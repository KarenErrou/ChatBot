The scenes featuring the horses were breathtaking...colts racing over green grass a filly and pony trotting together their sinewy legs moving together in smooth rhythm an elegant black stallion rearing up they were all absolutely beautiful. My favorite scene was the scene in which Beauty is being broken being taught to carry a rider. The wonderful line  But once I discovered that he and I that the two of us could become one this business turned out to be perfectly glorious!  the music swells and the horse takes off racing across the green and everything else turns to a blur.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is the poignant story of the horse named Black Beauty. You follow him through his life from the time that he was a young colt and the darned cutest thing you ever did see until his old age. The narrator of the story is Black Beauty himself. He will open your eyes to the treatment that animals receive at the hands of their masters  a problem that is not unique to writer Anna Sewells' time. Spoilers for the book and movie Some may complain that movies based on books always stray far from the original plot. In most cases this is extremely true. In the case of Black Beauty the greatest and most irritating change I found was the fact that the horses could not communicate with each other. They whinnied and neighed but they never spoke English. In Anna Sewells' book Beauty held conversations with nearly every horse he met. However I liked this change in the movie. It is fine to hear Beauty narrate but I found the movie much more convincing without the horses talking. An adult is most likely not going to jump at the chance to watch a movie with live horses communicating like that never mind watch long enough to get the message of the movie. I think that this was a change for the better even though it then cut out some of the characters and a few heartrending lines my favorite Captain's speech about war  it gets me every time. End SpoilersThis movie is never found wanting in any way. Be warned This is not an action movie. Those with short attention spans will probably not enjoy it. While Beauty goes through some terrifying moments remember that a horse is narrating. However it is my personal opinion that even when there is a decrease in action the movie absolutely wonderful  maybe even better than some action scenes. You may also need a box of tissues. Because I suppose I grew up watching it and practically had it memorized by age five I never cried but it is still a tearjerking movie. There are few people who don't get teary at moments.As a child I loved the film. When I was four years old I'd sit and watch it repeatedly. Even now the movie still enthralls me and is considered one of my favorites. It is a classic that I will treasure forever and pass down through generations. SpoilersThe casting could not have been better. Alan Cumming has the perfect voice for Beauty  mellow and worldweary. You can feel his excitement at those moments when Beauty is reliving his first run and his fear when the barn catches fire. You sympathize with his wariness and confusion when I believe Reuben Smith tries to ride him drunk. Alan Cumming put his heart and soul into Beauty. He was perfect for the role.Eleanor Bron is a fantastic Lady Wexmire. She is great at playing those cruel characters as seen in A Little Princess as well and she is very convincing. While I like her as an actress I absolutely despise her in the film which is the point of her character. She was like Cruella de Vil from another time.The rest of the cast was wonderful as well. Everyone was extremely gifted in the acting department and were great in their roles. This movie is highly recommended! It is a mustsee. Do not discard it as PETA propaganda or a child's story  it is so much more than that. It is a masterpiece in its own right.".

As we follow the horse's life we see both extreme cruelty and stupidity as well as great kindness from his human associates. The movie also touches on the book's theme of the importance of knowledge when through ignorance young Joe Green inadvertently inflicts pain and illness on Black Beauty. I was reminded of the memorable quotation from the book only ignorance! how can you talk about only ignorance?

	schema:reviewBody "Some Spoilers Heartfelt and touching movie based on the Anna Sewell story of a majestic prince of a horse who both reveled and suffered through a slew of owners good and badand in the end came back to the one person who saved his life twice. Once from a deadly case of chills and later from a raging barn fire and who reluctantly had to give him away Joe Greenboth Andrews Knott as a teenager and Ian Kelsey as a young man to live out the remainder of his life in a peaceful and loving home. Written by Miss. Sewell as a statement against animal cruelty back in 19th century England the story about Black Beauty has become since it was published in 1877 a year before Anna Sewell death one of the most beloved and read children as well as adult stories about horses ever penned.Folded at Farmer Gray's Sean Bean farm out of the mare Duchess the young colt grew up to be a striking black horse with a white heartshaped star on his forehead. The horse could run with the grace of an champion Olympic track and field runner and with such blinding speed that it seemed as if he had wings attached to his hoofs. Given away to Squire Gordon Peter Davidson and his wife Rosalind Ayers the horse named by Mrs. Gordon Black Beauty had the happiest times of his life with both John Manly Jim Carter and young Joe Green taking care of and looking after him. It was later when Mistress Gordon's health was failing that she and her husband Squire Gordon had to move out of England to a much warmer climate on the European continent that life started turning bleak for the black stallion. This decision to move lead to the Gordon's dispersement of their farm and all it's horses which included Black Beauty. Sold to the snobbish and unfeeling Lady Wexmire Eleanor Bron who among other things had the horse as well as the reddish or chestnut mare and white pony Ginger and Merrylegs who were also sold to her along with Black Beauty. Forced to wear a torturous bearing rein to make him look royal  regal almost drove the proud and handsome equine insane with pain.With his knees damaged from the constant riding and jumping for the sporting events Lady Wexmire's entered him into Black Beauty along with Ginger were auctioned off as horses to work for for Hansen Cabs or taxis in London. It wasn't easy for Black Beauty to adjust to the hard cobble stone and big city streets after roaming and running on the grass and rolling hills of rural England all his life It's with the love and guidance of his new owner London Cabbie Jerry Barker David Thewlis that Beauty did his best and provided Jerry and his family a decent income to live on.

	onyx:emotionText "Some Spoilers Heartfelt and touching movie based on the Anna Sewell story of a majestic prince of a horse who both reveled and suffered through a slew of owners good and badand in the end came back to the one person who saved his life twice. Once from a deadly case of chills and later from a raging barn fire and who reluctantly had to give him away Joe Greenboth Andrews Knott as a teenager and Ian Kelsey as a young man to live out the remainder of his life in a peaceful and loving home. Written by Miss. Sewell as a statement against animal cruelty back in 19th century England the story about Black Beauty has become since it was published in 1877 a year before Anna Sewell death one of the most beloved and read children as well as adult stories about horses ever penned.Folded at Farmer Gray's Sean Bean farm out of the mare Duchess the young colt grew up to be a striking black horse with a white heartshaped star on his forehead. The horse could run with the grace of an champion Olympic track and field runner and with such blinding speed that it seemed as if he had wings attached to his hoofs. Given away to Squire Gordon Peter Davidson and his wife Rosalind Ayers the horse named by Mrs. Gordon Black Beauty had the happiest times of his life with both John Manly Jim Carter and young Joe Green taking care of and looking after him. It was later when Mistress Gordon's health was failing that she and her husband Squire Gordon had to move out of England to a much warmer climate on the European continent that life started turning bleak for the black stallion. This decision to move lead to the Gordon's dispersement of their farm and all it's horses which included Black Beauty. Sold to the snobbish and unfeeling Lady Wexmire Eleanor Bron who among other things had the horse as well as the reddish or chestnut mare and white pony Ginger and Merrylegs who were also sold to her along with Black Beauty. Forced to wear a torturous bearing rein to make him look royal  regal almost drove the proud and handsome equine insane with pain.With his knees damaged from the constant riding and jumping for the sporting events Lady Wexmire's entered him into Black Beauty along with Ginger were auctioned off as horses to work for for Hansen Cabs or taxis in London. It wasn't easy for Black Beauty to adjust to the hard cobble stone and big city streets after roaming and running on the grass and rolling hills of rural England all his life It's with the love and guidance of his new owner London Cabbie Jerry Barker David Thewlis that Beauty did his best and provided Jerry and his family a decent income to live on. Poor Ginger who already had a weak and damaged heart wasn't that lucky dying from the stress of pulling a cab though the London streets. It wasn't long before Jerry himself came down with pneumonia that caused him to give up riding his horsedrawn Hansen Cab and sadly his faithful friend Black Beauty as the big bay horse was once again auctioned off this time to a grain dealer outside of London.Working as a packhorse pulling wagonloads of grain from one town to another it took less the a year for Beauty to completely break down and no longer be useful to his new owner or anyone else and was just about ready to end up as either glue or pet food.

I believe it took a woman director who obviously has a love of horses to make Anna Sewell's novel come to life. I love the way it is told from the horses point of view. It starts out when you see Beauty very happily sitting under a tree at home. He tells the story of his life and makes the point that animals are totally at the mercy of humans kind or cruel. Ironically the kindest owners he is fortunate to have lived with are the ones who have the smallest means he felt more loved and appreciated than by the wealthier ones. Which gives hope to those of us who are not rich and aspire to have horses in the family one day. Anyway this is a great one for the whole family and especially for horse lovers which is probably most of us whether admittedly or not.".

Elsewhere it's as downbeat and depressing as many a Catherine Cookson adaptation although the presence of numerous familiar faces like Sean Bean David Thewlis Peter Cook Peter Davison Jim Carter Alun Armstrong and John McEnery keep it more than watchable.The film is well shot and the acting honours obviously go to the various horses who do commendable jobs. My only problem really is the Hollywoodised decision to give the horse a twee and childish voiceover from actor Alan Cumming.

Black Beauty goes far beyond a simple horse story it is a tale of hope kindness loss betrayal sorrow and trust. The soundtrack brings out the emotional parts even more creating a story that will move you deeply.There were two scenes that never fails to bring tears to my eyes no matter how many times I watch it. I do not want to give too much away in case somebody has not seen it yet but the first of those scenes involves a bridge in a storm and the other is the ending. I am in no way unemotional when I watch heartwarming movies but it is a rare thing when they literally make me start crying. Those two scenes were beautifully done and I would give the movie ten stars for them alone.However the film was not without its flaws. Again don't want to spoil too much but there were several parts of the book that were not included in the movie when I wish they were or changed when I would prefer that they were not and some scenes feel a little rushed. That was why I bumped off one star. But it is certainly not a reason to push the movie aside. Even with those issues it is still a great movie and highly underrated in my opinion. I strongly recommend that you watch it and see what you think.".

Over Helen's objections and warnings by the High Lama he sets out with Friend on an expedition to find the elusive Yeti accompanied by another American named Shelley and a young Scotsman McNee who claims to have seen the thing. Footprints are found in the snows and McNee seems queerly affected the closer they get to their quarry's likely habitat but the biggest shock to Rollason is discovering Friend is a showman who only intends to exploit their find with Shelley his game huntermarksman. The conflict between science and commercialism only increases when an enormous anthropoid is shot and the horror only increases as the party realizes the other Yeti intend to retrieve their fallen comrade and have powers to do so which seem extrahuman.";

The beginning may seem a bit slow to younger viewers but it is crucial to the plot and Peter Cushing as always turns in a tremendous performance. The monastery setting seems authentic as do the climbing shots that follow even though most of the film was shot in Hammer's UK studios and the mountains are actually the Pyrenees in France.It doesn't take long for director Val Guest to build tension first dramatically with the ulterior motive revelation and the conflict is causes between John and his wife then during the Friend expedition's climb and most importantly when our crew nears the Yeti. Because the creature effects especially in the 1950s can't rival the viewer's imagination Guest wisely keeps the creatures offscreen for the bulk of the film and when we see more it's in heavy shadows. This makes the Yeti material extremely effective.The message at the end is sincere and poignant as it also would have been at the time of the film's release when anthropological exploration of seemingly alien cultures was still regular captivating news.Overall a 9 out of 10 for me and very close to being a 10.".

It lives up to the reputation of Hammer during this period and of course that of Peter Cushing as the premier actor of the studio. Even Forrest Tucker's typical heavyhanded hamminess cannot take away from this absorbing tale of scientific endeavor clashing with crass commercialism with a creature of an intellect that bests the men chasing it.

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw The Abominable Snowman today and was pleasantly surprised by the film. When I read the preview for it on the TV it was under the Horror category and knowing it was made in 1957 I wasn't sure I wanted to see it in fear that it would be too outdated to be enjoyable. But what the movie did was at a relatively quick pace told a story of 5 men who travel into the Himmalayin mountains in search of a Yeti. As our travelers progress we find out that not everyone has the same intentions for this creature. One thing I liked about this movie is how they don't show the creature fully allowing people to enjoy the movie years later without ever having to worry about why the Yeti looks so stupid and fake. Possible Spoilers In my opinion one of the best things about the movie was how the entire plot set up the Yeti to be a fierce and maneating creature. But the doctor realizes that the creature may not be this terrible monster but instead a species that is saddened and hidden away in the cold mountains away from humans. The final encounter with the creature proves this when we see that their face doesn't resemble a monster but much more humanlike. Overall I give this movie a 7.510 and I recommend it because it makes you think at the end something most horror movies truly don't.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hammer studios made a variety of films for many years before they struck gold with horror movies. One of their first steps in that direction was 'The Quatermass Xperiment' directed by Val Guest and written by Nigel Kneale who adapted his own highly successful TV production. A couple of years later Guest and Kneale did the same again with 'Quatermass 2'. Both were science fiction with some horror and both were very very good. Guest and Kneale had an uneasy relationship relationship is probably not even the right word Guest said he only ever met Kneale a few times but they collaborated once again on 'The Abominable Snowman'. Despite the title it isn't a monster movie it's more of an adventure tale with some mysticism and philosophical touches. It was successful commercially but coming out just before the onetwo punch of 'Curse Of Frankenstein' and 'Dracula' the two movies that really put Hammer on the map has meant it has all but been forgotten today. When people list the best of Hammer you rarely if ever see 'The Abominable Snowman' mentioned which is a shame. It's consistently interesting well acted stylish and suspenseful. Sadly I haven't seen Kneale's original TV version 'The Creature' so I can't compare the two but I really enjoyed this movie especially the performance from Peter Cushing soon to become a Hammer legend. Forrest Tucker is best known to people of my generation for his comic role in the popular 1960s sitcom 'F Troop'. Pairing him with Cushing might seem an odd choice at first but it really works. Their contrasting styles play off each other and Tucker is perfect for the role of the ambitious Tom Friend. There's also a good supporting performance from Robert Brown who later appeared as a caveman in Hammer's 'One Million Years BC'. Later still in the 1980s he played M in several Bond movies. The more Hammer movies I watch the more I am impressed by this legendary studio. Hammer House Of Horror yes but also so much more. 'The Abominable Snowman' is a great example of their originality and versatility.".

The story makes you think and sympathize while the locations and photography stuns you. There's a terrific interaction between the two protagonists  Forrest Tucker and Hammer regular Peter Cushing  which automatically forces you to pick sides. The final sequences are a bit of a blotch I reckonbut by then you're already impressed more then enough by this film. Val Guest was a terrific choice to direct his previous efforts for the Hammer studios The Quartermass Experiments both were suspenseful movies as well. Nigel Kneale rewrote the story that was turned in a TVmovie already two years earlier and he succeeds in upholding the unique premise. Cushing is at the peak of his respectable career at this point.

	schema:reviewBody "In the fifties Hammer produced a few highly noted films that were scripted by Nigel Kneale and directed by Val Guest.  Among them were QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT and the highly disturbing QUATERMASS II a.k.a. ENEMY FROM SPACE.  Though produced on low budgets these productions were of a higher quality than most of the usual ScienceFiction releases at the time.Kneale's literate screenplays were directed towards a more sophisticated audience and Guest's direction displayed much creative imagination proving that innovation can often override a limited budget.The story begins as botanist Peter Cushing teams up with crass hustler Forrest Tucker for the purpose of finding the ever elusive Yeti despite protests and warnings from Cushing's wife Maureen Connell and the llama. As the research team progresses on its expedition they begin to find subtle clues that the yeti may truly exist.  While they sleep they are awaken by the sounds of strange wailing in the night. Upon investigating they find large footprints of something not apparently human.Cushing an honorable man of decent principles is outraged when he learns that Tucker's real aim is to capture and cheaply exploit the yeti for monetary and personal status gain.  During the night a claw reaches into the tent sending their superstitious guide out into the night in a fit of total panic. The other members with the exception of Cushing who tries to maintain his sense of reason become more and more unhinged as they fear that the creatures are now stalking them.  Member Macnee who claims he once caught a glimpse of one on a previous expedition believes that they are trying to psychically attack him and he falls to death.  Cushing asserts that Macnee was mentally unstable and fell victim to his own frightened carelessness while Tucker cynically feels that they deliberately drove him to his death.Tucker proposes a reckless trick to entrap one of the creatures in a cave with a steel net as his trapper buddy stands by with a gun just in case. As Cushing and Tucker wait in a nearby tent a raging blizzard breaks out. Cushing deduces that the Yeti may actually be intelligent beings perhaps the missing link between man and ape and are a lost chapter in our history of evolution.  He feels its possible that they may actually be biding their time waiting for mankind to die out so that they can then take over. Tucker only has moneymoneymoney on his sleazy mind and thinks the scientist has flippedout from cabin fever and is off on an intellectual tangent.  Besides being the hollow man he finally reveals himself to be Tucker couldn't care less.The pair hear the hunter's scream and a roar from the cave.  They find his dead body with an expression of sheer horror on his face and see that the steel net has been ripped to shreds.  As the remaining two members decide to holdup in the cave til morning Cushing then hears the radio announcer saying that they are strongly advised to leave their gear and get out of the area immediately.  There is only one problem  The radio was busted earlier and is not working and Tucker says that he didn't hear any such announcement.I won't say anymore.  In many ways Kneale's intriguing story based on his acclaimed BBC serial THE CREATURE bears allegorical similarities to Huston's TREASURE OF THE SERRA MADRA in that the characters are actually pursuing a myth and are inevitably destroyed by their own greed and paranoia.  Like TWILIGHT ZONE and OUTER LIMITS the sciencefiction premise takes on supernatural overtones and serves as a cautionary morality play. Though some may think that that old there are some things that man should not meddle with message is a preachy cliche it does have validity when the man's sense of perception judgement personal ethics and real motives are highly in question.  Director Guest creates an absorbing atmosphere of mounting terror from beginning to end as the characters' and the viewers' smugness and complacency is gradually devoured then the unknown takes over and total helplessness and fear become the terrifying and tragic results.  What at first seemed farfetched now becomes all too real.  This skillful technique was effectively employed in the Quatermass films as well as Tourneur's memorable scare classic NIGHT OF THE DEMON.  The B  W photography evokes the proper dark eerie mood which leaves you with that unsettling feeling that something truly is out there and it's inevitably closing in on you.  Though many critics and viewers felt that the highly overpraised BLAIR WITCH was original with its idea of the unseen menace that preys upon your doubt and paranoia it's now obvious that it was nothing more than a  slipshod rehash of these notable films that were produced decades earlier.As long as you're not expecting some stupid slasher monster movie sophomoric puns and another overblown demo roll of specialeffects then give this unique intelligent film your serious consideration.  It may leave you haunted and disturbed.".

During the night a claw reaches into the tent sending their superstitious guide out into the night in a fit of total panic. The other members with the exception of Cushing who tries to maintain his sense of reason become more and more unhinged as they fear that the creatures are now stalking them.  Member Macnee who claims he once caught a glimpse of one on a previous expedition believes that they are trying to psychically attack him and he falls to death.  Cushing asserts that Macnee was mentally unstable and fell victim to his own frightened carelessness while Tucker cynically feels that they deliberately drove him to his death.Tucker proposes a reckless trick to entrap one of the creatures in a cave with a steel net as his trapper buddy stands by with a gun just in case. As Cushing and Tucker wait in a nearby tent a raging blizzard breaks out. Cushing deduces that the Yeti may actually be intelligent beings perhaps the missing link between man and ape and are a lost chapter in our history of evolution.  He feels its possible that they may actually be biding their time waiting for mankind to die out so that they can then take over. Tucker only has moneymoneymoney on his sleazy mind and thinks the scientist has flippedout from cabin fever and is off on an intellectual tangent.  Besides being the hollow man he finally reveals himself to be Tucker couldn't care less.The pair hear the hunter's scream and a roar from the cave.  They find his dead body with an expression of sheer horror on his face and see that the steel net has been ripped to shreds.  As the remaining two members decide to holdup in the cave til morning Cushing then hears the radio announcer saying that they are strongly advised to leave their gear and get out of the area immediately.  There is only one problem  The radio was busted earlier and is not working and Tucker says that he didn't hear any such announcement.I won't say anymore.  In many ways Kneale's intriguing story based on his acclaimed BBC serial THE CREATURE bears allegorical similarities to Huston's TREASURE OF THE SERRA MADRA in that the characters are actually pursuing a myth and are inevitably destroyed by their own greed and paranoia.  Like TWILIGHT ZONE and OUTER LIMITS the sciencefiction premise takes on supernatural overtones and serves as a cautionary morality play. Though some may think that that old there are some things that man should not meddle with message is a preachy cliche it does have validity when the man's sense of perception judgement personal ethics and real motives are highly in question.  Director Guest creates an absorbing atmosphere of mounting terror from beginning to end as the characters' and the viewers' smugness and complacency is gradually devoured then the unknown takes over and total helplessness and fear become the terrifying and tragic results.  What at first seemed farfetched now becomes all too real.  This skillful technique was effectively employed in the Quatermass films as well as Tourneur's memorable scare classic NIGHT OF THE DEMON.  The B  W photography evokes the proper dark eerie mood which leaves you with that unsettling feeling that something truly is out there and it's inevitably closing in on you.  Though many critics and viewers felt that the highly overpraised BLAIR WITCH was original with its idea of the unseen menace that preys upon your doubt and paranoia it's now obvious that it was nothing more than a  slipshod rehash of these notable films that were produced decades earlier.As long as you're not expecting some stupid slasher monster movie sophomoric puns and another overblown demo roll of specialeffects then give this unique intelligent film your serious consideration.  It may leave you haunted and disturbed.";

He is so intrigued that he joins a climbing expedition led by an unscrupulous American businessman played by Forrest Tucker in his preFTroop days.

Tucker is excellent here playing essentially a boorish American bad guy as opposed to some of the unconvincing good guys he played in later films. Tucker and Cushing play off each other very well and you can almost see Cushing's dander rising for having joined up with what he calls a fairground trickster.What works best here as opposed to American films is that the producers decided not to actually show the Abominable snowmen. You hear the growls of the Yeti even seen an arm but not until the end do you truly comprehend just what the Yeti might be. Even then much is left to the imagination.The story is wellpaced as members of the expedition slowly descend into a fit of fear and madness fighting one another while foolishly clinging to the same personality traits that caused it in the first place.By the end of the film the viewer is left wondering who is really the monster.".

I was amazed to see how youthful looking Peter Cushing looked in this movie compared to just a few years later.  Seemed to have come after The Curse of Frankenstein1957 and The Horror of Dracula1958.  The Abominable Snowman1957 looks at the notion of the yeti in an abstract manner.  The legendary yeti in the film is given an ambiguous quality that makes them into a fearful presence. Intellgent film that could only have been done by the British for filmmakers of Hollywoodmany of them would not make a film richly deep with implicit fright and intellegence.  When it comes to creating Science fiction flicks that are scary as well as intellegent the British filmmakers for the most part are bar none the best.  Parts of the story reminds me of Frank Capra's Lost Horizon1937 which also took place in the Himalayas mountains.  Both The Abominable Snowman1957 and Lost Horizon1937 deal with ideas of spiritality and humanity.  Peter Cushing as Dr. Rollason is a good counterpart to the money and fame hungry Dr. Friend played by Forrest Tucker.  Peter Cushing gives a gentle and thoughtful performance that is uncharacteristic of the many roles he had for Hammer studios.  Imaginating written by Quatermass creator Nigel Kneale who is a master of suggestive terror.  The Abominable Snowman1957 is one of the main influences besides Cannibal Holocaust1979 for Blair Witch Project1999.  Abominable Snowman1957 is a more effective film in suggesting terror than Blair Witch Project1999 for a couple of reasons.  First the former does show bits and pieces of the yeti which is more imaginative than not showing anything of the witch at all as the latter.  Second the fear and terror felt by the characters in The Abominable Snowman1957 feels geniune unlike in Blair Witch Project where emotions of fear and terror feel manipulated and forced. An excellent motion picture for a someone like Val Guest whose career is filled with ups and downs.  The Abominable Snowman1957 ends on a thought provoking note about the Yeti as well as other intellegent metaphysical issues.".

It's true that this isn't Hammer's finest work but it's a very nice early offering and shows some early ingeniousness of the studio. That's what I like best about Hammer Horror when you see one of their movies you know that you're going to be in for a fun and imaginative ride and this film certainly delivers on that front. The plot follows botanist Peter Cushing as he joins a group of arctic explorers that go off into the Himalayas in search of the mythical beast  the Yeti. The film then follows in adventure style their misadventure as they come face to face with the beast itself and get more than they bargained for...The snow setting gives the film a feeling of isolation that invokes a constant feeling of dread and we get the impression that if something bad does happen  there wont be anyone there to save our hero's. This mind game has been carried off in many films since this one Alien most notably but here is a good early example of that. The film is also different from most other horror films as it handles a subject and a monster that hasn't often been covered. This sets it apart in a good way as it's something different from the viewer and also goes some way to showing Hammer's inventiveness as most studios are happy to continue taking the safe option and making horror films that have been tried and tested. The fact that the Yeti doesn't appear for much of the film will no doubt annoy some viewers and it did me somewhat but it helps the film as it ensures that the audience will be intrigued to finally see the monster. The film is very well paced and doesn't get boring either which is a plus.As I said this isn't Hammer's best film. However it's definitely well worth tracking down for the Hammer fan and people in general that want to see a good monster movie.".

It would have been easy to allow the whole production to sink to the level of exploitation but it never does. The horror is subdued and really only surfaces in the final act. The movie is not without its creepy moments as the men fear for their lives in an alien landscape of ice and mountains. The remainder of the intelligent script focuses on the relationship between the scientist and the showman and asks the question Who is the real monster? The Abominable Snowman is an unusually subdued movie from The Studio that Dripped Blood. Released the same year as The Curse of Frankenstein and a year before Horror of Dracula The Abominable Snowman lacks the garish colors and the bright red blood that helped to make Hammer so famous. It may lack what I call the Hammer Color but it's one of the best looking Hammer films I've seen. It was filmed in beautiful black and white and the cinematography is stunning. The stagebound sets are some of the best I've seen. When combined these elements create the perfect frigid look and setting for The Abominable Snowman.Director Val Guest made the wise decision to keep the Yeti offscreen as much as possible with only a glimpse or two in the shadows. It would have been difficult given the budgetary constraints to create realistic looking Yeti that could have withstood too much onscreen scrutiny. Anymore screentime and the Yeti would have probably come off as cheesy as the title character in Hammer's The Gorgon.And I can't say enough about the acting. Everyone involved is excellent. You can always count on Peter Cushing to deliver the goods and he's at the top of his game in this film. It's a shame that his genius isn't more well known outside of horror circles. Forrest Tucker makes a great foil for Cushing. The two men make the perfect Odd Couple. The rest of the cast is equally believable and more than up to the challenge.".

	schema:reviewBody "Good flick! Very well done. There are a few slow spots here and there but I was happy to find that this movie avoids some of the terrible clichs found in the 50'60's 'monster' movies. Such as A The 'monster' pursuingcapturing the only female in the cast. B A machoswaggering male character whom the female lead falls in love with despite hating him at the beginning of the movie. C Killing the 'monster' with fire. D The wise old professor who attempts to reason with the 'monster' only to get killed by same. Cool scenes 1 When the team ventures outside of the hut after MacNee states that he'd heard a 'cry'. The cold dark silence..the mist floating above the snow as they shush each other and look into the darkness. 2 The yeti hand groping under the tent. 3 The sound of the yeti as it is shot by Ed. 4 The cries of the Yetis as the team examines the body. 5 Ed's behavior as he waits  alone  in the cave. His jumpy behavior as he waited and peered at the entrance gave me the creeps. 6 Ed's frantic screams as the Yeti enters the cave and the Yetis shadow as it wrestles with the cage. 7 Dr. Rollason's urgency to leave after he hears the broadcast on a radio that's been smashed to pieces. 8 The creepiest Tom Friend hears Ed's voice calling to him. The way the camera zoomslocks in on Forrest Tucker's face is perfect. Ed's cries for help were also very well done. One of the creepiest scenes I've ever seen in a movie. 9 When Dr. Rolasson realizes that he is not alone in the cave.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this exceptional Hammer film on the Sat. Nite 'Late Show' when I was 12 years old.  I wasn't fully prepared for it assuming that it would be your standard B monster movie.  It proved to be far more than that.  The script by Nigel Kneale based on his BBC teleplay The Creature which I believe that Peter Cushing also starred in was surprisingly very insightful and intelligent.  No dumb or pretentious dialogue to be found here and the entire cast gave great performances of some real substance  no shallow annoying stereotypes.It started at a slow pace but began to gradually build much tension and atmospheric suspense.  BUT it was that one certain scene that really hit me hard  where that claw reaches in at the bottom of the tent!!!  THAT WAS IT! The first time where I actually sprang up shut the set off and ran directly to bed and hid under the covers.  No other genre film ever got so frightened a reaction from me.  THIS WAS A FIRST!  Mind you no gore or grand effects. For a long time later I'd occasionally trip on that scene fearfully wondering what happened after that.  Obviously Blair Witch took a few creepy clues from this. The British had that weird approach to their 5O's ScienceFiction Horror Thrillers by creating a dark creepy mood of claustrophobic paranoia and mounting terror quite similar to Hitchcock's brilliant technique of building excruciating suspense and an overwhelming sense of pure dread.  LONG LIVE THE KING!Unfortunately we don't see too much subtlety in todays' formulaic approach to cinema  it's all dumped on our laps and is usually way too overcooked and halfbaked.I then finally got to see ASOTH about a year later without dashing under the covers during that haunting 'claw scene.'  I was shocked by how engrossing the story kept getting.  It was going for more than just the jugular. Kneale and director Val Guest devised quite a provocotive story about man and his fear of the unknown  and how in his arrogance and selfserving greed will misperceive and misinterpret what is actually real and what he thinks and desperately hopes to be real.  Reality is highly ambiguous and this film excellently conveys how fear greed and predjudice will always distort and twist what's actually true.  Much like the troubled uncertain world we live in and so much of the narrowminded bigotry that always seems to drop in uninvited.  When the plastic bubble of ignorant complacency is suddenly tampered with or burst all hell can then break loose where one's judgements values and sanity can now be in serious question.  It's safe to say we've all been in those confusing dire boats at times often when least expected so one can thus relate to the allegories presented in this fine film's intriguing story.Cushing and Tucker are superb and there's a strong dramatic chemistry between them  two opposing men with a similar goal but with opposite viewpoints on their strange and increasingly dangerous mission  to capture the ever elusive and mysterious Yeti.  Perhaps they're only chasing a myth just like the misfit characters' plight in Huston's Treasure of the Sierra Madrea where paranoia takes over and spoils the party  or perhaps it's more real than they initially envisioned and ignorantly 'hoped'.  The ambiguous ending has that unsettling 'twilight zone' irony and could also fit right in with Outer Limits in its disturbing philosophical tone  unlike the often pretentious and selfcongratulatory Star Trek intellectualisms.WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!  It was only on a more recent viewing that something odd occured to me.  DON'T READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET!!  When Cushing finally sees the dark shape of the aproaching Yeti we 'see' it from Cushing's perspective subjective shot from his P.O.V.. This seems to infer that he might be imagining it  or it might possibly be the real thing.  We seem to know but don't REALLY know.  Our own perceptions like the frightened characters are also now in question thus our strong identifications with the main characters.  Has anyone else ever picked up on that possible ambiguity?Also at the enigmatic conclusion when a stunned Cushing tells the deli llama that What I was searching for never really existed and the llama replies with an almost sinister compassion that There is no Yeti as the camera pans back to the desolute Himalayan Mountains while we now wonder and question what we have just experienced.  Some strokes of true genius here far from your typical low budget 5O's BW monster movie.  It smoothly takes on those allegorically profound Kurusawa touches that greatly distinguishes it from the rest of the B movie herd.  Haunting disturbing evocotive and unforgettable  the genuine 'thinking persons' ScienceFiction Horror Thriller.I have to also add that you should see it in it's wide screen format for it does make a vast no dumb pun intended difference.  There are also eight minutes of extra footage  all extremely pertinent.  No superfluous 'director's cut' crap.  You haven't fully seen this undiscovered classic if you've only seen the AMC prints unless they've been recently updated which I doubt.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED  especially for those who've grown tired of so many mindless overproduced Hollywood disappointers.".

	schema:headline " The Thinking Man's Horror Film";
	schema:reviewBody "'The Abominable Snowman' is a classic British horror film from the much celebrated Hammer Film Studio filmed at Bray and Pinewood Studios in 1957. It was notably the first Hammer film to feature legendary English actor Peter Cushing who would go on to star in a further 21 films for the production company. It was also the second and last Hammer film to feature American actor Forrest Tucker in the lead role to ensure Hammer films made it into the American marketand the last collaboration between Nigel Kneale as screenplay writer and Val Guest as director. This production is a film version of Nigel Kneale's original BBC play 'The Creature' remade by Hammer and even features some of the original cast members including Peter Cushing Wolfe Morris and the excellent Arnold Marle. The rest of the roles were recast including that of Tucker's the role having originally been played by Stanley Baker. The story concerns oddly enough the legend of the 'Abominable Snowman' or 'Yeti' if you prefer as they are referred to in the film. 'The Abominable Snowman' begins with Cushing as Dr. John Rollason and his assistant Peter Fox played by veteran actor Richard Wattis who notably wears a series of unflattering jumpers in this particular picture on a botanical expedition in the Himalayas as a guest of the Lama played by Arnold Marle. Soon enough Dr. John Rollason's wife arrives Helen played by Maureen Connell as well as a second expedition led by Tucker but also featuring Ed Shelley played by future M actor in the Bond films Robert Brown photographer Andrew McNee played by Michael Brill and the Sherpa guide Kusang played by Wolfe Morris. Their expedition is interested in one thing capturing a live Yeti and whilst Rollason and Tucker's character Tom Friend are instantly at loggerheads both have a mutual intrigue in the potential existence of Yeti much to the chagrin of Rollason's wife and the Lama whose people clearly believe and fear in the Yeti.For an early Hammer production 'The Abominable Snowman' has an impressive scale and effective location filming standing in for the Himalayan Mountains was filmed at La Mongie in the French Pyrenees. Whilst the Monastery set and the Lama's village were built and utilised at Hammer productions then home at Bray Studios in Bray Berkshire it was quickly realised that for the snowy landscapes of the Himalayas more studio space would be required so in an unusual move these were staged at Pinewood Studios at Iver Heath in Buckinghamshire. The film's score by classical composer but a frequent experimenter in the 'serialist' music form Humphrey Searle is very effective and is reminiscent of Max Steiner's score for 'King Kong' from 1933 and was reputedly based on Ralph Vaughan Williams score for the 1948 epic 'Scott of the Antarctic' starring Sir John Mills. Although Forrest Tucker has come under some criticism for his performance in this film even from director Val Guest I consider his interpretation of Tom Friend as an abrasive loud mouthed bully throwing his weight around and blowing hot and cold to Peter Cushing's character Dr. John Rollason to be very effective and as the film comes to a close and much of the action is based around these two characters Tucker and Cushing play off each other very well. Tucker doesn't give a subtle performance but to me that is kind of the point. Fortunately for Tucker writer Nigel Kneale was impressed with his take on the role. Peter Cushing as ever is wonderful as Rollason playing him as a kindly cautious and articulate man the polar opposite of the trigger happy bluster of Tom Friend. All the supporting cast are good with note going to the mystical performance given by German actor Arnold Marle as the Lama and Richard Wattis's humorous performance as Rollason's assistant Peter Fox. The only thing that really dates the film and lets it down slightly is the representation of women particularly in regards to Rollason's wife Helen. We learn during the film that she is very cautionary a bit of a moaner and is great at making hot food and drinks. Oh dear! This aside it's a great story and the realisation of the Yeti who are barely seen until the penultimate sequence are quite impressive. They have an intimidating look but the use of human eyes behind their unusual beak like masks give them both an endearing and wise look. The actions of man are not to be celebrated here and Kneale presents the Yeti as mystical intelligent and almost spiritual beings. The films ends on an uncertain note as we ponder as viewers whether Rollason in the icy conditions of the Himalayas hallucinated his encounters with the Yeti or whether they have purposely erased his mind of the events....or another consideration the final line There is no such thing referring to the Yeti could be Rollason's understanding that man must never try to interfere with the great creatures ever again hence the denial that he has come into contact with them. Val Guest's direction is superb throughout with effective use of handheld camera shots and overlapping dialogue in an almost documentary style a technique used in Howard Hawks's earlier films.'The Abominable Snowman' in my view is an overlooked gem ignored during its release largely because of the hubbub surrounding the premiere of Hammer's first colour Horror film 'The Curse of Frankenstein' coincidentally also starring Peter Cushing and no doubt also because of the critical failure of both the original television adaptation. The subtle and esoteric nature of the story hardly helped matters. Put simply it lacked the same gory mass appeal as the aforementioned Frankenstein film. 'The Abominable Snowman' is to be savoured and remembered as a production from a time when British filmmaking was arguably at its peak and Hammer's contribution to that period is unrivalled.".

He joins a team led by Tom Friend an ambitious adventurer who wants to trap the elusive creature known as the Yeti. Will they return from this perilous expedition ?This minor blackandwhite creature feature made by the same team responsible for the two excellent Quatermass films of the fifties director Guest writer Nigel Kneale and production company Hammer is an agreeable and intelligent if undistinguished genre flick. The obvious approach would be to do a simple monster movie with the standard tenlittleIndians setup instead Kneale's intelligent script approaches both the locating of the creature and its evolutionary position with sympathetic and scientific detachment. The movie is more a critique of the commercial exploitation of such a phenomenon and the lengths Friend will go to in pursuing it. Cushing and Tucker exploit these ideas very well in their performances and the support cast is good including a nice turn by a young Brown better known as spy boss M in four eighties James Bond movies as the trapper. While the film has its budgetary limitations it's still good to look at mixing second unit work shot in the French Pyrenees with some cool looking sets and it manages to evoke the mystique and sense of mourning the script is aiming for. A thoughtful little flick and one of a trio of agreeable horror movies American star Tucker made in Britain at the time the other two being the oddball The Strange World Of Planet X and the nottobemissed cult favourite The Trollenberg Terror aka The Crawling Eye.".

Filmed on a tight budget the picture is wellwritten deliberately paced and has relatively little action. The tone is pleasingly British in being civilized and polite aside from obnoxious American Forrest Tucker and there is about this film the hint that with more time and money a larger better movie might have resulted. Here and there one gets a Michael Powell feeling in the exotic lamasery setting and the outrageous plot while at other times in some excellent dialog there are suggestions of a more intelligent film a sort of thinking man's Lost Horizon that might have been done had to producers not been so compelled to stick to the bottom line of fantasy and adventure as opposed to the psychology and philosophy that periodically emerge as the story unfolds. All these matters aside the movie stands up quite well on its own terms managing to be both intelligent and eerie not an easy thing to do. Rather than appearing to 'fight' their modest budget the studio wisely emphasized the film's necessary minimalism right down to the haunting spare musical score and the result is a gem of a picture that pulls the viewer agreeably along to its satisfactory conclusion.".

So when I tell you that this film has the single funniest scene I have ever seen in a movie you might want to listen to me. There's a lot of diversity of opinion as to what makes this INCREDIBLY stupid movie as funny as it is. And to those who just didn't get well I can't blame them too much. The scene I speak of comes at about the 30 minute mark and involves a dead convict shackled to John Candy. Up until that point I had found the film dumb confusing and it was beginning to lose me. When this scene came up I laughed so hard I peed my pants. No movie has ever done that to me before. When the project began Going Berserk was supposed to be the SCTV movie. I remember it being announced. As time went on the cast was whittled down To John Candy Joe Flaherty  Eugene Levy. There also must have been a regime change at Universal while it was being shot because upon being released it was shown in nearly ZERO theaters. When watching this a second time I listened to the theme song which actually flaunts how incomprehensible the plot is in the lyrics relaxed my logic nerve and figured out what was going on. Aside from the aforementioned routine Going Berserk has many other hilarious scenes to recommend it. This is almost a 3 Stooges flick except it's much funnier. Director David Steinberg has razor sharp timing and he must have been laughing all through this. As for Candy who's basically in charge here he has NEVER been funnier. With all the plot devices and explanatory scenes thrown out the window he absolutely runs wild. Flaherty and Levy follow him effortlessly. There is a plot but it's a plot like Animal House had a plot and yeah the script is uneven and a little slow to start. Once you know this however you can well appreciate the full SCTV style craziness that transpires. It IS stupid but it's stupid on purpose and you need to remember that when you see it. DO see it and discover for yourself if it has the funniest scene of all time in it.".

The best moments for me are the KUNG FU U scenes as well as the great moment when Johnin a trance goes up on stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriendthat is how much he and his genitals love his girlfriend. I'm sure reading this you might think this sequence sounds really crude. It is but it is also very funny mainly because it is John Candy doing this bit. The story in general is pretty lame and Eugene Levy and Joe Flahertyboth SCTV alumni with Candy are not given enough to do in the film. Levy has his moments especially filming the wedding at the endthink Rod Serling and the great scene when he is talking to his mother on the phone. Overall a good movie if you have had a tough day and need to put your brain on stupid. I give this one 4 out of 10.".

But when given the opportunity he could really be razorsharp and quite subtle.  It's too bad he was cast in so many roles that only showed his broad side because we'll never get to see more of the other. Oh yeah the movie.  One can watch Going Berserk over and over I know I have with the frequency of Caddyshack.  It's just that good.  The plot although a little convoluted is actually fairly deep for a farce of this kind.

It is a visual treat when Ajay and Amrish Puri face off each other with intensive dialogues emoting mostly with eyes without going overboard or mindless shouting!!

The film was Aneez Bazmee's debut who then made Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha with the same pair and got successful. Hulchul also starred Vinod Khanna Ronit Roy. The film follows the same formula which worked in the 90s We have a squeaky Kajol who along with Kader Khan her uncle in the film rob people. Ronit Roy is a spoilt brat who is later convicted for a murder Ajay plans to save his step brother at any cost Oh Yes We have another formula of Ajay Devgan being a kid left on the temple streetsGairKachche Daage. The film does feature some good scenes between AjayVinod VinodAmrish but overall it's nothing different.There are some weird scenes too which was garbed in the name of entertainment in 90s. In the preclimax we have Ajay Devgan trying to save his mother and then all of a sudden he reaches the venue where Vinod Khanna Ronit are going to be hanged with a bandage on his head. Direction is decent but the writing could be better Music by Anu Malik boasts of some hit numbers like I Am Sixteen Saavan Ka Mahina.Ajay Devgan did such roles too many times in 90s he does well In 90s he always had a mushroom style hair his chewing of bittles type dialogue delivery and has come a long way yet he is good Ronit Roy who now has done a comeback with UDAAN plays second fiddle to Ajay he isn't as impressive as nowdays though. Vinod Khanna is his usual tired self Navni Prahar is as usual Amrish Puri is his usual self his English sayings however do get boring. Kajol and Kader Khan do provide some comic moments but though one wishes Kajol didn't squeak that much but those were 90s. It's sad that Kajol is wasted in such a film. Amongst rest Mohan Joshi and rest play their usual patented selfs. Arif Khan who resembles Gulshan Grover played similar roles in films like Phool Aur Kaante Mohra.etc Hulchul was a flop at the B.O released on the same day with DDLJ".

Zuckerman plays Ian a young virgin with no luck with the ladies a crush on his childhood friend Felicia Crew a jerk of an older brother Marsden and is best friends with an Austin Powersesquire Casanova by the name of Lance Duke. On the internet he poses as a football player while courting a mysterious girl online. When the girl invites him to go all the way he steals his brother's GTO and heads to Knoxville with Felicia and Lance. Ian's character has the usual nerdy teen virgininamovie problems falls for the wrong girls takes few risks gets caught in embarrassing sexual situations. On the road trip they run into a series of hilarious awkward and weird situations. And on the way they discover that sex isn't the most important thing and that true love can be found in both odd and familiar places.It's not exactly stunningly original but it's still a hilarious film. The three leads do a pretty good job Lance being a particularly funny character. Marsden and Green steal the show in all the scenes they're in and all of the characters in the film are interesting even if most of them are stock characters. The script is also wellconnected with most of the characters being connected to the larger plot and combines wit ribaldry and straight adult humor well. Every gag sequence gets big laughs and the comedy never slows down or dies out. The internet cutaways are especially hilarious supplements.It's refreshing to see a genuinely adult comedy not coming from the Apatow crew or McKay and Ferrell. Although it lacks star leads and filmmakers and will probably drop under the radar I definitely recommend Sex Drive to anyone looking for a big laughs.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are several people who say that critics don't know anything... I find it funny in Hollywood how the best movies get rated terribly and have a 28 rating on rottentomatoes 'tomatometer'...I saw the preview for Sex Drive on myspace. The preview started off as a typical driveacrossthecountry crazythingshappen teen sex party movie. About halfway into the trailer I found myself laughing... and thinking wow... something about this movie feels different. I think it's going to be really good. I don't want to wait til October I want to watch it right now.THREE WEEKS later three of my friends and I decided to see a last minute movie I looked up Sex Drive only to find that it was only playing in one theater in our entire city Denver with only one showtime! 1030 was the only showtime if this was any indication of how the movie was I figured that it was going to be terrible but I remembered how much I enjoyed the preview and coerced my friends to go see it. When we arrived the theater had only two other people in it both middleaged males sitting separately by themselves. Again not a good sign...The movie started out and was instantly funny. We laughed so did the others. I thought ok any movie can make people laugh... it's not that hard a thing to do... let's see where this goes. The movie continued on and I found myself loving the plot. Loving the script. Loving the noname actors. Loving the directing. Loving the editing. Loving everything about it. But that's just me... everyone has different opinions. My three friends who might I mind you have very different senses of humor all felt the exact same way. We were crying at certain parts because we were laughing so hard. The other two people in the theater were laughing hysterically as well. Just when I thought it couldn't get any better the movie turns to a love story and everything throughout the whole movie comes together.It finally ended and I and my three friends sat there in awe about what we just saw. We left the theater and could not have been any happier about our movie choice.I returned home to instantly look up reviews online about what others thought of this movie and it blew my mind. The most terrible awful things were said and the movie's gross domestic total? 8402485. A BOMB.I don't understand what it is people are looking for in a comedy. I will agree with others and say yes this has been done before. Yes this movie is exactly what I thought it would be and what I wrote above a typical driveacrossthecountry crazythingshappen teen sex party movie. Yes this movie is predictable and familiar but back to the question what is it people are looking for in a comedy? This movie had every element of the 100000000movie American Pie series. Sex Drive should of made AT LEAST half that much.I saw College recently NOW THIS is a movie that deserved it's abysmal earnings of 4.5 million dollars. College's jokes were cheap and seemingly desperate as if almost begging for a laugh. And once again yes College made me slightly laugh as I said before any comedy can but what it did not do was leave me with a feeling of sheer joy and happiness that I took the time out of my night and life to watch it. Sex Drive left me with this feeling.I believed Sex Drive to be perfect. In every aspect. I will address that again everyone's taste is different everyone's brains interpret things differently and because of this not everyone will find Sex Drive to be perfect in fact some may not find it funny it all but I believe THE MAJORITY of people 9 out of 10 will realize upon DVD release and wordofmouth that Sex Drive was the sleeper hit of 2008.See this movie. It deserves much more money than it made and is well well worth your time.".

College's jokes were cheap and seemingly desperate as if almost begging for a laugh. And once again yes College made me slightly laugh as I said before any comedy can but what it did not do was leave me with a feeling of sheer joy and happiness that I took the time out of my night and life to watch it. Sex Drive left me with this feeling.I believed Sex Drive to be perfect. In every aspect. I will address that again everyone's taste is different everyone's brains interpret things differently and because of this not everyone will find Sex Drive to be perfect in fact some may not find it funny it all but I believe THE MAJORITY of people 9 out of 10 will realize upon DVD release and wordofmouth that Sex Drive was the sleeper hit of 2008.See this movie. It deserves much more money than it made and is well well worth your time.";

	schema:reviewBody "So there was a screening of Sex Drive at the theatre so I thought what the hell?From the preview I thought it could have gone one of three ways 1. A horrible attempt at an Rrated comedy in the same fashion of a pretty good comedy a decade ago. Like College tried for American Pie and failed 2. A mediocre Rrated comedy with bits here and there. 3. A movie that knows what it's going for and hits its mark. I would have to say this movie is very close to 3. The movie isn't a great movie but it has no delusions on what it is. With the plot of a guy driving cross state just to get some ass there's not a lot of directions you can go with it. The makers know this so they make the best of it. No real need to stress much on the story. It's simple basic predictable. Bad? I wouldn't say that. The story is really more of a momentum pusher than anything. It's really only there to prevent this from being a series of jokes and gags just jumbled together. There's no real big twist a few lessons to be taken form it but they all have been done before. You can pretty much tell what's going to happen at the end within the first 15 minutes. But the story isn't really the important thing here so no real points taken off for that.All the actors are good. Clichd yes but they are likable. The goofy virgin lead guy who's trying to get some tail is played wonderfully by Josh Zuckerman. Pulls it off flawlessly with all the awkwardness and uncertainty that the character would have. Amanda Crew is also really good at the BFF of Josh's character. The two have pretty good chemistry even with all their awkwardly close moments. It isn't perfect but being in some of those awkward situations they were while pushed a bit familiar.A surprise is James Marsden. You may remember him as Cyclops from XMen and he pulls off a great punkass older brother with a sense of humor of his own. He is the typical ass hole older brother in these kind of movies but he pulls it over very well. Seth Green just seems like he's cruising through the movie. I think he's got a lot of talent and I knew even if the movie was going to be bad he would provide a good set of laughs. And as a sarcastic Amish engineer genius he's just fits in this movie seamlessly. But I have to give a lot of credit to Clark Duke. His first real movie. He was a party extra in Superbad if I'm not mistaken the one who called McLovin' a bad ass. Like Seth Green he just seems to glide through. He also has great chemistry with Josh Zuckerman. You can tell the two of them just had a really good time together on this. He is the suave ladies man who's guiding his pathetic best friend on his verge of losing his virginity while getting some action himself. He doesn't have the look of the typical character but he pulls it off excellently. I put a lot of emphasis on the characters and actors. They were the backbone of the movie. Not the story but the characters. There's also a hand full of supporting characters that do a good job at their parts and an unwelcome well for me it was unwelcome appearance by Fall Out Boy. There are few things worse than a comedy that's not funny. There have been a serious excess of those as well. Dane Cook just had a movie a few weeks ago and that was a haggard piece of crap. I actually have to say though I laughed quite a bit in this movie. With the plot there are going to be quite a few of the sex jokes involving spooge penises and homosexuality. Most of them though actually delivered. I can't actually say there were too many flat moments with the jokes. Yes there were some but the jokes that worked outweighed those that didn't. The climax got really overthetop but it did continue on with the laughs and was satisfying. The closure did take a bit longer than necessary but didn't drag. The movie was actually well paced and I was never bored. This is no Superbad. It's not anywhere in that league. I walked out of this movie saying This is 2000's Road Trip. No Road Trip wasn't a masterpiece or one of those comedy powerhouses but it was really good for what it was going for. An overthetop Rrated comedy. See it with a group of friends in the theatre. Definitely see it with a crowd it will probably make it that much more enjoyable. 3.755Also if you saw the trailer and had no interest then you probably would want to skip it. It has it's intended audience and will probably please those people and few others.".

When Ian meets a girl called Tasty Katrina Bowden in Internet he writes many lies about himself when she invites him to drive to Knoxville Tennessee to have sex with her Ian steals Rex's GTO Judge 1969 and travels with Lance and Felicia. When they have trouble on the road with the car the Amish Ezekiel Seth Green offers to help them in his community. Lance meets the Amish Mary Alice Greczyn and they fall in love for each other. During their travel Ian and Felicia discover that their feelings are more than friendship and that Tasty is not who she told she is.I am still laughing with Sex Drive since this movie is one of the funniest comedies that I have recently seen. There are many gross jokes beautiful tits and girls and enjoyable characters. The cynical Seth Green is simply hilarious in the role of a sympathetic Amish. The scene when Ian is on the stage watching the dancers backstage while a pregnant girl is telling her sad story is so funny that I needed to stop the movie just to laugh. The last scene with Amanda Crew in the end of the credits is also very funny and I believe many people probably lost this joke. If you are intellectual or if you do not like this type of movie please do not spend your time to write bad reviews in IMDb. I can not understand how a viewer can be surprised with the content of a comedy that begins the way Sex Drive does. Amanda Crew Katrina Bowden Alice Greczyn and all the female cast are incredibly gorgeous. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Sex Drive".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay so Sex Drive It's rude it's certainly crude but is it actually in any way good? That's the question that faces many teenage comedies of similar nature these days so very often over the past decade the answer unfortunately has been a resounding and overwhelming 'no' but there always remains a select few reminders that even the dumbest of comedies can still thrive upon just that. Sex Drive is thankfully one of these films. It's outrageous and ridiculous in its portrayal of teenage romance filled with characters that speak more broadly as caricature than real definable human beings but it all works for the most part in the favour of its silly edgy routine. Sure enough it's a film that is far more likely to put a smile on the younger faces of the audience but that assessment goes without saying in short there's some good fun to be had here but only if you don't mind the grossout variants of humour and can appreciate the comedy on its own merits. Expect anything more than that and you'll be disappointed.For all intents and purposes Sex Drive rarely ever strays far from the road of teenage romcoms. Taking place for the most part on the open road where many comedians make brief cameo appearances as wacky characters that bump into the main cast the narrative that binds Sex Drive's gags together is something that has been done to death. In this vein the movie can get tiresomeand at 110 minutes long the biggest flaw becomes the sometimes meandering directionless pace of which moves the plot along. Sure enough such sprawling pitstops are usually followed by a series of great laugh out loud bursts of humour but this incessant need to fill up space needlessly makes Sex Drive feel like a much longer drive than it actually is.That being said despite the formulated familiar approach to this road trip story Anders and Morris do well to capitalise on the stronger elements of such a narrative. The cameos never feel redundant and fabricated the trip itself gives way to some great comical situations and characters believe it or not actually grow albeit very slowly over the course of the journey. Furthermore behind all the profane raunchy sex jokes and slapstick lies a straight forward but nevertheless engaging unrequited love story that doesn't feel tacked on and as derivative as it plays out on page. It's a romance that never quite takes off but with decent characterisation and performances from those involved it's enough to give the story a warm core that pays out with an ending befitting of your average genre movie.To watch a movie like Sex Drive for the romance however is a bit like eating a hot dog for the bun the real drawing power and force of conviction that draws you into the surreal ridiculous world displayed here is through the characters and the awkward downright hilarious jams they get themselves into. For the most part the movie strikes gold most when the comedy is just thatcharacter drivenand it's always fun to watch lead character Ian Josh Zuckerman constantly get into uncomfortable cringeinducing moments of embarrassment.Of course a lot of such moments succeed primarily upon the clever ratatat teenage colloquial dialogue that Anders and Morris accentuate through their script but a lot of it also comes down to the performances of the cast who bring their characters to life vividly and with shades of naturalism that brings out the script's modern laid back feel. As a result Sex Drive all the more feels casual and while this again reinforces the slack attitude devoted to the meandering pacing such a style works well to give the movie a personality of its own that reflects its characters.In the end although I had some qualms with the movie's runtime and it's sometimes unfocused approach to narrative I nevertheless had fun with what Sean Anders delivers here. It's a relentlessly convincing picture with a youthful vision that many directors so often forget or simply neglect to touch upon when making such movies. As a result Sex Drive will undoubtedly speak a lot clearer to younger audience members than their older counterparts but if you happen to be a part of that demographic then there is definitely some great laughs to be had here unabashedly immature and not afraid to get dirty Sex Drive is a long ride but it's worth it in the end for the fun that it expels over that trip.A review by Jamie Robert Ward httpwww.invocus.net".

For a comedy of its type and all of you know what I mean by this coming of age sort of comedy it had a lot of slow parts that weren't funny and needless sentimentality that only served to slow the movie down. However when it was funny it was super funny.The ongoing gags were pretty notable and performances were top notch notably by Seth Green as the sarcastic Amish guy. This may reign as best sarcastic performance in any movie ever. The energy between the various performers was right and helped execute most of the gags effectively. As I mentioned I have complaints but they are trivial. If you want some goofy humor to eat popcorn to give it a shot.".

	schema:reviewBody "The name Sex Drive may awake false expectations for some viewers prior to watching. The movies goes beyond the typical americanpielikecomedystyle and shows a sensitive development of relationships which were not expected at the beginning. These developments are combined with several roadtrip experiences and different of course also sexual experiences during the trip. But the film contains more than that it has a nice plot a stringent story and very talented young actors. It is definitely not just a teenageflick it is much more. Because despite some laughs funny moments  amish and unexpected action  we experience beautiful acting of Amanda Crew who didn't appear to me that intense in other movies before like Final Destination for example. She does not only look beautiful but acts in a very authentic way it seems to me like she enjoyed the set the whole idea of the movie and the acting in it especially though the film had its rather crude moments at the beginning and in the stepmother appearances.I admit that this was one of the best teenageroadmovies I've seen in the last decade. Not only because it shows the lifestyle everybody would have loved to live in its teenage years it also features both laughs and unexpected developments in the end thoughts about the meaning of love and how important it is to trust feelings. A closer look at the character of Ian would have been great because during the whole movie he seemed a bit inapproachable and we don't get an impression about his development of feelings towards Felicia only the other way round.Summary Funny movie with a very nice development in the end and a fascinating and breathtaking Amanda Crew  worth watching!".

I liked all the characters and found this movie highly entertaining. It was a bit like road trip but with a few more edgier jokes. I think this was way funnier than Superbad who's humour I found a bit over the top and a bit uncomfortable and is a guys movie. For us girls it was not very funny.Overall 910. Good work!!".

But the best performances are by Seth Green and James Marsden Seth Green playing a sarcastic Amish man will make you laugh every single time he says I'm just fcking with you. He plays it so well you'll want to become Amish. And then there's James Marsden. You've probably seen him play a superhero a lovable dance show host an innocently narcissistic prince and a cynic we all grew to love. Ever seen him play a cocksure older brother with a maniacal laugh? This shows a whole different side to him the crude crass cussing cocksure homophobic side. His love for his car his love for torturing his brother his laugh steals every scene he's in. This is a great movie for a laugh or to see Seth Green with a beard glued to his face or to see James Marsden with bleached hair.".

The storyline divulged deep into each character and even played with emotions enough for you to love each character or hate to love each character. The over the top humor isn't the same old stuff but well placed well delivered especially Seth green and Clark duke and carefully thought out in the script.

Where Ian is a loser with no success with the opposite sex where the only problem I could see is that he is a little on the short side Lance is an incredible success. But Lance's main physical attribute is  how can I put this?  pudginess and he didn't convince me for a second. Perhaps that in itself was a joke but if so its not one that I got. Perhaps I was simply overwhelmed by the fact that Lance bore an overwhelming resemblance to UK standup comedian Alan Carr who is the last person you would expect to see as a Casanova not least because he is as camp as a row of tents.Josh Zuckerman is an amiable Ian and Amanda Crew is a very fetching Felicia.".

The main character Ian is an absolute rip off of Jim from American Pie but without the heart or empathy that Jim garnered.2. He's older brother and best friend are both part Stifflers. The older brother plays the jerk who makes gay references the entire time while he's best friend plays the objectifying and womanizing lothario. Unfortunately you actually liked Stiffler though. Of course you did. We all know who Sean William Scott is now. If nobody had heard of Xmen then James Marsden would have just killed he's career even more so.3. The best friend the womanizer is played by a fat dorky guy named Clark Duke. Makes sense. Women are falling over themselves to sleep with the fat dorky guy. But wait he's referred to as cool in the movie! Why? Nobody knows. He never does anything except say 'chill out' or some crap that makes him irresistible to women. Upon watching the movie I wondered why I recognized this guy and then I remembered the superbad DVD commentary. They mention Clark Duke cause he kept jumping into every scene in the house party ruining continuity. I also remember when I watched it thinking 'who is that fat dorky looking emo in nearly every shot'. Congratulations Clark Duke. You can tell your grandkids you were in a funny movie. Yeah the one where you never say any lines and try to ruin it! 4. This movie is completely summarized in one quote by Clark Duke near the end of the film when he turns to the camera and says 'These things never happen in real life'.This sums up this movie entirely. Everything in this movie NEVER happens in real life. It's absurd ludicrous and downright stupid.Let me just give you one and one example alone of the stupidity of this movie.The movie is about a virgin who drives across the country to finally have sex with a hot blonde girl who will screw him...BUT...10 minutes into the movie he crawls away from a hot blonde girl who is practically trying to rape him on a bed cause he's friend asks where he is......???? WTF If you had a choice between anaesthesiafree amputation of your balls and watching a movie that insults your intelligence like Sex Drive does I definitely recommend becoming the eunich soprano for your local church choir.".

Basically in Chicago shy and naive eighteen year old high school senior Ian Lafferty Austin Powers in Goldmember's Josh Zuckerman is still a virgin which is easy for his homophobic brother Rex James Marsden to mock but he has best friends Lance Clark Duke who although being a little geeky gets all the women and beautiful Felicia Amanda Crew who has been his friend since childhood but he secretly may love. Ian has been chatting to a girl on the internet called Ms Tasty in Knoxville Tennessee and he has been lying on the profile to make him look and sound more confident and manly they have been chatting a while and he is surprised when she invites him to see her and sounds happy to go all the way. With the opportunity to have sex and lose his virginity he steals his brother's 1969 Pontiac GTO Judge and plans to drive from Brookfield Illinois to her Lance is happy to join him to see him achieve his goal and Felicia comes with them as well told that they are visiting Ian's sick grandmother. On the journey they encounter many problems and interesting situations including hitchhikers that turn hostile state troopers that put them in a cell and a night of fun on behalf of farmer Ezekiel Seth Green with the Amish community called Rumspringa where they abandon their beliefs and do whatever they like but more than anything Ian and Felicia are getting closer. They finally reach their destination where Rex also catches up but Ian is allowed to see Ms Tasty Katrina Bowden by his brother after claiming he may be gay and having sex with the girl may make him straight again she does turn up and she is beautiful but then he realises he loves Felicia. So Ms Tasty threatens him to take his clothes off and then her psychotic boyfriend Bobby Jo Dave Sheridan comes out pointing a gun and they try to steal Rex's car and Felicia gets involved in the situation and needs saving and a small number of earlier characters get involved in the situation but everything eventually calms down. In the end Lance decides he would prefer the life in the Amish community and to marry beautiful Mary Alice Greczyn and Ian and Felicia both realise they love each other and have done for a long time he loses his virginity with her on New Year's Eve and Rex comes out as gay after all we also see the band Fall Out Boy with Ezekiel. Also starring Michael Cudlitz as Rick Charlie McDermott as Andy and Mark L. Young as Randy. Most of the cast are fine Zuckerman playing the typical foolish virgin Duke as an alternative sex pest Crew being slightly kooky but lovely and Green as an unusual Amish guy the story is nothing new it is essentially another Road Trip but travelling to have sex and pop the cherry I agree with the one star out of five rating by critics it is low on original humour it was mostly crude and stupid humour and only the Will TheyWon't They? element kept me going and some kinky stuff apart from that it is a pointless comedy. Pretty poor!".

I entered this film with high hopes for it had a very strong trailer as witnessed before Tropic Thunder. Unfortunately this film did not meet all expectations. The strongest performance was had by James Marsden who continues his meteoric rise through the annals of Hollywood. The former XMen Enchanted and 27 Dresses man showed versatility as the badass big brother of the main protagonist Ian.Ian himself was an unbelievably stereotyped character who was not at all realistic. I happen to be a sensitive and in fact was involved in a relationship very similar to the friendship portrayed between the two main characters however I can let you know that no one is that lame and at no point did Ian seem real to me. The character development was extremely spotty. The audience never really was able to connect with any of the characters and the story line was only engaging about half the time. The actual funny jokes were there though and i guess that is the entire purpose of this film therefore I guess it is more success than failure. I wish that they didn't focus so much on teenage stereotype and worked more into Amanda Crew's character because she is a beautiful young actress who could've used some more context.".

	schema:reviewBody "Since this film was a comedy let's look at it in that light first. I saw this movie about a week ago and it had about two hilarious moments which I am having a hard time remembering. The rest of the film most of the audience sat there in silence with sporadic giggles throughout. My friends whom I watched the prescreening with said they were amused in general but didn't find the film very funny. This is probably because this film strongly uses clichs and old ideas that have just been reshuffled with relatively little originality. The originality is this The two main characters the lead and his goofy friend are in some sort of role reversal where their bodies and personalities are flipped and it's very hard to believe either can be themselves the way they are. The whole film I felt this way and and it was quite distracting this may to some degree be attributed to the actors and Director failing to create believability and instead creating teencomedy caricatures but to the actors credit the three leads showed promise and could do better in a different movie.The comedy itself has a lot of preteen raunchiness that appears so often and so strongly that if you were to see a naked old man showing his gonads like in the movie Borat you wouldn't be very shocked or surprised. Normally this would be funny like in the scene in American Pie with the the pie but since this film holds very little meaning below the obvious surface gags the comedy punch doesn't land strongly if at all that often.This film was also full of young beautiful actresses meant to portray the regular public as they cameo over and over again through most scenes. I don't recall one average looking young woman in the whole movie. This was slightly annoying because perhaps I was looking for something like Dazed and Confused and felt like was I was watching something a little better than American Pie 3. What I mean is that this film is like Superbad where it's laden with raunchy teen comedy and some teen sexual angst. But unlike Superbad it doesn't have the deep underlying truths that elevate the script above boorish crude gags. If it weren't for those two hilarious scenes I failed to describe and perhaps the saving grace of the lead actors this film would be garbage. But it's not and kudos to the Donut costume! If you are between the ages of 1319 you'll probably like this film a bunch. Everybody else prepare to be mostly silently amused.610".

There's even the ruthless older brother Rex think Stifler who antagonizes and embarrasses young Ian at every turn. The big difference with Sex Drive is that the actors chosen for each role don't match the preconceived appearances for these types of characters. Ian doesn't look nerdy enough Lance doesn't look suave enough Felicia isn't laid back and even Rex doesn't always come across as intentionally wicked. This contrast of looks with character traits provides both a unique take on the genre and a harder grab for believability. When the short fat kid with glasses is the one that can woo any girl with ease one has to wonder if this intentional stereotype reversal is confusing refreshing or inspiring. At least Seth Green is there as backup with his always uproarious sarcastic Amish mechanic.The R rating is a welcome sight as it allows the comedy to reach even more risqu and adult heights and perhaps appeal to a bigger audience but the grossout humor does just that  provoking disgust from the viewer in ever bigger doses as each gag outdoes the last in an inverse proportion of laughs to vulgarity. For every bizarre unexplored and ultimately hilarious predicament introduced Mexican donut costumes Amish shindigs abstinence pledges there is an equally overused and rehashed concept rebellious road trips crazy hitchhikers extreme male nudity.

I'll even consider reliving school detention rather than watch a replay of Sex Drive.It's actually the very first movie I've rated below 3 stars at IMDb. i know I haven't rated nearly all movies I've ever seen and some I haven't even never seen to the end and all that but this is the worst comedy attempt I can remember.";

	schema:headline " It's a cute movie";
	schema:reviewBody "I am fascinated by the 80's. It was a unique generation like we'll never see again. Its culture its dressing styles and hairstyles its charm its lifestyle its very imaginative and creative TV commercials like we don't see nowadays...The 80's was also one of music's gold generations and brought us some of the best movies of all time such as The Neverending Story Who Framed Roger Rabbit Uncle Buck Romancing the Stone The Jewel of the Nile Herbie Goes Bananas Bon Voyage Charlie Brown and don't come back! Frankenweenie Missunderstood and D.A.R.Y.L. itself without forgetting that it brought us classic TV series such as Knight Rider Family Ties MacGyver and Miami Vice.D.A.R.Y.L. is in my opinion a very cute little movie. More than that it is a forgotten film and I'm a bit shocked with its quite low rating! It's too underrated yet a pretty good movie.This film stars one of the greatest child actors of all time Barret Oliver. In fact Barret Oliver is absolutely amazing in this movie and portrays an incredible character Daryl. In fact Barret Oliver won a well deserved prize of recognition for his performance in D.A.R.Y.L.  the Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor an honor also won by Noah Hathaway in The Neverending Story and Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense and A.I. Artificial Intelligence just to name a few examples.Daryl is actually D.A.R.Y.L. an acronym for Data Analyzing Robot Youth Lifeform. Daryl looks very human despite being a machine. Daryl however is the most sophisticated and advanced robot ever created like a miracle come true.Daryl is blessed with an extraordinary intelligence and amazing abilities. Plus he's nice friendly sweet cute lovable and liked by many. He's the kind of boy any parents would like to have as a son and the kind of boy any boy would like to be. Daryl is so different and unique that he can light up an entire room.However speaking of Daryl's unbelievable abilities let's see. At school he is even wiser than teachers. He can play baseball like no one else. He can interact with ATM machines and play video games in a way beyond our imagination. He can do house duties in a way that not even housemaids can. He can even pilot a SR71 Blackbird in the most amazing way possible this plane scene is just as impressing as those seen in Top Gun and is equally blessed with incredible driving skills.Daryl is also a blessing for the Richardsons and gives them a new sense for life. The Foxs their neighbors are also very fond of Daryl even Daryl's hilarious and cheat friend Turtle. By the way I hope nobody named their kids Turtle in real life lol. As if being Turtle wasn't enough he's Fox too lol.Sherie Lee Turtle's sister is pretty. It's funny how her brother really annoys her whenever he keeps calling her certain names. She's well portrayed by Amy Linker. The silly kid Turtle is greatly played by Danny Corkill. Other talents include Mary Beth Hurt as Joyce Richardson Michael McKean as Andy Richardson Josef Sommer as the friendly scientist Dr. Jeffrey Stewart Kathryn Walker as Dr. Ellen Lamb the actors who portray the Fox couple and others.It's an interesting movie with a heartwarming story. In general this is a simple and calm movie being often funny and lighthearted. It also has some action without overdoing it drama emotional and touching moments fun and entertainment. The concept and the idea of the movie is interesting and the movie is well made being filmmaking of quality.The ending is dramatic at first but turns out to be a happy and fair ending. Daryl is repaired brought back to life and returns to the Richardsons after a challenging and dangerous journey to escape to the cruelty of the United States Air Force with generals determined to destroy Daryl and won't allow anyone to free Daryl. Our story has a happy ending.I haven't talked about the soundtrack yet. I like very much the piano solo numbers and Teddy Pendergrass's song Somewhere I Belong which can be described as beautiful nostalgic relaxing happy sad emotional and fits perfectly in the movie's final scene. The rest of the soundtrack is good too.Despite the fact that D.A.R.Y.L. can be considered a science fiction movie it isn't totally fictitious. In my opinion there's very few of true science fiction in this film. For me this is more of a drama told through a simple but good story with a bit of scifi as well in a combination that works out very well. It has also interesting stuff about artificial intelligence a very classic sense of humor nice special effects and a great direction by Simon Wencer. The phrase A machine becomes human when you can't tell the difference anymore is very valuable. Should be kept in mind and never forgotten.Overall this is another great nostalgic and charming movie from the 80's. Another favorite of mine from that magical decade.This should definitely be on Top 250.".

McKean is both good and likable. The special effects while some are outdated are actually pretty good. The scifi elements do hold some interesting points and are handled well not too simplified. The sense of humor certainly has its moments. Direction can be great. Editing is usually positive and it has some rather effective parts. Cinematography is fine. For a kid's movie there is a bit of language. There is also some violence and a handful of mature references. This does bear some marks of being for little ones if not many. Music is OK.

A true 1980s film is one that evokes hope that any dream can truly be achieved that good will always triumph over evil and that feel good cheesy music colourful baggy shirts and inappropriate sunglasses will put a smile on your face. Whilst the most memorable 1980s pictures focus on comedy romance and success e.g. Ghostbusters Mannequin Wall Street etc there are outliers that go in a different direction but still retain the basic heart of this era the feel good factor. DARYL tells the story of a seemingly abandoned child who is adjusting to a new life with foster parents the story takes a twist however when it is revealed that he is really an experiment in artificial intelligence. The target audience is primarily kids and family and such spectators are rewarded with all the necessary ingredients that this movie should have. It successfully touches upon the aspects of life that boys would see as fun when growing up and through DARYL the audience can fantasise about driving in high speed car chases flying planes being a star sportsman video games player and being super smart. What more could a kid want in life? The movie remains engrossing throughout despite a slow pace as a result of a very strong performance by the lead character. DARYL is a thoughtful touching interesting and entertaining movie that despite being more than 20 years does not really feel dated the true sign of any classic. For those who grew up in the 1980s movies like DARYL will always have special meaning as they represent an innocence and hope that sadly most of us lose as we grow older and cynicism kicks in. As a standalone sci fi family film DARYL takes itself seriously whilst knowing how to have fun is thought provoking and delivers an evening of entertaining escapism for the entire family. After more than 20 years there are few family films being released today that can make the same claim.".

	schema:reviewBody "'D.A.R.Y.L.' is an adorable little scifi children's film from the Eighties and will certainly conjure feelings of nostalgia in those who watched it as children. The film revolves around tenyearold Daryl who is found wandering alone in the wilderness and is fostered by childless couple Joyce and Andy Richardson. He quickly befriends their neighbours' son Turtle and goes from strengthtostrength in his new home. However it soon becomes apparent that Daryl isn't quite normal. His intellect is vast he has excellent sporting reflexes and acts in an oddly adult manner. Then when two military scientists turn up at the Richardsons' home to retrieve him it turns out Daryl is not a human child but a Data Analysing Robot Youth Lifeform created in a science lab to serve the military. When the military orders that Daryl be destroyed the fight to save him and return him to the family home where he was loved is on...Barret Oliver plays the title character of Daryl gives an effective performance and nicely depicts his character gradually changing from being odd and awkward to acting like a typical boy of ten. Mary Beth Hurt and Michael McKean as Joyce and Andy also give good depictions of foster parents desperate for a child uncertain about the strange nature of Daryl yet coming to love him as if he were their own. Josef Sommer plays the scientist who begins to question the boundaries of what is considered human once he starts to know Daryl the robot he created properly. And Ron Frazier as General Graycliffe who is intent on seeing Daryl destroyed depicts his character in a suitably loathsome light!Besides the nostalgia factor for those in their twenties and early thirties this film will not only be enjoyable for children of today but as we live in the computer age brings up very relevant issues that they can consider such as what being a human means and why blood relations doesn't always matter when it comes to family. Daryl for younger viewers is the equivalent of Data from 'Star Trek The Next Generation' so perhaps making this film a good choice for parents wishing to introduce their young kids to the scifi genre.This is definitely an Eighties kids' classic but also one for all the family.".

Synopsis A military experiment lab loses its super enhanced human subject to the outside world who is now suffering from amnesia while the military hunts him down. Sounds familiar? Daryl got there first but thinking about it there is no reason why the Bourne trilogy cannot be seen as unofficial sequels to Daryl. But enough of that. I remember loving this film when I first saw it 20 years ago so when I watched it again I expected to find it dated and perhaps much of the magic gone. The opposite happened. I was spellbound. It is somewhat dated but that simply adds to the charm as the 80s was the epitome of childhood innocence wonder and mischief before the internet age came along. What elevates this film above most children's films is the abundance of heart soul and values of friendship. All the actors play their part with natural aplomb and it has to be said that Barrat who plays the boy robot with human emotions was played to perfection. Mckean plays the foster father delightfully although has a frightening resemblance to ex UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. The film is sprinkled with humour throughout particularly with Turtle teaching Daryl how to behave and how to deal with adults! There is no action in the first three quarters of the movie apart from a brief car chase at the start. Instead we are invested in the characters and relationships so that we truly care about them by the time the thrilling final act kicks into gear. And boy is the last act so exciting with perhaps the best car chase I have seen in any children's film and a climactic action finale that I can only conclude Die Hard 2 stole from! Daryl is an under rated 80s classic.".

Also as DARYL grew from an infant to a preadolescent child his computer brain would have to had been changed to a accommodate his growing skull.

'D.A.R.Y.L.' proves to be one of those movies that shows that the eighties might have actually had more thought process than today. In this do not trust the government movie Barret Oliver plays a young boy who actually is a robot. The military who couldn't figure out why they wanted little children robots in the first place decide to scrap Daryl. Daryl. however has been foster cared and has no memory of his past. While Barret Oliver's Daryl can't approach the level of success of Peter Billingsley in 'The Dirt Bike Kid.' He manages to play his role with a sympathy that Spielberg just can't get out of people who follow his storyboards. For all those who think that I just utterly hate Spielberg I do rate 'A.I.' slightly ahead of the tv program 'Small Wonder. '".

	onyx:emotionText "There are tons of Spielberg fans out there that remain loyal to him even after his long list of recent trash flicks. Amongst them was 'AI.' 'D.A.R.Y.L.' proves to be one of those movies that shows that the eighties might have actually had more thought process than today. In this do not trust the government movie Barret Oliver plays a young boy who actually is a robot. The military who couldn't figure out why they wanted little children robots in the first place decide to scrap Daryl. Daryl. however has been foster cared and has no memory of his past. While Barret Oliver's Daryl can't approach the level of success of Peter Billingsley in 'The Dirt Bike Kid.' He manages to play his role with a sympathy that Spielberg just can't get out of people who follow his storyboards. For all those who think that I just utterly hate Spielberg I do rate 'A.I.' slightly ahead of the tv program 'Small Wonder. '";

In my opinion this movie was the inspiration for Artificial Intelligence. I recommend watching this movie because of the extremely great story. Just overlook the bad acting it's not hard to do.The movie is about a robot in a boy's body. He is misunderstood by his creators who believe him just to be a mechanical being not capable of the will to live to have the ability to love or feelings and emotions. But he does have all these traits and you will come to care about him. now doesn't that sound like A.I. to you? SPOILER ALERTWhat makes this movie's peak of emotions is the ending where the song 'Somewhere I Belong' by Teddy Pendergrass is played. Give it a chance you won't regret it!".

As others have pointed out with his quicklearning abilities and lack of social skills it is easy to see Daryl as metaphorical for someone on the Autism Spectrum and the overall movie has some positive messages as such in terms of acceptance for all. The second half of the film which is more thrills than mysterybased is not quite as strong as the first half but lots of impressive if improbable stunts keep things chugging along. The ending certainly feels a little rushed and Marvin Hamlisch's sentimental music score does not always work. In general though this is an engaging tale along the lines of 'Pinocchio' and 'A.I.' with the idea that all kids are kids even if their minds work differently.".

This film is part of what I would call the Amblin generation of films although it is not an Amblin film because it came out in a decade full of wonderful family films GooniesGremlinsCocoonNeverending story etc.. . It was a time when adults could watch a so called kids film and enjoy it as much as their rugrats. D.A.R.Y.L is a family drama with a dash of SciFy  it is two film in one.A heart warming film for the first half and a children Sci Fy thriller in it's second half.These two different style works surprisingly well here. There is something so welcoming about the first half when young D.A.R.Y.L superbly played by child actor Barret Oliver is found in the middle of the wood and put into foster care as a test drive for a couple who desperately want to adopt a child. Here he meet his first friend  potty mouthed Turtle Yeah he his called Turtle and learn valuable lessons about how to relate to adults The kid does not know a thing about being a son There is just something so incredibly warm and fuzzy about the first half of the movie that makes it the perfect choice for a rainy Sunday afternoon.There is that 80's charm.It is also nice to basically watch a family that enjoy the little thing in life like baseball  Ice cream etc..The suburban setting his welcoming and the 80's vibe will bring as much memories to 80's kids as lets say The Andy Griffith Show does for children of the 50's. It was a simpler time and this film shows that. Barret Oliver as D.A.R.Y.L is a great main character  he his curious  oddly different and curiously smart...way too smart. The second half reveal something is different about D.A.R.Y.L and that is when the SciFy elements kicks in. I am not going to say what it is just in case the person who is reading this know nothing about this film The cover of the DVD reveals way too much unfortunately. This film is a great film for the all family.If you feel to escape the grim reality of life lol you could do far worse then putting this charming film on! I give D.A.R.Y.L a 8 out of 10.".

Habitat is a science fictionthriller movie and much more like an Outer Limits story than a Dead Zone one. The story is one we have heard before We are killing Mother Earth. Hank Symes Tcheky Karyo has radical plans to put an end to this destruction. His plans accidentily include his family. This was not a box office hit. It is not a faced paced action movie like Running Man or Total Recall. It is a movie trying to highlight an underlying issue. It is very enjoyable. The acting is mostly solid with very good performances by the older performers. The story moves along quite well and the special effect are believable with some Hollow Manlike tricks. Habitat does contain some nude scenes mostly topless and some swearing. This is mostly not out of place or out of character but does limit the audience the movie's message could have reached. The movie carries a message that we all should start taking notice of. Overall an enjoyable movie for me and that is why a 7 out of 10.".

An experiment with bacteria algae electricity and who knows what else claims the life of the scientist but then his family begin to notice their home slowly turning into a rain forest. The teenage son plays his role well embarrassed by his flower child mother and his stand offish father he just wants to fit in. But despite being the target of his peers' ridicule he manages to land the affections of one of the prettiest girls in school. If only that skinny dipping scene could've happen to me in high school! Anyway as the house keeps growing the son slowly develops certain powers that allow him to stand up to his oppressors. Habitat has a good story but seems to have run short on special effects funds with 25 of the movie left to film. Some of the interior shots of the growing house are both beautiful and grotesque but then we end up with strange scenes like a certain explosion at the end that looks like they rigged a train set model with firecrackers lightly covered it with moss and let it blow. Another one in the detach your brain before watching genre. I like movies like this. There's so much seriousness in our day to day lives that when I have the time to watch a movie like Habitat I like to just sit back and absorb it. Much like the house did to certain antagonists in this film.".

It also contains some of the most astonishingly bad dialogue in recent years The line It's you isn't it? You're that one potato deserves it's place in the bad dialogue hall of fame.The special effects are equally poor most of the time looking like something out of a bad 1980's Duran Duran video...And then there's the performances.The term 'almost universally bad' springs to mind here. Balthazar Getty Alice Krige and Chris Heyerdahl all act like they're in a coma but compared to the rest of the cast thats a good thing. The rest of the cast ranger from truly bad Bruce Mackay Kris Holdenreid to unbelievably irritating Kenneth Welsh Katherine Trowell and Tcheky Karyo who seems to have forgotten how to act altogether. In fact the only passable performance comes from Laura Harris but even that's far from good.Not even so bad it's good this is a painful experience to watch and is utter crud even for the most ardent or hard up scifi fan. Stupid in the extreme this has absolutely nothing to recommend it other than a little exploitative nudity and if you're truly that desperate rent a porno or a Troma film instead this is the type of film making that makes Ed Wood seem like a genius in comparison. 99 minutes of your life that you will never get back this is the very definition of a terrible film.

She plays her role with so much sweetness that any normal personal may literally throw up at the end of the movie like after eating few boxes of chocolates and drinking few cans of supersweetened condensed milk. Both taste great in little doses overdose end ups with vomits and so is Alice Krige's performance here. However there is an instant cure for it kind of vaccine  also contained within this movie as well  Perhaps it is not performance I don't dare to call it that much but lets just say that the extended scenes and closeups of nude Laura Elisabeth Harris proudly showing off her nice natural pair of breathing devices  they really made up for the damages done by Krige!I dont want my post to be taken down in any near future for using anatomically correct  but politically incorrect  words like brest tis etc. So if youre a straight male  rent it!

The script is simply terrible and the same can be said of the dialog the acting the music and just about everything else  except Lara Harris's face and breasts. At first I thought it was Laura Harris the chesty beauty from The Faculty but I was surprised to find out that there is a Lara and a Laura  who look very similar. Coincidence? Hardly these two must be sisters. Alice Krige also shows her breasts they're okay but kind of small. Why do I dwell on breasts? All in all their four breasts are the only things worth seeing in this unbelievably bad movie. The premise is okay it's the execution that sucks. The entire film from AZ from top to bottom is a 100 amateur venture. For a while the movie refuses to confirm its horror status and delves endlessly in ultramoronic teenmovie waters the school's coach is obsessed with boxing likes to beat up the students he unexplainedly dislikes and here's a first a movie father who prefers the daughter's boyfriend to the daughter herself! I've never seen anything dumber in any teen movie. Harris's evil boyfriend sees that Getty is eying Harris so what does he do? His first impulse is to fight her but he hands her over instead! And then Harris starts Frenchkissing Getty whom she barely knows! I mean the entire movie is like this. One absurd scene follows another. There is no point in making a list of the silly moments because there would simply be no end to it and I don't want to be stuck writing about this movie well into next year.".

Writerdirector Rene Daalder's script is occasionally interesting and intelligent but the high school bully's dialogmy favorite line being Yo organs n' skin gonna melt like stew!is laughable and character development is minimal. And there was one really really troubling line that is unfortunately scared in my mindYou ever heard of hygiene? Even animals lick themselves clean! I spend a lot of time with my boys in the shower and I teach them that even body odor isn't just smell it's bacteria it's germs!Wow that's unsettling. I really really hope that when Daalder was writing this line he intended it to be funny if not I shutter at what kind of childhood he must have endured! His direction is wildly uneven at best. The film was shot on a High Definition Sony video giving it a distinctly blurry ugly look it felt like watching one of those really bad daytime soap operas.The actors are passable no one was really awful I suppose given the material they were working with but no one gave a truly solid noteworthy performance either. So what in this film actually worked? Well for one the set looks great. Kudos to the production designer Claude Par for creating a wonderfully disgusting jungle of a set considering the budget was pretty low and time was probably limited the setprop constructors definitely deserve a pat on the back of their work. The visual effects though obvious and easy to spot were overall decent I've seen much much worse CGI from much biggerbudget films Resident Evil anyone?. And then there'suhI guess that's all that really worked in Habitat. Shame. The plot is actually halfdecent with more money this could have been a good scifihorror blend but alas it's nothing but your usual directtovideo fodder. It's boring stupid and confusing.

He's a decent enough young kid who leaves his parent's homestead and strikes out for the big city of Dallas where his uncle Barry Corbin has promised to find him work in the petrochemical industry. In 1980 that was beginning to boom and Texas was definitely a growing place in the USA.Travolta does a good job in making we the audience care about his character who when you come right down to it is a sexist pig. He meets and marries Debra Winger who's from the same background but she's got some ideas that women should not be shadows of their men. And when she beats him at Gilley's mechanical bull a man's game that's it for him.Scott Glenn who's an exconvict is working at Gilley's and this film was his breakout role. He's a real snake in Urban Cowboy he gets Travolta's goat with a mere look and he moves in on Winger. Travolta in turn takes up with rich girl Madolyn Smith Osborne who's slumming at Gilley's. Despite the characters Urban Cowboy was really one gigantic commercial for the selfstyled biggest honky tonk in the world. Gilley's is no longer there in the suburban Texas community of Pasadena but the memories do live on. And the best thing about Urban Cowboy is the wonderful score of countrywestern songs that were featured in the film. I'm not sure if some of the songs were not written specifically for Urban Cowboy but it's the only reason I can think of why the Motion Picture Academy ignored the musical aspects of this film. I especially liked Johnny Lee's Looking For Love if it was specifically written for this film it's a disgrace that it wasn't nominated for Best Song.I liked Debra Winger's character best in this film. She doesn't lose a trace of femininity but she stands up to Travolta and does it in style. And this review is dedicated to that yet as unknown woman who will one day be the first woman bullrider in the Professional Bull Riders.".

	schema:reviewBody "First let me say I am not from the south but I am an American. I don't love Country music but I can stomach it. I would never wear a cowboy hat but I wear hats. I don't live in a trailer but I do eat tuna salad and own a home. What does that have to do with this comment? A lot if you are one of those people who say only country people love this movie. This movie is loosely based on the They loved and lost premise. James Bridges directs an American love story as real as it gets. In an era of Jerry Springer and Lets put it out there mentality this film rings truer than ever. Bud is coming of age and embarks on a life of his own with a little help from his aunt and uncle so he moves to the big city with them. Bud finds himself drawn into the local honky tonk world for the only escape a blue collar man can afford. He quickly meets Sissy who is from a similar background and the two have a whirlwind romance filled with painful ups and downs. This plot takes so many turns that one has to just sit for a few minutes before they get hooked. Marriage is a focus here that is often missed. Early in the film they marry and we view the transition from being single to married. The film highlights some of the modern struggles a woman has when she marries an old fashioned man. It also brings into view the male ego with women and competition.Bud is challenged and is excited when Micky's puts in an electronic bull. Sissy gets ideas of having fun on it too but is quickly reminded that she is married and need to start acting like it. The emotion between the two characters is raw and expressive and the plot continues from there especially when they NOTE THIS IS GIVING SOME OF THE STORYLINE AWAY split and Sissy falls for an ex con with a penchant for abuse and cruelty. She soon realizes that the grass is not always greener on the other side.How anyone can compare Bud to Vinnie Barbirino is shocking to me. John Travolta gave an exceptional performance that was worthy recognition. He was believable and real. The scene where he shaves his beard and you first see him at the bar..still gives me goosebumps. Mind you I am not a huge Travolta fan but come on I see why Sissy was kicking of her boots so early in the film. Deb Winger was so real that you found yourself sympathizing with her as she pens a note of emotions to Bud after sneaking in to clean his house during their break up. The supporting cast was incredible. Wes played by Scott Glenn gave a first rate performance that made you hate him and curse him as he abused Sissy. Madolyn SmithOsborne as Buds Mistressgirlfriend was so authentic that large chested girls across the U.S. prayed to wake up flat chested to wear the clothes she donned in the film. My biggest kudos's go to Barry Corbin and Brooke Anderson as Bud's aunt and uncle. They seemed like someone's aunt and uncle somewhere in Texas and however small their role they made the film so much bigger and lifelike. Two memorable scenes were the Dolly Parton contest and the unforgettable scene where Bud and his aunt stand outside after one of the characters death. The dialog between them is touching.If you can watch this for what it is a true American love story. Then I recommend that you take it for what it is...a film before it's time that gave us voyeurism into a world unlike our own but real enough for our enjoyment and entertainment. If this world sounds similar to yours then you will enjoy it so much more. Lastly the music however dated is sure to send you back in time if you are over 30 years of age.".

Well it is true except for Pam.Travolta plays Bud a small town Texas boy who moves to Houston to work in the oil fields. And this is when Travolta actually played in good dramatic movies like Saturday Night Fever instead of playing stereotypical bad guysgood guys in big budget movies.

But their relationship becomes a real life battle of the sexes. Bud wants to be a real cowboy. Sissy wants to be with a real cowboy. But in modern times men's roles are not as clear. Where can Bud prove he's a real man? He can work his dangerous job by day and ride the mechanical bull by nighthe can be a urban cowboy. But Sissy wants to drive his pickup truck and she wants to ride the mechanical bull too. So where does this leave Bud? As Sissy asserts her independence she lies about riding the bull and flirts with the excon and prison rodeo stara real bull rider Wes played wonderfully greasy by Scott Glenn. Bud is threatened and Bud and Sissy break up.Sissy shacks up with Wes who abuses her. Emasculating himself further Bud becomes the boy toy of Pam a rich girl whose Daddy is in oil and all that implies. Sissy comes by the trailer to clean it upPam doesn't do that kind of thing.

Bud and Sissy have a chance at reconciliation but are too stubborn. Later the mechanical bull riding competition is at Gilley's and you know Bud is going to win. Pam realizes that Bud doesn't love her but Sissyhe did it for her. Wes tries to rob Gilleys but wouldn't you know that urban cowboy Bud saves the day and wins back the woman he loves.Of course you may ask yourself why Bud and Sissy would go to Gilleys about every night and live like pigs. Maybe that contributed to their bad marriage. Or why didn't Bud stay with Pamshe wasn't that bad and had money. Or why they had to kill off Uncle Bob. Or why Bud and Sissy had such stupid friends like Marshall and Jessie who were always trying to break them up Marshall says to Bud She Sissy rides that bull better than you do! But part of the fun of Urban Cowboy is making fun of it a little bitand saying isn't that Bonnie Raitt on the stage!".

The theater and the girl are both long gone.Back to the review....For those of you who grew up or lived in and around Houston during the 70's this is a delight to watch. I tend to endure Travolta and that horrid twang he tries to do but it's okay the rest of the flick makes up for that!Minor SpoilersWe start the movie wBud coming to town. Just watching him drive thru Houston thru the 610 loop and on to his Uncle's place is a treat. There is the Houston of Big Oil and Big Space. When I was little and went on vacations if some one asked me where I was from their next question was Do you have a ranch own an oil well or know astronauts? That was part of the joy of being from Houston back in the old days. But I'm rambling. The casting on URBAN COWBOY is great not a dud in the bunch even counting the Travolta factor. Only he could have pulled this movie off at the time it was made. On a side note it was common practice during the filming of UC for the local media to have a Travolta Sighting comment on the news or in the newspapers. The biggest spotting occurred in mid 1979 at the sports arena known at the time as The Summit. Travolta appeared in the white suit from Saturday Night Fever at a Bee Gee's concert and hopped up on stage. No one recognized him at first as he had grown a beard for the opening parts of the movie. If you grew up around Houston during this longpast era this is a MUST OWN. My daughters always ask if I ever rode a mechanical bull when we watch it. But I have always wondered about one small thing in this picture. And this is simply 'cause I am a car geek. Why at the end of the movie when Bud and Sissy drive away from Gilley's is there parked amongst the F150's GMC's Chevy Big 10's and other pickup trucks a Volvo P1800 wagon? You can't miss it.".

The popularity of the movie to a wide section of America is proof that it is more than just a movie appealing country or redneck types. There's something about Debra Winger  her change of moods her expressiveness her vulnerability  where you just can't take your eyes off her when she is on camera. And the movie is downright fun with the Charlie Daniels Band Travolta's Texas 2 step dancing scenes and mechanical bull riding contests.

	schema:reviewBody "An unmarried twentysomething hick played by John Travolta leaves the farm and goes to Houston where he learns about life and love in a Texas honkytonk. At face value it's a modern love story ... Texas style. There's gobs of cowboy hats pickup trucks neon beer signs and references to big beltbuckles and rodeos. The music if not Texas native is Texas adapted courtesy of the talents of Mickey Gilley Johnny Lee and the Charlie Daniels Band. And that Texas twang ... y'all.The story and the characters are about as subtle as the taste of Texas fivealarm chili made with Jalapeno peppers. It's enough to make civilized viewers abort the film in favor of a genteel classic one starring Laurence Olivier or Ingrid Bergman maybe. Hamlet it's not. But Urban Cowboy is spicy and explicit and I kinda like it.Technically the film is generally good. The dialogue the production design and the costumes are all realistic the editing is skillful. And both the casting and the acting are commendable if not Oscar worthy. I would not have cast Travolta in the role he plays but he does a fine job ... ditto Debra Winger. Barry Corbin and Brooke Alderson among others are good too in support roles. But the cinematography seemed weak. The film copy I watched was grainy and at times suffered from a reddishorange tint a visual trait I have noticed in other films from the same time period.At first glance the film does not seem to offer any social or political message. But I would argue that when Urban Cowboy was released twentyfive years ago it had rather prophetic implications. In 1980 the U.S. had all kinds of problems not the least being American hostages held by Iran. In the minds of a lot of folks back then the U.S. was being pushed around bullied.This film along with others of its time offered something that Americans wanted to see in their political leaders ... toughness. Urban Cowboy is a very physical film. The characters in it may not be the brightest people on Earth. But they're tough!Everything about Urban Cowboy is antiintellectual. As a vehicle for cultural expression then this 1980 film was one of several that augured a new gettough era for the U.S. It started in 1980 with the election of Reagan. And that era continues to this day with a President who probably will not be remembered for his intellect but will be remembered for his toughness and aggression traits that Americans seem to gravitate to as surely as Texans to fivealarm chili.".

Everytime I watch it I seem to notice something different in the movie. I even notice mistakes in the film. I really truly want to meet the real Gator Connley Minnie Norman Tucker Jesse the fat chick you see in several scenes and oh my the big dude himself Sherwood Cryer. I get to Texas often as I married a Texas boy. We goto Billy Bob's cant get him to goto Dallas to the new Gilley's. Cant even get him to take me to Pasadena.........but hey I know where there is a old dodge power wagon with one of those originals Gilley's stickers on it. just down the streethere in PA You have to see the movie TRUST ME";

The VHS was 1.33 full screen. And yes a solid 5.1 mix for your viewing pleasure. What can you say about this movie?It's just a great lovehate story set in Texas with great performances. Travolta is fantastic. Next to Pulp Fiction it's the best thing he's done. It's been in my top 5 for 25 years!!Check this one out!!! It's a 10 !!!!".

Along the days they fight each other and try to make the other jealous. When Gilley's announces a mechanical bull's dispute Bud wants to win Wes. Will he succeed? Urban Cowboy is a silly film with unlikable and immature characters. Bud Davis is an unbearable character and Sissy is immature and fool. But the music score and the dances are highly entertaining. In addition it is delightful to see Debra Winger very young. My vote is six.Title Brazil Cowboy do Asfalto Asphalt Cowboy".

Since these two lovebirds Bud and Cissy spend most of the movie arguing and fighting with each other and Bud also being physically violent with Cissy and other people what does this classic American love story really have to say about American love relationships? Not much that is good! Apparently in Texas all disputes must come to blows. I cannot image these two characters living happily ever after. The next fight is probably always just around the corner for these two. Oh and the soundtrack...what a piece of redneck Americana. Yeeehaaww!".

I remember Urban Cowboy hit the theaters and overnite there were honkytonks being opened on every corner men were sporting cowboy hats with their penny loafers and if you didnt know how to twostep you were considered a social moron! Personally I think it's a great movie. Travolta really surprised me on the heels of SatNiteFever. Who'd a thunk. He's actually believable too. The soundtrack is awesome. Too bad Charlene Tilton of TV's Dallas fame ruined Johnny Lee's career cause that guy was just terrific. The show stealer here is Scott Glenn as the greaser excon redneck cowboy. And I ain't got nothing against greaser excon cowboys semibeing one myself but I've always envied what I feel to be the greatest power line of all time....Packat St! Sort of like Clint's make my day.

	schema:reviewBody "If it does nothing else seeing Black Orpheus will make you want to pack up immediately and go to Rio de Janeiro. The movie convinces you that the city's sparkling harbor and dramatic green hills must be one of the most beautiful landscapes on earth especially when accompanied by a soundtrack of energetic samba and smooth bossa nova music. The cliffside shantytowns teem with vitality and are never too poor to rig up an elaborately costumed samba show for Carnival. Even the fact that the movie retells a tragic Greek myth barely detracts from the overall effect. It makes Rio seem even more magical a place where archetypal stories of love and death still hold their power. In this version Orfeu Breno Mello is a streetcar conductor who moonlights as a musician and Eurydice Marpessa Dawn is an innocent country girl. The movie starts as a simple love triangle Orfeu has an inconvenient fiance but becomes increasingly surreal as it progresses. Death represented by a man in a skeleton suit literally pursues Eurydice while going unnoticed by everyone else who may assume he is just dressed up for Carnival. His motivations are never explained but perhaps he is jealous of Eurydice's youth and beauty. The movie finds clever ways to depict the events of the original legend and adds a wonderful sense of atmosphere as Orfeu goes through the underworld in the middle of the night.Lourdes de Oliveira and La Garcia give vivid supporting performances as respectively Orfeu's jealous fiance and Eurydice's exuberant cousin. I also liked the two scrappy unsentimental street kids who idolize Orfeu.Overall Black Orpheus is a successful attempt to place a Greek myth in a modern context retaining the story's original tragedy while adding new contrasting flavors and rhythms. I would especially recommend it to fans of Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge another color andmusicsaturated film with a love story inspired by the Orpheus legend.".

But it is from a multiplicity of detail that an edifice of cinematic genius is constructed.The true brilliance of Black Orpheus lies in the people who live on the side of the cliffs overlooking the harbor at Rio. It is their energy that prevails. Then there is the color the costumes the pounding rhythms the spectacular vitality of life that is depicted as a carnival of dance and song in which we are driven along as on a wave. And yet there is the constant reality of death. And it strikes in way we cannot comprehend fatalistically and we are helpless to do anything about it. And then Orpheus sings a new Orpheus perhaps and the sun rises again and a little girl in white looking like Eurydice in miniature begins to dance as the little boy Orpheus plays his guitar telling us that time has come round again.Well that's the plot as adapted by screen writer Jacques Voit from the play by Vinicius d Moraes as divined from the Greek mythology. Supporting this arresting conception is the music by Antonio Carlos Jobim and Luis Bonfa. I recall the former as the composer of bossanova who gave us The Girl from Ipanema and made the samba international. Starring in the title role as the streetcar conductor who is loved by all is Beno Melo who might be seen as the natural man and native of paradise. The very pretty Marpessa Dawn plays Eurydice an innocent from the country who falls in love with Orpheus and his song. Lourdes de Oliveira plays his intended Mira who is hot blooded vital and beautifully ordinary. But the actress I recall most vividly from the time I first saw this in the sixties was La Garcia who played Serafina. Her exuberance and comedic flair struck me as something completely different from anybody I had ever seen before. And then there are the boys who follow Orpheus around and emulate his every move. With their torn shirts and unflagging optimism they represent the new day that will dawn.If you haven't seen this classic of world cinema you are in for a singular experience. There is nothing else like it that I know of. And it is as fresh today as when it was made almost half a century ago.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

	schema:reviewBody "If there is a film that deserves to be restored Orfeu Negro seems to be a logical choice. Judging by the copy we recently saw at New York's Film Forum it shows how the Eastmancolor in which it was photographed has faded. This is a film that is about color as seen in that photogenic city that is Rio de Janeiro with its infinite cacophony of colors and sexuality at the time of carnival.Vinicius de Moraes play Orfeu do Carnaval served as the basis of inspiration for French director Marcel Camus and his cowriter Jacques Viot for the movie. Mr. Moraes adapted the Greek tragedy and transplanted it to Rio at the time of carnival. Nowhere in the world do people live just for those precious days of the year where everyone goes crazy during the annual ritual.The tragedy of Orpheus and Eurydice plays well against that backdrop. Orfeu a tram conductor meets and falls in love with the beautiful an sweet Eurydice. Their love is doomed from the start because Orfeu has promised Mira he will marry her. They are seen prior to the fateful meeting going to register for a marriage license.Eurydice has a premonition that something will happen to her as a man dressed in a death costume and mask keeps following her and at one point he promises the young woman he will return for her. In the meantime Orfeu and Eurydice realize they are meant for one another. During the parade Serafina Eurydice's cousin exchanges places with her so she can stay home with the merchant marine boyfriend who has just arrived. Mira realizes the deceit and fights with Eurydice who flees in horror only to be follow by the Death figure.Orfeu Negro relied on unknowns for the main characters. The handsome Bruno Mello and the gorgeous Marpessa Dawn play the doomed lovers with conviction. Jean Bourgoin's camera loved them and they are photographed against the colors of the carnival and Rio. Lourdes Oliveira and Lea Garcia have good moments as Mira and Serafina respectively and Jorge DosSantos is a natural as Chico.The other best thing in the film is the fabulous music by Luiz Bonfa and Antonio Carlos Jobim. The songs and the music we hear in the soundtrack proved these two men were on the way to establish themselves as the best composers and in the case of Mr. Jobim interpreter of their creations which will culminate with the triumph of the Bossa Nova period that was produced in Brazil at the time.Marcel Camus ultimately is the man to be congratulated because of his vision in finding beauty even in the favelas where most of the action takes place in capturing the color and sensuality of Rio de Janeiro during carnival.".

	schema:reviewBody "Potential Spoilers!From the moment of its first appearance at the Cannes Film Festival in 1959where it won the Palme d'Orit was clear that Black Orpheus was a very special film. Taking the ancient Greek myth of a youth who travels to the land of the dead to bring back the woman he loves and transporting it to the slums of modern day Rio de Janeiro this bittersweet romantic tragedy has charmed audiences the world over with its beauty color andabove allits music. In fact so important is Black Orpheus' musical dimension that you might say the film's roots aren't in images but in sounds.The first shot shows an ancient frieze of the lovers Orpheus and Eurydice. But what grabs your attention as it hits the screen is the sound of the music playing underneath ita guitar softly strumming the chords of the film's main musical theme. A mood of quiet reverie is created only to be shattered almost immediately as the frieze explodes before our eyes only to be replaced by a series of fastmoving shots of dancers preparing for Carnival. But even those colorful sights are undercut by a sound that beginning here runs through the length of the filmthe eruptive convulsive infectious beat of the Latin American pop sound known as bossa nova.Though bossa nova had been the cornerstone of Latin American music for many years it's safe to say that prior to the release of Black Orpheus the world at large had never really heard it before. The film changed the world of music overnight. Its composers Antonio Carlos Jobim and Luis Bonf became international stars. The film's main themes Manha de Carnival and O Nossa Amor permeated the public consciousness in a way that hadn't been seen since Anton Karas' unforgettable zither theme for The Third Man. But make no mistake none of these musical glories would have been possible without the film that holds them all togetherBlack Orpheus.The Orpheus of myth was the son of the god Apollo and Calliope a muse. His singing tamed wild beasts and quited raging rivers. The Orpheus of the film is a lowly streetcar conductor whose singing makes him a favorite of the slum neighborhood where he lives. The original Eurydice was likewise highborn when compared to the film's heroinea simple country girl visiting the big city of Rio for the first time in her life. Ordinarily saddling such everyday characters with mythological barnacles would make for dramatic awkwardness. But thanks to the context of Carnival it all works perfectly. A onceayear blowout where rich and poor alike can masquerade in whatever identities they choose Carnival is the ideal setting for sliding a mythical mask over commonplace reality. And director Marcel Camus proves to be quite adept at juggling this balancing act between the fantastic and the real.The figure of Death that pursues Eurydice through the streets of Rio could be the literal personification of fateor the sort of everyday maniac found on the streets of any major city. Likewise Eurydice's death from a streetcar cable is a neat transportation of the original legend in which she died from a serpent's bite on her leg. Best of all is the film's climax in which Orpheus visits the underworldhere represented by Rio's Bureau of Missing Personsand a Macumba ceremony in which he tries to make contact with his dead love. As in the legend the story of the film ends on an unhappy note. Still this nominally sad conclusion is undercut by the spirit of the largely unprofessional cast Breno Mello was the champion soccer player Marcpessa Dawn a dancer from Pittsburgh director Camus' obvious love for Rio and its people and the joyous rapturous unforgettable musical score.David Ehrenstein".

	schema:headline " Body in Dance and Heart in Love";
	schema:reviewBody "Rarely have we encountered movies like this one a timeless mythical story from Greece brought to screen in Brazilian context the couple come from the very heart of Brazilian society from Rio. Yet what links them is the same sweet feeling that have linked the people for thousands of years no matter what nationality beliefs or family background. Yes that is what BLACK ORFEUS offers undeniably. The great romance that bursts out in the magnificence and lavishness of Rio's carnival when truly body in dance combines with heart in love. Yet is that the only reason for calling this movie classic? As a matter of fact there have been lots of love stories on screen that were quickly forgotten. What is in fact the very uniqueness of BLACK ORFEUS that differs it from other movies and that makes it an interesting cinema production after all these years? We could say though ridiculous this may seem that it is everything about this movie that makes it a timeless work on screen. Yet such a generalized view may of course result in simplification and confusion. There are specifically two factors that make BLACK ORFEUS significant or still worth attention the first one aforementioned timeless love story uniquely and accurately put in the context of Brazil which in itself must have been a challenge due to its innovative nature but the task was beautifully crafted by the director the second being the cinematography of the movie which still after almost 50 years appears to be astounding. Those two aspects for many viewers constitute this everything. This enthusiasm may be compared to a beautiful painting you admire thanks to its exquisiteness. In the same way any film which has an interesting story and is visually stunning occurs to be an unforgettable work of art. And indeed BLACK ORFEUS is a lovely visual work the colors are stunning and the imagery is brilliant. The gorgeous views of Rio the beautiful moments of sunrise and the charming views of little houses overwhelm even the most cynical viewers. But what about the rest? Such aspects like performances or action cannot be analyzed in terms of modern cinema according to what we find in the majority of Hollywood productions. Acting is superb yet their evaluation is exposed to certain opinions that not necessarily occur consistent. These are all Brazilian actors many of whom are unexperienced when concerning grand cinema but this very fact appears to be beneficial for the film since their performances result in authenticity and freshness. You really have a feeling that you watch real people in the very circumstances of the carnival in Rio and their love is genuine. There is a perfect chemistry between Breno Mello as Orfeus and Marpessa Dawn as Eurydice. They beautifully fit to their roles and even their life stories proved that mysterious link. Consider that they both died the same year... Lourdes Oliveira gives rather a funny performance as Mira but is also memorable.IL ORFEU NEGRO is a very valuable film a sweet and authentic love story that will for long maintain in your memory as body in dance during the carnival and heart in love during romance. I highly recommend it hoping that like the song of Orfeus was capable of bringing sunrise to the world this movie will bring in many people the rise of quest for beauty and a profound admiration of tenderness. Only then we can find simple things unusual just like the little boy who perceived his kite as the beautiful sun.".

It's hard to say what aspect is best the cinematography is superb makes you want to take the first plane to Rio the cast is wonderful the music is haunting and beautiful and the OrpheusEurydice myth is well suited to the setting in a Rio favela. I've only seen it on video but I keep hoping it will be revived somewhere so I can catch it on the big screen!";

	schema:reviewBody "There are so many reasons Black Orpheus is important to cinema. First how many people know that prior to Marcel Camus making this film the late Orson Welles attempted to capture Rio Carnival but with no story plot or script? In 1942 Welles discovered voodoo was at the root of the carnival samba and started filming in the favelas the slum shanty towns on the hills of Rio...it was considered by Hollywood to be antiestablishment and dangerous by Brazilian authorities. Thus Welles was not able to complete his film.Samba is a Portuguese form of music the word was derived from the West African bantu word semba meaning invoke the spirit of the ancestors. Long outlawed as a dangerous expression of black slave culture samba music eventually gained legitimacy and became a big part of carnival.Nearly 20 years later Black Orpheus achieves what Welles was trying for and goes beyond it. To start Marcel Camus had a script to work from whereas Welles was trying to wing it on the spot. Camus successfully recreated the OrpheusEurydice myth using the Rio Carnival as the back drop. The main characters retain the mythological names including the symbolic Death. This works because it is AfroLatin culture where paganChristian names were more evident and because the Carnival itself was such an important part of the story. History manifests as a deja vu a cyclical progression of event and reincarnation understood only by the occultic transformation of samba trance and possession for which the Carnival is the engine.To those who misunderstand or are ignorant of samba voodoo or the Rio Carnival Black Orpheus may seem overwhelming especially because of all the singing and dancing but samba and Carnival is ritual in its most elementary form it is a raw cacophony of primitive drumming clapping chanting... and the droning cries of the dancers who stagger on the edge of the stage seeking possession and reincarnation.Black Orpheus won the Palm d'Or in 1959 at Cannes. It was seen as progressive because it featured black actors and the pluralist culture of modern Brazil. It also gives outsiders a view inside of a ritualistic nonWestern culture and that is why it was and is so important to cinema.".

There will be a day when you come From the strings of my guitar That only your love sought. A voice comes and talks about kissing Kisses lost in your lips. Sing my heart happiness is back In the dawn of this love. And so Orpheus Breno Mello a happygolucky trolley conductor in Rio de Janeiro and Eurydice Marpessa Dawn a young girl from the country who has come to stay with her cousin in a Rio slum high on a mountain overlooking the city fall in love. Please note that elements of the plot are discussed. Orpheus is handsome confident and loves women as much as they love him. When he discovers Eurydice however she becomes all he has ever wanted. But Eurydice caught up in her joy with Orpheus still is frightened of a man masked as Death who she is convinced intends to kill her. But carnival is starting. There are costumes to buy and masks to wear dancing to practice life to be enjoyed. Through it all the hot sensual bossa nova beat of Antonio Carlos Jobin's and Luis Bonfa's music permeates everything. The movie is so lyrical so innocent and so joyous as it starts that it's easy to hope that in this version of the Greek myth there will be a different ending. There is not. But the intensity of carnival carries us along. The happiness and spirit of the friends and neighbors of Orpheus captures us just as much as the music. The almost childlike passion of Orpheus and Eurydice is so open and true we realize that it can't last. One of the most lyrical passages is early in the movie when Orpheus begins to play on his guitar a song he has written. Two scruffy little boys are with him. They believe Orpheus can make the dawn come by playing his guitar at daybreak. As Orpheus plays one boy holds a baby goat and the other a rooster to keep them quiet. Morning such a pretty morning a new song is born... Orpheus sings. Next door Eurydice hears him and stops to listen. In that moment the myth becomes a real thing. And Orpheus after he and Eurydice have slept the night together sings another song while Eurydice dreams on... My happiness is dreaming in the eyes of my lover. It's like this night passing Seeking the dawn. Speak low please So she might wake up happy Offering a kiss of love. Sadness has no end. Happiness does. Happiness is like a drop of dew on a flower's petal Brilliant and tranquil then grieving Then falling like a tear of love. Then carnival arrives and so does Death. At the end of the movie Orpheus and Eurydice are joined for eternity. On the mountain top as dawn breaks the two little boys bring the new sun as one plays Orpheus' guitar and Orpheus' song ...Morning such a pretty morning. A new song is born... They are joined by a little girl dressed in white who begins to dance around them and they join her. At this point I didn't know whether to smile or cry. I think I did both.".

	schema:reviewBody "I know using the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice is considered an admirable things about this film but I thought it added nothing to the plot and in fact wrenched things about in ways that made parts of the film quite incomprehensible. We'll let pass the absurdity of the names that derived from the myth these Portuguesespeaking Brazilians with names like Orpheus Eurydice Hermes and dogs named Cerberus. That was bearable although it put the film slightly offkilter. The Orpheus and Eurydice myth really came into play near the end when Eurydice is lost and Orpheus searches desperately for her. When I was young and first saw this film not knowing the myth this section seemed like utter nonsense today I see the nonsense is there and I can see why because the film maker was willing to shoehorn his story into the myth no matter the consequences.The essence of the myth is Orpheus descending into the underworld to rescue his wife he plays his lyre so beautifully that no one can deny him not even the guardians of the underworld who allow him to lead Eurydice out of the underworld on condition he not look back at her until both are safely back in the world of light. Just as he himself steps out into the light he looks back too soon and Eurydice disappears from him forever. But what has that to do with the story in this film? The film is a modern realistic love story. In the climactic scene after Orfeus has searched everywhere for Eurydice he is taken to a crowded room where a voodoolike ceremony is under way. He is told to call for Eurydice if he wants to find her so he joins in the mass ritualistic song so quietly that his voice cannot be heard  quite a departure from the Greek myth. An old woman behind him appears to be possessed by a spirit and she speaks with the voice of Eurydice asking Orfeus if he loves her enough to be satisfied with her voice never to look on her again. He turns to see where the voice is coming from and all traces of Eurydice disappear. Now where is the sense in this in terms of the story we have watched up to this point? We've been following an entirely realistic love story for over 90 minutes in which the woman has gone missing and her lover has been searching desperately for her. Where has she gone? Has she died? Has she been kidnapped? No an old lady in a voodoo ceremony speaks with her voice. Huh? What's this about? She tells him he must not try to look at her. Say what? Why not? No reason it's just all nonsense. He turns to look and we are to believe that he will never find his lover again. Again we ask why not? Does this make any sense at all? No it doesn't except in so far that the realistic love story has been wrenched and mangled in order to fit in a rough sort of way the plot line of an old Greek myth.The film would have been far better off to provide a proper resolution to the situation one which fit with the realistic thisworld ethos of the rest of the movie. In my opinion the use of the myth interfered in a bad way with an otherwise interesting and enjoyable movie.".

This was directed by a Frenchman and although it is sympathetic to its subjects there's a tinge of condescension as well. This fades into the background as the plot kicks in.The film is a retelling of the Orpheus myth does the film achieve mythic power? Not quite but it comes a lot closer than you would be expecting from the beginning of the film. The film tries to answer the question of whether there is value in trying to be happy when happiness will be destroyed and what if anything is left when that happens. The words of the ultrafamous bossa nova song Tristeza 'sadness' asks and tries to answer this question as it recurs throughout the film.The acting is uneven but ultimately effective at convincing us of the emotions that matter most in this film love fear and loss. That the protagonists are physically beautiful helps them bear the burden of being mythfigures that and the fact that they don't try to act mythical.The film's use of the Orpheus myth is not at all subtle. But the performance of Mello as Orpheu gains depth as the character's dogged refusal to believe he has lost Eurydice carries him through the underworld of Rio in search of her. And I was moved by the ending as Orpheu tries to invoke the blessings of a new day to keep his hope and his love alive.I haven't seen another film quite like this one I think this is reason enough to see it. The music is great of course and it's interesting to see a Carnival of Rio back when it was still an event for ordinary people now it's an international tourist event. Enjoy!".

	schema:reviewBody "Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves is the kind of film that makes me proud to be a filmgoer and exceeds anything I could have possibly expected from the man who made Element of Crime. That film had some clever experimentation and so does this one but this film is the kind that's beauty and power echoes in your mind hours after you've watched it. This is a flabbergasting work of art that portrays a woman's quest to please God and does so with the complexity and emotional power of a Bergman film not to mention the fact that the film portrays a woman's intense suffering in world sternly ruled by men with the power of a Dreyer film. If von Trier made nothing else of any merit for the rest of his career if all he did was make marginally interesting film experiments I wouldn't hesitate to call him a great filmmaker on the soul basis of this film. Anyway you get the picture The film stars Emily Watson as Bess a shy and neurotic girl who is filled with joy to be with her new husband Jan Stellan Skarsgard who is exceptional. When Jan is paralyzed after an accident at the oilrig he works in he is in danger of losing his life. He convinces Bess to see other people and Bess wants nothing more than to make him happy and to prove to God that she loves him. After some disastrous complications Bess is led to believe that she can please God and save Jan's life by having numerous sexual encounters with strangers in town. This sounds like a grungy tale but von Trier tells it with such humanism and focus on his themes that we never feel like he is rubbing our faces in drear. And Watson is delightful frightening and heartbreaking as a woman who will stop at nothing to please those around her. Her onesided conversations with God in which she looks up in the air submissively and pleas and then looks down with a deep voice of wrath and scolds are both funny and sad not to mention the fact that they reveal seemingly endless amounts of details about who she is.

	onyx:emotionText "Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves is the kind of film that makes me proud to be a filmgoer and exceeds anything I could have possibly expected from the man who made Element of Crime. That film had some clever experimentation and so does this one but this film is the kind that's beauty and power echoes in your mind hours after you've watched it. This is a flabbergasting work of art that portrays a woman's quest to please God and does so with the complexity and emotional power of a Bergman film not to mention the fact that the film portrays a woman's intense suffering in world sternly ruled by men with the power of a Dreyer film. If von Trier made nothing else of any merit for the rest of his career if all he did was make marginally interesting film experiments I wouldn't hesitate to call him a great filmmaker on the soul basis of this film. Anyway you get the picture The film stars Emily Watson as Bess a shy and neurotic girl who is filled with joy to be with her new husband Jan Stellan Skarsgard who is exceptional. When Jan is paralyzed after an accident at the oilrig he works in he is in danger of losing his life. He convinces Bess to see other people and Bess wants nothing more than to make him happy and to prove to God that she loves him. After some disastrous complications Bess is led to believe that she can please God and save Jan's life by having numerous sexual encounters with strangers in town. This sounds like a grungy tale but von Trier tells it with such humanism and focus on his themes that we never feel like he is rubbing our faces in drear. And Watson is delightful frightening and heartbreaking as a woman who will stop at nothing to please those around her. Her onesided conversations with God in which she looks up in the air submissively and pleas and then looks down with a deep voice of wrath and scolds are both funny and sad not to mention the fact that they reveal seemingly endless amounts of details about who she is. The film is made with a handheld camera and a visually stunning solarized style. This style does not make the movie it just adds richness to each scene in the way it gives each face such shadowy texture. In the end von Trier seems to believe in God but does not believe in the churches that try to codify what he wants.

It is a crime that Watson didn't win Best Actress for this role though I imagine that many voters were turned off by the disturbing subject matter of this film.

	schema:reviewBody "Director and writer Lars von Trier's 1996 Breaking the Waves received much attention worldwide when initially released.  Commentary reflected the high degree of polarization this long engrossing and deeply disturbing Indie film created.  I saw it when it first briefly hit Manhattan theaters and last night I watched the DVD release reabsorbed in its intricacies.Emily Watson's portrayal as young Bess McNeill is the most powerful performance of a career still in the ascendancy.  Bess lives in a small Scottish village by the sea away from any center of culture or heterogeneity.  She has no job and she appears to volunteer her services as a janitor at the church which her family attends. It is the dominating religious social and  I suspect  political entity in the area.Bess has one friend a woman who becomes increasingly important both to her and the story nurse Dodo McNeill widowed wife of Bess's brother. Katrin Cartlidge a truly gifted and beautiful actress is Dodo.  A tragedy she died in 2002 of pneumonia barely into her forties.The movie begins with Bess asking apparently for permission to marry an outsider.  She receives in church grudging authorization to wed Jan a worker on an offshore oil rig the always interesting Stellan Skarsgard. We're never told how she met him but the church scene immediately and succinctly conveys the fear and indeed near loathing the male religious oligarchs have of anyone entering their closed and tightly controlled community.Jan and Bess wed in a ceremony followed by a party where some of Jan's hard drinking work pals attend but hardly mingle with the lemonadesipping locals there's a very funny chugalug competition that highlights the dividing lines neatly.Bess is not only a virgin she's never seen a naked man before.  Her initiation into sex is rather a success and her love for Jan deepens as rapidly as her new found lust for vigorous and frequent lovemaking.Jan suffers a near fatal accident on the rig and is flown back to hospital. It doesn't take long for the doctors to determine he's permanently paralyzed from the neck down.  Dr. Richardson Adrian Rawlins becomes chief physician not only to Jan but to his disconsolate wife who prays for a miraculous recovery while remaining devoted to her husband.What happens next is the plot twist that has fascinated many and repelled quite a few.  Jan knowing that physical intimacy with Bess is impossible asks her  no really implores her  to take on any number of lovers AND report back the details of her trysts.  After a hesitant and almost funny start she complies.  As her sex life accelerates any humor evaporates.The results of the ongoing experiment in vicarious lovemaking for Jan and for Bess sinking way beyond her depth are disastrous.  She slowly elides into a twisted caricature of the personality envisioned by Jan.  Communal rejection is not far off.  And this in a community where membership in the church is the sole indicium of civic and personal legitimacy.Some critics and viewers described Bess as retarded or simple from the beginning.  I found her to be naive and inexperienced the kind of sheltered person for whom marriage to a man of broad experience and unfettered sexuality is boundlessly liberating.  Bess's inevitable penance does not stem from any interior failing of her's. It's the game urged on by Jan that exposes her to the venomous wrath of religious fundamentalists whose innate need to condemn and consign to hell literally and volubly is beyond Jan's imagination.  Whether his desire that she engage in sexual escapades really reflected his belief that it would make him feel better or whether this was an evolving pathological caprice on his part and both views have strong adherents here on IMDb and elsewhere he did not foresee the resulting debacle.On several levels von Trier has mirrored through powerful acting and awesome direction that small closed society whose fundamentalist interiority is a microcosm of the hatred that blind nonhumanistic religion often brings it's easy to see the stern unsmiling dogmaobsessed church leader as a modern incarnation of the sixteenth century's John Knox of Edinburgh.Von Trier won't let Bess escape as her situation worsens. Dr. Richardson and Dodo first ask and then beg her to abandon her selfdestructive and now publicly shocking behavior.  There is a sense of classical tragedy in the painful unfolding of Bess's mental and physical deterioration.  She can't curtail her conduct because of her absolute devotion to Jan and her community can't and won't understand or forgive her.The resolution is wrenching but also uplifting with the suggestion that Bess's acts reflect good in a pristine sense.  It's not meant to be realistic but to deliver I felt a needed moral lesson.Breaking the Waves isn't for everyone. It does showcase brilliant acting and direction in a fable that has some very uncompromising arguments about a religious dominance which only concerns itself with a believed afterlife caring nothing about addressing the pains of living and administering to its sufferers compassionately.1010".

Lars von Trier is a very patient storyteller as well as being an eccentric movie maker. In Breaking the Waves he slowly very slowly unfolds his drama. The problem is you have to pay careful attention and this can be difficult. Von Trier's style with its handheld camera lack of artificial lighting grainy photography and lingering closeups can try the patience. The movie is also long clocking in at about 2 hours. But if you see it through the final half hour will blow your mind and you will have seen one of the best and most emotionally powerful movies of 1996 maybe even the whole decade.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a pity that for most people Lars von Trier's involvement with the Dogme group of film makers is the main thing they know about him. Wherever you stand on the Dogme issue personally I'm all for it as long as they continue to make movies as great as 'Festen' and 'The Idiots' his brief alliance with the group has overshadowed amazing work like 'Element Of Crime' 'Europa' and 'Breaking The Waves'. 'Breaking The Waves' was made before the Dogme manifesto was formulated but it can be seen as a step in that direction with its use of documentary techniques as opposed to the flamboyant and highly stylized approach of von Trier's earlier films. To me the ends justifies the means and the bottom line is that this is an extraordinary and powerful movie one of the greatest of the last ten years. The main reason it is so remarkable is because of the devastating performance of Emily Watson one of the most impressive screen debuts in the history of film. Watson plays Bess McNeill a naive and odd young woman living in a remote and deeply religious  Scottish community. She is so good in this movie she'll leave you speechless! Stellan Skarsgard a most underrated actor in my opinion'Insomnia' 'Ronin' plays Bess's husband and is also superb and the supporting cast includes the late Katrin Cartlidge 'Naked' as Watson's sisterinlaw and von Trier regulars JeanMarc Barr almost unrecognizable from his leading role in 'Europa' as one of Skarsgard's work buddies and cult legend Udo Kier 'Flesh For Frankenstein' 'The Story Of O' in a cameo as a very nasty piece of work who Bess has the misfortune to encounter. The less you know about this movie the more powerful it will be and even a jaded cynic like myself was surprised at how effective its spiritual theme was. To me 'Breaking The Waves' is a much better more than von Trier's better known 'Dancer In The Dark' and Watson's performance makes Bjork's look like that of an enthusiastic but not very talented amateur which of course is exactly what she is. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dogville is one of my alltime favourite films and the most disturbing film I've ever seen. I've wanted to see Breaking the Waves in quite a while and recently I finally had the chance. Now I can't say which one is better. What a heartbreaking experience. Emily Watson had one of the best film debuts ever and this is probably the most accomplished female performance I've seen since Julianne Moore in The Hours. Actually if I had to list 3 favourite female performances now I'd mention Watson Moore and Isabelle Huppert in The Piano Teacher. Lars von Trier has a special talent to direct women just remember Nicole Kidman's and Bjrk's remarkable performances in Dogville and Dancer in the Dark respectively.Breaking the Waves tells the story of the pure Bess McNeill Watson and her unconditional love for Jan Nyman Stellan Skarsgrd who is paralyzed after an accident at the oilrig he works in. Then Jan convinces Bess to have sex with other men and tell him the details of the sexual encounters so he won't forget how to do it. Bess is determined to make Jan happy and to prove to God that she loves him but she soon loses control of her actions. The storyline might sound absurd but Von Trier isn't a joker and he takes us into a devastating journey. Katrin Cartlidge 19612002 an extremely gifted actress Naked Before the Rain Claire Dolan Career Girls TopsyTurvy and No Man's Land who died too young delivers a captivating discreet supporting performance as Dodo Bess' loving sisterinlaw.I'd say Breaking the Waves and Dogville are opposite masterpieces Waves being about love and goodness Dogville being about hatred and evil among other things of course nothing's easy or simple in Von Trier's universe. Both films are extremely dark and hard to watch but Waves shows that Von Trier has faith in mankind. His detractors like to label him as a cynical atheist but Breaking the Waves definitely proved me the opposite. Von Trier made a poignant epic about the struggle of an innocent goodhearted woman who wants to do what God wants her to do or at least what she thinks He wants her to do and make her husband happy  even if she has to sacrifice herself for that. It's a leap of faith both for Bess and the watcher who's got to decide if he's ready for such an experience. I wasn't disappointed at all. 10 out of 10.".

Then Jan convinces Bess to have sex with other men and tell him the details of the sexual encounters so he won't forget how to do it. Bess is determined to make Jan happy and to prove to God that she loves him but she soon loses control of her actions. The storyline might sound absurd but Von Trier isn't a joker and he takes us into a devastating journey. Katrin Cartlidge 19612002 an extremely gifted actress Naked Before the Rain Claire Dolan Career Girls TopsyTurvy and No Man's Land who died too young delivers a captivating discreet supporting performance as Dodo Bess' loving sisterinlaw.I'd say Breaking the Waves and Dogville are opposite masterpieces Waves being about love and goodness Dogville being about hatred and evil among other things of course nothing's easy or simple in Von Trier's universe. Both films are extremely dark and hard to watch but Waves shows that Von Trier has faith in mankind. His detractors like to label him as a cynical atheist but Breaking the Waves definitely proved me the opposite. Von Trier made a poignant epic about the struggle of an innocent goodhearted woman who wants to do what God wants her to do or at least what she thinks He wants her to do and make her husband happy  even if she has to sacrifice herself for that. It's a leap of faith both for Bess and the watcher who's got to decide if he's ready for such an experience. I wasn't disappointed at all. 10 out of 10.";

	schema:headline " Gritty sequel to Dreyer's Ordet";
	schema:reviewBody "Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves stars Emily Watson as Bess McNiell a young woman who lives in a strict Calvanist village. Bess spends her days working at a local church talking to God and slipping in and out of various delusions. Because she has an unspecified mental illness Bess also believes that she is a sinner who must constantly pay penance unto the Lord.One day Bess meets Jan an offshore oil worker. The village doesn't welcome Jan but Bess does. Eventually Bess and Jan get married but Jan has an accident and is rendered paralysed. Blaming herself for Jan's injury Bess sacrifices herself by giving her body to vicious sailors. She lets them rape and cut her flesh an act of selfsacrifice which Bess believes will result in a miracle which heals Jan of his paralysis.The film climaxes with Bess stumbling into Jan's hospital room her body bloody and torn. She hopes her husband has been miraculously cured. He has. Bess dies in the room next to his saved body.The local pastor believes Bess to be an unholy and sinful girl and so he prepares a funeral in which she is to be consigned to hell. The night before the funeral however Jan steals Bess's body from the morgue and gives her a secret burial at sea. When her body hits the ocean giant bells ring in the heavens above. The audience recalls an earlier scene in which it is explained that the local church forbid the use of bells.So what we have here is essentially a Christ allegory. The crazy Christian who is humble and meek the film's seven chapters the corrupt local church the public stoning the personal sacrifice the miracle the crucifixion the grave robbing and resurrection are all fairly well known stories in the New Testament.The film's message ultimately amounts to the same as Dreyer's Ordet a film which director Lars Von Trier cites as his favourite film of all time. Waves says only the innocent are able to have steadfast faith in God a fact which will make them seem mad in the eyes of both unbelievers and those who hold dogmatically to tradition. Like Dreyer's film we also have a doctor who learns to put aside the rationality of science and blindly embrace faith. The film teaches us the power of sacrifice faith submission and personal suffering and says that physical love has healing life giving powers.In other words it's a bunch of Christian propaganda shut up be a child and do as told. In reality Bess is caught between two patriarchal paradigms the virgin and the whore. She is a victim sacrificed on the altar of patriarchy by a sadistic husband and cruel God. On the plus side the film goes further than Ordet in that it carefully examines the social conditions existing around Bess. It suggests  perhaps unintentionally  that women will continue to pay with their lives for the sins of their fathers unless truly revolutionary social alterations and religious reformations are made.Unsurprisingly Martin Scorsese cites Waves as one of his favourite films. Its blend of religion and sadism as well as its false badge of realism aligns itself firmly with Scorsese's own world view. And where Scorsese's Raging Bull seems designed around the stations of the cross Waves offers seven stylish chapter cards each accompanied by a memorable song. These songs are themselves fairly symbolic indirectly referencing Virgins Holy Marys unconditional love crucification and blind hope. The film's first song All the Way from Memphis is used in a similar fashion by Scorsese in Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore whilst the rest of the song selections have a rock and roll feel which would feel right at home in Scorsese's filmography.But perhaps the most interesting thing about Breaking the Waves is its visual style. Von Trier uses hand held 8mm cameras and pretends to stick close to the principles of Dogme 95. The result is that the film has a superficially realistic and voyeuristic feel. Such a raw and gritty film caused quite a commotion when it was initially released but this style has now been absorbed and digested by countless big budget Hollywood productions to the extent that Breaking the Waves has lost much of its bite. The gore unflattering lighting film grain and shaky camera now feel less like an attempt to uphold the rules of Dogme 95 than a manipulative aesthetic itself.And on another level isn't it ironic that a film which tries so hard to fake reality would be so obsessively concerned with attacking rationality? That a film which pretends to adhere to the principles of Dogme 95 would itself be about religious dogmas? Still you want visceral drama you get visceral drama. Emily Waton like Jesus in Mel Gibson's Passion of Christ puts herself through hell to move your soul. Bless the poor girl.710  Worth one viewing.".

Von Trier's dogmatic style of filming with shaky handheld cameras lots of intimate closeups and a gritty texture to the stock that actually makes it look like a film from the early 70's irked me on some level but then I loved the chapter breaks with the striking widescreen vistas of scenic wonders accompanied by pop music from the 70's.  It was all mildly interesting and a bit strange which is always good and when Beth made her huge sacrifice I didn't quite know what to make of it all it all being so grim and emotionally draining.  And then the end one little scene reminded me that this was not supposed to be some gritty piece of character drama but a work of art and suddenly I lit up at the sight and sound of the last scene and it all made sense Beth made sense in a surreal way and it was all so wonderful and tragic and wholly satisfying.  Von Trier had given me a totally unique cinematic experience and whether or not I liked the film had become moot. It had affected me like no other film before and that is the highest remark any work or art could hope for.".

What she brings to the role of the naive Scottish girl offers a clinic on superlative acting that could humble veterans with ten times the experience.  Another thing that makes this film so special is that it never backs away from its vivid and mature examination of love commitment and aspects of the metaphysical.  I easily class this work as one of the top films of the 1990s.  Director Lars von Trier is a true visionary and the largely handheld cinematography by Robby Muller perfectly defines the tone of the film  in fact the theatre where I saw Breaking the Waves posted a disclaimer that warned anyone who suffers from motion or seasickness to see the film at their own peril!".

	schema:reviewBody "Emotional power is one of the most difficult and complex aspects of filmmaking to succeed in. Very few films can manage to be emotionally destructive while still retaining the viewer's concentration and dedication to the piece. Yet Breaking the Waves is a film that holds more emotionally power that most films it is not a film you will want to see again. One viewing is enough at least for a long period of time. Bearing in mind you will feel devastated by the film's selfdestructive nature and after viewing such an unforgettable story of heart ache and sadness you will have etched into the back of your mind.Breaking the Waves is a complicated story it is one that studies love regret guilt madness and religion. Breaking the Waves is set in a small religious town deep in Scotland and tells the sorrowful story of the innocent Bess Emily Watson and her lover Jan Stellan Skarsgaard. Jan becomes paralysed in a freak accident at the oilrig he is working on and asks his estranged wife Bess to have sex with other men and then tell him what it was like to keep their relationship stable.Lars Von Trier the founder of Dogme filmmaking creates a drama that remains in a league of its own. Though Breaking the Waves is not Dogme filmmaking like The Idiots it still has elements of Dogme filmmaking style littered around it. The film is separated into chapters which work as wonderful mood and symbolic transitions. These sequences are a single shot focusing on something that is considerably impressive with the added touch of a brilliantly chosen song to fit the mood. The film's general direction is one that feels like it has been shot with a handheld style.The film studies many questionable elements of life including topics such as death terminal illness spirituality emotions and hypocrisy in religion. These are just a view of the talking points that crop up throughout the long runningtime. The film asks the viewer questions and most importantly tests how much harrowing devastation you can handle. There is no denying just how pure Breaking the Waves is.Emma Watson gives a career defining performance with her pitiful role of a naive young woman who just wants to be free from pain. The performance is very painful to watch because it is so unbearably realistic. You become apart of her journey and watch her emotions and sanity spiral out of control even from the people who love her. Heartbreaking in every way.Breaking the Waves is a difficult film and one that is not for everyone though I say it is a film which deserves the critical acclaim it gets.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves is undoubtedly one of the most impressive films of recent years I have delayed commenting on it until now as my feelings about it are far from clear.  Certainly it has an arresting quality that held me in a vicelike grip for nearly three hours  no mean achievement as generally once over the twohour threshold one is looking for the scissors.  But no it has a mesmerising quality that reminds me of Dreyer's Ordet at times.  Both are set in remote communities and deal with religious concepts which even for a semibeliever remain difficult to comprehend in the case of Dreyer the miracle of a resurrection and here the hint at something similar in a final scene I will not reveal. Both films have a supposedly mentally unstable central character a young man who talks as Christ in Ordet while Bess the young woman in Breaking the Waves talks to God who answers her in her own voice's deepest register. Bess falls in lave with Jan an oilrig worker and the early scenes chart their wedding.  When Jan has to return to the oilrig the distraught Bess prays to God for his return a prayer that is answered ironically when he returns paralysed from the neck down after an accident on the rig.  How Bess lives with this situation is the subject of the second and third hours of the film.  These have at times an almost unbearable intensity and at one point where a group of         children taunt Bess we are in deepest Mouchette country.  It is one of those very rare films where I feel the use of a handheld camera to be completely justified as it gives extraordinarily emotional events a frenetic immediacy.  However by punctuating the action with chapter headings set against long held landscape stills moments of an almost trancelike repose are achieved between each onslaught on the senses.  Whether the film is anything more than a quirky tale of sexual derangement bordering on morbidity is something that two viewings have left me uncertain about.  That I have compared it to Dreyer and Bresson is evidence that it is not a work to be ignored but at the moment I have a gut reaction that there is more than a hint of sensationalism here that somewhat diminishes its artistic integrity when set beside the work of the earlier masters.".

It is surprising how gripping the film is as it is difficult to watch not just because of the subject matter but also because of its style. Made by the conventions of Dogme '95 the film has many extreme closeups generally shaky camerawork and errors in continuity for editing and audio levels all of which is supposed to amount to a film that looks and feels more realistic. With this film though the quality of the acting and writing provide enough realism alone and therefore the style serves no purpose other than to make the film more difficult to digest. It is an incredibly long film and while this is not too much of a problem the chapter markers are noticeably long without much reason either. Still the film comes through despite its detracting bits.

Lars von Trier is the worst kind of director the kind that thinks it's his job to incite and provoke his audience and that movies must be unendurable if they are to say anything that matters.

	schema:reviewBody "Although Breaking the Waves is interesting in many aspects like the beautiful cinematography by Robby Mller Paris Texas it is the story that has the most staying power. Von Trier's movies have a tendency to watch like literature and the division in chapters presents the first comparison. The static shots with their slowly changing picture as introduction to each chapter foreshadow the story in a nutshell for example the large village shot against the background of the small boat Bess uses to make her sacrifice or the changing of the light in the flow of the river indicating a passing.Set in a close strongly religious community it tells many stories The most important is the destruction of an individual by that community that use the Bible to maintain control over its inhabitants. The ultimate punishment of abandonment is used to spread fear. One of the best scenes is at the wedding party One of Jan's friends empties his glass in one one of the elders does the same Jan's friend breaks a plastic glass the elder responds by breaking his glass resulting in a bleeding hand this scene already stating the length the elders will go to maintain their power over the community. As Bess later returns to the church for consolation she is only rejected by even her own parents.It all watches like a Greek tragedy with biblical proportions Bess has to make the ultimate sacrifice become a prostitute and die for it to rescue her husband Jan from his death. As Bess is the only true believer in the movie only her prayers are answered. Note that none of the elders or the sailors on the boat Bess visits has proper names. And the story has more angles A feminist one as the community is lead by men that disallow women to speak. And a deep distrust for the medical practice more obvious in Von Trier's Riget  The Kingdom a mustsee by the way as Dr. Richardson only adds to the misery. I found the end shot somewhat redundant and naive it is not the kind of shot present in Solyaris for example that questions the whole movie.Von Trier is able to direct actresses in a way that their performance sticks to you weeks after you have seen the movie here with Emily Watson. There is a parallel between the sacrifices Bess has to make for Jan and the sacrifices Von Trier demands from Emily Watson exposing her bare essentials and personality in front of the camera.Breaking the Waves is a slow and overlong movie It doesn't need 2  hours to tell its story. But it still makes an overwhelming impression by acting and story.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lars von Trier is a director whose name I've heard almost incessantly through the years but whose work I've just now arrived at. After seeing this film I'm not what you'd call encouraged. All I knew beforehand is that it contained some minor detail on offshore drilling something of a personal interest and featured Emily Watson an actress I much admire. Both turned out to be the highpoints of a film that is overlong all pretension and no profundity.Most audiences know there are appreciable subtleties when it comes to performances framing by the camera and the editing. They know some directors can deliver a cogent message from only these three devices instead of relying on insistent music cues or excessive dialogue. Most audiences prefer this method because it seems less cloying more sophisticated. And it's a skill von Trier utilizes. There is music here but only during pointless title cards that break the narrative into segments. There may have been background music in the wedding that opens the film but I'd have to take another look to be sure. The story's delivery however depends almost entirely upon Watson what she does what she says or doesn't say how she inflects.Her character's name is Bess and an alert viewer is aware that this woman is seriously mentally ill. She has been oppressed all her life by her parents and by their community all of them beholden to the Calvinist church. She talks to God a lot a onesided conversation though she goes a step further than is usual in the movies by composing His responses and projecting aloud His contralto voice. I applaud Watson for how successfully she imparts the damaged psyche of this woman. She conveys total disintegration without selfconscious expressions or gestures that would have distanced the actress from her character. Another actress may have been compelled to do that to play against the blunt harshness of the material.But the other characters are far less developed. Their existence is kept at the rote level of the screenplay to provide various foils for Bess's brainsickness. Okay but to what end? First there is her husband Jan a roughneck who suffers his own mental damage after an accident on an oil rig leaves him paralyzed. Consequently he implores his wife to sleep with other men and tell him about it afterward. It will aid his recovery. This request understandably mortifies her even after she relents. Then there's the doctor and nurse the latter is an inlaw who take care of Jan. Both of them try to talk sense into Bess but something in their manners suggest not concern so much as the deluded ramblings of clinical hypocrites people who are as compromised in their own way. The essential conflict in their relationship with Bess is that they just don't get her i.e. the value of her faith. All she wants is to help her husband. She is nave and emotionally fractured but her intentions are inherently good. That's all that matters in the end.Thanks in part to naturalistic camerawork by Robbie Muller and the way it lingers on the seedy details of this frigid Scottish countryhow it connotes a slice of life qualityvon Trier does a skillful job of keeping us offbalance for much of the film's first half. We think we're in an objective more or less realistic drama and only gradually clued in as to the simpleminded parable he's building towards.Sure you can argue for the absence of overt moralizing that it's all relative etc. But look again there is a definite objective. Everything is posed. It is all in the performances in the closeups of Watson. What von Trier has done is to communicate a message almost exclusively through his performers and that message is reprehensible. The vagueness which continues to permeate the story till near its conclusion is not the ambiguity of life but a coy obfuscation by the storyteller. I was constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop. When it finally happens it doesn't just dropit plummets and cracks the ground.In the final shot high above the rig platform when heaven's bells begin to ring for Bess's sacrifice my stomach turned. Few images are as hokey. What a downer also to celebrate the selfdestruction of a young woman whose death resulted from the oppression she suffered that denied her the exercise of mental faculties she needed in order to understand and cope with life. Yes that is something to celebrate. To look upon Bess with sympathy and reflect on her end with regret for her malady is not good enough. For von Trier it merits celebration. That tells me something rather sordid about him and it's more disturbing than any of the film's merely prurient aspects.I don't think I'll be going on any more adventures with this guy. Not anytime soon.Rating 1 out of 4".

	schema:reviewBody "There had not been a lot of movies I'd seen in a very long time where the act of embracing one's faith in a greater power and an unselfish allencompassing belief in unconditional love and trust were so vividly and powerfully portrayed. CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON so invests its characters with these traits that I thought I would never see another film to rival it in this respect. I was sadly mistaken.Neither Emily Watson or Stellan Skarsgard are as conventionally attractive as the kind of actors you would find in a big budget Hollywood production. Yet in their love scenes as Jan and Bess I believe we get our very first glimpse on film of what sex between two people is meant to be as the Man Upstairs intended not something dirty or vile or wanton or anything as icily clinical as the conditions prescribed by Mother Church but as a gift to us to be enjoyed and therefore in turn the greatest gift that any one person can give to another as a sign of love and affection. That alone makes Skarsgard and Watson two of the sexiest most passionate actors ever to make love on screen they invest that much into Jan and Bess. I very nearly cried when Bess tells Jan in the throes of passion Thank you. So deep tender and uncalculating is her love for him that he can't help but return it. Few of us will ever know a love of that capacity or intensity in our lifetimes.Which is what makes this film's conceit easier to accept and that much harder to bear. In these hard and cynical times it would be easy to dismiss Bess as a feebleminded idiot and have done with it. Had director Von Trier seen her story in that way this would've been a pretty short film.But when our love for another and our faith is all we have no matter how misguided it is no one has the right to question or debunk it no matter how wellmeaning they are. I don't think that Bess' fate could've been altered or avoided no matter how her husband's doctor her mother or her sisterinlaw Dodo had tried to approach the situation. Her love for Jan and her faith in God are what simultaneously nourished sustained uplifted and destroyed her. At the end she was afraid that maybe she had made a mistake investing herself in making the ultimate sacrifice and maybe that's what Von Trier was trying to say with that ending which I'm sure turned off a lot of viewers. If the sacrifices you make are in quest of such love and spirituality then you can never be wrong.That's a heady message and a dangerous one if it is taken out of context. But for those who would condemn this film I can only say this you're not paying attention. BREAKING THE WAVES is a film about a woman fallen into promiscuity the same way that BOOGIE NIGHTS is about a bunch of sleazy pornographers. If you're only looking at the surface you shouldn't be questioning the content but your own lack of vision.".

	onyx:emotionText "There had not been a lot of movies I'd seen in a very long time where the act of embracing one's faith in a greater power and an unselfish allencompassing belief in unconditional love and trust were so vividly and powerfully portrayed. CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON so invests its characters with these traits that I thought I would never see another film to rival it in this respect. I was sadly mistaken.Neither Emily Watson or Stellan Skarsgard are as conventionally attractive as the kind of actors you would find in a big budget Hollywood production. Yet in their love scenes as Jan and Bess I believe we get our very first glimpse on film of what sex between two people is meant to be as the Man Upstairs intended not something dirty or vile or wanton or anything as icily clinical as the conditions prescribed by Mother Church but as a gift to us to be enjoyed and therefore in turn the greatest gift that any one person can give to another as a sign of love and affection. That alone makes Skarsgard and Watson two of the sexiest most passionate actors ever to make love on screen they invest that much into Jan and Bess. I very nearly cried when Bess tells Jan in the throes of passion Thank you. So deep tender and uncalculating is her love for him that he can't help but return it.

I wish I could say that this was a great work of art but it is not. It is a sad very sad commentary on the madness of human beings a twentieth century 'tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing.' Particularly depressing were the church fathers in their beards and their stupidity. And be forewarned the sexuality is degrading and the very essence of human love is willfully and repeatedly perverted.In making this movie Director Lars von Trier no doubt sought a kinship with the tragedies of Shakespeare and the Greeks in which the fates destroy the protagonist because of a socalled 'fatal flaw' a flaw the protagonist cannot help. Bess's fatal flaw was her childlike nature twisted by circumstance. In the great tragedies the essential purpose is to bring the audience through its involvement and its identification with the protagonist to a catharsis a catharsis that cleanses the emotions and allows us to see the world as it really is free of selfdelusion. But Von Trier's bizarre and pathetic ending with those ridiculous bells in the sky was closer to bathos than anything else and steered us not toward catharsis but into a kind of emotional limbo where not even emptiness is felt.".

The European movie landscape already heavily smeared and infested by petentious selfdelusional selfindulgent pointless vapid and narcissistic European movie critics and filmmakers had accepted into its elite ranks yet another leftwing charlatan posing as an artist who knows exactly what he's talking about.This is undoubtedly one of the most insipid dramaslove stories ever made. It's too stupid for words but I'll give it a try. This is a unique chance for words to try to prove to me that they CAN live up to the ultimate challenge by describing an atrocity of this magnitude.The very idea that Skarsgard would suggest to Hysteria Watson that she live out sexual adventures for her own good while pretending that it's for his own as well can only come from the mind of a hateful lunatic.The fact that Hysteria is doing everything in this movie as a sacrifice to God can only come from the mind of a religious lunatic who adores God but makes movies that make him look like a Satanist. God is portrayed here as a merciless tyrant a sadist a gleeful torturer of innocent people and a Very Grumpy Being bent on wrecking people's lives for no apparent reason at all.This becomes apparent through Hysteria's conversations with God which at first seem just schizophrenic and those hilarious bells at the end of the movie  which signify God's approval of all the events that transpired. Or maybe the bells were God's way of saying When is this damn piece of crap going to finally end?! The only conclusion left for me from the laughable endofmoviebells fkup Trier's God is very happy that he made Hysteria go through Hell and then die a violent death so that her hubby can walk again. Of course never mind the fact that it was Trier's God in the first place who intentionally crippled Skarsgard just to annoy Hysteria and punish her for being in love with him so much that she wanted him to come back to her.Hence we also have to conclude Trier's God was unhappy with Hysteria's deeply committed love towards Skarsgard so when she prayed for his return he decided to punish her for being in love! We further conclude Trier's God is deeply offended by love between a man and a woman and rewards Hysteria's prayer to Him that her hubby return  by ruining her life and driving her to suicide. And then bells bells oh them sweetsounding bells! Hallelujah! Trier must be deranged and his capacity for logical thinking severely damaged IF it ever existed in the first place. That much is certain.Anyone who actually enjoyed this movie  let alone finds it touching  is without a grain of a doubt a total well you can guess what comes here. Those people who believe in God and still like the movie and aren't offended by it they are the biggest youknowwhats of them all.Trier has a very confused mind and he makes movies for other confused minds. It's as simple as that. How fitting that his next movie was The Idiots an ultradull affair lacking both intelligence and wit. Worse yet he is an untalented filmmaker. BTW has an awful ugly look a combination of brown and yellow if Trier wanted the film to look like diarrhoea  well he certainly succeeded in that. The handheld camera which is nearly always a pathetic and unoriginal attempt at creating heavyhanded artistic realism swings left and right back and forth up and down as though it were held by one of Trier's drunken Danish sailor characters. Very annoying. I got dizzy quite frankly watch this piece of art.Emily Watson is utterly annoying overthetop and makes grimaces that have to be seen to be believed. Jim Kerrey must be dying of envy. Her overacting is out of control it makes her seem beyond insane. She comes off as a drugged alien hiding in the body of an overrated British actress. I will definitely have to avoid her other movies. I just can't get that dumb face out of my head...Other silly details 1 when Skarsgard's friend sees the bells in the sky he first gets Skarsgard to look at the radar before showing them to him very very stupid.2 The town's elders priests gather on Hysteria's funeral to express their desires that she burn in Hell! Now in what Western 20thcentury religion does a priest go to a funeral to send the dead person to Hell?! Outrageously stupid. There are far nore intelligent and more subtle ways for Trier to display his hatred? for clergy andor organized religion.There is plenty more nonsense but frankly my mind has probably subconsciously blocked out half of the crap in order to protect itself from permanent damage so if you want a complete list of the ridiculous goingson in this film find a more detailed review or  if you dare  watch it yourself.This moronic little film certainly didn't break any waves but for unfathomable reasons it made some especially among many uncritical viewers and selfloathing critics.Lars didn't tire of utilising his pointless martyrdom theme hence Dancer In The Dark which is possibly even dumber.".

The set decoration and cinematography are a throwback to the old 40's movies which is ironic because those movies are mentioned throughout the film Griffith's character is a huge fan of war movies that were shown at that time. If you like great romantic stories with just enough action thrown in watch this one. You will not be disappointed.".

Joely Richardson plays a complicated character who provides some interesting plot points. Melanie who isn't known for subtlety gives a rich and layered performance especially in the development of the romantic storyline. Michael Douglas is a bit over the top playing the stolid soldier and unlikely spy to the hilt. Liam Neeson is amazingly handsome and charismatic  despite playing for the other side as a top Nazi officer. It's a fun recreation of the 1940s romancewarspy dramas  exciting and definitely romantic.

	schema:reviewBody "Though I never read the book personally I feel that this is an overly criticized and highly under rated movie. It's been awhile since I saw it so forget all the plot intricacies but do recall enjoying this wartime romance at the time. As others have noted it is definitely more a love story than a spy thriller. Also I was sufficiently impressed with the performances by all three leads but especially Liam Leeson.The plot revolves around an American spy master Ed Leland who reluctantly sends his secretary Linda Voss on a dangerous mission to Berlin refusing to admit to himself that he has feelings for her personally. Voss is sent to spy on a high level German army officer named Dietrich being deemed suitable for the task because she speaks fluent German. This secretary is half Jewish herself and part of her motivation is actually to find some of her relatives who are in hiding. She thus goes undercover into Nazi Germany as a secretary turned spy with little training in survival or espionage. However she is a great fan of old spy movies and has gleaned a few tips! Perhaps the plot is not that plausible but the same charge could be laid against any number of other movies. This is mainly a romance and a highly entertaining one.Melanie Griffith is charming here in the role of Linda Voss. She is not a dumb blonde bimbo nor does she even appear to be. Quite the contrary. Some have complained about her German but I was interested in the story and no expert on her accent. Michael Douglas competently portrays the American spy Leland. Whether or not it is believable that someone in his position cannot speak a word of German he has a very credible chemistry with Griffith. Liam Neeson is especially excellent playing with dignity and charisma the complex role of the sensitive but potentially ruthless Nazi officer and devoted family man. Sir John Gielgud the ultimate professional is masterful as always and commands any scene in which he appears.I confess that I'm a sucker for wartime romances love the drama of that era as well as the 1940's styles so would lap up just about any representative of the genre. While this one may not be a classic it is a good love story with some gripping action tension and suspense. As another also noted though it may indeed be highly improbable it is nevertheless highly watchable.".

She tells her story in flashback an old woman relating her adventures to a BBC documentary crew.Griffith is improbable as the shrewd resourceful bilingual Linda. Her 'allAmerican girl' style of delivery is grating and inappropriate. Michael Douglas as Ed Leland makes a passable spy hero but his character's unwillingness to learn the German language doesn't make any kind of sense given that he spends most of his working life strutting around Berlin in a Nazi uniform.  Sir John Gielgud plays 'Sunflower' 'our' agent in Berlin.  Gielgud goes through the motions as Gielgud usually does without acting at all.  Otto Dietrich the highranking Nazi is played fairly convincingly and with dignity by Liam Neeson.  Joely Richardson is reasonable even if her character Margrete von Everstein is a welter of illthoughtout nonsense.David Seltzer wrote and directed this rather lame thriller and packed it with historical inaccuracies and implausible plot points.  The teenage Linda is asked in the course of her job interview to stand and give a twirl so that the men can get a look at her.  She refuses on feminist grounds. This is simply unbelievable and shows a complete lack of sympathy for the mores and attitudes of a historical period which doesn't happen to be the present day.Cliche bogs this movie down and robs it of any sense of freshness or vitality that it might have had.  For no very good reason we get a sombre 'Pearl Harbor' moment even though America's entry into the war is irrelevant to the plot.  Espionage in Germany means that the German and spymovie stereotypes have to be trotted out so apfel strudel schnapps and the microfilming of secret documents all find their way into the story. Nazi border guards just have to have slavering alsatian dogs.Part of the film's problem is a clumsy script which contains some horribly clunking lines.  Such mouthfuls as What 's a war for if not to hold onto what we love? grate on the ear.  The German security forces are referred to in heavyhanded purple prose as Hitler's dreaded stormtroopers.Continuing the run of blatant improbabilities Sunflower and Linda board a German train and immediately start discussing Drescher in English  two mindboggling lapses in security.  And would Sunflower use the polite 'ihre' form when addressing a workingclass girl?In order to give the plot some dramatic contours events are introduced which could never have happened in real life.  The film sacrifices credibility for the sake of a cheap shot.The finale at the border crossing is too silly to merit criticism.".

Melanie Griffith is wonky in a delightful way. The forties flavour in both the US and Germany is tremendously well executed.And theres some really good action and suspense. Would a high ranking German officer take a servant to the opera? Hardly. Would the Gestapo phone first? Don't think so. Nor would the events of the closing scenes have happened on the wartime Swiss border. The Swiss were very much on the knife's edge. They avoided provoking the Germans and any Allied combatants who found their way to Switzerland were interned for the duration. Of course the movie never says they were not. But what the heck. I gave it an 8 because it was well produced and very well filmed The Nazi parade was superbly done. And in that opera scene they even had a ringer for the late Herbert Von Karajan. Interesting they used his name. After the war Von Karajan never advertised the fact he had hobnobbed with the Nazis. I loved Griffith and admire Douglas and even though I knew I shouldn't have enjoyed it I did. So there!".

This was not a low budget film so hiring an historical adviser would surely have been a justifiable added cost. As it is Shining Through comes close to being as implausible as any Star Trek film.

Melanie Griffith is inept in her role as a wouldbe spy in Nazi Germany. With her character's stupidity and embarrassingly unconvincing command of the German language she would not have lasted a halfhour before being discovered by the Gestapo and sent back in a boxcar to Hollywood. Michael Douglas's performance was good during the first part of the film but his heroic rescue of Linda Voss was implausible in the extreme almost laughably so. It was a miscalculation to have Linda narrate the story in a long series of flashbacks as we in the audience were consigned to feel no threat whatsoever to her survival. And why do the native Germans speak in subtitled German for much of the film but then revert to English in other parts? That strains our suspension of disbelief. Worst of all a spy thriller should never be as boring as Shining Through. I had trouble staying awake which surely is not a good sign.".

There are few films where the music becomes another character of the film but Shining Through is one of them. The Last of the Mohicans and Memoirs of a Geisha are some other films where the music is so wonderful.

Drama loses its impact when one isn't presented with a situation that one cannot imagine oneself involved in. The same could be said for anachronisms in historical drama but in this area the director is responsible and Shining Through actually scored pretty well in this area I didn't see any obvious clues that the story was filmed 40 odd years after the fact.In addition to the implausible screenplay the acting was weak especially Melanie Griffith. She just isn't the strongest actor in the world. In the right roles she can be enjoyable to watch and she is certainly one of the most attractive people out there but this role required an acting ability she just doesn't have. Michael Douglas on the other hand is a fine actor  just caught in a real dumb movie. The throat gag is so ludicrousAnyway this is a 310 if ever I saw one.

Thank goodness it's finally out on DVD in the U.S.It has stoic performances by Douglas and Griffith which is not out of place for the setting and time period and as a stylistic approach works very well in this sometimes melancholy story about how complex life can be and how difficult it is for everything to work out in the end. I really enjoyed the fact that almost no one in this movie was black or white  everyone has shades of gray. Absolutes seldom apply.The tagline in the trailer was very appropriate they used to make movies this memorable they used to make movies this powerful they used to make movies this romantic  they still do.".

	schema:headline " Liam Neeson is the only star of the film";
	schema:reviewBody "I have seen this film several times and it never fails to grip me with the suspense caused by the tension of the plot and the atmosphere created by the actors.  Liam Neeson is superb and manages to illustrate the complexity of a character who is at odds with many issues in his life. He changes from sensitivity to coldness to anxiety and then to possible ruthlessness but this side is never really shown only guessed at. The tension of the plot remains throughout the film and what the script illustrates is that despite the war and the characters being on 'different sides' the emotions of humanity like love of family and between men and women are universal. People are motivated by love and caring for others but as inevitable with a war film sometimes they will fail to realise their intentions andor lose their loved ones. However I fail to imagine that a woman in 'evening dress' could have failed to have been stopped by police and or army if she was running around in the middle of the night. Melanie Griffith has no idea what it was really like in those days. Women were on the whole far from liberated and they would have been quite submissive outwardly to men".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a brilliant lavish Czech film from the Sverak father and son team all about two Czech pilots who flee to England to help the RAF in the Battle of Britain but who also fall out over a woman the beautiful Tara Fitzgerald.  Features some excellent and incredibly realistic aerial combat scenes  probably the best ever and much better than Pearl Harbour or even the film Battle of Britain  and a number of interesting general themes such as love war romance comradeship loss and servitude.  Also the trials and tribulations of moving abroad and learning a foreign language though made easier here with the great stalwart Anna Massey.The film has some great little motifs such as the world famous RAF bullseye device shown throughout and at one point nicely reflected in the black vinyl record spinning around cutely music is another theme of the film of course.  Plus all of the traditional icons of English life dimpled beer glasses unlike the postwar straight glasses used in Pearl Harbour tea in a nice china tea set in an English country garden though shot in the Czech Republic? the mascot dog a vintage bottle of HP sauce even a darts board!Of course the airfield and surrounding countryside is ridiculously unlike anywhere in the south of England though the virtuouso aerial sequences make up for this showing Eastbourne and the Seven Sisters always synonomous with southern England and the Battle of Britain.  But best of all is the sensational musical score from Ondrej Soukup as good as anything from Hans Zimmer yet all in the tradition of the late excellent Ron Goodwin who scored the original Battle of Britain film amongst other classic English war films.  There's even a nice little cameo role for the  apparently  famous Czech musician and actor and Kevin Kline lookalike Oldrich Kaiser who plays on the piano the title theme song Dark Blue Sky. Excellent!It's got a few smutty yet funny little Freudian devices too such as always showing an inflated condom floating by the ceiling whenever Karel the callow but brilliant Krystof Hadek is stuck at the airfield while his love rival and fellow pilot Frantisek Ondrej Vetchy is with Susan.Another great English actor in this film!  Charles Dance is of course fine as Wing Commander Bentley.Highly recommended and well worth watchinghiring  get the DVD with special features stuff like how they created the dog fights and stuff.  Probably the only film ever to combine subtitles with characters speaking English German French and Czech all at once.".

As the film opens it is 1950 the war is over and Frantisek and Honza are imprisoned in a former monastery. In their now Sovietcontrolled native country they are 'enemy of the people'. Honza is severely maltreated by his Communist countrymen and dies.In 1939 many pilots manage to escape Germanoccupied Europe and make their way to England where they join the RAF. Notwithstanding their high motivation and experience they face RAF reluctance and British stiff upper lip. Finally they fight gallantly in the Battle of Britain. However Frantisek and Karel find their friendship severely tested when they both fall for the same woman.In terms of romantic subplot this is very similar to the Hollywood production Pearl Harbour. However given the context of the film and Frantisek's eventual fate it is also possible to read the English woman's treatment of the two men as symbolic of British treatment of the Czech and Polish RAF pilots conveniently forgetting them once the war is over.In addition the film is a lot less clich than Pearl Harbour and the characters are more fully realised. Dark Blue World also scores in terms of its stunning aerial dogfights which were seamlessly created using a mixture of models actual liveaction aerial filming and outtakes from the 1969 epic The Battle of Britain.In short Dark Blue World is a wellmade moving thoughtprovoking and exciting drama that puts the likes of Pearl Harbour to shame. Highly recommended.".

I thoroughly enjoyed the film for many reasons all of which have been well covered by other reviewers  the moodiness the forgotten history of the Czech pilots the subtle charm of the supporting characters the fatalism of the main characters and the first person view during the battle scenes.But the element of Dark Blue World that really stood out was the lack of dramatic effects especially during combat and this is a good thing!. While the pilots were flying in battle no musical score accompanied them no manipulative shots of worried spousesgirlfriends were interwoven every little aerial maneuver did not elicit trite patriotic cheers and viewers weren't asked to swallow unbelievable James Bondesque pilot heroics. Instead the audience is allowed to feel the melancholy fear and isolation of these single pilot fighters while they try to stay aloft during combat. As comrades are shot down we are spared tearful howls and the typical but audience pleasing revenge based heroics.  Instead the other pilots sadly and quietly observe their fellow pilot's fate  in reality they still need to remain intensely focused on their own safety and objectives at that very moment.  We only briefly experience the pilot's breathing and the background roar of the engines as we the audience witness a friend spiral quietly down to his death.  And then immediately 'we' need to jump back into combat mode and focus on survival.Too often in Hollywood we're spoonfed the emotions we're supposed to feel and no room is left for the viewer's imagination.  Dark Blue World maintains a sparseness that captivates and involves the viewer allowing us to invest in the movie and fill in the gaps and spaces using our own thoughts and feelings.Excellent film well worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm Czech and soldiers not only pilots who escaped Czechoslovakia after Nazi's invasion in 1939 and fought against them abroad are true heroes and bravest men in our history for me. This movie from director of Academy Award winner Kolya 1996 is a tribute to these men. It's first bigscreen movie about Czechoslovak WWII soldiers since Nebesti jezdci 1968. I think Dark Blue World is a good movie  good acting good special effects nice music etc. Movie is half in English and some actors are Britons. But greatest thing about this movie is it's pure existence. It's great chance to show people all around the world and to many people in Czech Republic too... that Czechoslovak role in WWII was not only as occupied country but as an active member of allied campaign.Leading characters are older and wiser Frantisek and young Karel. They escaped together from Czechoslovakia they are flying in the same squadron and they fell in love with the same woman... Maybe it's a clich but fortunately this storyline is not so aggressive and is in good balance with other scenes including great dogfights. I don't want to compare Dark Blue World with Pearl Harbor someone will like PH more and someone will like DBW. But if you like happy ends DBW is not for you. So I think it's very good movie for everyone who likes this type of stories and very good movie who wants to get to know something about this chapter of Czechoslovak history.BTW main theme Dark Blue World is from Czech 30's and 40's composer Jaroslav Jezek. He wrote this theme when he lost his eyes...".

	schema:reviewBody "I absolutely loved this movie. Great realistic looking combat footage for one thing and a touching genuine story also. The calm understated manner of the lead character Franta makes him very likable. The human relationships in the story seemed so very typical and possible of what you could expect in war time. The bond between Franta and Carel shows the loyalty wartime comrades can have for each other and that is often described in books and interviews with veterans. The subtitles do not detract from the story at all and actually serve to underline the problems the Czech pilots had in the RAF. The postwar storyline is a great reminder that for many the suffering of WW2 did not end in 1945 especially in Russian occupied countries. The cinematography was also very good. Wish I could have seen it on the big screen.".

If you have any love of flying at all especially an attachment to the planes of WWII this is an absolute must see vastly superior to the pathetic Pearl Harbor and up there in rivalry with the famed Battle of Britain filmed more than thirty years ago. There are moments when you feel as if you are flying wingman literally dodging the shell casings of your leader as you roll in on a Me 109 or He 111. As an historian this film deeply touched me as well for it is about the plight endured by tens of thousands of gallant Poles Hungarians Slovaks and Czechs who in 19391940 fled their homelands made it to England fought with utmost bravery for the survival of western civilization and then were so callously abandoned by us after the war when they were arrested by the communists upon their return to their native lands. I have stood atop Monte Cassino in Italy and was moved to tears by the cemetery for the Polish troops that stormed that mountain that British and Americans could not take. I have traveled as well to Prague the most beautiful of cities and studied their history. Their story of abandonment I believe should be a lesson to us even today about obligations to gallant allies. But back to the film. If you love flying see this. If you are interested in the aircraft of WWII most definitely see it. Without doubt the most brutal direct and frightfully swift air combat scenes ever replicated for film. And yes if you even are seeking a touching romance there is that as well in heartbreaking detail.Bill Forstchen Professor of History Coowner of a WWII replica warbird P51 Mustang Gloria Ann".

The love interest is central to the plot and Tara Fitzgerald is very convincing in her role.My only gripe is that the officers and sergeants share the same mess hall.

A deeply impressive work this lived in my memory for the 2 years since I saw it and I have just bought it to explore the makingof extras.I highly recommend this film movie. Like Aces High it alternates between viscerally exciting or scary air combat sequences where the viewer might experience actual loss of characters they'd come to care about but also unpredictable interactions on the ground where skillful writers and reallife experiences inform some involving and moving events. This also underlines the fact that for many people 1945 marked not just the end of one conflict but the beginning of another and even today we still don't recognise the loss bravery and sacrifice of so many nameless heroes or even worse we venerate them from a distance without allowing them to be human beings with all the emotional weaknesses that entails  making their sacrifices all the more valiant.Watching this movie is an experience which will take you from the heights of friendship to the depths of jealousy and back to love that endures even beyond death. If all war films were like this we'd never have to fight again.Did I mention it's worth watching? 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "If you want to see the true vile nature of Communism watch the movie DARK BLUE WORLD. Tvamomodr Svet It recounts how the brave Czech pilots who refused to surrender fled to England to join the fight against the Nazis. After the war the Communists feared they had picked up dangerous Western ideas about freedom. So they had these heroic Czech pilots thrown into a nightmarish prison where some of the guards were the same Nazis they risked their lives to defeat.If Hollywood wants to understand why so many of their movies fall flat they should compare the character drama portions of Pearl Harbor with this movie. In Dark Blue World you really make a connection to all the characters. In Pearl Harbor everyone is like some slick cartoon version of a real person.There are innumerable instances of brilliant writing in this movie. One funny scene that sticks in my mind is when the character Karel is being taught English by a rather formal Englishwoman. When he can't pronounce a word he ridicules the lesson. In typical stoic English fashion the teacher calmly but forcefully confronts Karel and shames him into behaving.The aerial battle sequences in this movie are amazing and they help to keep the movie lively. I read that it cost 11000 an hour to rent the planes but it was worth every penny.Ladies you are expected to cry at sad movies but guys.... beware! This movie would make General Patton weep. And if you are a dog lover you'll use up half a box of Kleenex. Don't say I didn't warn you.".

Maybe there would be goodnatured competition over some succulent beauty as in A Yank in the RAF or The Immortal Sergeant. But no. It's not that at all.It's a modern Czech movie finely photographed in color. There are combat scenes to be sure but the RAF seems to lose as many planes as it shoots down  and without any facile justification. The acting is good and the characters not stereotyped. Although there are two Czech pilots wooing the same supernal babe the rivalry is hardly good natured and in the end they both lose her. Friends die of course but when they do the sentiment is not laid on with a trowel. I even like the title  Dark Blue World. Dark blue as in an RAF uniform or under the surface of the English channel or ten thousand feet in the air at sunrise. Excuse me if I have trouble with the names. Some of them seem to be all consonants and no vowels. I hope my Czech grandmother forgives me. Anyway the story centers around two pilots  the babyfaced and naive Karyl and the less emotional senior officer Frantisek. Both fliers manage to escape from Czechoslovakia after the Germans take over. The Germans by the way are for the most part treated reasonably. One officer smirks and is and insulting the German doctor is generous and fatalistic. When they reach an England desperate for pilots there are some comic scenes of their having to learn English  the difference for instance between borrow and lend. Then there are the scenes of aerial combat. Back to the Spitfires. Everybody in the movie flies Spitfires  beautiful nimble graceful airplanes. Nobody flies Hurricanes. We don't even see any other airplanes except a B25 and a couple of anachronistic Bf109 models cribbed from The Battle of Britain. One shot is an exact duplicate. The visual and sound effects are much improved over The Battle of Britain.The neotenic Karyl is shot down somewhere in England and spends the night at a farmhouse. He's young horny and blunt and the woman is married to someone who has gone missing in the Navy. She sleeps with him partly out of hunger and partly out of pity for his childish need. Her allegiance later switches to Franisek and it gets complicated but it's all handled delicately even Karyl's thinking he's deeply in love while swimming in endorphins.Structurally there are some flash forwards and you have to look out for them at first otherwise you'll find them confusing but you adapt after you realize what's going on.The ending when Franisek returns to Czechoslovakia and his early love isn't a particularly happy one. The Allies have won of course and Czechoslovakia is once again free for a few years but as in real life the cost has been monumental on everyone's part.".

A bond that even a shared woman fails to break.The British people as a whole do not know the debt we owe the Czechoslovak and Polish Spitfire Pilots during the War. For example it is not widely known that the Pilot who shot down the most enemy planes was a Czechoslovak.I finally managed to find this film on VHS video in the discard bucket of a rental shop.

	schema:reviewBody "I came out of Dark Blue World feeling sigh 'so sad' yet it was definitely a film needed to be made and it's truly well done from Czech Republic. It's entertaining in spite of the 'sad' premise. It is full of feelings the bonding and undeniably true friendship between the two lead characters  one mature lieutenant pilot Ondrej Vetch as Franta and the young  eversoeager budding pilot Krystof Hdek as Karel the inevitable love triangle and the now and then reminders of the grim prison situations in Czechoslovakia in the '50s. It's all in one film put together by the father screenwriter and son director team Zdenek and Jan Sverk previous achievement being the lovable Kolya.It's not as long as EastWest French EstOuest 1999 which was heart wrenching multilayered story about a returning Russian doctor and French wife's illfates after WWII in Russia. The plot of Tmavomodr svet title in Czech is quite straightforward and has sprinkles of light humor. Music songs of WWII England sung in Czech modest special effects of pilots and air crafts in the sky  not elaborate like Hollywood  there's no need to be bing bang boom all the time when showing air battle scenes. The sadness was explained up front in the beginning two paragraphs in English and wrap up with follow up paragraphs. The film is not totally subtitled only when translating the Czech conversations  the rest are in English be it very British or in Czech accents. So it's a foreign film with English language and includes British actors. The three lead performances especially of the two Czech pilots were wonderfully delivered. There are nuances between the two of them even though it's the steadily mature vs. the eagerly young. I always appreciate Tara Fitzgerald yes there's Brassed Off 1996 opposite Ewan McGregor and Pete Postlethwaite remembered her from Hear My Song 1991 opposite Adrian Dunbar and Ned Beatty opposite Hugh Grant in Sirens 1994 and The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill and Came Down a Mountain 1995 besides her appearances in PBS Masterpiece Theatre miniseries. 'So sad'  the fact that heroes defending one's country can be so ill fatedly treated and for so long 40 years. Thank goodness for worthwhile memories and the imprints of friendship unforgettable. Hence the pause for a ray of sunshine through a stain glass window ironic or coincidental that it's of a church where the hard labor took place  symbolic of hope never give up Other recent films that have stories needed to be told Kandahar with Nelofer Pazira as Nafas the Canadian from Afghanistan taking a journey to Kandahar with a personal 'mission' in mind more than meets the eye behind a burqa by Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf. Everything Put Together with Radha Mitchell as a new mother facing SID  sudden infant death insightful film by Swiss director Marc Forster and his much talked about controversial film Monster's Ball I've yet to catch with Halle Berry Billy Bob Thornton and Peter Boyle. See the films without prior expectations or comparisons to films before. Just see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a CzechGerman production with the dialogue half in Czech and half in English made by the Czech father and son writer and director team of Zdenek and Jan Sverak who brought us the delightful Oscarwinning Kolya' in 1997. I had to wait for a full year after the film was shown in the Czech Republic before it secured a British release but I was always determined to see it because it concerns a subject close to my family and my heart the wartime record of the Czechoslovak pilots who flew with the Royal Air Force.The film  titled 'Tmavomodry svet' in Czech  focuses on two contrasting personalities Spitfire pilots Franta Slama played by Ondrej Vetchy and Karel Vojtisek Krystof Hadek. I'm sure that it's not too much to assume that the names of these two characters are illusions to Josef Frantisek who shot down 17 fighters in the Battle of Britain and Karel Kuttelwascher my wife's father who shot down 15 bombers on night intruder raids plus three fighters.Like Pearl Harbor' the war becomes a backdrop to a triangular love story involving two men besotted with the same woman. In this case the rivals are the Czech airmen Franta and Karel fighting over a married English girl Tara Fitzgerald which rather dilutes the political messages of the movie. Most viewers will not have known that these heroes were imprisoned after the 1948 Communist takeover in Czechoslovakia and that it was not until the velvet revolution' of 1989 that many young Czechs knew about their countrymen's contribution to the allied victory.  The film is a wellresearched piece full of authentic detail with some splendid Spifire flying and beautiful photography but ultimately it is too slow and too sentimental to make the impact that it should for Englishspeaking viewers who are less interested than me. Although the film has been an enormous success in the Czech Republic in the UK at least sadly it has played to tiny audiences.The script is loosely based on books by two Czech veterans Frantisek Fajtl and Antonin Liska both of whom I have met. One of the technical advisers on the film was my good Czech friend Zdenek Hurt and on the official Czech web site for the movie the Czech edition of my book Night Hawk' is mentioned as source material. Most amazingly pilot insignia wings worn by the two main stars belonged to Karel Kuttelwascher and his friend Gustav Pristupa and the leather pilot cap and gloves worn by Vetchy the principal hero belonged to Kuttelwascher. On the aircraft front viewers might be surprised to learn that there were only two flying Spitfires in the movie Nigel Lamb flew Spitfire Mk Vb BM597 from Duxford and Robs Lamplough flew Spitfire Mk.VIIIc MV154 which he owns. All the other fighters were there due to the marvels of computer graphics and modelling plus some clever recycling of material from the 1969 film The Battle Of Britain'. However in a short scene there is a lovely flying shot of a B25 Mitchell bomber. Meanwhile on the ground in an erotic opening scene we see the prewar Czechoslovak fighter the Avia B534.".

He's wonderful in everything.However it's also true that the center of the movie is archly conventional  the story of two comrades at war in love with the same woman  this is about the 100th telling in movies of such a story. It's true that the writing is ok  less committeetype work than Hanover Street or the atrociously written Pearl Harbor  but somewhat similar to the underrated War Lover in its romance. One wonders if the wonderful book Goodbye Mickey Mouse by Len Deighton yes the usual situation  RAF pilots in W.W.II England in love with the same woman  but as well done as I could imagine will ever make it to American movie or television screens.I felt much more could have been done with the postwar period. It was far less familiar and somewhat more interesting territory to western audiences  and the movie jumps in time so much that you long to see the way the protagonist wound up where he is. Similarly the relationship among the postwar characters seemed odd  the story odd and underwritten.By the way the scene at the train station as the protagonist returns from the War is the best scene in the movie  and absolutely heartbreaking. In being heartbreaking it reminds me of the even better scene in flashback at the conclusion of Plenty when Susan Traherne Meryl Streep in movie Kate Nelligan on stage speaks to a French farmer at the conclusion of W.W.II.So this is well worth it  just don't expect to see a stunning original work.".

It has the lovetriangle a storyline done to death in a thousand other movies but that's about it.  Apart from that two totally different movies altogether.The characters are more human not onedimensional comicbook types and I think hit the spot.  Take Karel for instance he LOOKS like a typical young fighter pilot in the Battle of Britain and the average age was about 19 or 20 while Franta looks the more levelheaded and experienced leader. Their dilemma is handled better and a little deeper than PH's and with more conviction.The film appears to be better researched too  Czech and Polish squadrons were not used in the Battle of Britain until nearer the end and were often angry at not being allowed to fight against their enemy.The fight sequences are marvellous making little use of CGI and as much use of the Spitfires as the budget would allow  especially the trainattack sequence and the subsequent crash.  I won't reveal just how they do the excellent dogfights but it's truly amazing what you can do with a limited budget and a couple of fighter planes!Despite the limited budget Dark Blue World has a proper feel to it  it's not a churnedout movie that was rushed through shooting and released to make a ton of money as quickly as possible.  It's evident that the movie was very much a labour of love for its director and the crew.The DVD contains an excellent making of documentary a special effects short and a brilliant aerial symphony showing the old warbirds being put through their paces to the film's stirring theme tune.I give this movie 9.5 out of 10  a very human moving story about something from WW2 that is largely overlooked and that is the contribution of the occupied nations to the Allies' war effort.".

There is a good balance between drama romance humor action and symbolism that is understated beautifully by the director and cast. This is a breath of fresh air after sitting through overblown and boring Hollywood epics like Pearl Harbor. A solid production all around.

Later Tom and Ellen attempt a graceful dance number as the ship rolls. Upon arrival Tom holds auditions and meets Anne. There is much indecision by the siblings about their romantic partners even though they are intheclouds. Tom dances on the walls and ceiling of his hotel room. All ends well in this light musical. By the way there is a vaudevillestyle dance number in their show that features slapstick. It's a hoot.";

These include the opening number Every Night At Seven their cute little attempt to dance aboard a rocky boat and the dynamite How Could You Believe Me etc. AND I Left My Hat in Haiti.  Powell known mostly for her operetic soprano that never quite seems to match her speaking voice and which can also be heard in a few forgettable songs here rivals Ginger Rogers in her ability to keep up with Astaire and match him every step of the way.  Not to be missed if you love musicals dancing in musicals andor Fred Astaire dancing in musicals.As for the rest of the film the plot is thin as expected but breezes along smoothly.  The characterizations of the English are silly caricatures. Alan Jay Lerner wrote the screenplay and lyrics but remember this was five years before My Fair Lady  Keenan Wynn does okay with the double role of an American agent and his British twin counterpart though.  Peter Lawford is Powell's English honey bun.  In real life Adele Astaire did leave dancing when she married an English lord And yes that is Sarah Churchill Winston's daughter as about the only romantic partner of Fred's on film that was his own age.".

	schema:headline " The Happiest Day In A Lifetime";
	schema:reviewBody "One of Fred Astaire's most charming musicals is Royal Wedding where as if taken from his own real life he's part of a brother and sister act with Jane Powell. We never did get to see Adele Astaire perform on screen but rumor has it she was exquisite in her steps and lovely to see. And like Jane in this film she married into the aristocracy.In fact both brother and sister have their romances in Royal Wedding Fred with none other than Sarah Churchill who was the daughter of a well known British politician. On shipboard Jane attracts the attention of Peter Lawford who was a member of the aristocracy and something of a skirt chaser.All this is against the background of the royal wedding that took place in 1947 between Mr. Phillip Mountbatten and Ms. Elizabeth Windsor. Another reviewer astutely remarked this film was on the MGM drawing boards for some time. In fact it was originally meant for Judy Garland but she had her breakdown and Jane stepped into the part. Despite all the British locales the cast never left the MGM lot footage of the real royal wedding and other London establishing shots were used.Jane got three lovely numbers to sing The Happiest Day in a Lifetime Open Your Eyes and Too Late Now the last being nominated for Best Song. In fact Jane Powell had a unique distinction of having two film songs up in the same year for the Oscar the other being Wonder Why from Rich Young And Pretty. I can't recollect another performer this ever happened to not even her costar Fred Astaire or Bing Crosby who did introduce the Oscar winning song for 1951 In The Cool Cool Cool of the Evening from Here Comes The Groom.Songwriters Burton Lane and Alan Jay Lerner didn't do too bad for Fred either. Royal Wedding is famous as the picture in which Fred Astaire did his surreal dance on the ceiling. Thinking about his lady love Sarah Fred alone in his hotel room starts to sing and dance You're All the World To Me and ends up dancing on the sides of the wall and ceiling of his room. This was accomplished by constructing a set that turned with the furniture and fixtures nailed down. I can't fathom the precision it took to get that number right and retain the spontaneous look that Astaire's dancing was noted for. Fred also sang and danced I Left My Hat in Haiti and Every Night at Seven.The duet that Powell and Astaire have is the longest song title on record to date. How Can You Believe Me When You Know I've Been A Liar All My Life has Fred and Jane as a gangster and his moll. Astaire was fabulous and Jane more than kept up with him in the number. When Judy Garland had her breakdown her first public appearance after leaving the hospital was on a pair of Bing Crosby's Philco Radio Program where guest starred with Bob Hope as well. Judy did a rollicking version of the Liar song with Bing and it's the only instance where you can get an idea of what she might have been like in Powell's role. This film was a favorite of my mother's when we watched on VHS about 20 years ago she loved Fred Astaire's Sunday Jumps number. This is a sequence on board ship where Fred asks to use the ship's gym for rehearsal and does a marvelously inventive sequence with the gym equipment even including a coat hanger. If there's an example of Fred Astaire's ingenuity in making his material look spontaneous this is it. It's well known the number of man hours he rehearsed to get that spontaneous look but it certainly pays off here.And this review is dedicated to my mother a very big fan of this film. I can still hear her remark about how graceful Fred Astaire moved.".

She can dance by the way...

In the minor parts a young Peter Lawford lords it up improbably as an  ahem  English lord while Sarah Churchill the great war leader's niece no less seems a tad plain both in appearance and her minimal dancing efforts. The humour centring mainly on the different takes on the languages from the US and UK perspectives is somewhat forced too but maestro Donen exerts a sure hand at the helm from the stylish wedding invitation titles to the flyaway panout shot over London at the close. A pleasant underrated musical comedy with which to while away an afternoon or evening.".

Obviously the famous sequence with Fred Astaire dancing on the ceiling is one of them but to me it also was the humor. Musicals really aren't best known for the well placed and original humor but this movie does a great job at providing a couple of genuine good and original laughs.The story is kept simple and formulaic and above all also of course very predictable. The movie doesn't offer an awful lot of surprises but yet the story serves its purpose and that fits the genre just right.There are a couple of great and likable characters in this movie that help to make the movie an extra joy to watch. Fred Astaire of course steals the show with his acting and dancing but also Jane Powell as his sister was great. Not too happy about the casting of Sarah Churchill Winston Churchill's daughter. No offense but she just isn't beautiful enough she has got her daddy's looks I'm afraid for her part and also perhaps a tad too old. It just doesn't fit the genre.The musical numbers are all well executed mainly those by Fred Astaire. The sequences were however a bit too 'stagey' for my taste although I should admit that the musical genre has just never been my favorite movie genre.All in all an enjoyable to watch typical MGM musical with a couple of more offerings in it than its fellow genre movies.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "ROYAL WEDDING was a colorful and splashy MGM musical that turned out to be one of Fred Astaire's best offerings despite the initial trouble insuring a leading lady for the project. The film was originally planned for Fred and June Allyson who had to drop out when she learned she was pregnant. Judy Garland was then approached as the studio had been anxious to reunite her with Astaire since their triumph in EASTER PARADE but Judy began her nowfamous behavior patterns of showing up late on the set all the time or not at all and Astaire was not having that so Jane Powell was finally brought in to take the role. Astaire and Powell play Tom and Ellen Bowen a brother and sister song and dance team who have been tapped to perform at a royal wedding in London I believe it's the Queen who has requested they perform so they take a cruise ship to London. On the ship Ellen meets a debonair playboy Peter Lawford and at the London auditions Tom falls for a dancer Sarah Churchillwho he casts in the chorus of his show. This breezy plot provides the backdrop for several showstopping numbers the most famous of which is You're all the World to Me in which Astaire while staring at a photo of Churchill is so head over heels in love that he dances on the floor the walls and the ceiling. Movie historians have argued for years about how this scene was done and frankly I don't care...it's such a joyous expression of love through dance that nothing else really matters. Astaire also has a solo called Sunday Jumps where his partner is a hat rack and as always Fred makes his partner look good. There's also a showstopping duet with Astaire and Powell called How Could you Believe me when I said I loved you when you know I've been a liar all my life? which features Fred as a slick gangster and a surprising Powell as a brunette gumchewing floozy. Liner notes from the soundtrack album claim that this song was written by composers Alan Jay Lerner and Burton Lane in a limo on the way to the studio one day. Despite a wooden performance from Sarah Churchill daughter of former Prime Minister Winston Churchill this musical is a joy and one of the best from the MGM stable.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1947 Britain was looking forward to the marriage of the heir to the throne Princess Elizabeth to Philip Mountbattan. The marriage would be a lasting one it still is going on and a fruitful one producing three sons and a daughter. This film made four years later is set during the period of the wedding events in London. Curiously the King and all members of the royal family are not shown in this film  although stock color film of the wedding procession to Westminster Abbey is shown.I suspect this musical must have gotten onto the MGM planning boards rather quickly  there had been no real royal family marriage for a long time and the pageantry connected to this one was quite extensive. It was the first real attempt by the British Government to rekindle the advertising strength of the Royal Family since the Second World War. Oddly enough the government that pushed it was the Atlee Labor Government which had beaten Winston Churchill's Tory in the 1945 election. But by the time the film came out Churchill was back in power. Perhaps then it is not hard to understand the appearance of Sarah Chuchill Sir Winston's daughter in the film as a love interest for Fred Astaire. Jane Powell's love interest is Peter Lawford.This is a film with plenty of gimmicks In one dance number Astaire dances with a clothing rack in a gym. He also is recalled in this film for dancing on the walls and ceiling of a hotel room. He and Jane Powell entertain the passengers on the French liner they are taking to England by dancing for them at dinner time only to find the ship is rocking in turbulent seas so they keeping losing their footing on the dance floor. In this film Keenan Wynn plays twin brothers who run a theatrical agency. One lives in the U.S. and his speech is full of American theatrical slang. The other is in London and speaks in British slang. The humor of their phone conversations is that they find they barely understand each other. Finally the screenplay romance and marriage of Powell into the British aristocracy is a gimmicky capitalization on the career of Fred Astaire's own sister and partner in the 1920s Adele Astaire who also married into the British aristocracy.The film is a nice film despite the gimmicks in it's script and plot. Under the situation it is a nice little musical comedy which deserves some attention usually shown for bigger films and somewhat more outstanding casts than this one has.".

Soon London comes calling and they want their show. Powell leaves her many boyfriends behind and instantly falls for Peter Lawford who is on the ship to London wouldn't you?. Soon they're in London and Astaire also falls in love with a British dame played by Sarah Churchill. Soon they're wondering if they should get married or not and sacrifice their careers! I mean it's romantic trifle but it's GOOD romantic trifle. I'm a little surprised that this movie is in the public domain! This film has two of Astaire's most famous dances on it the one in the gym and the props and the one where he's dancing on the ceiling. Both of these are very well done and just cements further as if it needed any more cementing that Astaire was the greatest dancer the silver screen ever saw. Jane Powell is also surprisingly good here as the somewhat trampy sister act. I liked her a lot. The BIG problem I had with this movie though was just the horsefaced Sarah Churchill as Fred Astaire's love interest. Can't dance can't act I mean how does a guy fall in love with HER?

This is the movie where by use of a rotating room with a fixed camera Astaire does a routine where he starts on the floor dances up a wall dances on the ceiling and back down the opposite wall then reversing everything because he is in love.Incidentally it is striking how the young Powell looks like the current day actress Reese Witherspoon.I rate this one 7 of 10 very enjoyable for any fan of 1950s musical comedies.".

All the songs fit well into the story even though the numbers within the show don't make sense. What is the show about anyway? No matter. That's not the point. Fred is always great with no exception here. The big surprise is Jane Powell. She's terrific and it's her best film. Wonderful voice and her dancing is top notch. Watch them especially in HOW COULD YOU BELIEVE ME....number. Sensational. People have been very critical of Sarah Churchill. She was a good costar for Fred as she was more his age. If she seemed a bit stiff perhaps that's the way she was directed. She was English and the English are very cool and collect. She reminded me a bit of Deborah Kerr. Anyway she was just fine in her limited role. Peter Lawford was...well Peter Lawford. Keenan Wynn was his usual self in his upteenth supporting role. I think he made more movies than any other actor at MGM. The DVD has two wonderful specials an interview with Stanley Donnen and the casting of Ellen in the film. I know Judy Garland was supposed to have been Fred's sister but to tell you the truth as good as Garland was she would not have been right for this role. I'm sure she was fired for good reasons. Now I'm a Judy Garland fan but after SUMMER STOCK she was through and rightly so. The only drawback to this terrific musical is that the use of rear projection is quite jarring. Too bad they didn't make a trip to good old London. Regardlaess this is a great great show and don't miss it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Royal Wedding boasts two great dance moments. In the first Fred Astaire softshoes with a hatrack for a partner. In the other he literally dances his way completely around a room from floor to ceiling and back again.Alas Astaire's Agame moments aren't enough to distract one from the pitfalls of Royal Wedding a thinlyplotted musical with uninspired songs and a cast that ranges from game to gamey. Using the wedding of England's thenPrincess Elizabeth as a backdrop the movie seems to suffer from a terminal case of Anglophilia.Astaire and Jane Powell are Tom and Ellen Bowen a brotherandsister dance team who gladly jump on a boat to escape muggy New York for London not quite swinging yet but pretty festive what with all this wedding business. Soon romance is in the air for the dancers as well as she meets a British lord and he a dancer hopelessly holding out for her fianc in America.There's not much else going on here which is too bad. For while a musical isn't expected to have complex characters or Mametstyle plots it needs a little something beyond star power to get the audience interested in what's going on. Royal Wedding has Astaire and Powell two terrific performers saddled with bland songs uninvolving dance numbers and romantic partners who make incest seem preferable for our heroes.That's especially true for Peter Lawford whose last name should have been Principle for it certainly applied to him. He plays a caddish lord who sweeps Ellen off her feet. Given that she seems to enjoy the sport of making romantic overtures to men she then abandons it would probably serve her right to find herself victimized by a nonnoble imposter yet Lawford's character is on the square he couldn't have played it any other way. Their romance follows a smug and uninteresting course.Astaire's love interest Anne is played by Sarah Churchill who dances pleasantly and doesn't look too bad but seems to be cast in an uncomfortably loadbearing role as a nod of American respect to her father Winston a great man in my eyes but not exactly Michael Redgrave in the actresssiring department.There's also dull comedy much of it in the form of Keenan Wynn's dual role as Transatlantic twins who talk past each other in their unconvincing slang. Dig? Pip! Director Stanley Donan tries to work some humor in the dance routines but having the Bowens shipboard shimmy shattered by a shaky shipdeck just doesn't work either for laughs or hoofing. Nor do all the nods at stereotypical Brits who say things like Cheerio and only seem to live for the chance of waving at the Royal Carriage. While Powell and Astaire do dance well together the numbers just don't grab you like they should technically brilliant perhaps but unengaging.No you basically have just two great solo dance moments in Royal Wedding. The remarkable thing about the ceilingdancing number now that we understand the how of it is how well Astaire sells it by playing with audience expectation. No sooner are you comfortable with him dancing on one side of the frame then with a subtle movement to disguise the fact the set has now been turned 90 degrees he finds another side of the frame to jump upon looking as natural as SpiderMan in the process. The hatrack dance is even better for my money an engaging number all the brighter because its presented as a lowkey workout even as Astaire manages some more gravitydefying without the aid of camera tricks this time.Since one of these numbers later became a vacuum commercial and the other a Lionel Ritchie video it's nice to see them here as they were originally intended. Even a bad film is redeemed when Astaire gets going and he does. But otherwise this Royal Wedding is strictly a Camilla rather than a Diana affair.".

	onyx:emotionText "Royal Wedding boasts two great dance moments. In the first Fred Astaire softshoes with a hatrack for a partner. In the other he literally dances his way completely around a room from floor to ceiling and back again.Alas Astaire's Agame moments aren't enough to distract one from the pitfalls of Royal Wedding a thinlyplotted musical with uninspired songs and a cast that ranges from game to gamey. Using the wedding of England's thenPrincess Elizabeth as a backdrop the movie seems to suffer from a terminal case of Anglophilia.Astaire and Jane Powell are Tom and Ellen Bowen a brotherandsister dance team who gladly jump on a boat to escape muggy New York for London not quite swinging yet but pretty festive what with all this wedding business. Soon romance is in the air for the dancers as well as she meets a British lord and he a dancer hopelessly holding out for her fianc in America.There's not much else going on here which is too bad. For while a musical isn't expected to have complex characters or Mametstyle plots it needs a little something beyond star power to get the audience interested in what's going on.

Fred does some of the most memorable dances as a solo act in the film. He does the dance with the wooden coat rack. He also does my all time favorite where he dances on all sides of a room. He and Jane do a couple of really original song and dance scenes. The first one is where they sing and dance on a ship as it goes thru a storm. They slip and slide around in an entertaining scene. This scene actually happened to Fred and his real life sister. They also do a funny vaudevillelike scene where they stomp on each other. Winston Churchill's daughter plays Fred's love interest and Peter Lawford plays Jane's. Keenan Wynn is his usual funny self in a dual role.".

The other half spring from the story in that fantastic manner we accept as a matter of narrative convention.The dances though some of them are pretty darn memorable.To appreciate this you need to understand the challenge of filming dance. We have the old convention in spots here the camera is in some sort of theater seat and watches a performance on a stage sometimes a literal stage. There's nothing cinematic about it you could see the same thing is a live performance.The challenge is in what to do that works with the dance and at the same time leverages cinema presumably to engage us. The production team here did some rather amazing things with space. I don't know who to credit but there's some genius here.The idea is by steps bonding the dance to notions of artificial space the actual containing space. It starts with a simple device Fred dancing with a hat rack. Its a strange thing halfway between being a partner and an interaction with the world.Then on a ship he and Jane dance on a floor that shifts. The notion of an unstable gravity is a pretty amazing notion because Fred's effects all depend on his relationship to the ground and what's on it. The floor shifts and he accommodates amid moving pulls rolling oranges and shifting furniture.Then the most memorable dance sequence shifts this on its head mastering gravity he dances in a room starting on the floor. Then dances on the walls and ceiling. The effect is accomplished by having the room imperceptibly rotate and the camera with it. But its an extraordinary achievement the way he plays with it. It isn't as wild as Gene Kelly playing with and in the rain because it is more precise and intellectual. But it is a real thrill. You need to see it.Later in the stage show there's an acknowledgment of all this a production number about place with a map of a place that turns transparent to reveal the place itself. There's a strange background here the actual royal wedding of the period. The tone of that was supposed to be so obvious and strong that merely being immersed in it would overcome hesitations to wed. Its so flat today it shocks especially the actual footage of the rather ridiculous pomp.The woman playing Fred's paramour is Winston Churchill's daughter an odd combination of mannish face red hair terrific legs a studied grace and little charm.

The thing holding him back is that he is disgorging money to his exwife Annabella Sciorra. Dillon is also hooked up with a nurse Mary Louise Parker while Sciorra has bonded with her professor William Hurt who lamentably is married.I ask you  the experienced moviegoer  is it necessary to spell out what happens at the end? Not if you've seen The Awful Truth or any of the innumerable others that wind up with the estranged couple realizing that they were really meant for each other all along. The only alternative and it was fashionable for a while was for the wounded wife to find empowerment in her singlehood as in Unmarried Woman. The story was written by women and directed by a man and so the perspective of both genders is rather neatly represented. The bits of symbolic interaction the kind that women pick up and men blunder over are nicely captured in the script. A little hackneyed here and there as during Parker's dismissal of Dillon but overall a nice job.The director adds an understanding of male companionship of men stifled in their ability to express emotions other than lust and rage. And he knows how much men of Dillon's background treasure their Vettes. Here the dialog is sometimes inept. A friend of Dillon's Pope is in love with a young woman named Marie. The central figures are all Italian the WASPS are on the periphery. I doan know how I feel when I see Marie! I mean she might be 50 feet away. Maybe she's just brushin' her hair or somethin'. I mean I doan know. My stomach gets dis HOLLOW feelin'. I get all kinda JUMPY if you know what I mean. Well I may or may not know what he means but I know that workingclass men DOAN TALK DIS WAY. Here's how the dialog would go. Dillon Hey you still wit Marie or what? Pope Yeah. I tink it's getting' deep. If you take that verbal clumsiness away from these guys you might as well take their cojones while you're at it.It was all pretty familiar if intermittently amusing. Here's the thing that surprised me. MaryLouise Parker's performance as Dillon's sometime girl friend who finally realizes that she can do better with somebody who cares more for her than for his ex wife or his car. She's quite good  and in a slurpy and uninspiring part too.No one wants to sound like a sexist but I'm compelled to point out speaking to you as your psychologist that men's and women's brains are rather different. That's not even to mention their hormones. I won't get into detail but this biological difference is reflected in their interactional styles. I refer you to any of Deborah Tannen's books on the subject as much as I hate to. She knows how to cut men off at the knees while retaining her deniability. Anyway I think women would enjoy this film more than men. The men will squeeze some enjoyment out of what is likely to have been the director's contribution.I wish MaryLouise Parker had been on screen more often here and elsewhere and not stuck in the victim role so repeatedly.".

	schema:headline " A fine early effort from Minghella";
	schema:reviewBody "I was surprised after seeing this film and later finding out it was directed by none other than one of the best 90s and 00s directors Anthony Minghella now sadly long gone. Why surprised? Perhaps because it's an American film and a melodrama but not of the spectacular kind like The English Patient or Cold Mountain. But one thing they all have in common which also shines through in this one Minghella's ability to express the emotions of its protagonists like few other directors. That is really his great legacy and contribution that he leaves behind to the film.The movie stars one of my favorite 80s actors Matt Dillon as the Average Joe Gus the electrician. He lives with the beautiful Mary Louise Parker who plays Rita an emergency room nurse. They are very much in love but one thing hinders their happiness together and Gus' financial situation his exwife Leonora played by Annabella Sciorra. Gus dreams of buying a bowling alley for himself and his pals but due to the alimony payments he must provide to Leonora the bank turns his request for a loan down. Therefore he tries to get her married by finding her a husband. This whole process triggers something that has been lying deep inside both Gus and Leonoratheir love for each other.This might seem like a schmaltzy sappy love movie to some but it is a carefully crafted melodrama. It explores the idea that love is sometimes too easily abandoned or given up on when other things come in the way like money and career. At the same time it shows how hard it is to make a choice between two women that you both love and care for. Gus may love Leonora more but it doesn't mean he feels nothing for Rita. That part of the film is very sad but at least Gus does realize he was wrong to let Leonora go in the end and does something with it. As the other user pointed out it doesn't seem very believable that he'd give up on such a seemingly perfect match as Rita for the more complex one such as Leonora but hey to each his own. The supporting cast is really top notch with William Hurt playing Leonora's college professor whom she dates. Gus' strong reaction when finding this out is the first hint of what's to come. Also seen here is Vincent D'Onofrio as the main candidate for Leonora's husband that almost makes the cut. Dan Hedaya Luis Guzman and James Gandolfini are also in the supporting cast but don't make that much impact on the storyline. Dillon is great as always and makes his character very believable. He's a dreamer who has been sleeping too long. Parker also shines in her part as his ultimately unhappy love project and Sciorra is as always a delight to watch. This can be seen as a final step towards perfection for Minghella like a graduation test. While it's not one of his best works it certainly has a vital place in his repertoire.".

	onyx:emotionText "I was surprised after seeing this film and later finding out it was directed by none other than one of the best 90s and 00s directors Anthony Minghella now sadly long gone. Why surprised? Perhaps because it's an American film and a melodrama but not of the spectacular kind like The English Patient or Cold Mountain. But one thing they all have in common which also shines through in this one Minghella's ability to express the emotions of its protagonists like few other directors. That is really his great legacy and contribution that he leaves behind to the film.The movie stars one of my favorite 80s actors Matt Dillon as the Average Joe Gus the electrician. He lives with the beautiful Mary Louise Parker who plays Rita an emergency room nurse. They are very much in love but one thing hinders their happiness together and Gus' financial situation his exwife Leonora played by Annabella Sciorra. Gus dreams of buying a bowling alley for himself and his pals but due to the alimony payments he must provide to Leonora the bank turns his request for a loan down. Therefore he tries to get her married by finding her a husband. This whole process triggers something that has been lying deep inside both Gus and Leonoratheir love for each other.This might seem like a schmaltzy sappy love movie to some but it is a carefully crafted melodrama. It explores the idea that love is sometimes too easily abandoned or given up on when other things come in the way like money and career. At the same time it shows how hard it is to make a choice between two women that you both love and care for. Gus may love Leonora more but it doesn't mean he feels nothing for Rita. That part of the film is very sad but at least Gus does realize he was wrong to let Leonora go in the end and does something with it.

This was the first time I saw MaryLouise Parker and she was perfect as the great girl but taken on the rebound. I love the fact that they all have regular jobs with a working class dream of buying a bowling alley. Why is it so hard for Hollywood to portray middle and lower middle class people in films?

I would say that's being unfair though as the characters are a little better written than you would expect from the genre and there is a little more emotional connection too. But in the end it opts for formula instead of trying to figure out a more believable solution. It should be mentioned that this is the only film Minghella directed in which he didn't have a hand in the screenplay. The film stars Matt Dillon and Annabella Sciorra as a divorced couple. Sciorra relies on alimony payments to live and Dillon is unable to move forward in his current relationship with Mary Louise Parker or to invest in a bowling alley which his friends want to buy. The solution find a suitable partner for the ex to marry thus ending alimony. For a long time it didn't seem like the movie was lame enough to have Dillon fall for his exwife but alas that's what eventually happens. Personally I was so smitten by Mary Louise Parker that I was especially disappointed. Then again Dillon does come off as kind of a jerk so I guess I didn't really care with whom he ended up. It's still moderately entertaining but the straw that breaks the camel's back is the transcendently awful smooth jazz score. Apparently the composer isn't even listed in the credits at least IMDb doesn't list who wrote it but this person deserves to be beaten.".

The ending is satisfying without being overplayed and there was enough going on through out making me want to see it again to look for more.It's not a perfect film but my quibbles are as much my personal taste as anything else. And those critiques are too small to mention here.Ink has proved to me what can be done on a lowbudget and with limited resources when you have a great script and take the time to do it right. I don't know what the budget was but I'm pretty sure it was ridiculously small for the type of production value Winans delivers. He wrings good performances from the unknown cast through out. And while none were quite Oscarworthy to me the large cast blends well together and a few performances are really good. More importantly none are that red flag you almost always see in an indie film.

It is so easy to get laden down with the burden of day to day survival that we lose sight of what we should hold most precious love honesty and forgiveness.

	schema:headline " Truly Remarkable Indie that defies categorization";
	schema:reviewBody "A bold rich and very remarkable film. This is art not entertainment. Story This little movie defies easy categorization there is nothing quite like it that I am aware of. For students of literature you will find connection to the work of Dante  in particular The Inferno  and other works that portray a human being losing hisher soul for that is what this movie is about. There are philosophers Rudolf Steiner who believe that the world is literally divided into overlapping parallel worlds populated by forces of dark and light not good and evil where each side works continuously to influence human beings leaning in one direction or the other  the demon lying upon us as we sleep feeding us nightmares the angel gently stroking our forehead comforting us as we face our deepest fears. This is an epic and continual battle in which the darkness in the world comes from those of us who have committed treasonous acts against our own humanity and suffer in proportion consequences for having done so. In film I would group this with movies like Renee Missel's Resurrection or Blatty's totally brilliant Ninth Configuration. But bear in mind that you are watching an INDIE which means limited money to make the film. Therefore production values suffer at times there are weak special effects low budget costuming limits to cinematography etc. These should be easy to overlook given the scope and depth of this work. Jamin Winans has crafted a minor masterpiece. The ensemble acting is uniformly superb but Mr. Kelly carries this film with a deeply felt and gifted performance. Though the story may be difficult to follow because of its unique and complex subject matter in fact it is tight as a drum with virtually every shot and edit building on those that preceded it but it will take a second viewing to discover this. The direction is very fine the film absolutely has a look and feel expressive of its content. The use of offcolor green was effective and quietly disturbing as was the black inklike flow covering the protagonist at specific moments throughout the film. At a time when our entire culture is in danger of losing it's soul when so many are seeking insight into something deeper and truer this film could not be more appropriate. INK is what Independent films are supposed to be intelligent deep inspired rich genuine quirky imperfect expressions that Hollywood could never make or would simply ruin because of commercial pressures. Mr. Winans  thank you.".

	schema:reviewBody "I regret that I watched a pirated download of this movie. It was fantastic and it truly deserves my money. However that said I don't know how else I would have found out about this absolute gem of independent filmmaking if it wasn't for seeing it on a list of downloads and feeling curious. My ONLY quarrel with Ink is the quality of the visuals themselves. I understand the desire to create a dreamlike otherworldly atmosphere but blowing out all the whites and softening the image can only be tolerated for so long. In some ways it makes the movie look cheap which couldn't be more misleading. I think it's best to go into Ink curious. I didn't really know what the film was about when I began watching it other than it dealt with the idea of parallel worlds and I think one review equated it with The Matrix some how but it was a pleasure to let the film unfold in front of me never knowing exactly where it was going and letting all of the puzzle pieces eventually drop perfectly into place. Although sometimes the costuming leaves something to be desired the actors wear them confidently and never let you feel like you're being swindled. That said the acting was top notch. Especially from lead Chris Kelly. Keeping everything I just said in mind I would like to reiterate that Ink is an INDIE. Those looking for a bigbudget thrillride will be slightly disappointed. But it is a remarkable indie. It doesn't let it's budget get in the way of a great story startlingly impressive special effects car crash scene is topnotch visionary directing and chameleon acting. This IS indie filmmaking. And it's the furthest thing from that softspined 'mumblecore' that lovers of independent film have been forced to sleep through for the past decade. I can't wait to see what's next from Jamin Winans. In the meantime I'm going to track down a copy of Ink all legallike to add to my collection. In fact if you're reading this post and are interested in watching it try to find it legally  only because it's worth the purchase and it lets investors see audiences appreciate intelligent independent filmmaking. It's well worth the purchase.".

This movie could serve as a model for treatment well beyond Freud's limited treatment modalities.Existential issues of life purpose death and a hereafter the quicksand of limbo land they are all intricately woven in a drama of distorted time imagery fresh vibrant music and photography that is gripping innovative and alive while allegorical and metaphoric. The acting is superb the cinematography is as good as anything West of Thomas Imbach and the music is so fresh and coherent that it is often the thread that holds seemingly disparate pieces uncomfortably in place until they are resolved.

The story was absolutely hearttouching and I really felt for the characters in the movie. The cinematography was unlike anything I've ever seen before seeming like a dream the whole time your watching it. Everything about this film was unique and creative  things I would've never imagined. It is hard to describe my experience without giving anything away but everything about this movie was magnificent  considering it's a small independent film. It was filmed entirely in my state of Colorado putting me right into the action as I recognize the locations they are.After the showing two actors the man who plays Jacob and the little girl Quinn were there answering questions along with one of the producers. This was especially exciting as I learned some very interesting things about the movie. For instance none of the dialogue was actually recorded with the video. It was all addlibbed during postproduction  amazing considering you couldn't tell at all during the film.If you want to see a movie with great production value and a great story that isn't in mainstream Hollywood go see this movie. It's ten times better then some good Hollywood movies I've seen recently.".

The dialogue throughout the film is banal at the best of times and absolutely revolting during the restwhich is to say most of the film. Furthermore the characters are all either onedimensional or archetypes that have been recycled too many times and in better films.To say that the acting is subpar would require a Ghandilike generosity of spirit that I simply do not have. The pathfinder character is played by someone who attended the Dane Cook School of Acting. The only actoractress with any real talent is the little girl. The rest of the cast displays as much subtlety as a Thomas Hardy novel.Many of the shots during the filmespecially the main character's flashbacksplay like a Zales commercial. They are saccharine enough to cause earlyonset diabetes. This is worsened by being combined with poorly choreographed fight sequences and unimaginative special effects. Dark City from which Ink stole the portrayal of the incubus had far superior special effect over ten years ago. The pacing of the film is unnecessarily slow. I would liken the experience to traveling 5 mph in a beat up Ford Pinto through a ghost town that has been lit on fire.In summary I would rather give myself a root canal with rusty coat hanger than have to watch this again.Many people like this film......they are wrong.".

No sane person unrelated to the makers of this film would ever give it over 510. Well I'll start with the positives There are some nice effects here and there with one glaring exception. The succubus bad guys do look quite sinister using simple but quite effective tricks. The filters and muted colours are evocative and suit the material.OK that's that over with. Now I will try to keep the negatives relatively succinct so this doesn't turn into an epic post.The script is just a shambles. Utter juvenile trash. I mean this rubbish manages to make Twilight look like dostoevsky. That bad. The theme of dreams is apt as the plot seems to have been literally dreamed up over night. Or probably during the course of a daydream while sat on the bus to workschool. There is little explanation of the tenuous reasons for the bizarre dream people who give good dreams etc. And if you can manage to get to the toe curling finale you will probably feel very frustrated. The kung fu fighting while adequately choreographed and performed lacks any real context and as a result any real impact. The lead actor is the only actor who seems to have anything even approaching professional abilities and those are rendered laughable by one half of his role which includes the comically bad prosthetic nose. I do actually feel sorry for that guy as if he wasn't literally smothered by this juvenile nonsense he may be capable of putting in an acceptable subbale performance.The characters are all paper thin and range from the simply annoying to the truly silly. Stupid angel with no eyes character tries so hard to be annoyingly funny but is just annoying. The storyteller has some of the most toe curling and awkward lines I have heard. And there are some other people. That's about the best I can say. There are some other people who say some things that are irrelevant and have some irrelevant kung fu fights. Although the little young girl does actually manage to not be annoying or precocious.The dialogue is consistently dreadful throughout and really reaches a peak of absurdity towards the end. Leaden and ham fisted platitudes pour from your speakers like a sonic cancer. Well thats about all I can say really. This is easily the worst film I have ever wasted my time on and I have seen some real stinkers. Jamin Winans as I note is listed as directorproducerwritereditorcomposer. Well maybe for your next film you might think about sharing some of that load with some people who can actually do that work. You know maybe get some of those shills to actually help you make a good film instead of spamming IMDb with nonsense reviews. I understand this is an indie low budget feature but that really doesn't excuse the utter rubbish that has been produced. If anything this film is pretty negative for indie features as there is such a gulf between this and a good high budget film.".

This film has a few good ideas wrought with poor execution. The nature of the story is something we have heard before the conflict is nothing new. Some have commented on the actors and yes they are as bad as you've heard. The script or lack thereof is very thin very very poor character development in every case except John the main character. Why is he so important? The movie never tells you the storytellers and incubus are just there to be opposing forces and add to a weak narrative. The concept is great and when I read the description I was excited I understand the limited budget but you cannot use that to justify the dross of this film. The story is told in fragmented pieces which has been done quite a bit already but it isn't done well. Not until the 40 minute mark do we have any sort of idea of whats going on they should have left at least 20 minutes on the cutting room floor. The film lacks dialoge too for the slow pacing you would expect some dialoge to keep things moving but all you get is a mediocre score that only aids the snaillike pace of the movie.So why did I even bother giving it a 3? There's some neat concepts that should have stayed in the oven a bit longer for one. Second it has some decent effects here and there that were impressive for the budget. And third some of the photography is somewhat inspired. But in most of the film I disagree with the photography it really should have been applied better so you knew what dimension you were in or you knew you were watching a dream or a flashback and so on. I cannot in good conscience recommend this film to anyone who wants a film with substance or a good cohesive idea because this movie does not know what it is trying to be.".

What a crazy ride. Ink is unlike any other movie I know.Its definitely the most original movie I have ever seen and visually it is quite stunningthe special effects really enhance the film.They're not state of the art GCI but they are tremendously effective.The soundtrack is wonderful and very suiting.The acting was good specially Quinn Huncharthis little girl is not only beautiful but she played her role with a maturity way beyond her age.The story its kind of a grown up fairytale and has an epic feeling to itunfortunately it gets too confusing and complex at timesits one of those films you have to watch more then one time to fully comprehend everything that happened.My other complaint is the following I think the movie is a bit all over the place.It has many great ideas and elements but it ends up being a bit messy.Having said that I'm amazed by what this director was able to accomplish with a low budget and probably not many resources.I see a LOT of great ideas here and I see a lot of potential.If Jamin Winans can do a film like this with this budget I could only imagine what he would do with a Hollywood budget. In conclusionInk is a crazy and surreal journey that deserves to be seen.A very original and refreshing piece of work and the director is one to watch!710".

What plot there is concerns a young girl the not too bad Quinn Hunchar channelling Heather O'Rourke in Poltergeist who is trapped in limbo between the real World and the World of nightmares thanks to a shadowy abductor known as Ink.Now considering that he is the star of the show not too much money has been spent on the costume of old Mr Ink. He wears shabby old rags which he has clearly nabbed off Mr Susan from the Mighty Boosh and a ludicrous fake nasal appendage presumably borrowed from Monty Python's Raymond Luxury Yacht character. But costumewise he still fares reasonably well compared to one other character whose blindness is signified by his wearing four pieces of black duct tape across his eyes. Feel the budget!Set design fares little better with Ink journeying to a halfway house between Earth and Hell which I can only describe as CrppyPixelWorld and then finally arriving at his less than nightmarish destination PlasticBagWorld. Along the way Ink must repeatedly fight off good guy dream warriors who want to snatch the child back again. Tedious fight scenes abound. And to further pan his road trip out he meets pointless other characters e.g. a woman who is seemingly introduced solely to give someone else a haircut. I'm not sure why.The plot with it's rambling about Storytellers Pathfinders  Incubi seemed frankly just a tiresome load of old tosh to me. But some younger viewers may dig it.Furthermore the overacting by the adult actors was for me both cartoonish  dismaying. Especially when compared to that of a film like City of God for example where young kids were plucked out of a Brazilian ghetto shoved in front of a camera and performed incredibly. How can the disparity be so great?On the plus side though I found the soundtrack of the movie seemingly done my the film's director to be a quite decent affair with plenty of moving electronic string pads soaring away. And the nightmare baddies with TVs for faces actually looked rather good.In summary I feel slightly guilty for not liking this move as it is clearly a small independent affair and movie makers have to start somewhere I guess. But anyone wanting to see a SciFi shot on a shoestring budget should perhaps consider Another Earth instead.".

It is hampered at times by the low budget. It was obviously filmed using medium quality digital cameras and the writing and acting were a bit dodgy at times. But overall the story and the feel of the world they created almost completely overcomes these failings. I really think that if word spreads this could be come the next Donnie Darkoesq cult hit.

	schema:reviewBody "The lives of famous politicians are rarely the subject of a film even though their decisions may have had a large influence on daily life and in the case of wars even on death. Leftwing politicians are the favorites of film directors not only because of their often interesting creative and emotional characters but also in order to moderate and sometimes destroy the myth. Margarethe von Trotta has done justice to Rosa Luxemburg 18711919 in this film about her last twenty years. As a director she thank God refuses to take sides. Some knowledge concerning the historical backgrounds of the story will add to your enjoyment of the film. You might consider reading the friendly book Gedenksteen voor Rosa by the Flemish writer Achilles Mussche. Luxemburg was a legendary socialist leader with a revolutionary inclination. Just to give you a taste of the themes that await you she recommends the political mass strike an interesting idea which unfortunately can rarely be realized since the people themselves are the first victims. Although she originated from Poland where she belonged to the upper middle class she became a distinguished member of the powerful and massive German SPD workersparty. Later the Bolsheviks have presented her as one of their forerunners but her ideas remain appreciated by socialdemocrats since she never embraced dictatorship and kept a critical distance towards Lenin. The film shows her life in the little biotope of all the contemporary party bosses and their families among others Bebel Kautsky Karl Liebknecht and Clara Zetkin discussing society over a glass of good wine. Sometimes we see her association with the working class during lectures and agitations. The film hints at her job as a productive journalist and being a versatile woman her scientific ambitions. We get a taste of the puffed up ideological utopianism which was so typical of a part of the intellectual middleclass socialdemocrats. Such extremist ideas blossomed naturally as a result of their permanent predicament of intimidation persecution imprisonment and for Luxemburg exile that was imposed by the corrupted state. unfulfilled personal ambitions are an additional cause. On the private level her intimate relationship with a Polish revolutionary is represented as well as her final romance with a barely grownup. In many ways her last final years lead to a climax. It was the period of the First World War which in Germany had extreme consequences. During the war she was once again imprisoned for political reasons. Freedom has its limits even in capitalism. Then in 1918 after the defeat of Germany a proletarian revolution changed the empire into a republic. The socialist SPD played an eminent role in the upsurge together with the leftwing secession USPD a few years later they merged. Luxemburg together with Liebknecht had shifted to the extreme leftwing into the sectarian Spartakus movement with high ambitions. In word and deed she advocated that the socialdemocrats should cling to their newly conquered rule. In my opinion and I am pretty knowledgeable on the subject her plan would have created a civil war which would have further aggravated the situation of the people. I would say that her final actions were highly questionable and perhaps irresponsible however some think otherwise so judge for yourself. Anyway she was freed and in those first months of 1919 supported the armed resistance of workers even when it continued after the successful proletarian revolution mainly in Berlin. Finally she was arrested and shot on the spot by a Prussian Officer together with Karl Liebknecht. On a higher level the socialdemocrat Noske then minister in the socialdemocrat interim government is commonly held accountable for these murders. The film gives an impressive overall description of the period but you must appreciate the revolutionary atmosphere caused by the persecutions and finally the horrid and superfluous war otherwise the fierce dialogs and debates may deter you. Her premature death made her into a martyr in the same league as Che Guevara. Like him she must have been rather goodlooking more than the actress Barbara Sukowa which also helps.".

This is a real shame as Rosa Luxemburg is a cinematic and historical gem.Rosa Luxemburg is a true hero and a great thinker who deserves a spotlight in the history of the early 20th century. Unfortunately she is too often forgotten and only the likes of Ernst and Marx are remembered. Here is someone who is really trying to change her fate and the fate of her sisters and brothers. All of this is beautifully brought to life by von Trotta in this film and many of Luxemburgs writings and speeches are used throughout. The performance by Barbara Sukowa as Rosa is amazing and she really merges with the character she portrays. I think this is a beautiful film and I would wish someone would give it a good makeover and preserve it for future generations. This is a film which should not get lost  rather it should be remembered.Unlike her male contemporaries von Trotta's films are often hard to find and virtually unknown to most people  even those who have heard of her contemporaries like Schlndorff Fassbinder and Herzog. This is a mystery to me as I have seen a number of her films and she manages time and time again to make raw challenging and emotional films about history. At the end of the screening there was also an interview with von Trotta in which one could see her intelligence and passion for film. I am really looking forward to see her next film  a project on the philosopher Hannah Arendt.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rosa Luxemburg is probably one of the most interesting and controversial characters in German history and here she gets her tribute movie. Initially Rainer Werner Fassbinder was intended to make this one with Jane Fonda playing the title character but as we all know he died prematurely and Margarete von Trotta took over with Helena Sukowa playing the main part. Both got a fair share of awards recognition probably worked on several other projects together because of that and the movie also won Best Film at the German Film Awards roughly 30 years ago. It was not the right decision I guess. I am not a great fan of Sukowa I must say but she is bearable in here. I remember her being downright bad as Hannah Arendt recently but in this much older work here she is solid for the most part. She does not bring any greatness that could justify her awards for this work not at all but at least she kept herself from constantly going over the top so that there were only a few cringeworthy moments involving her acting. But I also think she does not prove she has particularly great range and this mediocre lead performance cost the film a lot as she is basically in every scene.Then you have to say in her favor that von Trotta's script isn't really up to the challenge either. There are good moments but as a whole it simply is not enough for a movie that almost runs for 2 hours. This is particularly disappointing as Rosa Luxemburg really would have deserved a lead actress with more talent and consequently a movie with better quality. I guess we have to live with that for now. I may be a bit biased here as the years before 1933 in the 20th century even as a German citizen never felt that interesting to me as I hoped they would be but I also need to state that this film here did not succeed in sparkling my interest. There were many moments during which the film dragged and it lacked consistency in convincing storytelling. The duo von Trotta  Sukowa is one that still has to impress me. This one not being as bad as the previously mentioned Hannah Arendt will not cut the cake. It is a missed opportunity and I do not recommend the watch.".

That's why it pains me to see some users give this film a bad review because the dialog is weak or the scenery isn't vibrant or something along those lines. This is not a stab or an insult to you but what I'm saying is sometimes movies are made with one intended purpose... ENTERTAINMENT! I could careless if this film had poor actors poor script poor lighting that doesn't matter when you watch an action film. This movie delivers your monies worth too in my opinion Will Smith and Martin Larwence make such a great team that part of the fun is just watching these two get into it from time to time. And with Michael Bay directing you know you're going to get some good action scenes. Let's face it Bad Boys II has one of the best car chase scenes ion recent history it dominates the dismal over played chase in Matrix Reloaded which was the other big summer sequel of that year. I think all that needs to be said here in a retort is the movie is an action movie ans needs to be looked at as an action movie. To hell with the elements that the Academy looks at appreciate the film for all the stuff that blows up and the laughs the cast can bring you to.".

That's why it pains me to see some users give this film a bad review because the dialog is weak or the scenery isn't vibrant or something along those lines. This is not a stab or an insult to you but what I'm saying is sometimes movies are made with one intended purpose... ENTERTAINMENT! I could careless if this film had poor actors poor script poor lighting that doesn't matter when you watch an action film.

Will Smith was definately more built much tougher and more in charge Martin Lawrence stole the show with his silly remarks every 5 seconds but I loved it. The car chase scene on the highway was way better than the Matrix Reloaded's car chase scene it puts that one to shame. But this highway chase scene will definately rank up there with T3's. Some parts in this movie were a bit overdone such as the morgue scene won't get into it but I'll leave it at that and the rats...that's it! If you are looking for a solid type performance from Will Smith to be a good actor don't bother this movie was all about pure action and mindless fun if that's what you want then go see it if not don't waste your 2 hours and 40 minutes seeing it. Funny thing is it didn't feel that long.Can't wait to see this out on DVD in superbit. A great sequel.".

The two funniest scenes are when Burnett and Lowery are scaring the hell out of Burnett's daughter's date and after the chase scene with the dead bodies and Captain Howard goes off on the two. Absolutely hilarious! My only gripe is that it seemed that the writers were running low on material and resorted to grossout humor like rats having sex and corpses losing their heads. Not funny. Otherwise it was very funny due to the amazing chemistry between the two leads. I still prefer the original Bad Boys but this is still a great time at the movies. 710".

I for one am gonna defend the guy here.  And no i'm not some idiot teenager who thinks Charlie's Angels is the best movie ever made.  I am an avid film watcher.  I probably see close to 100 movies a year IN theaters.  Big movies and small alike.  I appreciate any genre of film if it's done well.  But obviously my first love is and always will be action.

As good as James Cameron John Woo Ridley Scott John McTerninan John Frankenhiemer and any other guy named John.Is Bad Boys II too exrtavigant?  Too explosive?  Too indulgent?  It's not your money why should you care?  BB2 is action filmaking in it's purest most volitile form.  I can't remember seeing an action movie with this much well ACTION in it.  This thing drills you like a jackhammer in a way that The Rock could only dream of.  It comes close to the Enough Already level of action as in Armageddon but holds off with all the humor brought by the stars.  Was there one too many car chases?  Yeah probably but I'm not complaining.  Two and a half hours looks just fine too me.  Personally I like my action movies to exhaust me.And what action it was.  The car transport chase is easily better than anything in the Matrix Reloaded and even T3.  Not only that but it's great to see full blown R rated action in all its bloody glory again.  Ahh just like the good old days when men were men and action movies were all rated R.Look if you're all about hating Bay and blaming him for all of scociety's ills as well as acusing him of being the antichrist  then what in god's name are you doing watching this movie?  It's been pretty well established since The Rock and especially Armageddon that you don't like the guy  so why do you keep going to see these movies if you know you're going to hate them?

What a wild surprising and funny time they have! I know the storyline doesn't sound very convincing but this movie is not 'okay' as most people put... it's the action movie of the year! The storyline is as I said probably not very convincing and that lots of movie have been made like that and you think that you've seen every on of them...But if you watch this movie you'll be really really surprised. The director Michael Bay is one of my favorites and this movie is one of his action masterpieces.Rating 710".

	schema:reviewBody "A huge budget sequel to the dumb Bad Boys. I guess it was inevitable.I saw the HBO special on this movie and watch how Will Smith Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer went on and on about how great this movie is. What was really happening was that Michael Bay and Will Smith were happy that they received a fat paycheck and Bruckheimer was happy that he will make another huge pile of money with the release.They said we finally got it perfect. Perfect? Perfectly overblown trash maybe. There is not the slightest distant glimmer of anything that faintly resembles originality here. It is all one boring dull mindless clich after another until the viewer is literally ready to puke.The story starts with Will Smith who is hot for Gabrielle Union who is Martin Lawrence's sister which is a a cheesy love vs family problem that is addressed so poorly that it shouldn't be there. And guess what? There is a twist! Gabrielle Union is an undercover cop working on what maybe the same case! Oh dear! We are also treated to a big loud car chase in which well over thirty vehicles are totaled along with the bad guys. But the good guys? They don't even get hurt. Some cops manage to land in critical care but after flipping over in a car going 80 mph straight into a massive fireball in the middle of the highway you'd be dead. Yes the T1000 survived such a feat but he is a futuristic robot.Moving right on from the pathetic story and horrible action is the humor. It is also dumb clich and overly vulgar. I mean are rat sex and junior high school level gay jokes something you'd expect to see in a movie not by John Waters? Types of humor have their placement in film or as Michael Bay demonstrates so well misplacement. Moving on we come to a sick excuse for a plot device. Towards the end our heroes got save Gabrielle Union who was kidnapped. They pack their service pistols and prepare to go to take on an entire drug cartel. But guess what? The police chief's friends are in the CIA and they decide out of the goodness of their heart to help two hotshot loose cannon detectives! So now with the help of a bunch of CIA commandos half of Cuba is blown up and everyone goes home safe. Preposterous on all counts.There are entertaining movies that follow this kind of preposterous formula. James Bond for one. He is just as ridiculous as this movie but he has a light side. He doesn't take himself too seriously. Those films have a tongue in cheek nature that constantly reminds us that we are watching what is basically a fairy tale. Not here. This film takes it self so seriously and tries to be ultra cool and slick. Thankfully it fails on all fronts of film making. Let's hope we don't see anything like it anytime soon.Sick disgusting unoriginal a horrible waste of money superficial unentertaining unfunny vulgar and just plain terrible. This sort of Hollywood junk put the word 'bad' in the dictionary. Either that or the Bubonic Plague. Well I guess they are both bad. 110 Rated R excessive violence relentless profanity and all around bad taste".

Lawrence was on top comedy form and Smith the fresh smiley face was in full swing of refreshment. Having two young comedians tackle two heavily sought after roles was a shift into the unfamiliar for a buddy cop movie and it worked a treat as the pair bounced verbally and toughly off each other.So where did it all go wrong in 2003? As we see the pair emerge undercover at some unexplained religious celebration there is racist banter an over the top and unrealistic eventual shoot out and some gross out jokes that fill your mouth with bitterness.Yes when the pair emerges there is a cool low angled slow mo shot but Mr Bay never seems to stop pumping this motion. In the abandoned house as Smith emerges in a purple blazer as a mine flies in the air etc. It's not The Matrix as much as he thinks.Perhaps the director isn't to be blamed for this film's overblown portrayal of testosterone. Ultimately this crime comedy boils down to one of the most poorly pencilled scripts in all of crime films.Seriously what is the purpose of trying to justify comedy in the way of drugs car chases and rivalry? Those elements are enough for the usual good cop film leave out the comedy. The opening title sequence is reasonably well established as the plane once more glides over the Miami sign and the set up for the boat drop could have been worse but the descent into the ordinary exaggeration of detective work is ridiculous. Clues seem to be too easy to find whenever there seems to be too much talking there is an inclusion of overly long action to compensate and in case something was missing there are ridiculous stereotypes thrown in.These inclusions of rough gangsters doing drugs and a soft looking ruler just add to the sheer egregiousness of the overall picture. These included presumably getting some laughs but I struggle to see the humorous factor of Martin Lawrence on x rat sex and a swimming pool breaking.Perhaps the fact Smith and Lawrence are comic geniuses makes this disappointing as they are not funny exempt for brief oneliners.Bay the destroyer has overblown the proportion of action with so many inclusions of bullets it is unforgivable not to mention numerous car chases that never result in a realistic crash. The franchise sadly looks to resume in 2012 but it surely won't get worse.".

I left the film feeling irritated and angry that two and a half hours of my life were spent exposed to unoriginal vulgar poorly edited and written tripe.  I enjoy a good action movie.  Chase scenes and things going SPLAT and KABOOM can be fun but Michael Bay manages to drag every moment for what seems like an eternity.  Several scenes manage to plagiarize one another and often felt like clips from the trailer instead of part of the movie.  The continuity is horrible and a chase scene that ends with the heroes crashing their car into a body of water is immediately picked up on a road somewhere!  The fun interaction between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence that made the first Bad Boys enjoyable is pretty much entirely absent.  Between their constant bickering and dialogue so full of swearing tossed in for kicks watching them literally becomes a painful experience.  In the place of any real humor the writers decided to resort to gay jokes to get some cheap laughs.  Nothing like the threat of anal rape to get the crowd roaring. Every actor in this disaster was reduced to a pathetic caricature the brassy femme who wants to prove she is as good as the boys while doing it in a bikini  the hardboiled chief who has seen enough of the crime that is tearing his city and consequentially his mental state of being apart JOE PANTOLIANO  WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!!!The movie itself is just so coldhearted.  To catch ONE drug dealer the heroes of this movie cause 2 major highway disasters and plow over a shanty town in like the 600th chase scene of the movie.  Oh hooray we got that awful drug lord sure we killed dozens of people in the process but at least the kiddies won't get their E as easily anymore.  Bad Boys II was a bloated mess of a movie.  Way too long Way too poorly stitched together and way too stupid to waste any of your time or money on.".

	schema:reviewBody "Violent loud relentless and without question the coolest film of the summer.  Michael Bay's action epic is the action movie to top all action movies.  It's as if Bay and producer Bruckheimer are saying we dare you to top this. For Will Smith the film is a breath of fresh air.  What Smith is doing with this picture is showing that he can do something more than entertain the PG13 crowd with his alien fighter shinanigians.  It's nice to see Will Smith play a pied off angry cop as opposed to his usual Mr. Nice Guy shtick.  Martin Lawerence shows that he does have talent if he works with the right people.  My advice to Lawerence is don't make any movies except BAD BOY movies.Much has been said about the film's violence and frankly I'm surprised by it.  Yes the film is violent.  There are a lot of people getting shot and killed.  What do you expect?  It's a cop movie.  Most critics have mentioned the scene involving dead bodies used for comedic value.  This is the same type of humor you see in movies like Final Destination 2 where the laughs come from the deaths.  I don't find it offensive because the scene with the bodies is an important slice to the narrative and hey it is FUNNY.As an action picture no other film this summer comes close to Bad Boys 2. The Matrix Reloaded tops Bad Boys 2 as an overall movie but if you are just to measure the action scenes Bad Boys 2 wins.  Many have been comparing the chase scenes of this film and Reloaded.  Let me say this the freeway chase scene in Reloaded beats the chase scene in this film.  The difference the freeway scene in Reloaded was the main action scene while the chase scene in Bad Boys 2 is one of seven amazing action scenes.  No other Hollywood movie can compare to the amount of action that is in this film.  So because as of right now Bad Boys 2 is the definitive action picture you owe it to yourself to see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was barnone the best action I have seen in years!!! I am not only one of the most critical people I know when it comes to movies but I'm also not a Michael Bay fan. Oh My God!!! Most action films nowadays are just hohum and use warmed over effects and stunts from other films but this one pulls out all the stops. When I first saw the ads for this film last year I said to myself Why are they making a sequel to that film? Not only that but why did they wait 8 years to make it. Needless to say I didn't have much faith in this film. The underwhelming trailers didn't help either. Boy was I wrong. This was the summer film I didn't know I wanted to see. Most action films are mere spectacle but I actually felt this one in my gut. None of the sequences give up one inch of slack. This film is on major steroids. Oh...and did I mention the comedy? The exchanges between Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are completely raw and off the chain. I don't even like Martin Lawrence!!! This had to be one expensive movie especially at 2.5 hours long. I was so pumped up after leaving the theater that when I got home I immediately put on some Slayer. This film is that good. This is by no means an Oscar winner but who cares.Forget the Matrix Reloaded Terminator 3 The Hulk and all those other weak imitators. Go see Bad Boys II five times and make it the highest grossing film of the summer. 10 out of 10!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Bad Boys II 2003 No Stars I've been trying lately only to review movies that I consider to be great movies or random new releases that I get time to review. And so this review is different. It's a movie that was made three years ago and its the exact opposite of great. I hated this movie so much that months after finally watching the whole thing I had to watch this movie in pieces because I felt as if I was going to have to stab my eyes out I feel I can finally review this thing. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are Miami cops cracking down on a Cuban drug king played by Jordi Molla. Martin Lawrences sister Syd Gabrielle Union is also involved undercover in a federal investigation and of course things get freaky with her and Will Smith's character. Blah blah blah roll the clichs and super cool dialog insert a chase scene that sees about a million cars get destroyed while Will Smith drives his Ferarri through the carnage at 200 mph unscathed slap on some random catch phrases and a cheesy ending and BANG you have Bad Boys II. Doesn't sound like much? It isn't. You could say that the movie is just mindless action but to say that it is mindless would excuse its insulting of morality and intelligence to the viewer. If it would be mindless it wouldn't know better. Michael Bay does know better but that doesn't stop Bad Boys II from being cruel and down right offensive to mindless movies everywhere. The movie thinks that it's being funny when it's just being cruel and one scene in particular made me cringe and made me want to run out and burn posters of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. That scene involves the pair driving their fancy Hummer through a shanty town on a hillside. We're talking a slum where the poorest people you could imagine live. The Hummer plows through the houses tearing them apart. This would have killed dozens of poor people. But do they care? No they're driving their big yellow Hummer having a ball. Sure they try to say that the village had been making drugs but so what? I'm sure the kids and innocents who lived in those houses might have something to say about that. This movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth that shows up every time I hear someone say Bad or Boys or 2. That this piece of cinematic junk has 6.1 rating on IMDb is mind blowing. It's a testament to the stupidity of the modern movie audience. I never had to pay to see this movie yet after seeing the whole thing I still felt like someone owed me a whole lot of money.".

I mean can you imagine any other director who is given megabudgets every few weeks and told to blow up more than he did in his previous movies? In the first Bad Boys film an airplane hanger was blown to bits and was swiftly followed by an asteroid being nuked in Armageddon and the destruction of Pearl Harbour in...uh Pearl Harbour. Not to be undone Bad Boys 2 has him indulging in not one but two chaotic car chases where muscle cars which most of us would spend our lives saving up for are torn to pieces like yesterday's newspapers and rounding everything up by detonating a sizable part of Cuba. If this trend continues there won't be a building left standing in the whole of North America once Transformers is through. Not bad for a smug little geek with a rubbish haircut.If you've seen the first Bad Boys film you'll know what to expect. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence return as Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett a pair of loose cannon cops whose only similarities are their penchants for arguing and getting into gun fights. Lowrey Smith is all laid back cool stylin' and profilin' his way through the Miami underworld while charming the pants off every woman that crosses his path. Burnett on the other hand is an insecure neurotic and over protective family man. Not only that but he has a bit of an anger management problem as well and has been half a step away from a severe nervous breakdown for the majority of his adult life. So far so very similar to any cop orientated buddy movie you've ever seen but Bad Boys 2 overcomes the total lack of originality thanks to the natural charisma of the stars and the sheer spectacle of its action sequences.The plot of course is throw away guff designed to hurtle Smith and Lawrence into the thick of as many explosions as possible but when they bounce off each other this well it's difficult to care. Martin Lawrence has never been a great leading man but somehow when partnered with Will Smith his career makes perfect sense his manic edginess being the perfect foil to Smith's effortless charm. You could argue that being on screen with the World's Most Charismatic Man would make anyone look good but then you'd clearly not have seen the terrible I Robot where nobody looked good. Not even the robot.And then you have the aforementioned action sequences. Yes we all know they're going to be over the top but lord almighty it's still an adrenaline pumping thrill to see them happen. The opening John Woo impression with the Ku Klux Klan is just the starter to a main course that consists of a destruction derby car chase a close quarters battle with some Rastafarian gang members a fist fight on a train carriage ANOTHER insane car chase and a dessert set in Cuba where a mansion gets destroyed. Throughout bodies fly off overpasses to go crashing into glass phone boxes men are riddled with machine gun fire and the balls of fire get bigger and more firey the later they appear. Bad Boys 2 might not be subtle but it sure as hell is fun.However there is a drawback the running time. It might be an energetic exercise in flashy excess but did it really need to be two and a half hours long? Entertaining though it is there comes a point when you've seen enough faceless henchmen getting holes drilled in them and just want to see the villain being brought down. Given the extreme running time isn't also a bit unusual that Joe Pantoliano's role as the best clichd police chief in movie history is so small? Maybe they were worried he'd pack the movie into his bags and run off with them like he did the first time around...Those grumbles aside there's little complaint to be made about Bad Boys 2. Sure it's so shallow that I could just as easily have written Will Smith and Martin Lawrence destroy stuff and summed up the entire enterprise but it makes for an exhilarating action movie and the natural successor to all those ones produced in the eighties when brain cells were exchanged for body counts and biceps. Try not to take it seriously and you'll have a blast.".

Critics who keep bashing the movie forget that Micheal Bay is known for shooting action. So if you don't like to see some amazing action sequences and you have a weak stomach then stay away from movies like these. I thought this movie had more action in it than all of the Lethal Weapon movies. This is the buddy cop movie. Their should be a part 3 now that this movie clocked in over 40 million in its first weekend.I already said enough about the action in this film but Martin and Will are hilarious in this one even though the plot has nothing to do with several of their skits. It feels like they were 2 different movies here. But nevertheless the chemistry was good between them and they had me falling off my seat. So do not miss this movie because a critic says so. This movie will make way more than it cost to make 200000000 but it will ChaChing much more just like Pearl Harbor was bashed along with Armageddon which are Hollywood Classics. I admit Bay is not my favorite director to see work with Bruckheimer his closeup handheld camera shaking movements always bothered me. Instead I like the Scott bros. Ridley and Tony who should direct Bruckheimer movies from now on.  3 stars out of 4. Go see this film just get the advil ready afterwards".

	schema:reviewBody "Before I begin this brief review of Bad Boys II let me inform you that I am not a prude. I love exploitation films. I love sex and violence. But this movie simply crossed the line. Forget Hershell Gordon Lewis  he was Walt Disney in comparison. Forget all of the grande guignol Italian horror directors of the '70s  their zombie and cannibal movies are like the Teletubbies compared to Michael Bay's latest monsterpiece. Hell even forget the collected works of Adam Sandler Rob Schneider and Tom Green..this movie..this movie. this movie.This movie will go down in my long years of extensive movie watching as the crassest most offensive most bloodthirsty most repulsive film ever made. Not since the release of the actual Nazi Holocaust footage have I seen so much mindless destruction and heartless killing on screen fuelled by endless supplies of unbridled hate. Never have two supposed heroes' caused so much collateral damage for so little reason. The film's supposed gags' consist of nothing but homophobia necrophilia corpse mutilation and seriously offensive ethnic slurs the punch lines usually resulting in more impersonal unnecessary killing filmed in that pornographically violent style we've come to expect from Bay. This is violence without consequence  most of the time the movie doesn't even address it such as the scene where a Hummer crushes dozens of shanties and their inhabitants.And you know what? It wouldn't even bug me that much if the film had any halfway decent action scenes. Zilch. Bay's direction can only be described as incompetent to the very extreme. To quote Roger Ebert The movie is so choppy in its nervous editing that a lot of the time we're simply watching senseless kinetic action. The chase scenes and shootouts are broken down into closeups that deny us any sense of the physical relationship of the actors or the strategy of a chase. It's all just movement.'I had little idea of what was going on during the film's countless chase scenes or why they were necessary.This movie has officially surpassed Pearl Harbor Attack of the Clones Batman and Robin and Freddy Got Fingered on my list of worst movies of all time. Congratulations Michael Bay. After Pearl I didn't think it could get any worse but you've outdone yourself this time.".

	onyx:emotionText "Before I begin this brief review of Bad Boys II let me inform you that I am not a prude. I love exploitation films. I love sex and violence. But this movie simply crossed the line. Forget Hershell Gordon Lewis  he was Walt Disney in comparison. Forget all of the grande guignol Italian horror directors of the '70s  their zombie and cannibal movies are like the Teletubbies compared to Michael Bay's latest monsterpiece. Hell even forget the collected works of Adam Sandler Rob Schneider and Tom Green..this movie..this movie. this movie.This movie will go down in my long years of extensive movie watching as the crassest most offensive most bloodthirsty most repulsive film ever made. Not since the release of the actual Nazi Holocaust footage have I seen so much mindless destruction and heartless killing on screen fuelled by endless supplies of unbridled hate. Never have two supposed heroes' caused so much collateral damage for so little reason.

	schema:reviewBody "After watching and reviewing nearly three hundred Westerns on this forum it's always a neat surprise to find one with an element or two that I haven't seen before. Not that Man of the Forest doesn't have one of the typically standard plots for a 'B' oater because it does. This is one of those flicks where the evil town boss Noah Beery Sr. attempts to steal a rival's ranch out from under his niece who's arriving from back East to help out her uncle. Isn't it interesting that most of the time it's a returning niece or nephew instead of a son or daughter  I wonder why that is? Unless you've seen a bunch of these Thirties and Forties Westerns you might not give it a second thought but it struck me enough today to comment on it and believe me I've seen a few hundred of these.As for something 'new' the picture catches your interest in the opening scene when it looks like a mountain lion is stalking our hero Brett Dale Randolph Scott and attacks him from a rocky ledge. Surprise number one is that after wrestling the animal to a standoff we find out that it's one of his pet lions. Surprise number two is that the mountain lion from the earlier stock footage is replaced by an African lioness! Not only that but another lioness portrays the male counterpart! I was looking for a way to pluralize lioness lionesses lionii but I came up empty  neither one sounds like it makes any sense. 'Mike' and 'Bessie' had a trio of cubs that looked as cute as all get out and I think they helped in some small degree to win pretty Alice Gaynor Verna Hillie over to Brett Dale's side.Before that happened though Scott's character had to rescue Miss Alice from an attempted kidnapping by Clint Beasley's Beery henchmen. This is the second time now that I've seen a Western hero spank an uncooperative female in what many would consider to be a politically incorrect scenario the other was Gene Autry putting Barbara Pepper over his knee in 1935's Sagebrush Troubadour.For Western fans this one is a veritable treasure trove of familiar character actors of the era. Besides Beery you have appearances by Harry Carey Sr. Barton MacLane Buster Crabbe and a slap dash comedy duo consisting of Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams and Vince Barnett. The pair get some mileage out of an ornery mule and have a stake in making the save for Brett Dale in the finale.Even though the picture is fairly run of the mill storywise I'd recommend it for a chance to see Randolph Scott in an early starring role. Interestingly both Scott and director Henry Hathaway worked together on another Zane Grey based vehicle Heritage of the Desert in 1932. It was Scott's first lead role and Hathaway's first directorial effort. It also had Big Boy Williams in the cast!".

This was a thoroughly enjoyable film. It had a familiar but good story line great scenery and an outstanding supporting cast headed by Noah Beery and one of my favorites Big Boy Williams. The acting was above average for this type of movie. Scott was handsome and actually dashing with his little mustache. He showed lots of wit and charm and none of the woodenness that would come later to his acting. I couldn't help laughing at some of the lines concerning women considering his so called homo affairs with Cary Grant at the same time that this movie was filmed. I don't like women I never have! is quite a line as well as Harry Carey saying to him maybe this will change your mind about women. The big blooper of the movie was trying to pass off African lions as mountain lions. They must have come from Buster Crabbes's jungle adventures. I did feel bad for the cubs when the mother was killed. Scott even said that they were too young to drink milk from a bowl And I HATE HATE HATE leg traps! Didn't he realize that he could have caught one of his own pet lions? In spite of the leg traps this is a nice little movie that I won't mind watching again in a few months.".

Scott manages to get Hillie first Uncle Harry has been brutally murdered and after convincing her that he's on her side and courting her with some adorable lion cubs must protect her from the nefarious Beery and his men which also includes Barton MacLane.There's a running gag of funny man Vince Barnett trying to wrastle an ornery mule. I just wonder why it is that every B western must include some buffoon or grizzled sidekick when the plot on its own carries the film well enough. Still there's enough action and excitement in the hour long running time including trapping the good guys in a burning building but unpredictability has never been a factor in these low budget oaters even those made by A studios such as Paramount here.".

What a bizarre movie! Scott learns that an evil bossman Beery is planning on kidnapping a young lady. So to thwart his wicked plan he kidnaps the petulant young woman himself. But in the meantime the girl's father is killed and Beery frames poor Scott for this. Can the everheroic Scott manage to avoid a hanging AND bring justice to the frontier? See this for yourself if you want to know how all this ends.Overall this is an enjoyable film despite its eccentricitiesor perhaps because of them. The comic relief was actually pretty good the acting decent though Scott was a bit woodenprobably since it was one of his earliest starring roles and the story engaging.

He then wages war against his peaceful neighbors killing their women and enslaving their men. A hero named Ursus appears at a tournament to challenge Hamilan's authority. Though victorious at the tournament Ursus is arrested and forced to turn a gristmill under an overseer's lash. Meanwhile the former king's virtuous daughter Diana is tormented by her evil cousin the new queen. Sentenced to a slow and tortuous execution Ursus breaks free and a revolt breaks out. Ursus throws Hamilan to his death in a fiery pit and then Ursus and Diana enjoy the cheers of a grateful populace.";

	schema:headline " Ed Fury's third and final film as Ursusvisually imaginative";
	schema:reviewBody "Made in 1963 URSUS IN THE LAND OF FIRE was Ed Fury's third and final film as Ursus although there was not much continuity from film to film with the specifics of Ursus' personal details! and also Fury's final peplum film in the 1960's. Filmed in rich pastel colors blue seems to be a favorite color in many scenes and featuring fascinating and imaginative set designs throughout the film is an above average peplum in every way. As another critic noted the series of tests and physical challenges for Ursus are ingenious and require Fury to display his strength and physique to their best advantage. The sequence where he shows up at a tournament run by the evil ruler and then stands up to the evil one AND whips everyone who takes him on is very wellstaged and exciting. Cowriter Luciano Martino has many strong credits as producer andor writer in swordandsandal westerns giallo and 70s crime films including a number of cult classics. Director Giorgio Simonelli went on to direct a number of Franco and Ciccio comedieshis previous peplum work as a writer includes two Brad Harris classics Samson and The Fury of Hercules as well as the fascinating 1963 horror film TOMB OF TORTURE aka METEMPSYCHO. This film may well be Ed Fury's best starring vehicle and is probably the film I would show someone I wanted to convince of Fury's status as a major peplum star. The US television print I taped off UHF in the early 1990s isn't really panandscanit's as though the outer twothirds of the picture are just lopped off and you are watching the middlethird. The credits are hard to read as you only get the end of the first name and the beginning of the second name! As I've said about many other peplums this cries out for a sharp letterboxed DVD transfer. With this film's rich visuals beautiful photography and interesting set design it's well worth tracking down for any swordandsandal film devotee.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having heard good things about this swordandsandal movie I found myself a tad disappointed with some of its aspects but in general this is superior to most of its competition and Hercules fans will find it well worth a look. Of particular note are several of the imaginative and impressive indoor sets which are a clear cut above the plywoodcolumns sort of decorating one often sees in this genre. Of course any Hercules movie must largely be judged on the appearance and appeal and talents of its main actor and here we're fortunate to have Ed Fury who not only looks good with his shirt off but who has some personal flair as well. He plays the part with an agreeable touch that's a welcome break from the grimly determined muscleman school of acting. Another way of judging these movies lies in the quality of the tortures which are inflicted on the hero. Here we have two good ones. In the first Fury is chained to one of those wooden poles which protrudes from a circular gristmill. Encouraged by a burly overseer who lashes him across his bare back Fury must walk around in a circle pushing that pole and turning that gristmill. And boy is this a big gristmill! Unlike other such sequences such as that involving Victor Mature in Samson and Delilah this horizontal pole is not at waist level but rather positioned above Fury's head so that his chained arms are extended upward from his body. This seems to make the ordeal even more strenuous and painful and effectively showcases Fury's physique. In the second torture he's forced to stand on a dungeon floor amid a number of sharp metal spikes which protrude upward. He's also forced to hold above his head an enormous flat stone. Eventually his arms will weaken and the weight of that stone pressing inexorably downward will impale him on those spikes just before it crushes him. The appeal of this torture is that it turns the hero's chief asset  his strength  against him. The longer he's able to hold up that stone the more he prolongs his agony. And in the process of course the more entertainment he provides for his captors  and for the movie audience as well!".

Anyway the story is well handled though Ursus' idea of avenging the peaceful shepherds is to defy singlehanded and challenge the new king which promptly results in his arrest the fact being that Ursus doesn't have a plan for avenging his people but entrusts himself to a whirlpool of events his single plan might of been of course to defeat the king in the arena supposing that the sovereign would of taken up the challenge. The cast has a lot of clergymen more pious and cautious than just and a prophet anyway the high priest proves of some help to the insurgents.The landscape is mainly dreadful but I think I recognized the waterfalls from another s  s movie.By the early '60s the European kids seem to have got a peculiar education by movies like this which is a fact perhaps less analyzed sociologically.".

	schema:reviewBody "Neatly crafted action thriller with Seagal on top wristsnapping form as a Buddhist cop from New York with a shadowy past teamed with Wayans' wisecracking LA cop to investigate the gruesome murders of a serial killer known as the Family Man'. The two leads work well together in typical buddy cop fashion which provides the film with the comic relief it needs to give the audience a break from the serious themes involved.The script is competently composed trying to surprise us as best it can with several twists and turns however the story is so fully packed with things going on that it's easy for the audience to get lost along the way. However that is not a problem as Seagal is on the case with his usual array of impressive martial arts and likeable personality encased in an interesting character. To me Seagal represents in a way a modern day John Wayne always playing the same out for justice good guy role and taking no crap from anyone along the way. He is a screen presence that can carry even the most brainless of films but this film has both brains and brawn. Wayans does very well here too managing to avoid the typical stereotype of the AfricanAmerican cop who is simply there for laughs.The direction is standard but competent in keeping a relaxed balance between the hectic action entwined with the tense buildups and the comedic peacetime goings on. The gorier parts of the film like the murders are handled with skill and successfully manage to create an eerie atmosphere rather than simply a gory headturning occasion.The Glimmer Man is not a masterpiece by any means but it serves its purpose well as a tense action thriller. It tries hard to be more than it is but its lack of originality is its biggest flaw but it gets top marks for trying. You can't take anything away with you afterwards but you can enjoy yourself along the way.".

	schema:headline " Weak unimaginative plot with poor performances but just enough action to be watchable";
	schema:reviewBody "A cop with an attitude is partnered up with a newage cop with a shady past and amazing martial arts skills to investigate a serial killer who crucifies his victims. Campbell sees it as a fairly straightforward case of a religious nut obeying orders from God but Cole sees something else in some of the murders a sense of purpose and order that hints at a bigger plot. Going back to his handler at the CIA gets him nowhere but brings him to the attention of Frank Deverell and the Russian mafia. With so many people gunning for them can Campbell and Cole stay alive long enough to get to the bottom of it? Although any film that contains both Seagal and a Wayans brother will hardly be an easy sell to me I still decided to give this film a stab because I do like a solid action movie every now and again. Plot wise this film is about as weak as I had expected with a messy narrative that never really convinces and just seems like a couple of halfbaked ideas crammed into one story with little concern with logical linkage or development. The hope seems to have been that enough action and energy would stop us seeing the holes  sadly this doesn't work. The film has enough action to be worth watching but it isn't really anything special although fans of Seagal will be used to this consistent standard.The cast are just as average as you would expect. Seagal delivers everything with a total lack of emotion that is explained away by him being a totally calm Buddhist as opposed to him just not being a very good actor. Physically he is pretty good here and his fight scenes do actually show a man with skill as opposed to the out of shape man we have been shown almost waddling recently. Wayans tries to be a tough comic relief but his performances just reinforces the feeling of this being a formulaic mismatched cop movie even if he is impressive in some of his action scenes as well. Neither of them are that good but they are certainly no worse than a lot of the reluctant buddy cops movies out there. The support cast should have been better but people like Gunton Cox and Tobolowsky just sink into the mess rather than helping to raise it.Overall this is a watchable Friday night style thriller that you will quite enjoy if all you want is watchable action surrounded by messy and clichd plotting and delivery with par for the course acting. If you are after anything more than this then you'll be sorely disappointed as this is a weak film with an unimaginative plot poor performances and only just enough action to be watchable if you're in an undemanding mood.".

The film has enough action to be worth watching but it isn't really anything special although fans of Seagal will be used to this consistent standard.The cast are just as average as you would expect. Seagal delivers everything with a total lack of emotion that is explained away by him being a totally calm Buddhist as opposed to him just not being a very good actor. Physically he is pretty good here and his fight scenes do actually show a man with skill as opposed to the out of shape man we have been shown almost waddling recently. Wayans tries to be a tough comic relief but his performances just reinforces the feeling of this being a formulaic mismatched cop movie even if he is impressive in some of his action scenes as well. Neither of them are that good but they are certainly no worse than a lot of the reluctant buddy cops movies out there. The support cast should have been better but people like Gunton Cox and Tobolowsky just sink into the mess rather than helping to raise it.Overall this is a watchable Friday night style thriller that you will quite enjoy if all you want is watchable action surrounded by messy and clichd plotting and delivery with par for the course acting. If you are after anything more than this then you'll be sorely disappointed as this is a weak film with an unimaginative plot poor performances and only just enough action to be watchable if you're in an undemanding mood.";

I heard that Seagal was 'beefing' up for the part and that Wayans was in a real serious role all this crap! I went and saw it with all in mind and I really could care less at someone else's take on it anymore. Sitting watching the film I got into the characters I don't know about anyone else but I believe thats what it's all about. No Keenan was not totally serious in fact he was mostly comedic although there were moments of serious but it was not over the top as I had previously been told. So really I was going in with a lot of expectations. In all fairness I can say this one was a fun and furious ride at times. The surrounding cast including Mr. Smith an agency 'spook' employer for the C.I.A. Brian Cox was lowlevel emotion and cynicallybalanced. He made the dark side more interesting along with Bob Gunton Mr. Deverell and John his right arm man that executes hits and reckon cleanup. In L.A. where I used to live it was fun seeing the old stomping ground where they filmed it.. Interesting premise of a thrillerstory on top of it all. Christopher the hitman added a 'whispful' and fatalistic element to the program played by actor Stephen Tobolowski he plays psychotic intensely well. Thumbs up!! This was very pleasing for me I admit you disconnect your reality beliefs with some of it as movies go these days and some are so much more unbelievable than this. I say this is one of Seagal's greats along with Keenan as an awesome partner in crimeclean up they stole the show. I recommend for interesting 'plot' twisted stories with good good casting and interesting charactersscenery.Recommended highly ThxIMDb.com".

Nico Toscani in the movie Above The Law back in 1988 have been like the seven fat years in the book of Genesis. By the time he made The Glimmer Man some seven years later Seagal had to wear extra baggy clothes to hide the extra weight that he put on his frame from all the success he had since then. Steven Seagal Det. Jack Cole and his partner Det. Jim CampallKeenen Ivory Wayans who only seems to be in the movie for comedy relief are put on the Family Man murder case in L.A. The Family Man murdered some half dozen families and had them crucified in some weird ritual after they were dead. Seagal here plays a cop who who cracked up back in the early 1980's from the guilt that he felt about his service in Vietnam where he was known as The Glimmer Man a hard as nails killer who the enemy only saw a glimmer of before he did them in. Det. Cole or Seagal later went to Thailand and took up Buddhism and became a sweet and peaceful man who wouldn't hurt a fly! Even though the movie The Glimmer Man is one of the most violent films that Seagal ever made. The Glimmer Man is an almost incomprehensible movie to understand and follow. It starts off with a serial murder and then goes to what seems like a weirdo psychiatrist Frank Deverell Bob Gunton who thinks that he's the Godfather and uses a gang of thugs to smuggle arms from the now defunct Soviet Union to a Serbian freedom fighting organization. This whole racket is run Det. Jack Cole's former boss in Vietnam Mr. Smith Brian Cox who's working together with the Russian Mafia. That's about the best way I can describe the plot in the movie. Early in the film Det. Cole's exwife Helen and her husband Andrew Dunleavy are murdered by the Family Man killer and it's made to look like it was Det. Cole who was the killer. This makes Cole realize that the killings are a cover for something more sinister. After breaking a number of heads and arms and legs of Russian gangsters and Deverell thugs Det. Cole finally gets to the bottom of what is really behind all these killings.The movie is so violent it made me wonder what Seagal who had a lot of control of the material in the film was trying to tell his audience love your fellow man? Since it went against everything that Buddhism stands for which I at first thought that the movie was advocating!The Glimmer Man builds itself up to it's inevitable bloody conclusion at the Overington Hotel in downtown L.A where Det. Cole has the Deverell mob turn on each other. This all happened when Det. Cole had a tape recording of Deverell played back on the phone to his top henchmen Donald Cunningham John M. Jackson. The tape said that his boss was going to turn Cunningham in to save his own behind. That lead to a shootout between the two at the hotel where they were supposed to find both Det. Cole and Campellthe CC boys  as Cunningham trapped Deverell there without knowing that he knew about his plans to doublecross him.The hoods ended up killing themselves with of course the help of Cole  Campbell. Only Cunningham is left for Cole to do in at the end of the movie who after almost beating him almost to death ends up crucifying him! Steven Seagal seems to really enjoy working people over in the movie he does it with such relish and enthusiasm despite his nonviolent Buddhist beliefs. Seagal does it to the point where he beats them in some cases to death even when their no longer a threat to him at all! when all he had to do is just put the cuffs on them and have them locked up behind bars! This isn't by a long shot going to make too many people watching the movie get turned on to Buddhism which I assume the film wanted them to do.".

If your imagination can't stretch that far just watch THE GLIMMER MAN as it's the next worse thing !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!Jack Cole is a cop with a hidden past and it's very ironic that he's played by Steven Seagal since he's also someone witrh a hidden past  but don't tell anyone because it's top secret . Perhaps the biggest secret is how someone like Seagal became a movie star in the first place since THE GLIMMER MAN continues in the vein of all of Seagal's other movies in that it's utter  utter crap . Look at the way he's introduced as his partner walks into his office  Yoi love beads man . In you're in the wrong office  Steven replies with something that is side splittingly witty  or he would if anyone was able to understand a bloody word he said because for much of the movie he just mumbles away . In fact the only time I could make out his dialogue was the scene at the school where he bursts in on the gunman holding the class hostage  Don't make me kill you  Is this what a cop would say to a suicidal gunman ? I'm just thinking that in another movie where Steven isn't the hero  ie A good movie  the cop would say something along the lines of  Don't kill me  I've got a wife and a couple of kids waiting at home  . So anyway suicidal gunman goes to blow his head off but Steven saves his life by hurtling them both through two sets of windows . It goes without saying that you shouldn't try this at homeAs the story progresses Steven  I've given up on calling him Jack though credit to the screen writer for giving Steven a sensible name  becomes involved in a case a plagiarism where someone has been stealing bits out of other superior movies featuring serial killers . As Steven finds more victims you can see him thinking  What was that movie that starred Morgan Freeman as a cop ?  as he inspects the bodies  oh and the action keeps switching back to the hero's domestic life just so we know that this guy's good as a family man  this guy's very good as a family man such a pity he's so bad as a movie star".

	onyx:emotionText "Imagine if you will an alternative universe where someone has made SEVEN where instead of a talented cast and crew they've cast a politically conscious environmentalist and a stand up comedian as the leads . If your imagination can't stretch that far just watch THE GLIMMER MAN as it's the next worse thing !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!Jack Cole is a cop with a hidden past and it's very ironic that he's played by Steven Seagal since he's also someone witrh a hidden past  but don't tell anyone because it's top secret . Perhaps the biggest secret is how someone like Seagal became a movie star in the first place since THE GLIMMER MAN continues in the vein of all of Seagal's other movies in that it's utter  utter crap . Look at the way he's introduced as his partner walks into his office  Yoi love beads man . In you're in the wrong office  Steven replies with something that is side splittingly witty  or he would if anyone was able to understand a bloody word he said because for much of the movie he just mumbles away . In fact the only time I could make out his dialogue was the scene at the school where he bursts in on the gunman holding the class hostage  Don't make me kill you  Is this what a cop would say to a suicidal gunman ? I'm just thinking that in another movie where Steven isn't the hero  ie A good movie  the cop would say something along the lines of  Don't kill me  I've got a wife and a couple of kids waiting at home  . So anyway suicidal gunman goes to blow his head off but Steven saves his life by hurtling them both through two sets of windows . It goes without saying that you shouldn't try this at homeAs the story progresses Steven  I've given up on calling him Jack though credit to the screen writer for giving Steven a sensible name  becomes involved in a case a plagiarism where someone has been stealing bits out of other superior movies featuring serial killers . As Steven finds more victims you can see him thinking  What was that movie that starred Morgan Freeman as a cop ?  as he inspects the bodies  oh and the action keeps switching back to the hero's domestic life just so we know that this guy's good as a family man  this guy's very good as a family man such a pity he's so bad as a movie star";

	schema:headline " Better Than Average Seagal Saga";
	schema:reviewBody "The latest Steven Seagal crime movie The Glimmer Man takes its title from the hero's dexterity and cunning at eliminating his foes before they can retaliate. Devoted fans of the reallife Aikido master will cheer their ponytail hero as he demolishes his usual quota of thuggish villains who richly deserve every slap smack punch and crackle they receive from Seagal as a way of atonement. What might upset them are the many variations that embellish this saga. No The Glimmer Man isn't a messageladen ecological nightmare that Seagal's earlier epic On Deadly Ground was. This Seagal vehicle grafts a creepy whodunit serial killer plot reminiscent of the 1995 Brad Pitt chiller Se7en onto a standardissue police procedural. This time out we're allowed to laugh a little at the antics of Seagal and his newest sidekick LAPD Detective Jim Campbell Keenen Ivory Wayans of A Lone Down Dirty Shame who gets to be the butt of our protagonist's pranks. The script allows Wayans to behave in a fashion that would appear inappropriate for the screen persona of Seagal's indestructible character. For instance we get to see Wayans cry like a baby as he watches Casablanca in a downtown movie palace. Seagal's recent pictures have been overshadowed by his 1992 box office smash Under Siege. The Glimmer Man represents an appeal to a more broadly defined audience but nevertheless it is more a watchable than most of his farfetched fare.Steven Seagal's Glimmer Man character Jack Cole replicates the cop that he played in his cinematic debut Hard to Kill 91988 who had a hazy background as a CIA agent. Here Seagal plays an exCIA assassin who plied his trade during the Vietnam War. As usual Cole suffered from the lone wolf Dirty Harry syndrome. Mystery cloaks Cole so thoroughly that Campbell Wayans cannot decide whether to trust him or arrest him. Gradually our detective heroes discover that their suspicions about the serial murders are correct. They uncover an elaborate CIARussian Mafia plot to smuggle chemical weapons into the U.S. in a most interesting and original manner. Complicating matters is the actual serial slayer Christopher Maynard Stephen Tobolowsky of Momento who lives up to his weirdness. Frank Deverell Bob Gunton of The Shawshank Redemption is Seagal's chief adversary who masterminds the chemical weapons smuggling operation. As a CIA honcho Mr. Smith Brian Cox of The Long Kiss Goodnight brings urbanity and a touch of Dixie to his duplicitous dastard. Cox makes such a impassive but slimy villain that he deserves the abuse that Seagal delivers with glee.The real fun in any Seagal epic is the incredible way that he crushes his adversaries without suffering any payback. Nothing in The Glimmer Man matches the farfetched scene where he escapes the hoodlums right after he emerged from a coma and pushes his own gurney out of the hospital. Another change here is the jokeswapping rapport between Seabal and the impeccably tailored Wayans. Seagal characters aren't known for either their levity or their pranks. They are typically a humorless moribund breed of hero. Keenen Ivory Wayans' presence helps to lighten things up in this bizarre thriller. He gets shot at his apartment blown up and he falls out of a highrise motel window. Wayans looks and dresses ultracool but he gets no more respects and twice the number of bruises than Seagal.Underlying the complicated plot is the budding relationship between Cole and Campbell as they pursue their investigation in its bl00dsplattered pyrotechnical explosive finale. The humor and antics that develop between these two make The Glimmer Man more interesting than the usual Seagal opus. The Glimmer Man is a vast improvement over On Deadly Ground and Under Siege 2 Dark Territory but it is just another potboiler albeit a polished one. The powdered deer penis scene is hilarious.".

I'm not sure these two even have chemistry but they are such an odd couple that somehow I couldn't help but be entertained. Wayans does his usual smartalec schtick while Seagal is some exCIA mystery man who walks around in some sort of nehru outfit with beads around his neck. He proceeds to tell some gangsters that fighting is against his religion. After which he then proceeds to kick their asses to a bloody pulp and even uses a credit card to slice a dude's throat. Haha! Yep that sounds like our ZenBuddhist Mr. NonViolence himself.Seagal is clearly putting on some weight here. But at least his movies are still hitting theaters at this point. Though it's clear that 1996 was the beginning of Seagal's decline. UNDER SIEGE 2 in 1995 was his last great film. Heck that was his best film. But starting with 1996 his films began to flounder. Heck that same year he basically had a cameo in Stuart Baird's exceptional EXECUTIVE DECISION  where he got sucked out into thin air during a botched planetoplane transfer. Kurt Russell ended up saving the day in that one.Anyway it wasn't long before Seagal began to team up with washedup rapperswannabe actors in his films. Then he just went straight do DVD. I guess teaming up with dudes like DMX and Ja Rule is not a good career move. But here in this film this odd combo of Seagal and Wayans somehow works. The story is pretty crap. Heck it's very crap. Something about some Russian mob tied to some rich businessman and the C.I.A. and then some stupid subplot about some religious fanatic killing families. So yes very crap story.But Seagal and Wayans entertained me. And the way Seagal folds his hands across his chest like some Dalai Lama only to then beat a bunch of dudes into a bloody pulp is just a joy to witness. Haha! And the way he beats up these guys is pure comedy! He just tosses them around into walls sharp objects windows etc. without even breaking a sweat. I guess by 1996 Seagal didn't need to use actual aikido skills. He was just in this zenlike state where he could just push a dude and that was enough to maim him. And if that wasn't enough then he would just smack him across the face a few times and that would most certainly kill the sucker. Hilarious!!".

Steven Seagal plays the same kind of character that he has played since Above the Law.  In my opinion the performance of Keenen Ivory Wayans is wasted in such an average film and belongs in a much better film.  Bob Gunton is okay as the main heavy.  The best acting in the entire film belongs to Brian Cox who is very frightening in the role of the murderer. My favorite scenes are the fight scenes with the Russian mafia.  One of the film reasons to see The Glimmer Man1996 is for the brief appearence of the beautiful and voluptupus Nikki Cox.  Its too bad that there were not more scenes with her in them.".

Steven Seagal plays the same kind of character that he has played since Above the Law.  In my opinion the performance of Keenen Ivory Wayans is wasted in such an average film and belongs in a much better film.  Bob Gunton is okay as the main heavy.  The best acting in the entire film belongs to Brian Cox who is very frightening in the role of the murderer. My favorite scenes are the fight scenes with the Russian mafia.  One of the film reasons to see The Glimmer Man1996 is for the brief appearence of the beautiful and voluptupus Nikki Cox.  Its too bad that there were not more scenes with her in them.";

	schema:headline " Dave A Vote For Innocence";
	schema:reviewBody "Another feel good movie from Ivan Reitman? Who'da thunk it? Seriously folks that's not at all a bad thing. Firstly I must say that I am a died in the wool Reitman fan and from that perspective this review may be considered biased. Reitman's nearly incomparable ability to craft sweetly funny heart touching tongue in cheek films is at the core of this movie as well.The premise Dave Kovic Kevin Kline proprietor of an temporary employment agency and part time Presidential impersonator is spotted and recruited by the Secret Service to do a brief body double appearance for current President William Harrison Mitchell at a Washington networking dinner. Although explained to Dave as doubling for the President in exposed situations in reality he is the scandal stopping alibi for Mitchell currently Lewinskiing his secretary Randi a very small part for the tremendously talented Laura Linney. Simple enough until the unthinkable happens Mitchell while in flagrante delicto suffers a massive stroke and becomes completely incapacitated.With a little ingenuity this may have been covered up and smoothed over simply by transferring leadership to the Vice President as specified by law. However White House Chief of Staff Bob Alexander Frank Langella has other ideas entirely. Seizing on the opportunity to obtain his greatest ambition the Presidential office for himself Alexander decides to take matters into his own hands. Enlisting the reluctant aid of Press Secretary Alan Reed Kevin Dunn together they convince Dave that for the good of the country and the world at large he must continue to double for the President until Mitchell recovers from his slight circulatory problem of the head. Suddenly this very down to earth guy finds himself in the most unreal of circumstances thought of by all but a handful of insiders to BE the actual President of the United States.Although smoothly sailing at the start as time passes things begin to become complicated. Dave's naturally sweet personality gentle sense of fun and moral character are by no means similar to Mitchell's and cannot help but surface. Soon the watchdogs of Washington and the American public begin to notice the difference. So does the First Lady. Estranged from her husband although living under the same roof the more time she spends with Dave the more keenly aware she is of the change in her husband. She begins to have her suspicions that all is not as it seems. And Dave becoming more immersed and comfortable in his new role decides to stretch his wings and take a shot at actually DOING the President's job for real much to the growing consternation of Bob Alexander.Now Could this happen in real life? Probably not. With all of the security surveillance and snooping that certainly goes on every day in Washington could the two Pit vipers Alexander and Reed really pull this off? Oh hell no. Would a woman not know her husband even if she confronted him naked in the shower? As as woman I doubt it. We ALWAYS know. But to paraphrase the moderator of The Mclaughlin Report the correct answer is Who cares? This film was never meant to be Murder at 1600 or The Shadow Conspiracy. No think of it more as Air Bud Goes to Washington. A delightful departure from reality. A delicious What if...? story. Reitman films are NEVER believable. That is precisely what makes them so wonderful. Yes this movie asks you to suspend belief for about two hours. Yes it asks you to swallow the idea that Dave could fool not only the First Lady but his cabinet Congress and the country at large. In fact it seems he has convinced everyone except Oliver a delicious cameo appearance by Oliver Stone on Larry King's show.My best advice on Dave Just watch it and love it for what it is. Forget the plot accuracies and the believability factor. Watch the actors who are superb. Part of what makes Reitman films so watchable is the interaction between the players the subtle sub plots and undercurrents to the story. Sigorney Weaver is excellent as First Lady Ellen Mitchell. Kevin Dunn does a marvelous job with the conflicted Alan Reed bound by past misdeeds and present schemes to Bob Alexander yet finding a growing respect and affection for Dave. Ving Rhames is perfectly cast as Duane Stevenson the President's personal Secret Service man. Stoic and unyieldingly correct he also finds himself becoming attached to Kline's easily lovable Dave as does legendary actor Ben Kingsley in his role as Vice President Nance.Kevin Kline as usual turns in a workmanlike performance making Everyman Dave Kovic someone you'd love to have for your own friend. More he makes you wish a guy like him would actually BE elected President. And what do you say about Frank Langella? He's always magnetic. Those deeply penetrating eyes with their deadly glare that softly evil voice. Listen carefully to his dialog. Spoken softly it doesn't do for you to miss his delivery of some of the best lines in the film. His facial expressions say more than ten pages of script could ever. Speaking of facial expressions watch Charles Grodin as Murray Blum Dave's accountant friend especially in the closing scenes of the movie. Hilarious without saying a word.In case you haven't gathered I loved this movie. I've watched it countless times and highly recommend it as a charming witty and touching break from the reality of politics and life in general. Buy this film. You'll be glad you did.".

	onyx:emotionText "Another feel good movie from Ivan Reitman? Who'da thunk it? Seriously folks that's not at all a bad thing. Firstly I must say that I am a died in the wool Reitman fan and from that perspective this review may be considered biased. Reitman's nearly incomparable ability to craft sweetly funny heart touching tongue in cheek films is at the core of this movie as well.The premise Dave Kovic Kevin Kline proprietor of an temporary employment agency and part time Presidential impersonator is spotted and recruited by the Secret Service to do a brief body double appearance for current President William Harrison Mitchell at a Washington networking dinner. Although explained to Dave as doubling for the President in exposed situations in reality he is the scandal stopping alibi for Mitchell currently Lewinskiing his secretary Randi a very small part for the tremendously talented Laura Linney. Simple enough until the unthinkable happens Mitchell while in flagrante delicto suffers a massive stroke and becomes completely incapacitated.With a little ingenuity this may have been covered up and smoothed over simply by transferring leadership to the Vice President as specified by law. However White House Chief of Staff Bob Alexander Frank Langella has other ideas entirely. Seizing on the opportunity to obtain his greatest ambition the Presidential office for himself Alexander decides to take matters into his own hands. Enlisting the reluctant aid of Press Secretary Alan Reed Kevin Dunn together they convince Dave that for the good of the country and the world at large he must continue to double for the President until Mitchell recovers from his slight circulatory problem of the head. Suddenly this very down to earth guy finds himself in the most unreal of circumstances thought of by all but a handful of insiders to BE the actual President of the United States.Although smoothly sailing at the start as time passes things begin to become complicated. Dave's naturally sweet personality gentle sense of fun and moral character are by no means similar to Mitchell's and cannot help but surface. Soon the watchdogs of Washington and the American public begin to notice the difference. So does the First Lady. Estranged from her husband although living under the same roof the more time she spends with Dave the more keenly aware she is of the change in her husband. She begins to have her suspicions that all is not as it seems. And Dave becoming more immersed and comfortable in his new role decides to stretch his wings and take a shot at actually DOING the President's job for real much to the growing consternation of Bob Alexander.Now Could this happen in real life? Probably not. With all of the security surveillance and snooping that certainly goes on every day in Washington could the two Pit vipers Alexander and Reed really pull this off? Oh hell no. Would a woman not know her husband even if she confronted him naked in the shower? As as woman I doubt it. We ALWAYS know. But to paraphrase the moderator of The Mclaughlin Report the correct answer is Who cares? This film was never meant to be Murder at 1600 or The Shadow Conspiracy. No think of it more as Air Bud Goes to Washington. A delightful departure from reality. A delicious What if...? story. Reitman films are NEVER believable. That is precisely what makes them so wonderful. Yes this movie asks you to suspend belief for about two hours. Yes it asks you to swallow the idea that Dave could fool not only the First Lady but his cabinet Congress and the country at large. In fact it seems he has convinced everyone except Oliver a delicious cameo appearance by Oliver Stone on Larry King's show.My best advice on Dave Just watch it and love it for what it is. Forget the plot accuracies and the believability factor. Watch the actors who are superb. Part of what makes Reitman films so watchable is the interaction between the players the subtle sub plots and undercurrents to the story. Sigorney Weaver is excellent as First Lady Ellen Mitchell. Kevin Dunn does a marvelous job with the conflicted Alan Reed bound by past misdeeds and present schemes to Bob Alexander yet finding a growing respect and affection for Dave. Ving Rhames is perfectly cast as Duane Stevenson the President's personal Secret Service man.

	schema:headline " One of my favorites of the 1990's";
	schema:reviewBody "Of all the movies about the President released in the 1990's Dave was the first and the best. Kevin Kline plays a dual role. He plays President Bill Mitchell and Dave Kovic a lookalike for the chief executive. When he is asked to fill in for him as a decoy he jumps to serve his nation. However the real Bill Mitchell suffers a stroke and lays comatose. That's when the White House Chief of Staff Bob Frank Langella and the Press Secretary Alan Kevin Dunn convince Dave to stay on. According to them the Vice President Ben Kingsley is mentally unbalanced. Dave being naive falls for it. However they do not count on a generally nice guy wanting to really play the part of chief executive. He figures out their plan and turns the table wanting to do real public policy that will make a true difference. Sigourney Weaver plays the estranged First Lady who must be kept in the dark which is half the battle during this wonderful comedy. I liked this movie on so many levels. The first was that this movie was not silly slapstick humor like First Kid nor did it resort to preachiness and making a political point in The American President. Dave also did not rely on excessive action in Air Force One. Instead we have the basic idea that if we get good honest people elected to office good things will happen. Almost Capraesquire the film is earnest not wanting to push one political agenda over another. What makes this message work is the restrained direction of Ivan Reitman and the subtle yet honest performance of Kevin Kline one of the best actors ever. One of the most entertaining aspect of this movie is watching actual members of Congress the Washtingon Press Corps and popular entertainment making cameos. This is what gave the movie a sense of realism. Finally Reitman helps the audience fall for the plot. He makes it so believable honest and true. In the end the audience will realize that politics will not mend our nation but rather honest people will. In any case of all the movies about the President this is the best one.".

LOLThis is one of the few movies I will watch any time it comes on and I enjoy it just as much every time I see it.".

The segment toward the end of the film when he and Sigourney Weaver are pulled over for the turn violation and they do their version of Tomorrow from Annie is absolutely hilarious. This is one of those films that for some reason or another I keep going back to watch every so often mainly because of its entertainment and values orientation. Our President and Congressional Delegations should care more about us than themselves. I'm still waiting but I haven't seen that happen yet nor have I seen a movie about the President of Slovenia.

The characters were believable though Kevin Kline easily outshines the others. Playing someone who you have to convince could be the President of the United States is very very difficult yet he does it so flawlessly that you really believe that he is the President  or could be. One of my favorite movies and I've watched it several times and will watch it again in the future. 10 stars for this one!!".

The rest of the cast doesn't much matter. They are decent if never amazing. It's a lightweight movie and to demand much beyond the gags and feel good qualities isn't fair to it.Does it hold up twenty years after it was made? Oddly yes. You might not even notice it's a bit outdated on the fringes. Politics in some ways has not changed a bit. And the idea of body doubles for the U.S. President is still in currency see Vantage Point for starters. Of course the notion of a secretive government that might pull of a huge scam isn't farfetched at all except of course that you hope it actually is farfetched outside of Hollywoodsee Wag the Dog for starters.There is also the use of lots of real people to bolster the idea that it's real or could be real. Some are identified senators and other celebrities from the era so if you don't recognize them you should at least trust that these people are not actors. But there are a number like 20 or 30 of other real people playing themselves including Oliver Stone. In case you don't know him Stone is being interviewed on Larry King Live with the real Larry King and he says that they've studied photos of the new president and that it's a conspiracy. This is really one of the many little hilarious lines because Stone of course is famous for hatching or nurturing conspiracy theories for his movies. His JFK came out just two years earlier.The other fun one most people will miss and this dates me is running into an unidentified Tip O'Neill on the streets. He was the real speaker of the house and it's a great little three seconds. He dies the following year.Okay the movie isn't brilliant. But it never gets stale and it's well made enough to survive even a curmudgeon without popcorn. It'll make you laugh.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the trivia it says Warren Beatty and Kevin Costner turned down the lead. Obviously the script must have been great to attract so many high powered cameos so we must assume they had the humility to realize they were not right for the role. But Kevin Kline was perfect as was everyone else particularly the lovely Sigourney Weaver and the snarling Frank Langella. Everyone associated with this movie should be very proud of what they created a truly great movie.I was thinking just the other night about a top 10 list of movies that I can watch over and over and that still work every time. Dave would be on it along with North by Northwest and The Producers. But Dave produces a different emotional response than these two it is closer to The Princess Bride in that it is a very pleasant movie that makes you feel good even when you feel bad. The script of Dave is fantastic with lots of memorable lines and the plot has more hairpin turns than the Alaska Highway. But it is the movie's effectiveness in producing emotional responses to various scenes that sets it apart. The ending is especially powerful. Great directing writing and acting!Dave has elements of The Prince and the Pauper Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and Superman the latter because you have to suspend your disbelief that the public won't recognize Dave. Also for those too young to remember former vice president Nelson Rockefeller died while having sex with a young mistress an obvious inspiration for the story. The story also bears some resemblance to President Bill Clinton's escapades but those came later. During the premiere of Frank Capra's Mr. Smith half of Washington walked out of the theater in outrage over the portrayal of corruption which probably cut a bit too close to the truth for some of them. This time half of Washington appeared in the film! Capra died two years before Dave was released but I am sure he would have enjoyed it and been delighted to see the Capra style continued so beautifully by Ivan Reitman and Gary Ross. If you haven't seen Dave you must watch it. And if you have watch it again. And again. And again. You will enjoy it every time. Unless perhaps you are a crooked politician.".

Often that's what I crave in a movie and this one really hits the spot. Kevin Kline is an extraordinary ordinary guy who finds himself catapulted into a major role none other than President of the United States when the President's chief handlers discover he's a dead ringer for the man in the top job who suddenly becomes incapacitated. The arrogant and malevolent Chief of Staff played by the Frank Langella has ideological differences with the Vice President and decides to pull the rug on him so he cons the American people including the Congress and the press corps into accepting a lookalike who he can control. Or so he thinks. At first the trick seems to work but it works too well. The new man in the Oval Office has great talent as an actor a great sense of humour and enormous people skills. Just what people want in a president. However he has the courage to follow his good instincts. When the chief of staff tries to railroad him into blocking legislation from Congress for programs he likes he calls in his best friend and number cruncher played by Charles Grodin to work out a way of finding money to fund homeless shelters including one he had just visited. Deciding to do things his own way leads to a huge conflict which plays out in highly amusing and often heartwarming ways. Sigourney Weaver the estranged First Lady of the exPresident finds she has much in common with the new man in charge which leads to some interesting complications. I've always liked this leading lady and she plays the role to a tee. There are on screen appearances by Arnold Schwartzenager and veteran press corps member Helen Thomas. We also see cutaways to Tip O'Neill Speaker of the House being interviewed on the street also Oliver Stone talking to Larry King as on a the real Larry King Live talk show saying the whole thing is a conspiracy. Clever script and editing! I like movies that have something to say but also ones that are great at entertaining and this one fits the bill.".

	schema:headline " Great Tenor in SoSo Operatic Adaptation";
	schema:reviewBody "I write here as a moviegoer for about 70 years and an operalover for 65 of those years. This is an interesting film mainly because it is the only opera or anything close to same that Richard Tauber ever filmed which is unfortunate as he was one of the great opera stars of his time and THE great tenor operetta and lieder specialist of that time. Although the only two previous reviews appearing here pretty much rate the excellence of the film correctly there are other things of interest to know about it. The leading lady Steffi Duna was Hungarian and filmed this while on a quick sojourn from Hollywood where she had and would continue to appear to no particular effect in a number of films but ultimately marry the much underrated Dennis O'Keefe and pretty much retire from acting at that point. The second leading lady Diana Napier had only just become Mrs. Richard Tauber around the time this was filmed and they would remain married if muchseparated by the war and occasional domestic problems until his death in 1948. Tauber made about a dozen films between his German and English output and while no Hollywood matine idol he was certainly an idol to all who loved operetta but most probably to the women who did so. Like Barbra Streisand he made up for his looks with a very great talent. However there is a bit of misleading commentary in the other entries shown here that should be corrected Enrico Caruso did not make PAGLIACCI famous he simply was the greatest Canio of his time and he did not record the opera only two arias from it. It is also lamented that Caruso did no films as far as is known in the electrical recording process. The qualifier there is unnecessary as Caruso died in 1921 and real experiments in electrical recording did not come until 1923 the process wasn't introduced into studio recordings until 1925 nor into films until 192627 with the Vitaphone shorts and of course THE JAZZ SINGER. Lastly opinions can vary greatly but one writer's comment that Tauber was a good if not great tenor could be taken two ways but I think he meant simply that Tauber was a good but not a great tenor. Also that he was not up to the singing demands of this opera. Well the general consensus amongst critics musicians and audiences was and remains that he was one of the very great tenors of the 20th century and while he may not have been up to the film demands of this production which might also be blamed on the director since he was up to the usual film demands in his other 11 films he was certainly up to the vocal ones for among the grand total of 97 complete operatic and operetta roles he sang on stage Canio was one he did any number of times at the Vienna State Opera and possibly in Germany as well Tauber's career was much inhibited and incredibly peripatetic thanks to Adolf Hitler. Indeed he regularly sang even heavier roles than Canio including Calaf in the German premiere of TURANDOT Don Jose in CARMEN and Pedro in TIEFLAND while simultaneously being recognized as THE outstanding Mozart tenor of the first half of the 20th century all of the foregoing quite apart from his operetta concert and film activity. Incidentally after Peter Dawson and John McCormack he was the most prolifically recorded classical singer of the entire 78rpm era leaving some 735 published sides and he was also a regular conductor of the London Philharmonic during the years Sir Thomas Beecham decided to spend in America. These accomplishments should be noted in any evaluation of such a very great artist. Would that this filming of the PAGLIACCI story came up to some of his other activities but it is a solidly sung and acted performance throughout. Incidentally the great film version of PAGLIACCI was done in Italy in the late 1940s with a very young Gina Lollobrigida acting the part of Nedda but not despite claims to the contrary actually singing it the claims were given some currency because Lollobrigida did possess a reasonable semblance of a soprano voice but the actual singer was Onelia Fineschi. If the people making the Tauber version had seen this one first  a chronological impossibility of course  they might simply have folded their tents and gone home.".

It is based on Leoncavallo's opera with a couple of small changes  here Canio the leader of a Commedia dell'Arte troupe playing Pagliaccio is not so jealous of her wife at first getting worse when instigated by rejected Tonio another actor who is not humpbacked like in the original play. Nedda the detached wife playing Colombina starts an affair with a young cadet and plans to run away with him. The dramatic intensity grows to a climax during the Commedia dell'Arte performance so this is a play inside the play. If you like this opera you'll probably like this film as it has the famed arias and is well staged with a good production design. It has even some early color sequences in the introduction and climatic scenes. The image quality of the existing copies is quite awful but if you are fond of opera andor Richard Tauber it is a curiosity if not one of his best films.

	schema:reviewBody "This comment discusses the English versionBROTHER SUN SISTER MOON was the first film I had seen in my life. I was 10 at the time when it was on Polish TV before 1989 such films were censored by communists. The feelings I had are hard to express with words. I loved everything about it music story cast scenery everything.Now in 2004 when I see it again I must admit that most of its splendor is gone. Where is this admiration? ... However in spite of some faded emotions it is still a film which I consider pleasure seeing again. Is there something magical about it?I think that what makes me personally fond of it are four most basic factors the director himself Franco Zeffirelli whom I have always admired for his artistic soul the story far from the true but still moving and retaining the gist of Francesco's life  love to God and His creatures the music by Ken Thorne and sung by Donovan especially the title song and scenery in which the movie was shot.Franco Zeffirelli chose excellent cast. Graham Faulkner was very much like Saint Francis these profound eyes smile full of love. WONDERFUL. Alec Guiness was also excellent. His role of pope Innocent is really unforgettable. Others including Lee Montague Pietro Bernardone Leigh Lawson Bernardo and Valentina Cortese Pica also give memorable performances. Whenever I watch other films about Francesco I can't get used to other faces than theirs from this film.The story is very different. I don't know why Zeffirelli changed it so much. In fact Francesco did not leave his family like that. What is more he was a great Lover of the Holy Cross which I can't find in this film. However one forgets about all these mistakes when the scene with the pope comes on screen. A Polish movie critic said that it is the most moving scene in the history of cinema. This viewpoint is definitely overdone but there is some truth in it. The mosaic of Monreale Pantocrator looking deeply into everyone's eyes pope's dream and second calling of Francesco and finally his blessing to the amazement of others  the film is worth watching for thanks to this scene alone. You will not regret.The last factor scenery is also worth considering. Film's Assisi is a lovely Italian town of San Gimignano the hills of Umbria are replaced by Piano Grande a parish church of Assisi by an old medieval abbey of Sant' Antimo and finally a Roman basilica  the cathedral of Monreale  a real masterpiece of Norman  Byzantine art in Sicily 10 kilometers from Palermo. The locations in which this film was shot are indeed one of the best ever.Finally if the above advantages did not fully talk for this movie there is one more  its message. The message of love forgiveness and respect for nature is extremely important nowadays. Films which promote it and one of them is undoubtedly BROTHER SUN SISTER MOON are a real treasure of cinema. And this movie does it mostly by the power of flower and song.I will end this review with a prayer of Saint Francis. Think about it. If we all copy these words to our lives the world will be much better to live inLord make me an instrument of your peaceWhere there is hatred let me sow LOVE Where there is injury let me sow PARDON Where there is doubt let me sow FAITHThis is in GIVING that WE RECEIVE This is in PARDONING that we are PARDONEDThis is in DYING that we are BORNTHAT WE ARE BORN TO ETERNAL LIFE!!!".

Hence the raggedbutlyrical cinematography by Ennio Guarnieri fractured editing by Reginald Mills and the use of contemporary  but strangely timeless  folk songs written and performed by Donovan all of which conjures the requisite mood of spiritual awakening whilst simultaneously dating the movie quite firmly within its period. Cynics will hate it while others will embrace Zeffirelli's defiant romanticism. Daringly Zeffirelli's script cowritten by Suso Cecchi d'Amico and Lina Wertmuller contrasts Francis' piety and virtue with the bloated pomp of official Church doctrine weighed down by internal politics and social indifference though it's difficult to gauge if this represents a veiled attack on Christian orthodoxy or is simply a reflection of Francis' dismissal of outdated customs in favor of a return to Nature.Lovingly crafted by Lorenzo Mongiardino art direction and Danilo Donati costumes the movie is toplined by a cast of gifted newcomers and screen veterans including Judi Bowker one of the most beautiful actresses of her generation Leigh Lawson Kenneth Cranham Valentina Cortese and Alec Guinness. But the film derives much of its strength from Faulkner as the young battlescarred nobleman laid low by his wartime experiences who emerges from the horrors of conflict with a completely new and spiritual outlook on life. Faulkner was one of a handful of young actors including FELLINISATYRICON's Hiram Keller and LISA AND THE DEVIL's Alessio Orano who emerged from European cinema in the 1970's handsome and talented in equal measure to burn brightly and briefly before disappearing into relative obscurity. Here Faulkner's intense beauty and freshfaced innocence are illuminated by Guarnieri's worshipful camera and Zeffirelli's attentive direction which places him centerstage throughout there's even a generous PGlevel nude scene halfway through the movie. This was Faulkner's cinematic debut and while Zeffirelli couldn't have made a better choice for such a crucial role the director later described him as slightly aloof from his fellow actors which may explain his subsequent retreat from showbusiness. But here his grace and dignity are displayed in abundance and it's hard not to fall in love with him every time he appears onscreen.The alternative Italian version FRATELLO SOLE SORELLA LUNA runs approximately 14 minutes longer and replaces Donovan's music with a fully orchestral score by Riz Ortolani. In related events editor Mills produced a 16mm documentary entitled FRANCO ZEFFIRELLI A FLORENTINE ARTIST 1973 compiled from footage shot during the making of the movie featuring a lengthy interview with the director himself.".

	schema:reviewBody "Upon seeing this movie in my young 20s I fell in love metaphorically speaking with St. Francis of Assisi and the simple message of life that he practiced. Though many of the absolute facts were stretched like in most historic films the movie was completely on the mark about his simplicity and his love of nature and mankind. In addition it gave a very plausible and probable glimpse of the love relationship he had with St. Clare all in contrast with the idea of love and sexuality which we have in these times.Though the Italian version soundtrack was not by Donovan the English language songs he sang gave the movie great focus and support. I often wondered why it was only issued on vinyl in Italy which is how I discovered Donovan's songs were not present. The music is sensitive and wonderful.Both young actors Bowker  Faulkner fill their roles with perfection. Bowker is one of the most beautiful and sensitive young actresses of that period so it is with wonder that she was not more utilized or popular.Yes the film does have the allegorical connection with the hippie movement but that does not diminish the story nor the impact. In fact rather it parallels our times and served to connect me with the times of Francis if that is possible.Finally Zeffirelli deserves a thanks for tackling this saint with compelling zeal passion sensitivity and panache. As another reviewer here noted the scenery will blow you away. And as a child of the 50s who grew up in the late 60s this movie offset the idea of love having to be of a sexual nature and elevated love to a plane where it becomes transcendent and transforming. Isn't that what love is supposed to do in our lives? I have had my own 2 sons watch it with me more than once as they were growing up and they are mid20s now.It will be a hard film to find but is viewable for any age without reservations and is well worth the search. It is now available on DVD for around 10 or less.".

It may make the movies seem dated but that also is a sign of mastership as we see the life of Francis and also see life in the Vietnam era 1970s. The movie itself is hauntingly filmed in a dreamlike manner. It tells the story of Francis who we will later know as Saint Francis Of Assissi. It is not an attempt to tell the complete story of the saint but to use episodes from his life to speak to the culture of the time. It is not a biography so much as it is an interpretation.".

It is simple with a folksong quality that I think fits with Saint Francis's teachings. I only wish there were a soundtrack available I'd buy it in a heartbeat. I agree with the other commentator that there is nothing really new added to the story of Saint Francis however the story is a good story without something new added to it. I do wish that the film could have been a bit grittier what I mean is sometimes in the film Saint Francis comes across as if he were so kind and gentle that he is floating or mindless. I wish the film could have shown the harsh realities that Saint Francis would have faced. Overall the film is beautiful. Don't miss it.".

The rythm of the movie is what I enjoy most.  It is like a great symphony with rising action that compliments the wonderful music by Donovan.This is a film that is totally captive to its time and place.

	schema:reviewBody "Three things of interest here.The first is cinematic. I am engaged in a movie indexing project that will likely go open source. There are a few beginning qualities I've been working on. I think I will add architectural cloth as this film reminds me. Its main cinematic device  other than the ordinary ones  is the use of cloth to denote notions of eye story vision. There are four specific episodes here as well as the general acting style where the actors have been directed to act into their clothes.The second is largely historical and probably will only be appreciated by old farts like me. I can't quite explain the extent of the Beatles influence on the late sixties. There just hasn't been anything like it since then. They were more than admired and emulated they were spiritual leaders. They were serious about this if not altogether willing and that comment about being more popular than Jesus wasn't an offhand statement. In 1968 they were in Rishikesh India seriously putting together something that they thought was attuned to cosmic structure. It was in a sense. With them were a few Beach Boys and Donovan.Around this time they were approached by Zeffirelli to take roles in his Brother Moon project. They would have Paul was the fellow behind the movie projects and most else and he truly wanted to. But this was the time of the breakup. So what happened was Zefferelli make the film with ordinary actors and Donovan's music composed with The Beatles at Rishikesh. So at least this is an echo of the profound influence they had perhaps as profound as Francis and perhaps as compromised by the surrounding institutions.The third has to do with the church. How strange it is that the two most spiritually deep Biblical films in my experience were made by two gay Italians. These were men Zeffirelli and Pasolini not welcome in their chosen world in fact persecuted for their being persecuted by their own faith. And they would be even more today as the leadership has gotten tough with queers.Lots of lessons here. I first saw this by an aesthetic hippie in about 73 who was carrying a worn print around from town to town to show it in coffeehouses small ashrams and any alley he could find a spot in.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:headline " Some comments about the DVD the screenplay the actor.";
	schema:reviewBody "Just a few comments to add to the many fine comments already written by people who like this movie as I do.The DVD is very good overall for its quality of sound and color. The subtitles include neither any Latin nor the lyrics for any of the songs performed by someone offscreen but the captions are nearly perfect including all the lyrics and lacking only the Latin. The following numbers about the shape of the screen are my own best guesses. The original movie was presented in a 1.661 about 53  159 aspect ratio but the DVD version is made to fit a modern 169 wide screen about 1.771 though a previous reviewer gives 1.751 as the ratio for the movie. In order to do this 116th about 7 of the vertical had to be shavedoff the original movie some was taken from the top and some from the bottom. This definitely hurts a few of the scenes but overall people who like this movie should be very happy to have the DVD.In the scene just before the meeting with the pope a former friend of Francis chases after him and tries to convince him not to go to Rome. The former friend begins to insult Francis and his way of life. This short speech is excellent writing as is much of the rest of the screenplay. It ends with this You just saunter out of your house one fine morning and pluck God out of the air as easily as catching a butterfly. It's all too simple! This line may not have been nominated for the AFI top 100 list this year but it is one of the finest I've ever heard in a movie. I don't know whether it is original with this screenplay or was borrowed from tradition.Some layorder Third Order Franciscans told me that they object to the role of Francis being done in this movie by a gay actor. Other people object to Francis being portrayed as a flowerchild. My own understanding is that indeed there is no reason to think that the real Francis was gay and that he was probably not so pretty or so much like a 1960s flowerchild as presented in the movie. But I do not agree with those abovementioned objections the movie does a very good job of dramatizing in a lyrical way the spirit and times of Francis.".

Yes it is a movie of the flower children but it is sincere and faultless. After so many viewings I even got used to Donovan! Zeffirelli did a wonderful job of directing bringing out beautiful pieces of acting from all.

Such a movie could only have been made in the early '70's!All flippancy aside though this is a stunningly beautiful movie which captures the joyous and generous spirit of Il Povorello himself.  Although some of the more severe aspects of Francis' life are not ignored his vision of Christ's sufferings and his fearfully tough asceticism for example these are downplayed in favor of Francis' joy in creation and his almost limitless love for God.  The sense of time and place are also beautifully portrayed.Even so watching this movie one can't forget that it was made in 1972. The movie drips with the sensibility of that time and Francis' opponents are twodimensional characters meant to represent the Establishment. It's so plastic man!  Bishop Guido is given particularly short shrift here the real life bishop was very sympathetic to Francis and gave him more support and understanding than the movie would have us think.Minor complaints though.  This movie definitely has its heart in the right place.".

	schema:reviewBody "Once upon a time as legend would have it there was a time when we set aside our material concerns and lived in harmony and brotherhood. This was not in the time of Francis but in that period from the Summer of Love until the Nixon resignation. Although this period encompassed about as much of the seventies we now refer to it as The Sixties.Much good came of this time but there were also many simplistic expressions of its spirit. Such is Brother Sun Sister Moon which is not really about Francis at all but uses Francis as a metaphor to express the ideals of the Flower Power movement. With his love of nature and his will to eschew the trappings of material acquisition Francis was the patron saint of the Woodstock era. In essence this movie is Hair without the hair.Viewed through today's more cynical prism the movie seems laughably naive. I didn't laugh but I cringed in embarrassment many times. I think the worst moment must be the anachronism when Francis and his little congregation sing Donovan songs at their country Mass this is contrasted to the somber opulent silent ritual of the official Mass in town. In effect they start to sing along with the musical score. Remember folk masses? Francis invented them.Donovan the ultimate hippie wrote the entire musical score and I must say it is the single worst score I have ever heard in a movie. What could have possessed Zefferelli to use this music exclusively?The script is among the worst I have ever encountered. It is nothing but the cliches ripped from the Lives of the Saints that can be found in any Catholic elementary school library. There is not one original or thoughtful moment. The acting catches no complexities or nuances at all. Francis and Chiara are straight out of a high school play ... an idealized concept of innocence like the faces in a Keane painting. Any Franciscan viewing this movie would question his vocational choice of belonging to an order founded by a simpleton.The good news is that the movie was filmed by Zefferelli. Whatever other faults it may have it ranks as among the BEST filmed movies you'll see. Virtually any single frame could be extracted and made into an awardwinning photograph. There is no randomness nothing is left to chance. Every camera angle ever zoom the placement of every extra in every frame is perfectly calculated and choreographed. Watch it in stopmotion and you'll be dazzled by the composition of each image. Incidentally I think the real St Francis would probably have said you may set up your camera but we'll just be ourselvesIf I had a brilliant period script I would gladly hire Zefferelli to film it. Unfortunately for Zefferelli Shakespeare didn't write a script pertaining to this subject.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film gives us an ideal figure of a Christian. Yes Francesco of Assisi is a true follower of Christ. He is a spiritual disciple of Yeshua Ben Yosef Jesus. The movie tells us about it beautifully. Francesco was a Crusader. When he returned from the holy land he realizes that war and killing is wrong even if it's done by the name of God. Just like the sage that experience enlightenment Francesco aware that Jesus Himself abandon luxurious materials and become poor. Francois also aware that even birds got food everyday without need to twine work. He rejects the material pursuit of Catholic Church authorities and his society. Then he establishes his own monastery and in the end the Pope himself sees that Francois is a right person. For me this movie is worth to see for every spiritual seeker. I enjoy the scene when Francois do full nudity in front of inhabitants and force them to throw away their gold and other extravagant stuffs. I also enjoy when in the end Pope Innocent III bow in front of Francesco and kiss his feet. The pretty panorama of Italian mountains and flower plain is attracted me so much. Nothing technically novel from this film. It's more Hollywood than NeoRealism. It's easy to understand yet it is so poetic. I very recommended this movie for everyone who wants to followbe acquainted with Christ. Brother Sun and Sister Moon can help you awaken your sleeping heart. Brother Wind and Sister Air can sublime your awareness. Just hear their tunes".

Then he establishes his own monastery and in the end the Pope himself sees that Francois is a right person. For me this movie is worth to see for every spiritual seeker. I enjoy the scene when Francois do full nudity in front of inhabitants and force them to throw away their gold and other extravagant stuffs. I also enjoy when in the end Pope Innocent III bow in front of Francesco and kiss his feet. The pretty panorama of Italian mountains and flower plain is attracted me so much. Nothing technically novel from this film. It's more Hollywood than NeoRealism. It's easy to understand yet it is so poetic. I very recommended this movie for everyone who wants to followbe acquainted with Christ. Brother Sun and Sister Moon can help you awaken your sleeping heart. Brother Wind and Sister Air can sublime your awareness. Just hear their tunes";

	schema:reviewBody "Brother Sun Sister Moon is as refreshing today as it was when it was first released in 1972! In our rather cynical world of today when it seems that the only fare available on the big screen contains an overabundance of violence brashness and materialism it is still a joy to behold this bright outstanding and enlightening montage of Franco Zeffirelli's homage to St. Francis of Assisi. With beautiful colorful cinematography of the Umbrian and Tuscan country sides augmented by fine performances and skillful scenarios this production is a wondrous blend which totally celebrates the life of a mystical man who revered the Creator through nature. Graham Faulkner's portrayal of St. Francis is sensitive and moving running the gamut from madness to spiritual ecstasy to the realization of the virtues of simplicity. The young actor's sterling performance is one which will always be remembered through this film. All of the supporting players turn in credible performances especially Judi Bowker Valentina Cortese Kenneth Cranham Michael Feast Leigh Lawson and of course Sir Alec Guinness. This film was produced during an era when some Biblical stories were explored and exhibited as flower child scenarios on the stage and on the screen. In St. Francis' time there were many troubadours who roamed throughout Europe as the only musical entertainment for the populace. Donovan's songs in the American version of the film are reminiscent of the Flower ChildHippie troubadours of the 1960's and the 1970's with lyrics that are beautifully melded in some instances with actual words of the First Franciscan so what better music would be so perfectly representative of the Peace and Love which St. Francis practiced? Donovan's lyrics are not used in the Italian version of the film rather the lilting original score was created by Riz Ortolani and it works just as well. Ortolani's score weaves in and out of the American version with Donovan's songs and the complete Italian version is available on CD. My only regret about the production is the fact that Donovan's memorable songs in this film were never released in an audio soundtrack recording. I would certainly like to have a CD of the Donovan score to play in my automobile if only to create a sense of serenity while driving in the rude and meanspirited traffic of Los Angeles! Even though it is a bit dated in its flower child style this film remains a truly inspiring and enlightening cinema masterpiece a celebration of youthful original innocence.".

There is a real emphasis on quality screen writing here which only comes through on a small ratio of films. The characters could easily have become 2 dimensional stereotypes but instead given some interesting dialogue and motives science military etc. Yes it is cheesy and I think many people label it as a cheap and tacky 80's movie but having watched it again recently I think history may well judge it a minor classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "There have been many films that claim they can entertain audiences of all ages. Indeed this seems to be the most profitable kind of film to make with the familyoriented often translating to the lowest common denominator. There is a rare kind of film in this oversaturated market however. Namely the film that claims it can entertain an audience in almost any age bracket and really can deliver on this promise. I know how this sounds so bear with me a moment.Short Circuit is at heart a comedy about what happens when a robot designed to replace a special forces soldier is struck by lightning and starts to believe he is a living entity. Much of the rest of the film revolves around either Number 5's attempts to evade capture by the people who made him or his attempts to convince the people he meets of the truly wonderful thing that has happened to him. Ally Sheedy and Steve Guttenberg provide an excellent support cast that does a first rate job of interacting with the character. This was one of the first films to show human actors engaging in conversation with what was essentially a fullscale puppet and it remains one of the best. With brilliant voice acting by Tim Blaney Number 5 seems more human than some of the other actors in the film especially G.W. Bailey. They must have had a special on Police Academy alumni that year.Speaking of Police Academy the let's rip the front seats out and sit in the back joke gets a couple of references here. In fact a few old classics get a good reference in this effort. Interestingly enough the Three Stooges short that is shown and imitated in a couple of sequences is called Woman Haters. Go figure. The one weakness of the film is that it seems primarily constructed around a few puppeteering or special effects sequences. The use of the laser beams here seems very dated by modern standards and the computers would look unbelievable if I hadn't personally seen the computers that were available to the public and business around this year.Sadly they do not make films like this anymore. In this day and age where every film has to be made as expensively as possible and even films aimed at children seem segmented nobody seems willing to consider that the adults in the audience might need to be entertained too. Which is a real pity. Films like Short Circuit have the ability to appeal to this viewer even more now that he is twentysomething years old than was the case when he was eight years old. I doubt that anyone who turns twentysix in 2020 is going to same the same about the Pokemon or other such mindnumbing singledigitageonly crap that is being churned out.I gave Short Circuit an eight out of ten. It is starting to show its age but as a relic of the mid1980s it also shows that there were people asking questions about the advancement of technology. Indeed on the basis of films like Short Circuit I am almost willing to regard the 1980s as the last bastion of creativity in the mainstream film industry. Give it a look expecting a film about more than money and you may be pleasantly surprised.".

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't seen Short Circuit for some time now but it is such a huge milestone in my childhood that I have to say something about it. Maturer audiences will have a hard time overlooking some of the childish nuances of the movie but it is such a fun and entertaining family film that all of those things can be easily forgiven. It reminds me of other wonderful family films like Flight of the Navigator and The Goonies that I used to watch over and over when I was a kid. I feel like I've lost something when I can't think of a single movie now that I love so much that I will watch it a few times a week. Maybe I just am more aware of the time involved in watching the same movie over and over today than I used to be. Johnny 5 is a robot designed for military use until one day it's struck by lightning and apparently comes to life. This is a pretty tired formula something manmade suddenly displaying lifelike qualities and wanting to be recognized as a real boy but it's accompanied by some clever messages about the advancement of technology particularly technology designed to replace humans which has always been seen as a bit of a dangerous idea criticized brilliantly by everyone from Charlie Chaplin to James Cameron. Johnny 5's adventures involve his efforts to avoid capture by the people who made him NOVA! No!! while at the same time trying to prove to the world that he's a living entity now. They could not make a movie like this today. Sadly CGI has forever replaced the need to create a physical robot like the one that plays Johnny 5 in this movie so any Short Circuit that was made today would just be some soulless digital effect cavorting across the screen instantly forgettable. But here he's really there and he's heavy and clumsy and metallic but so memorable as a movie character that I've recently read that the actual robot prop was sold for something like 500000. Now THAT is a fan!Steve Guttenberg and Ally Sheedy have a cute chemistry on screen that is satisfactorily simple. They are both cookiecutter caricatures Sheedy the lonely Stephanie who drives an icecream truck for a living and Guttenberg plays a scientist named Newton who works for the evil NOVA but who only needs a cute icecream lady and a charming robot to change his evil ways. Sound like fun? No? Well it is trust me. The film has definitely dated but I'll take special effects that look dated 20 years later over expensive CGI that never looked real in the first place any day. A lot of films claim to be fun for all ages but Short Circuit is one of the few that really is. It's too bad that movies like this seem to be gone forever now.".

	schema:reviewBody "Short Circuit is an offthewall comedy about a series of robots made of the military. They sort of resemble Conky from the old Pee Wee's Play House series. One of the robots 'Number Five' escapes and finds sanctuary in the home of Stephanie Speck Allly Sheedy a nice lady with a soft spot for runaways. Speck becomes good friends with 'Number Five' who begins to take on a lot of human characteristics transcending the static life of a robot or the hostile life of a military weapon which is what the robots were designed for. Speck learns that Number Five's owners are looking for him but she knows that the military would only destroy Number Five or terminate the emotional drive that he has developed. Number Five's designer Newton Crosby Guttenberg and his silly assistant Ben Jabituya Stevens have yet to appreciate what Number Five has achieved as a shell of wires and controls able to take on human qualities but soon they too will join Speck in the quest to save 'Number Five.' Some of it is kind of reminscint of other 80s scifi movies like 'Batteries Not Included' and 'E.T.' There's two issues at work in this movie. The first and obvious one being about the development of human emotion and would it be possible for anything to gain an understanding and appreciation for it? And the second being the ethics of military useage. Plus it's your standard 80s love and friendship story. Because of the story and the sharp wit comedy and sarcasm it's makes for good comedy. I haven't seen the sequel in a long time but I do remember enjoying it almost as much as the first. I think that's because 'Number Five' is such a funny loveable robot.If you like the theme of this movie I recommend seeing the hilarious comedy 'Making Mr. Right' which is about a robot designed for space exploration rather than military use. But the robot begins to take on human emotions while the owner becomes increasingly more like a robot. It's from Susan Siedleman the director of 'Desperately Seeking Susan.'".

But the robot begins to take on human emotions while the owner becomes increasingly more like a robot. It's from Susan Siedleman the director of 'Desperately Seeking Susan.'";

I'm not going to spoil the movie as to what makes the ending great but I liked the way the movie ended.I also think that the type of people who would enjoy this movie are the people who feel like Newton Crosby. He's devoted his entire life to something science and technology just to have others who used to be devoted to it steal it all away from him. It's almost like the whole movie you want to score one for the little guy. Most of us have been there at some point in our lives. This movie kind of captures that and if you watch the movie with that intent it does keep the viewer intrigued.The movie also makes you appreciate what your life is when you see just what the robot can do and you realize just what your mind is capable of.All in all I think I found it a lot more touching than it should have been because it was 315am when I started watching it and I THINK I watched the movie Pi right before it.".

What was called the sequel...should have been kept under wraps.I really do wish they would revisit the idea of a sequel for Number 5...this is one robot that deserves another chance at a far better script than what he was given in the 2nd movie.But going back to the original. Very good job for his supporting cast. Steve and Ally were excellent. I don't think they could have picked better to be in this movie. I still see and still laugh at the ex boyfriend getting his boot heels shot off...his belt and brim of his hat...the look on his face as he saw his precious car taken apart...not Number 5's fault he had left the Chilton manual in the car...

The cast is really good. Sheedy and Guttenberg are both likable leads. Fisher Steven is a lot of fun. Guttenberg's Police Academy costar G.W. Bailey plays to type as he did so often in the '80s. Such a fun movie. I had a big goofy grin on my face the whole time I was watching this.I recently read a review of this movie that trashed it. The reviewer's main reasons for doing so were based on how unrealistic it was. He went on and on about how robots aren't capable of this and that. It made me very sad for him because I know he must not have any friends.

Skroeder the head of security sets off with his men to catch it while its inventor Dr. Newton Crosby and his assistant Ben Jabituya follow its tracking signal to help them locate it. They find Number Five but it evades capture by jumping off a bridge and parachuting on to the back of a van driven by Stephanie by now it is out of range for the tracker.When Stephanie finds Number Five she initially thinks he is an alien and invites it into her house where he seeks input he quickly reads every book in the house and turns to the television for further learning. When she learns that instead of being an alien he is a robot from a weapons manufacturer she is not impressed and calls them to take it away however when she tells Number Five that he is to return to Nova he reacts in a way one wouldn't expect from an inanimate object... he shows fear. Realising that he is in danger Number Five takes Stephanie's van which he learns how to drive by reading the instruction manual. She manages to jump aboard as he drives off but they crash and are found be Doctor Crosby who deactivates Number Five and puts him on a truck bound for Nova. Five however manages to reactivate himself and escapes once again. He returns to Stephanie and is present to help rescue her from her abusive exboyfriend. She believes that if she can persuade Doctor Crosby that Number Five is alive then he well help them unfortunately they meeting is interrupted by Skroeder and as well as rescuing Stephanie Number Five must confront the other robots I won't say what he does to them as it would spoil one of the films jokes.As stated before the film still seems charming and Ally Sheedy and Steve Guttenberg performed well in the lead roles and while watching it was easy to suspend disbelief and accept that Number Five was indeed alive. I'm not sure what to make of Fisher Stevens's portrayal of Ben Jabituya on the one hand he was an amusing character on the other it seemed very dated to have a white actor playing an Indian rather than actually employing somebody from the Subcontinent. There are one or two jokes some parents might find a bit racy but I think most children would enjoy this film as will plenty of adults especially those who first saw it as youngsters in the '80.".

As usual A great cast including Steve Guttenburg and Ally Sheedy when they were both very young. Somewhat original in concept although I am aware of many other SciFi stories in which either a robot or computer achieved consciousness. Johnny is hit by a bolt of lightning and has a short circuit that makes him truly alive. Children will love it and not even pick up on the antiwar nature of the basic storyline in which a war robot decides to change his own destiny and become peaceful and loving instead of a laserpowered war machine. An often overlooked minor classic in my book.".

Though if you look beyond the computer components and the boring banter of this high tech machine facility what we have is a quite an adventurous and surprise fun flick. When a experimental robot among a score of them is electrocuted and grows smarts and takes off from the facility to tour the splendour of San Francisco it's creator likable Guttenberg a stay in and his peers one another Police Academy favourite are desperate to recover it where they do whatever it takes. The robot is befriended by a female vet sweet Sheedy who harbours it and the two become great friends. The manipulation of the robot is very smart as from the designers of it and the escape sequences are so well done. Too I liked the geeky sleepy voice of one of the managers as if illustrating sarcastically the enjoyment of this job. Fisher Stevens is a hoot as Guttenberg's assistant who lectures him on how there's another world outside the facility. SC pretty much has the same kind of approaching climax whether it's ET Starman where Sheedy who of course strikes up a relationship with Guttenberg will protect Johnny Five at all costs from the facility guy who will turn back into an experiment. Not being a lover of kid's flicks though I was more flexible as a teen this film had grown on me and it's song from El Debarge rocks. Certainly a movie for all ages this couldn't be a more perfect flick for everyone. Of course it spawned a not as successive sequel not in the same class as the first with only Stevens staying for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "www.plasticpals.com Short Circuit is one of the most beloved robotrelated movies of all time. More than 20 years have passed since I had last seen it so it was with cautious optimism that I selected it on Netflix. I have fond memories of it but I was just a kid then. Now I can see it falls into just about every pitfall of the comedies that characterized the '80s. It closely follows the sappy E.T. formula where an innocent otherworldly creature is hunted by the heartless military authorities. So this is definitely a kid's film or is it? It stars the contemptible Steve Gutternberg who hasn't starred in anything worthwhile since as a carefree roboticist and Ally Sheedy of The Breakfast Club gets caught in the middle as the animalloving girl who can't find a trustworthy man. Notably Fisher Stevens rounds out the cast as a racist brown face East Indian character with a thick accent. He's full of offputting sexual innuendos which kind of tars the film's familyfriendly image. But there's enough slapstick gags based on The Three Stooges that Short Circuit is clearly appealing to a younger audience.The undeniable star of the show is Number 5 a prototype built by the NOVA company for the military. It was designed by the legendary concept artist Syd Mead who gave us the TRON lightcycles and Blade Runner's spinners among others. It's a fantastic looking robot puppet and was one of the most sophisticated movie props ever built. It's expressive eyes are enough to melt any robot junkie's heart even if it's primary objective is to nuke the Soviets. Hit by a jolt of lightning after an explosive demonstration of the robot squad's firepower Number 5 inexplicably becomes selfaware and shows incredible intelligence and curiosity. It's a far cry from the complex and semibelievable explanations made by smarter science fiction but it's just one of those things you have to go along with for the sake of the plot.Of course all hell breaks loose when Number 5 inadvertently escapes from NOVA's lab. It's absolute nonsense with few if any laughs but it's still sort of fun to watch out of curiosity. One can't help but notice the similarity between Number 5 and certain real robots developed since then. I'm sure I'll probably make a lot of people angry by saying so but Short Circuit hasn't exactly aged well. It's one of the few examples of robots on film where the robot isn't a villain so at least it has that going for it. It's practically required viewing if you're into robots but unless you're on a serious nostalgia kick you're probably better off skipping it and watching WALLE again instead.".

But not in this case.According to a recent biography of Burt Lancaster the collapse of the elephantine budgeted Heaven's Gate made the studios gun shy about westerns. It was the main reason the film was held up. Probably Lancaster Oscar nominated performance in Atlantic City made the studio change its mind.A pair of Hollywood legends Burt Lancaster and Rod Steiger make their only joint film appearance in Cattle Annie And Little Britches. Lancaster plays legendary outlaw Bill Doolin who operated in the Oklahoma Territory primarily and who the girls who've had their heads filled with dime novel fantasies become camp followers and are christened with those names by Lancaster. Steiger is legendary lawman Bill Tilghman who is on the trail of the Doolin gang. Worth seeing this film just to see them together in one scene.According to the Lancaster biography Amanda Plummer regarding Lancaster as an acting mentor. She was impressed with his sheer physicality even in middle age. Burt certainly was no longer playing roles like The Crimson Pirate but still he used his whole body and not just that clear speaking voice to get you to notice him. Steiger too has one memorable voice for the screen.Cattle Annie And Little Britches is a sleeper western ready to be discovered by film fans. Make sure to see this if broadcast.".

These stories illustrate to some degree the Palestinian history from 1947 to 1993. But the focus is on the women's stories. I think this is a movie that will be appreciated far more by women than by men. It is poignant and respectful. Most women will find something with which to identify in this film. The cinematography is beautiful and the lead actors are compelling in their roles. The movie has been criticized as disjointed but that's because real life does not have a formulaic dramatic arc.

	schema:reviewBody "Run don't walk to see this movie. If you miss it while it is in the theaters put it in your Netflix queue. My wife and I see a lot of movies independent and mainstream and this is one of the best. Yesterday we saw a mainstream movie Hanna which was a major disappointment except for the excellent acting of Saoirse Ronan. I gave it a 5 because the story was so terrible and I didn't have any emotional involvement concerning what happened to Hanna. We generally don't go to two movies two days in a row but I was so disappointed in Hanna and have been interested in possibly seeing Miral since I heard Rula Jebreal on NPR's Tell Me More. She wrote the novel and the screenplay the movie was based on. I was surprised that she received such a chilly reception on the show so I remembered to check out the movie online.On METACRITIC which contains reviews by major critics there were 17 reviews 3 positive 12 mixed and 2 negative. Overall it was given a 45 out of 100 which means generally mixed reviews and near the low end of that scale. Keep in mind that Hanna got a 64 which means generally favorable reviews. I read a number of the critic's reviews of Miral as I often do before seeing a movie I also read all of the six reviews available at that time on IMDb. There were only five usable as one was written by a person who in my opinion had an agenda and based on his review had not seen the movie.Having consulted METACRITIC and IMDb I was convinced that my wife and I might like this movie but would probably not rate it above a 6 or 7 out of ten after we saw it. I always keep in mind that there are movies with overwhelming favorable reviews that I have hated including The Diving Bell and The Butterfly which had the same director Julian Schnabel as this movie. Lost in Translation is also in that category.My wife and I came to this movie without prejudice for one side or the other. We were just looking for a well made movie that would entertain us. We were so pleasantly surprised. The acting was excellent the story involving and we were quite tense in the last third of the movie. Unlike Hanna we really cared what happen to Miral.I agree with Spencergo this movie should be seen by a wider audience but I know it won't. The reason that this review is so important to me is most people will skip this movie because of the mixed reviews and they shouldn't. Unfortunately many independent films like Rabbit Hole last year get missed. I sincerely hope you give this movie a try if you can find it at your local independent theater.".

	schema:reviewBody "A drama centered on an orphaned Palestinian girl Freida Pinto growing up in the wake of ArabIsraeli war who finds herself drawn into the conflict.You might wonder Freida Pinto is Indian so why was she cast as Palestinian?  Some critics took exception to this or the idea that she is too beautiful to play an ordinary girl. Are ordinary girls not allowed to be beautiful? And while her Indian heritage may seem out of place I think this should be overlooked in light of the fact she is a tremendous actress and sold the character well.What is so great about this film is that the politics are not the issue. The life of a young girl is. This is a film that shows the humanity of the Palestinians  the DVD cover asks if Miral has the face of a terrorist. After seeing the film you have to say no. While the story covers a wide swath of history from 1947 to the 1993 Oslo agreement the politics are not the problem.Schnabel tells me many of the critics were negative and I do see some complaints that the editing was choppy or the bizarre remark that Schnabel does not know how to direct women. Presumably many critics took exception to the positive portrayal of the Palestinians and the negative portrayal of the Israelis.In fact though this is how one might view the film if looking for a certain angle. The Israelis are presented negatively yes but not inaccurately. But the Palestinians are not really presented positively  just as human beings. There is still a father telling her daughter not to get mixed up with the PLO and one scene has a stepfather raping his wife's daughter. That can hardly be seen as being positive though the real point here is that people should be judged as individuals not as members of a group.The cast is all excellent with plenty of Arab flavor. We have Willem Dafoe a native of my city Appleton and Vanessa Redgrave for the white aspect. And then Alexander Siddig probably best known as Bashir from Star Trek somewhere inbetween Siddig was born in Sudan but was educated in London.The film is PG13 making it less raw but more accessible to audiences. This may have toned down the realism a bit but it in no way compromised the emotional outreach that was a steady undercurrent.Geoffrey Macnab calls the film courageous and groundbreaking while Mike Goodridge calls it sincere and thoughtprovoking. Both are correct. The more unusual comment comes from Claudia Puig who says Schnabel puts his unmistakable dreamlike stamp on the film. Now Schnabel is first and foremost a painter so his goal is art. But to call this film dreamlike just seems off. This struck me as pure realism all the way. But who am I to judge? Anyway great film and one that will be sure to spark discussion regardless of which side if any you stand on in the ongoing Middle East debate.".

	schema:reviewBody "First I must say that before seeing this film I had not read the book it was based on so I have to assume that the film follows the book. As the writer of the book also participated in the scripting of the film one would think that this film is a collaboration between the author of the book and the director Julian Schnabel. This being said I have tried to review this film without prejudice.When the film ended my first thoughts were that this film would cause a stir as it is directed by a Jew and yet the subject matter of the film shows the Jewish State of Israel in a negative light. My concerns were not as much for the film itself as it is a well made film but for the attitude that the Jewish population would have towards the film. In my own experience as someone who has been directly involved with distribution of film whenever there is a group that has a negative response the distribution can go one of two ways the first being limited distribution as some will not support showing the film in their theaters and the second being a tremendous response to good cinema where theaters will take the risk and book the film at a national level. Miral a film that should have widespread distribution because of what the Jewish population will do in response to the anti Israel theme this film will be reduced to Art House distribution.Miral deals with a Palestinian community in turmoil due to change. That change was the effect that the new Statehood of Israel caused. As with any new regimes change is mandatory and an often misunderstood process and the story of Miral reflects that process.The film boasts a well woven story competent acting and a visceral message. This is a relevant film and well worth seeing. It is multiplelayered and a multipleleveled film. It would be a shame if the Jewish Community misreads the intention of the film. Films like this do not come around often and avoiding it out of ignorance would be a mistake. .".

	schema:reviewBody "I did not know what the movie was about so when it started my first reaction was Oh no! not another movie on Jewish suffering! I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this time the movie was about the Palestinian plight. Kudos to that I say nevertheless I found the story confusing. I am a fan of Julian Schnabel's work as director but I expected more after The Belljar and the Butterfly which in my book was a masterpiece. Miral not an apt title for the subject matter takes its time before getting to the main story and protagonist telling first the tale of 3 other women Her mother Nadia Fatima the terrorist and Hind the school master and surrogate mother to all orphans. Miral's arrival on the scene is almost an afterthought hinted at by Nadia's vomit attack upon arriving in jail if she is sickened by fear or by baby is not clear until much later on.I wished the director let the people speak in Arabic and add subtitles which were used only in the beginning it would have made for a less Anglocentric flavored film and the written text would have allowed the audience to catch important dialog that was otherwise drowned by the soundtrack. What Fatima says to the man who later becomes Nadia's husband for example would have explained later events. Same for what was exchanged between Miral and the Intifada member at the funeral important words muffled in music. Because of this and the confusing ways of past and present scenes mixing without a clear way to distinguish between them the storyline of the movie was unclear and so was its perception similar to walking in the dark intuiting the outline of things but not getting the full picture. All actors were good but Hiam Abass who played Hind stood out. Freida Pinto does not look authentic I read she is of Indian heritage but her beauty made the distressing story more bearable if distracting. Aside from this it was refreshing to see a movie on this subject matter produced and directed by major names in the movie industry. To see the Israeli seen as bad guys was almost shocking what with the Jewish propaganda we get out of Hollywood all the time. The world needs to see Palestinian heroes if nothing else to balance the way Arabs in general are portrayed in the movies. A movie worth seeing if NOT the ultimate picture on the subject.".

	schema:headline " The Conflict A View from Palestine";
	schema:reviewBody "It is refreshing to visit the IsraeliPalestinian conflict form a vantage too seldom shared in cinema. Director Julian Schnabel once again proves that he understands human responses in the face of political conflict. Rula Jebreal has adapted her own novel which in turn is a biography of her involvement in the history of the Palestinian conflict. It is a touching recounting of the events that took place form 1947 to the present and it leaves the window open for much conversation. The film opens with a party held by Bertha Spafford Vanessa Redgrave in 1947 when she asks her guest to forget the conflict outside for a celebration of Christmas the party is attended by both her Jewish and Arabic friends the centerpiece being the Christmas tree brought yearly by the Husseini family and then replanted to restore the earth. Hind Husseini Hiam Abbass is there and meets Eddie Willem Dafoe an American friend of Bertha. A year latter in 1948 there is an ArabIsraeli War the Deir Yassin Massacre and the establishment of the state of Israel. The wealthy Hind Husseini encounters 55 starving children victims of the war and take s them home to establish what will become the Dar AlTifel Institute a school for Arab orphans that within months grew to a population of 2000. The film then jumps forward and we meet Nadia Yasmine Al Massri an abused alcoholic who is imprisoned and there meets devout Muslim Jamal Alexander Siddig who later becomes her husband Nadia unable to change her life drowns herself when their child is only 7 years old. It is now 1978 and Jamal brings his daughter Miral Yolanda El Karam to the keeping of Hind reassuring her that he will see her on weekends. Time passes to 1988 and the older Miral Freida Pinto is victim to the intifada uprising is sent to a refugee camp where she falls in love with the PLO leader Hani Omar Metwally and commits to the Palestinian movement to secure a land of peace called Palestine that will be free of the Israeli governance and jurisdiction. Hind encourages Miral to follow her heart and convictions it is the development of change represented by Hind Nada and Miral that personalizes this compelling epic. Though the conflict between Palestine and Israel continues to this day this film allows us to appreciate the Palestinian response to the loss of their land and home by a international ruling to create the state of Israel. Cinematographer Eric Gautier mixes the hot sun washed Palestine footage of the real intifada and the result is mesmerizing. The real star of this film is Hiam Abbass who as the gradually aging Hind Husseini brings the story to life. The large cast is excellent with special kudos to Alexander Siddig Omar Metwally and Freida Pinto the presence of Vanessa Redgrave and Willem Dafoe add credibility tot he proceedings but their roles are minimal. Julian Schnabel is to be congratulated for bringing to light the 'other side' of the ArabIsraeli conflict. He gives us excellent food for thought. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "Political films based on actual events are usually angry sentiments and have a strong point to make. This biographical drama is no different. Based on Rula Jebreal's novel the emotionally charged production gives us an insight on the political unrest and instability happening on the other side of the world. Regard it educational if you will this Julian Schnabel directed film will leave you wondering what it takes to live a life surrounded by the horrors of war.The film chronicles Hind Husseini's effort to build an orphanage in Jerusalem after the 1948 Arab Israeli War. This began with her crossing paths with 55 orphaned children while on her way to work one day. She took them home and before she knew it she had almost 2000 orphans under her care. The Dar AlTifel Institute was born and thousands of orphaned children came under Husseini's care. Some 30 years later Miral a motherless child was sent to the orphanage by her father. Upon turning 17 she is sent to a refugee camp where she experiences the tension between Israel and Palestine and the possible destructions it can bring to her own life.Director Schnabel is known for his award winning works The Diving Bell and the Butterfly 2007 and Before Night Falls 2000 and it comes as no surprise that the New York born filmmaker's latest project deals with such politically charged themes despite the foreign lands the story takes place in. Through gritty cinematography read shaky camera work and choppy editing read abrupt cuts and transitions Schnabel shows us a world which we have only read about but never had the chance to experience. Sure there may be no beautifully decorated sets with perfectly synchronized action sequences but this is the slices of reality which the locals have to live with day after day.It is also clear that the film presents a Palestinian perspective of things and may appear one sided to viewers who are expecting this to be objective. Do note however that this is based on a memoir by Jebreal and it is only natural that the war is seen through her eyes.Amidst the violence and assaults there is tenderness and compassion in the 112 minute film as Schnabel tells a story of remarkably strong women surviving in times of turmoil. Their intertwined tales may be unevenly told but you'd feel a sense of passion and zeal as they go through life fighting for their beliefs and causes.Playing the central character Husseini is Hiam Abbass The Visitor Munich a Palestinian actress who injects the much needed fervour into her character. Frieda Pinto Slumdog Millionaire plays the titular character and viewers get to see how a girl who is initially brought up safely inside the orphanage's walls gradually grows into a young woman who is awakened by the reality around her and has to fight for her convictions. Appearing in supporting roles are familiar faces like Willem Dafoe Daybreakers and Vanessa Redgrave Letters to Juliet in the first few minutes of the film.The film ends without any closure or resolution which reflects the harsh realities happening on the other side of the planet we live in. And that in our opinion is the best way to leave us reflecting on the unnecessary pain and tragedies brought about by war.www.moviexclusive.com".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Miral";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Julian Schnabel tackles yet another biographical tale after his Diving Bell and the Butterfly with a focus shifted to the Middle East conflict but unlike the typical Hollywood production ranging from all out action like The Kingdom to heavier dramatic fare like Syriana this film an IndianItalianFrenchIsraeli coproduction stops short at passing judgement opting to tread the middle ground in portraying as objective a viewpoint as possible and does so through the eyes of the titular character Miral Freida Pinto being caught up in the scheme of her environment.Curiously this film is based on the novel by Rula Jebreal a Palestinian journalist whose book is an almost biographical account of her growing up and formative years where she got brought up in an orphanage in Jerusalem established by Hind Husseini Hiam Abbass whose notable exploits after the 1948 ArabIsraeli War include rescuing orphaned survivors from the Deir Yassin massacre and turning her home into an orphanage. So in essence we get to observe the story of two women caught up in extraordinary circumstances spanning a vast timeline right up to the establishment of the state of Israel and right through to various peace accords that are still trying to bear fruit and one The narrative is split into two halves with the first centered on the tale of Hind Husseini her sacrifice and achieving of her objective before having the narrative shift toward that of Miral clearly the poster girl since Freida Pinto's shot to fame in Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire might mean a lot more people giving this film a chance. Brought to Husseini's orphanage to be raised we see the teenager getting awakened to the state of affairs of the land claimed by opposing sides and getting caught between a rock and a hard place where Husseini's counsel gets weighed against that of the brush of romance with the militant Hani Omar Metwally but of course don't come to expect flitting romantic scenes as the more powerful and thought provoking ones far outweigh affairs of the heart.While the film offered two stories of two independently strong women somehow it is the lack of a primary central figure that did it in where it's most unfortunate to have the story quite scattered in its ambitious timeline in trying to condense an extremely complex political situation no doubt adopting a micro view through the two different perspectives and principles in its leading characters. It sought to contrast viewpoints of those who deem education is the key out of their current plight against those who wish to stand up and be counted violence notwithstanding as a means to achieve an end.Perhaps I was anticipating more but with an ending quite abrupt it leaves more questions than those answered and addressed and perhaps so because it's still an open environment with no clear solutions in sight. Like how the characters have seen milestones set in their lifetime I wonder if we in ours can eventually see something significantly charted out. The end title was a chilling reminder that it will take quite a while.".

	onyx:emotionText "Director Julian Schnabel tackles yet another biographical tale after his Diving Bell and the Butterfly with a focus shifted to the Middle East conflict but unlike the typical Hollywood production ranging from all out action like The Kingdom to heavier dramatic fare like Syriana this film an IndianItalianFrenchIsraeli coproduction stops short at passing judgement opting to tread the middle ground in portraying as objective a viewpoint as possible and does so through the eyes of the titular character Miral Freida Pinto being caught up in the scheme of her environment.Curiously this film is based on the novel by Rula Jebreal a Palestinian journalist whose book is an almost biographical account of her growing up and formative years where she got brought up in an orphanage in Jerusalem established by Hind Husseini Hiam Abbass whose notable exploits after the 1948 ArabIsraeli War include rescuing orphaned survivors from the Deir Yassin massacre and turning her home into an orphanage. So in essence we get to observe the story of two women caught up in extraordinary circumstances spanning a vast timeline right up to the establishment of the state of Israel and right through to various peace accords that are still trying to bear fruit and one The narrative is split into two halves with the first centered on the tale of Hind Husseini her sacrifice and achieving of her objective before having the narrative shift toward that of Miral clearly the poster girl since Freida Pinto's shot to fame in Danny Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire might mean a lot more people giving this film a chance. Brought to Husseini's orphanage to be raised we see the teenager getting awakened to the state of affairs of the land claimed by opposing sides and getting caught between a rock and a hard place where Husseini's counsel gets weighed against that of the brush of romance with the militant Hani Omar Metwally but of course don't come to expect flitting romantic scenes as the more powerful and thought provoking ones far outweigh affairs of the heart.While the film offered two stories of two independently strong women somehow it is the lack of a primary central figure that did it in where it's most unfortunate to have the story quite scattered in its ambitious timeline in trying to condense an extremely complex political situation no doubt adopting a micro view through the two different perspectives and principles in its leading characters. It sought to contrast viewpoints of those who deem education is the key out of their current plight against those who wish to stand up and be counted violence notwithstanding as a means to achieve an end.Perhaps I was anticipating more but with an ending quite abrupt it leaves more questions than those answered and addressed and perhaps so because it's still an open environment with no clear solutions in sight. Like how the characters have seen milestones set in their lifetime I wonder if we in ours can eventually see something significantly charted out. The end title was a chilling reminder that it will take quite a while.";

However if you go into Miral in order to learn more about the ArabIsraeli conflict and follow it from an honest Palestinian perspective you'll love this movie to death.Although most people say that this movie is following the lives of two different Palestinian women you're really only following oneMiral the other woman doesn't really develop as a character throughout the film. Miral during the film goes through metamorphosis of perspective of sorts as she goes from being a revolutionary against the Israelis to realizing the goodness on both sides and believing in the possibility for peace.But besides that the events going around Miral paint a perfect picture of the conflict as it is nothing hidden. For example in the film you'll see a Peace Protest that turned violent that Miral participated in as well mention of Jewish Settlements within the region of Judea and Samariathe West Bank. You will also see tremendous hate on both sides such as a Palestinian who in her blind hate became a suicide bomber killing innocent people she didn't know in a movie theater and an Israeli father who thinks all Palestinians are terrorists.All in all this is an absolutely fantastic film and I highly recommend it but cautiously. As this film does not show much if any of a separate Israeli perspective Like most of the media involving the IsraeliArab conflict this film only shows one side Arab or Israeli and not the other it is therefore somewhat biased in presentation by definition. The viewer should be careful and take heed of all events in the film as they are simply and through Miral's perspective while viewing for maximum enjoyment and understanding of the events depicted.".

	schema:headline " Compelling Memoir of an Israeli Palestinian Woman";
	schema:reviewBody "On a recent visit to New York about two weeks ago I happened upon the opportunity to watch the movie Miral followed by a QA session with director Julian Schnabel Diving Bell and the Butterfly one of my top 10 movies of the last decade and with the writer of the screenplay and the memoir upon which the movie was based Israeli Palestinian Rula Jebreal. Jebreal's book is also named Miral the movie and the book are the story of her youthful experiences growing up a Palestinian in Jerusalem as well as stories about her mother and about a remarkable womannamed Hind Husseinwho started an orphanage and school there in the aftermath of the chaos around the creation of the Israeli state in 1947. Rula Jebreal was Miral a character named after a flower that grows by the side of the road in that region and she grew up in the orphanage attending the school after the suicide of her mother I believe it was the early '70's. Filmed in a variety of great locations in Israel and the West Bank the movie shows the misery and strife of military occupation from the point of view of Palestinians. RulaMiral has the status of being an Israeli citizen as her ancestors never left and finds her identity as a Palestinian as a teenager. Miss Hind the towering figure of the orphanageschool for some 40 years from the time she founded it provides hope for the young girls there and does her best to protect them from the dangers of the intifada uprising. At the story's end she arranges for Miral to go to Italy to attend university then dies a local hero.Rula's experiences include an infatuation with a young intifada leader who first supports the Al Fatah PLO position then runs afoul of them and is killed as an accused traitor she is taken by the Israeli authorities interrogated then blindfolded bound and beaten her Israeli citizenship saved her from more prolonged imprisonment. Still her experiences are not nearly as harsh as those the film recounts of her mother who was abused and degraded falsely imprisoned by the Israelis and afterwards could not live with herself. Miral's father the parentage was shown not to be biological is one of the few positive male characters a complicated character who was a devout Muslim loyal to Miral's mother despite her infidelity and a loving father yet one who gives up custody of his daughter to the orphanage. Beyond the range of the movie's story Rula Jebreal became a journalist in Italy as she said the first 'black' TV presenter there. She spoke passionately at the QA session of her desire to raise awareness in the world of the plight of the Palestinians though affirming her love of the area and acknowledging that she loves Israel as well. One thing she does not accept and of which her life is testimony is the Zionist notion that Israel is a Jewish state though she came to have Jewish friends and appreciate their culture some of which is shown in the movie she wants a unitary state for all who live there. The film is deeply affecting though perhaps not as much as Schnabel's Diving Bell. Frieda Pinto the South Asian female lead of the smash hit 2008 movie Slumdog Millionaire is a bit of a controversial choice for the difficult role of Miral but I will say that she brings to it something like the beauty which I witnessed that evening from Rula herself. Her father was played by an actor Alexander Siddig who seemed very familiar but I could not place turns out he was a regular Dr. Bashir on Star Trek Deep Space Nine not a great recommendation I know but his performance here was sympathetic and dignified. The other two key roles both very challenging to portray were those of Hind Hussein and of Miral's mother Nadia played by Palestinian actresses Hiam Abbass and Yasmine El Masri respectively. Willem Dafoe and Vanessa Redgrave both lent their presence to the movie though their roles are relatively small and peripheral to the story. Schnabel spoke of the difficulty in getting official permissions to film in many locations but also of the cooperation and passionate support for his effort that he sometimes found and of the beauty of the region. He is known primarily as a painter and is the son of prominent Jewish leaders but has taken a courageous independent political stance with this effort. He has run into some resistance from the Hollywood community not too surprising considering the subject matter he didn't need their help to make the film but he will need it and will not get it to get broad enough distribution for him and Rula to accomplish their aim of raising political awareness. They may have to settle for the satisfaction of telling a compelling story beautifully as both their political aims and commercial success will no doubt lie beyond their capability.".

The institute's founder Hind Husseini Hiam Abbass manages to keep the institute and its students safe from events outside. Miral Freida Pinto gets sent to Dar alTifl at the age of seven. Her life is mostly easy until the intifada when Israel tightens security making life even more difficult for the Palestinians. Miral's friend Hani Omar Metwally insists on taking militant action against the occupying forces while Hind Husseini warns Miral not to do anything that endangers her future. In short Miral has practically no good choices.Aside from bringing up the IsraelPalestine conflict part of what I like about Miral is that it shows the daytoday lives of the Palestinians. The reminds us that these people about whom we usually hear in the context of war  or simply get called terrorists  are human beings. If the movie has any downside it's that the jumping back and forth between Miral herself and Dar alTifl is a bit confusing at times but overall I strongly recommend this movie.Also starring Alexander Siddig Makram Khoury Willem Dafoe and Vanessa Redgrave who of course mentioned Palestine while accepting her Oscar for Julia.".

	schema:reviewBody "Movies are not important. Despite what critics producers writers directors actors IMDb commentors or anyone else thinks there's nothing about a movie that is inherently genetically important. There are rarely if ever any dire consequences in choosing to watch a movie  no one's life is depending on it. The country the planet the universe could not care less about your film going habits.But a great film can certainly affect us profoundly. This is an experience that we cherish and revere and since we are so defensive of our emotional lives we define these compelling moments as important. The experience may be important but the film is not. The film's just a vehicle a messenger a ploy to insinuate into our lives someone else's experience. That's why this film Miral is not nearly as wonderful as it could have been. It seems to have the attitude that it's important. This pompous disposition is not obvious not flagrant but it is persistent and distracting. And the great irony of it is that Julian Schnabel has purposely contrived his film hoping to avoid this very accusation.It's a decidedly modest nuanced and low key depiction of the terrible situation in the middle east as seen almost exclusively from the view point of Palestinian women. The film is self consciously playing against the thunderous deafening roar of western media coverage of the conflict. Today we are daily deluged with horrific videos graphic images and hysterical hyperbolic reports of the conflict a formidable din over which sincere voices labor to be heard. So by playing it softly  speaking under the crowd  Miral draws attention to itself. Isn't that what a film is supposed to do distinguish itself?

His artful approach served him so well in his previous films but here it sabotages his efforts. And just to be sure he's torpedoed the whole enterprise he closes it with the doleful raspy croak of that beloved Palestinian crooner Tom Waits. Tom Waits?! Oy vey that's meshugenah!Avoiding the clich dodging the obvious scorning the conventional is the mortal pledge of any worthwhile artist and so Julian can be partly forgiven his miscalculations. But an unpardonable fault is the lack of a truly capable compelling character for us to focus on. His stars are beautiful and photogenic but so overwhelmed with the responsibilities with which they have been charged. They just don't have the chops to command our attention and so our gaze and thoughts fix on other things such as the film's distinctive stylization and it's leapfrog time sequencing. The dialog is so stilted and labored the actresses too often reading their lines. Except of course Vanessa Redgrave who should have been in much more of the film maybe even reading everyone else's lines! Though it's based on a true story many scenes ring false. I often found myself thinking what a clever well meaning film. That's a thought no film should ever illicit at least not till it's over. While it's happening you should be engulfed in an experience oblivious of yourself.Set in the locale of what may well be ground zero in determining the fate of our world Schnabel should have played up to the roiling cacophonous volcanic environment into which his film softly whispers. Despite that old corny expression about whispers and wanting to be heard this is one time when it would have been better to be bold.

	onyx:emotionText "Movies are not important. Despite what critics producers writers directors actors IMDb commentors or anyone else thinks there's nothing about a movie that is inherently genetically important. There are rarely if ever any dire consequences in choosing to watch a movie  no one's life is depending on it. The country the planet the universe could not care less about your film going habits.But a great film can certainly affect us profoundly. This is an experience that we cherish and revere and since we are so defensive of our emotional lives we define these compelling moments as important. The experience may be important but the film is not. The film's just a vehicle a messenger a ploy to insinuate into our lives someone else's experience. That's why this film Miral is not nearly as wonderful as it could have been. It seems to have the attitude that it's important. This pompous disposition is not obvious not flagrant but it is persistent and distracting. And the great irony of it is that Julian Schnabel has purposely contrived his film hoping to avoid this very accusation.It's a decidedly modest nuanced and low key depiction of the terrible situation in the middle east as seen almost exclusively from the view point of Palestinian women. The film is self consciously playing against the thunderous deafening roar of western media coverage of the conflict. Today we are daily deluged with horrific videos graphic images and hysterical hyperbolic reports of the conflict a formidable din over which sincere voices labor to be heard. So by playing it softly  speaking under the crowd  Miral draws attention to itself. Isn't that what a film is supposed to do distinguish itself?

	schema:headline " Another good film from Julian Schnabel";
	schema:reviewBody "With a few caveats Miral is a rather good movie. It shows things from the Palestinian perspective and does leave out an important point or two ... but again in general it's pretty good cinematic experience.The development of a young lady named Miral is the main subject here. The film is based on an autobiographical novel by Rula Jebreal. Miral is Palestinian and she attends a school that some might consider a privileged place for a Palestinian. She is very lucky to get the type of education offered at the school. The school is a boarding school and is also an orphanage. It is run by a wonderful lady.The author Rula Jebreal is a journalist. She attended university in Italy and was a journalist there for over decade. After that she worked for a Cairo TV station.There is quite a bit of setup in the film before the main character Miral appears. You just have to wade through it because it's quite necessary to build the foundation before this particular house can be built.Even though there are multiple issues of importance to women raised by the film I suspect that creative men will be interested in most all of the film. I'm a guy and I liked it.The main issue in the film is how Miral's attitude towards and approach to the IsraeliPalestinian struggle will develop. It's a complex subject and the film likewise is complex. Overall the film acquits itself quite well is this area.OK. Let's get to the controversial stuff. The movie portrays the situation from the Palestinian perspective. Once or twice it leaves out an important point and that omission gives an advantage of the Palestinian side of the argument. However in another case it really should provide a tiny bit more historical info to make the portrayal of the circumstances surrounding the founding of the schoolorphanage more credible. Let's tackle that bit first.The schoolorphanage is founded because a wonderful lady finds a group of orphans in the street who say their parents were all killed without reason. The scene just didn't seem believable to me ... until I looked up the Deir Yassin massacre. It really happened and those kids are part of the subject matter of this film. Again it was called the Deir Yassin massacre. Look that one up try haaretz.com. The film should have mentioned that incident by name in a later scene for increased credibility.OK. Now the flip side of the coin. The schoolorphanage grows greatly because of the 1948 ArabIsraeli War that started the day after Israel declared its independence and sovereignty. Nowhere is it mentioned in the film that in that war the Arab nations were the first to move across national boundaries they started it. More balance is needed on this point.Another point omitted in the film occurs in an important scene where the Israeli army is tearing down a Palestinian house. I could be wrong about this but they typically do this when someone has committed a really bad terrorist act. That persons house or their parents house is then destroyed. When the house is torn down in the movie no contextreason is given whatsoever. For a film that is trying to balance things this a noticeable omission.One high circulation newspaper said that the film was a slanderous and shameful piece of propaganda. That's just totally wrong. To me it is sensitive and complex. Another newspaper review said the movie had a disdain for details. On the contrary it gets the details right with the caveats noted above. The Guardian said Freida Pinto looks uneasy and miscast as Miral herself. Ms. Pinto's acting is quite good. The only problem there is that her skin tone is a 12 shade to dark. I REALLY doubt that most folks with white skin will notice that problem. The Village Voice said it was atoddswithitself and was a partisan work. The only sense that the film is atoddswithitself is that the title character's response to the IsraeliPalestinian struggle changes over time. The work is told from the Palestinian point of view ... that makes it partisan? Give me a break! What crap! On the other hand the use of plaintive violin music is a bit overdone in the film.Let's get real here. It distinctly appears that the reason that people might typically review this film poorly is that they don't like that a story is being told from the Palestinian point of view.I understand that this is an incredibly tough problem but to quote Rodney King Can't we all get along? Unfortunately the situation seems quite insoluble.".

This film focuses on heroic and strong women having to deal with being born into a tortuous situation a living Hell on earth. Funny how Israel can not stop stealing land. I literally read an article about the government of Israel green lighting 15 thousand more settlements I believe that is the third time just this year.

	schema:reviewBody "Ignore some of the terrible reviews this movie has gotten. Watch it and reach your own conclusions.The story presented here presents personal stories of people affected by the creation of Israel in former Palestine a British colony. This movie is not meant to be history though facts of history are presented but based on how the situation has affected people in different parts of society of Palestinians and Israelis.Although the movie is from a Palestinian perspective I didn't feel that it was antiIsraeli but did show how the partisan situation has affected many negatively but mostly the Palestinians.I would urge everyone to see this movie with an eye to what happens with both colonialism and war. That some manage to survive does not mean thousands more didn't suffer greatly.This movie has some flaws and I'll mention some here so you will not think I could not see them. While much of the cinematography is excellent there are times that I had to turn away because the cinematographer must have used a handheld camera zoomed in so the picture is blurry. Then he moves the camera from side to side or makes a sweep and it almost gave me motion sickness and distracted from the movie. I have no idea why this was allowed but if this bothers you just move on because it doesn't last. Sometimes the story line seems truncated. First Miral's mother is a belly dancer then she is married to a moderate kind Muslim leader not an oppositionist. Did I miss something? I think some of the narrative transitions fell on the cutting room floor.Despite any flaws I really urge you to see the movie. It has very beautiful music excellent acting and is thoughtprovoking about the situation with the Palestinians and Israelis. Its partisanship is not strident so you don't feel that it is meant to be any type of manifesto. It does leave us wondering why the Oslo agreements of 1993 were never finally agreed upon though there are understandable reasons. This question is NOT the point of the movie however.".

This movie is not meant to be history though facts of history are presented but based on how the situation has affected people in different parts of society of Palestinians and Israelis.Although the movie is from a Palestinian perspective I didn't feel that it was antiIsraeli but did show how the partisan situation has affected many negatively but mostly the Palestinians.I would urge everyone to see this movie with an eye to what happens with both colonialism and war. That some manage to survive does not mean thousands more didn't suffer greatly.This movie has some flaws and I'll mention some here so you will not think I could not see them. While much of the cinematography is excellent there are times that I had to turn away because the cinematographer must have used a handheld camera zoomed in so the picture is blurry. Then he moves the camera from side to side or makes a sweep and it almost gave me motion sickness and distracted from the movie. I have no idea why this was allowed but if this bothers you just move on because it doesn't last. Sometimes the story line seems truncated. First Miral's mother is a belly dancer then she is married to a moderate kind Muslim leader not an oppositionist. Did I miss something? I think some of the narrative transitions fell on the cutting room floor.Despite any flaws I really urge you to see the movie. It has very beautiful music excellent acting and is thoughtprovoking about the situation with the Palestinians and Israelis. Its partisanship is not strident so you don't feel that it is meant to be any type of manifesto. It does leave us wondering why the Oslo agreements of 1993 were never finally agreed upon though there are understandable reasons. This question is NOT the point of the movie however.";

And for those of you with an aversion to subtitles there are only a few so you will be fine. Based on Rula Jebreal's novel about her own life the movie walks us through the inception of the State of Israel and the ensuing escalation of the Palestinian conflict that followed all through the eyes of a young girl whose life is shaped by that conflict rather than by her own goals and aspirations.I have to say something here. If someone's real life is filled with people dying torture and deceit and the person telling the story is always the victim or always did the right thing in a sea of others who didn't one has to wonder. I just don't believe her when she talks about how she behaved when she was picked up by the army. Sorry. Maybe it's not that important but when something doesn't pass the smell test you have to acknowledge it. Her story is a selfserving litany of justifications for her decisions one of which cost someone their life.A recurring theme in Miral is displacement and the carnage that results from it. Miral and her mother were displaced and her Palestinian people were displaced. We all learn from this film that displacement kills hope faster than the Israeli flag was designed after they took the land.There are many dissonant messages in the film that make it one of the best movies of the year thus far. Perhaps the most important of these is the movie's portrayal of a fabulous girl's school which is still standing that educates young female minds from behind a hedge of denial of events outside its walls. It's like The Secret Garden but somehow that's believable. There can be no hope for peace in the Middle East if oases of normality can't exist amid seas of insanity.Some will say the story is all about Miral but I think her father Jamal is an equally important character with much more to teach. Jamal is a forgiving man but Miral mistakes his forgiveness for weakness and denial. She thinks he's hiding behind a God that has forsaken them but he's not. He is choosing forgiveness and focusing on what he finds important which is Miral herself. Everyone should have a parent like that. And we should all understand that it's our choice to forgive or fight and that one must weigh the consequences of each option before making the choice. Alexander Siddig portrays Jamal perfectly slowly without much dialog but with ever so much emotion. Why don't we see him more?The story moves quickly and covers a large stretch of time but you never feel rushed or that you missed anything. That's hard to do when your story spans fifty years in two short hours. I never really understood the genesis of Israel or how it came into being so quickly. It's like Los Angeles a city that grew too fast to allow for city planning and they have been struggling with the consequences ever since. No solutions can be implemented when you take land away from entire people to make room for their arch enemies just band aids.I know I've said this before about other films but this is another one of those movies that should be shown in schools in homes in the Knesset and anywhere else where people are sure of their point of view about who is right and wrong in this conflict. I wonder what would happen if it were required viewing for all Palestinians and Israelis.Julian Schnabel is a wonderful director so wonderful that no one part of the movie stands out as his. He just wove the tale brilliantly and sensitively and a grateful nation or two should thank him. On behalf of mine thank you. Please go see it. Take someone with you who is sure that Israel is totally right or that Israel is totally wrong and then go to a coffee shop and talk about it.".

The director whose previous work showed a rare quality in telling a story working on Rula Jebreal's novel and with a screenplay by the author takes a look at recent history analyzing it from the less popular side of the Palestinians who have lived in conflict after the creation of the state of Israel in 1947.The story deals with a kind hearted lady Hind Husseini who is surprised to find a large amount of orphans roaming the streets. She takes the children into her home and later creating a school in which to educate and house the young innocent victims. Hind's life was given to help the unfortunate children that came into her school and her life.Miral a young woman was the product of the system Ms. Husseini created. Unfortunately she gets to witness first hand the way her fellow Palestinians were being treated by the Israelis. In fact Miral falls in disgrace when the man she falls in love with forces her to carry a device which fortunately does not explode. Her life changes instantly as she has to experience the way she is treated and abused by the Israelis.Mr. Schnabel's sympathies are with the Palestinians something that he has not been able to avoid in the way he presents the material. The many years of fighting between Israel and its neighbor has produced wounds that are hard to heal. The film ends with the Oslo Peace Accords of 1993 in which some hope for peace seemed possible something that in real life never happened.The wonderful actress Hiam Abass is seen as Hind although she is only seen briefly as she goes from a young woman to her death. Freida Pinto the Indian actress does what she can with a role that should have been played by a young Palestinian actress. There are familiar faces among the cast. Vanessa Redgrave and William Dafoe are seen in minor roles.".

This film is another reason to blame commerciallydriven distributors for the lack of variety in our movie theaters. Here is a funny daring film about life in Communist East Berlin in the 70s that  would not have found its way to our screens but thanks to innovative festival programmers. It took courage to even think about making a comedy with musical overtones no less ! on such a subject. Yet thanks to energetic direction an enthusiastic cast and some truly memorable ideas the scene with the multitable is a real gem and the take on West Berliners probably well deserved ! Sonnenallee will stay in your minds for a long time. And the joyful finale complete with East Berliners dancing their way up to the infamous wall makes you wonder why the film was not also titled  East Side Story.".

It is a comedy not a drama the acting is good but not stellar and the film is only about a small portion of German culture that doesn't even exist anymore. How can a movie like that be a major step in German culture? I'll tell you... This movie deals with History. Not just history modern history. the ONLY people in Germany who haven't lived through this period in History are children under the age of 9 as of the release of this film in 1999 EVERYONE was touched by the cold war and the split of Germany into east and west. In my opinion the day a culture can joke about its history is the day in which they have come to terms with what happened and have accepted the facts... Sonnenallee is the first film to my knowledge that has satirized former East Germany and its everyday life including the Stasi...secret service and the Grenzpolizei.. boarder patrol To me this shows that the Germans have accepted their history and are ready to move on...

	schema:reviewBody "The film Sonnenallee is a comedy of the absurd humor type a bit like the Monty Python stories. A sense of humor is always rather personal and to be fair the fun in Sonnenallee is not my thing. Maladjusted fun feels weird and this makes the conception of this review a somewhat precarious undertaking. In Sonnenallee everything is chaotic. The characters are illcontrived and unpredictable. They move in all directions without pattern. There is a scene where the main character Micha suddenly strikes down his friend for the simple reason that he has accepted this narrowminded job. The events have no understandable coherence but arbitrary hop on and off your screen. Evidently the fact that I watched the extended version did not allay the confusion. Does it reflect the existentialism of Sartre which is actually hailed in the film itself? Or is it an attempted alliance with the Nouvelle Vague? The story unfolds in a quarter of EastBerlin in an alley immediately behind the illustrious Wall. Although the Wall is a stageproperty that dominates many of the scenes it remains an object without meaning or significance. If there are witted allusions they are lost on me. More obvious hints would help. An example of the incomprehensible character studies Micha has no pangs of conscience to enlist in the people's army. In one of the scenes at the Wall he even threatens to shoot down tourists that are peeping from the west side. But at the same time he keeps a diary in which he taunts the allegedly repressive nature of the Leninist state. There can be no doubt he is mentally unstable. You can allege that Sonnenallee is about a youth troop whose members are in the process of trying to discover their own identity. But the adults in Sonnenallee are just as allout deranged as the kids. The mother of Micha plans to defect to the west on her own but reconsiders and allures and seduces her dull husband. Two visitors in Berlin who at home can not receive the western TV broadcastings are impressed by their glitter and for hours sit gazing at the test screen. Joke where is the English Channel? Answer I don't know my TV does not pick it up. To be fair not all is bunk. Yes tall exaggerations can be fun. For instance there is this scene where a young guest from Vietnam makes an allocution before an audience of pupils in her own exotic language. Naturally she almost disappears behind the readingdesk. At the end the audience reacts elated. And the teacher is indignant or should I write shocked because Micha has peed in the direction of her beloved antifascist protection barrier. Joke 2 did you hear about the crosseyed teacher? She could not control her pupils. So let us allow for some amusing moments in Sonnenallee. But it could be more. I had alltime expectations considering the awkward theme of the clash of ideologies. To be fair Sonnenallee avoids the demagogic and selfconceited atmosphere that is alloyed in Goodbye Lenin. If you enjoy kids being silly the film Berlin Ecke Schnhauser of Defa Studios also narrates about a youth troop. In Berlin yes. Pronounce Bearleen. This film dives deep into the commonplace temptations of East and West without becoming too censorious. The translation is not allin as usual with Ice Storm. Or see my other reviews.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sonnenallee is a German 85minute movie from almost 20 years ago that features some of Germany's biggest rising stars from around that time in Alexander Scheer Robert Stadlober and Alexander Beyer. They may not be too wellknown today anymore but back then they were. And there are some more established actors on board too such as Henry Hbchen Katharina Thalbach and Detlev Buck. It's not really their fault that this film is not working for the most part. There is a touch of Goodbye Lenin to it as it depicts life in the GDR of especially younger people but it's all less refined and does not feel right on many occasions. The writer and director is Leander Haumann certainly wellknown here in Germany and I felt at times that he tried to make a mix of stuff like comingofage films like The Breakfast Club but also included the political context that has been overdone by now in German cinema.And in terms of the genre nothing new is delivered by this movie here. I cannot say I enjoyed the watch a lot. It was obviously the filmmaker's intention to make almost all the characters likable but the actors weren't good on several occasions especially the younger actors and Stadlober in particular who just isn't very talented. One of the few good things is that the film is fairly short but it's still disappointing to see a team of so many writers work on a movie and the result is something as forgettable as Sonnenallee. I cannot agree with all the awards attention that this film got. Haumann has done better on several other occasions and it's a bit sad that this is probably his most known work todate. I do not recommend the watch. Thumbs down.".

It was written and directed by David Twohy who also written and directed Riddick trilogy with Vin Diesel Pitch Black The Chronicles of Riddick  Riddick who I wasn't fan off and I never cared about but Pitch Black was an okay film. The Arrival is my favorite David Twohy film and the best of Charlie Sheen movie ever. It come out the same year as Independence Day 1996and The XFiles Season 3 was completed. It is a brilliant science fiction thriller film about a extraterrestrial intelligence and a global conspiracy. The acting in this film from Charlie Sheen and Ron Silver is brilliant I love this movie to death I love it! to me this this movie is an easy 8 and it is a prototypical good science fiction thriller movie  intense perfectly executed original plot no copycat shown to the tune of a forgettable and occasionally insulting story.Plot Radio astronomer Zane Zaminsky Charlie Sheen believes he's picked up a cosmic noise that signals extraterrestrial intelligence. But after turning over the tape to his boss Phil Gordian Ron Silver Zane's fired his girlfriend Teri Polo get's transferred and his partner is found dead from a supposed suicide. Zane's desperate search for answers leads him to Mexico and a mysterious power plant that is generating more than electricity and is run by people who are not what to appear to be. Arrested for the murder of a scientist Lindsay Crouse investigating and impending ecological disaster Zane's escape custody carrying proof of a worldshattering alien invasion in this intense scifi thriller.I first saw this movie on a cable when I was in high school. I did not recognize Charlie Sheen with a beard watching this movie it quickly become my favorite Alien film. To me Independence Day Alien and Aliens alongside The Arrival are my top 4 favorite extraterrestrial intelligence films. The story is solid and acting is solid.Also to me this movie is disturbing and terrifying on the end when Zane try to expose Aliens secret with the satellite dish Zane and Char are trapped in that station and first I thought Char betrayed Zane but it turned out it was Kiki Tony T. Johnson who betrayed Zane. Charlie Sheen makes such a terrifying face when Char asks him what will they do. The scene was terrifying when Ron Silver was preparing to kill them both so they hit with the van in the station and Zane froze them all.The aliens are raising temperatures so that the weathers are hot they are feeding with our energy. I also watched the sequel Arrival II 1998 with Patrick Muldoon in which Zane character is dead in which to me is pretty stupid! I love this movie to death I can't give this movie a 10 it is not a perfect movie the greatest or the best one but it is a good movie my favorite Charlie Sheen movie I got today on Bluray and I just finished watching it and i was blown away I love it. 810.The Arrival is a 1996 science fiction horror film directed by David Twohy and starring Charlie Sheen and costarring Lindsay Crouse Ron Silver Teri Polo and Richard Schiff.810 Grade B Studio Orion Pictures Starring Charlie Sheen Lindsay Crouse Teri Polo Ron Silver Leon Rippy Richard Schiff Director David Twohy Producers Robert W.

	schema:headline " A smart well done Alien movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "I had the pleasure of watching this film in the theater and to be quite honest that is the way it should be seen.  Its a well done movie about aliens visiting earth overall the story is nothing original but it does have more then a few tricks up its sleeve and is your typical Alien invader movie.Watching this on television years later its hard to appreciate just how well this film was shot.  One scene in particular involving a large dish and someone almost falling off the side of it almost caused me to make a mess in my pants when first watching the film on the big screen.When I saw it the theater was mostly empty not good for the movie but it probably allowed us to enjoy it some more and it was its first run did it have a second?.  Its sad the film didn't do as well as it should have at the time it was the best alien related movie in theaters I seem to remember independence day being out at the same time.My one gripe is a somewhat weak ending especially considering the strength of the rest of the movie.  Overall it is an entertaining and somewhat thought provoking film that you won't regret watching unless you don't like movies that emphasize suspense instead of action.  And there is a LOT of suspense in this film.  It doesn't skimp on action either but it saves it for the end of the movie where it belongs and makes some sense.Some people may not like its message either but I didn't have a problem with it and it certainly didn't get overly preachy.  People voice their opinions on screen just as someone would do in real life and I don't have a problem with that.  The real focus of the movie is aliens not the environment. If you fixate on the environmental message in the movie then you probably have some issues or just don't get this type of movie.  Global warming is more of a subplot that leads Mr Sheen in a certain direction and nothing more.The special effects are fairly spartan but effective and nicely creepy when they are used.Some of the characters are kind of annoying but are necessary and don't detract from the film overall.A worthwhile rental especially if you have a large TV to watch it on.".

	schema:headline " A very intense film";
	schema:reviewBody "What makes The Arrival so good is that it's paranoia could be real.  Where as scientists tell us that global warming is the result of smokestacks and deforestization and factories this film has other ideas.  And the ones that are in here are a little more frightening than what the scientists think. Think for one second all that has happened over the last decade or so. Think of all the ecological changes that we are facing right now.  These crisis are all a result of our greed and our industrializaton which in a way can be a euphanism of greed.  And this film takes all that we know about ozones and animal extinction and global warming and such and puts its own little spin on it.  What if a species that is greater than us has looked at what we are and decided that we are too stupid to take care of our own planet so they will take it away from us.  After all according to the theories that this movie subscribes to we are wasting and destroying this planet anyway why not speed up the process?Charlie Sheen stars as an astronomer who thinks he hears a definitive signal from outer space.  But when he brings it to his boss he learns that due to budget cut backs his department is being eliminated.  So his signal theory falls on deaf ears.  But from here on out the movie becomes almost Hitchcockian in the way that you have a character that knows something that no one will believe not his superiors not his girlfriend not even his friends.  And so it is up to him to try and find a way to convince everyone that he is not crazy and that he is telling the truth.  And what makes this film work so well is two things really.  The first being the story that was written David Twohy.  He also wrote The Fugitve so we know right away he is a good writer.  Here he has some excellent characters and crisp dialogue for them to speak.  The script is a real positive here.  But the second thing about this film that really makes it work is the portrayal that Sheen gives of Zane.  Sheen always looks confused and amazed at the same time.  He can't believe what it is that he has uncovered and his expressions and his mannerisms really do his character justice.  I can honestly say that the last time I saw fear like this from anyone that saw aliens first hand was in James Cameron's incredible 1986 film Aliens.  It has taken ten years for someone else to get an actor to show true fear when it comes to the subject of ETs.  Most films have the stars crack clever jokes about the aliens that they are meeting for the first time.  They rarely show fear but in The Arrival Sheen is always afraid.  He is never shown as anything more than a normal human being that has uncovered an ugly truth about the true agenda of what the aliens are realy up to.  His performance is one of the best things about this film.The Arrival is intense.  It doesn't stop for a breather too often and it is very intelligent.  It has interesting opinions and it also makes you question our own intentions when it comes to the well being of our planet. Most people passed this one over when it came out because Independence Day came out a mere month later but as good as ID4 was this is a different kind of movie.  It is more serious and has an opinion on some very political issues.  It never runs out of steam and it is very entertaining.  I highly recommend that you give it a chance.".

	onyx:emotionText "What makes The Arrival so good is that it's paranoia could be real.  Where as scientists tell us that global warming is the result of smokestacks and deforestization and factories this film has other ideas.  And the ones that are in here are a little more frightening than what the scientists think. Think for one second all that has happened over the last decade or so. Think of all the ecological changes that we are facing right now.  These crisis are all a result of our greed and our industrializaton which in a way can be a euphanism of greed.  And this film takes all that we know about ozones and animal extinction and global warming and such and puts its own little spin on it.  What if a species that is greater than us has looked at what we are and decided that we are too stupid to take care of our own planet so they will take it away from us.  After all according to the theories that this movie subscribes to we are wasting and destroying this planet anyway why not speed up the process?Charlie Sheen stars as an astronomer who thinks he hears a definitive signal from outer space.  But when he brings it to his boss he learns that due to budget cut backs his department is being eliminated.  So his signal theory falls on deaf ears.  But from here on out the movie becomes almost Hitchcockian in the way that you have a character that knows something that no one will believe not his superiors not his girlfriend not even his friends.  And so it is up to him to try and find a way to convince everyone that he is not crazy and that he is telling the truth.  And what makes this film work so well is two things really.

Most people opted to watch the latter film for all its big action scenes which left The Arrival a box office loser a destination it most definitely did not deserve.  Since then it has gained some life on video and will probably gain more popularity since the film marks the debut of director David Twohy who is proving to be a force to reckon with in Hollywood especially after his success with Pitch Black.Zane Ziminski Charlie Sheen is a brilliant radio astronomer who along with his partner Richard Schiff receive a radio signal which Ziminski believes was emitted from an extraterrestrial source.  But as soon as he hands the recording over to his boss Phil Gordian Ron Silver everything seems to go wrong.  Zane is fired his estranged girlfriend Charlotte Teri Polo is transferred his partner dies of an apparent suicide and the tape of the recording has seemingly vanished.Ziminski's new job as a cable repairman gives him access to his neighborhood's attena dishes which he lines up together into a phased array in hopes of receiving the signal again.  To his luck the signal returns but it's coming from a small town called San Marsol in Mexico.  Heading down there he meets a scientist named Ilana Green Lindsay Crouse who is down there studying the rising temperatures of thirdworld countries.  As Ziminski continues his investigation he believes he may have uncovered a worldwide alien conspiracy.What makes The Arrival as great a film as it is is because of the story which is smart and interesting.  Rather than giving us mindless action scenes writerdirector Twohy prefers to keep our attention with an intelligent story.  Despite this being his first time behind the camera he proves himself an adroit filmmaker weaving the story together brilliantly and unfolding little plot surprises along the way.The Arrival is primarily a thriller and Twohy is more than competent at creating action and suspense witness Pitch Black both elements of which are sharply executed in this film.  The final hour of the film is full of edgeoftheseat excitement.  Composer Arthur Kempel's score also adds an extra bit of tension. The film moves at a lightning pace and there's never a loss of momentum or a lag in the running time which runs smoothly throughout all 115 minutes.The cast is also strong with Charlie Sheen taking top acting honors.  I'm a little suprised of all the statements claiming he was miscast for the role. If anything he's the only person who could play the part and he comes through superbly never failing to convince for a moment.  Teri Polo is decent as Sheen's girlfriend and while her character isn't developed as well she still makes an impression in her limited screentime.  Ron Silver is utterly chilling as Ziminski's boss who wisely underplays the role rather than chewing the scenery.It's truly a breath of fresh air to watch a scifi thriller that relies on logic and plausibility to carry the story.  For viewers who enjoy a fine story and believable science with their scifi The Arrival is a true must see.".

The movie has a classic premise about a radio astronomer Charlie Sheen who receives a signal from outer space that may or may not have come from extraterrestrial life.To say anymore would be unforgivable as Twohy packs in believable twists and turns throughout the plot which is fun without insulting the brain and complex without ever bogging down in mindnumbing confusion. The script does have a few headscratchers here and there I was particularly miffed that Lindsay Crouse's character an environmentalist wasn't familiar with the concept of terraforming and some contrivances but they're hardly bothersome and aren't noticeable until a second viewing.As good a screenwriter as Twohy is he's even more adept as a director further proven by Pitch Black a superbly crafted deepspace thriller with a script not even half as smart as The Arrival's. With great pacing and precise editing Twohy builds momentum with each discovery Sheen unfolds until it culminates to an edgeoftheseat climax that's quite satisfying unlike...cough...cough...V the Final Battle Independence Day.The cast is allaround effective with Sheen delivering a surprisingly terrific performance as the paranoid astronomer. It's great to see an intelligent protagonist who thinks his way out of tight jams rather than shooting and blowing up everything in sight. No one else gets half of Sheen's screentime but Ron Silver is nicely ambiguous as his boss and Teri Polo however underused is fine as Sheen's girlfriend. Lindsay Crouse also makes a good impression as an environmentalist studying some strange activity.On a technical level some scifi fans might be a little disappointed. Those weaned on V and ID4 will notice the lack of largescale special effects. Sorry no discshaped motherships here. Still the visuals present are mostly decent certainly passable enough that they don't become a distraction to the plot. Despite the use of CGI in its more primitive stages this was '96 after all the effects are still occasionally excellent and imaginative such as the spherical object those tightlipped men wield. Composer Arthur Kempel's score adds a bit more tension to the already excruciating suspense and evokes a creepy atmosphere during the film's quieter moments.Remember folks The Arrival is a rarity a once in a while example of how pure movie magic can be created when we've got dedicated filmmakers who want to intrigue the audience rather than catering to demographics just for the sake of box office returns.

	schema:reviewBody "When the astronomer Zane Ziminski Charlie Sheen receives signal from a distant star he reports and gives all the evidences to his chief Phil Gordian Ron Silver and is immediately fired. Zane becomes obsessed to locate the signals again and finds a transmission to the outer space in the same wave from Mexico and he flies to the place. Meanwhile the scientist Ilana Green Lindsay Crouse is investigating the unexplained raise of the temperature in Third World countries and also goes to Mexico for further research. They meet each other in a small Mexican town where Zane finds that aliens are preparing to annihilate the human race and preparing Earth for their occupation.The Arrival has a good story that uses the abnormal raise of temperature and change in the climate on Earth as part of a plot of invasion of our planet by aliens. Director David Twohy follows the same style of John Carpenter in this movie. However there are two problems the first one is the permanent lunatic expression of Charlie Sheen who also keeps insane attitudes along the whole story giving a total lack of credibility to his character. The second one is probably the budget or a badly developed screenplay with flaws along the narrative.

	onyx:emotionText "When the astronomer Zane Ziminski Charlie Sheen receives signal from a distant star he reports and gives all the evidences to his chief Phil Gordian Ron Silver and is immediately fired. Zane becomes obsessed to locate the signals again and finds a transmission to the outer space in the same wave from Mexico and he flies to the place. Meanwhile the scientist Ilana Green Lindsay Crouse is investigating the unexplained raise of the temperature in Third World countries and also goes to Mexico for further research. They meet each other in a small Mexican town where Zane finds that aliens are preparing to annihilate the human race and preparing Earth for their occupation.The Arrival has a good story that uses the abnormal raise of temperature and change in the climate on Earth as part of a plot of invasion of our planet by aliens. Director David Twohy follows the same style of John Carpenter in this movie. However there are two problems the first one is the permanent lunatic expression of Charlie Sheen who also keeps insane attitudes along the whole story giving a total lack of credibility to his character. The second one is probably the budget or a badly developed screenplay with flaws along the narrative. Anyway this good scifi film entertains and has a good ecological message in the end particularly the quote If you can't tend to your own planet you don't deserve to live here. My vote is seven.Title Brazil A Invaso The Invasionnote On 23 August 2016 I saw this film again.";

In fact David Twohy writes all of his movies by himself and is very interested in science fiction and his second movie is no difference. The plot progresses logically and it 's very interesting to follow Charlie Sheen's Character through this mystery. This movie also has Twohy's remarkable style all over it which makes it visually creative as all of his work.

I totally disagree that this is a message movie  if there is a message about global warming here it is that aliens are causing it! Hardly a boon to the treehugger cause. And the head alien getting all pious at the end about humans not deserving the earth  this is not exactly a sympathetic character! So I fail to see this as a guilt trip. On the other hand it is interesting that topics like terraforming and colonization of other planets are creeping into real mainstream scientific discussion now almost a decade after this film's release. If there is a notsocool whenithappenstoyou message here you still have to give the filmmakers credit for being ahead of the curve.I generally assume that films that look like they suck always do  but every once in a while you stumble across one that doesn't!".

I doubt that both investigations would lead to the exact same place. Climate science isn't that precise. As for assassination attempts crushed by a bathtub is one of the most unusual and laughable. It seems so much easier and more common to simply shoot them. However I do really like the black hole metallic spheres.After a really good first half the movie starts to run into problems. It's still pretty good. David Twohy is most notable for the Riddick franchise. He needs to simplify the second half and ramp up the action. It tries to be too cute with the story.

	schema:reviewBody "I like scifi and while perusing movie offerings in that genre ran across The Arrival. The movie has an interesting premise we Earthlings are heating up our world by creating manman anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Aliens arrive who have a way of masking their true bodies with a device that allows them to appear human. They can live in high heat that would be unpleasant if not lethal to a normal human being. And because human beings clearly do not deserve Earth because we're destroying it by overheating it the aliens arrive to artificially heat up the atmosphere even more with greenhouse gases to kill us all off. One must remember the movie came out in 1996. At that time skepticism on a wide scale existed regarding the effects of global warming which more correctly should be called more extreme global climate change.All this being said the movie is riddled with weak points. First there is the chief character Zane Zaminsky Charlie Sheen. I first saw Sheen perform in Olive Stone's Platoon 1985 and thought he did a credible job. At that time I thought he might even turn out as good as his dad Martin Sheen. That of course didn't happen. In The Arrival he plays a perpetually excited and fearful radio astronomer based at a NASAoperated installation whose mission is to try to detect radio signals coming from outer space signifying an alien civilization SETI. Zane detects something that convinces him this is the signal and tries to convince his boss Phil Gordian Ron Silver that he received a message from aliens. Gordian poohpoohs it and gets rid of Zane. Zane being fired he shoots out on his own. Zane has issues with his girlfriend Char Teri Polo who doesn't see the big picture like Zane sees it. Zane meets a young black kid Kiki Tony Johnson who helps with his enterprise. With his jerryrigged apparatus Zane detects a signal identical to the one he got before except that it's not coming from outer space. It's coming from somewhere in Mexico. He shoots down to Mexico and bumps into a climatologist there Lindsay Crouse who also knows something's up. Meanwhile it turns out Gordian is an alienindisguise and sends two alienindisguise goons to destroy Zane's apparatus. Zane finds the alien nest in a privatelyoperated plant in Mexico it turns out there are many of them located in thirdworld countries. The company is supposedly involved in legitimate electrical generation but in reality it's generating instead vast amounts of greenhouse gases. Zane gets rid of the aliens in the plant. The climatologist is killed off by hordes of black scorpions planted in her hotel room by one of the aliens. Zane journeys back to NASA headquarters in LA and confronts Gordian and his goons. He eventually triumphs over the aliens and warns Kiki who it turns out is also an alien that their game is over and to tell his masters to send no more aliens to Earth.Good points I found the depiction of the aliens convincing as was the premise. Bad points The script was wooden and the acting was mediocre. Summary OK for a rental movie if you need a scifi fix. Not a 12atthetheater kind of movie.510".

This has lead to recent movies like Strange Days Independence Day and The Arrival. Charlie Sheen who has slipped into freefall since the heady days of Platoon is Zane Ziminski a radio telescope operator who searches the airwaves for alien contact from outer space.  When he encounters a radio signal he is sure is of alien origin he submits it to his boss Gordian Silver who then fires him.  When his equipment is confiscated and his partner is found dead in suspicious circumstances he becomes fully aware that a coverup of sorts is in operation. He tracks the signals to an isolated Mexican village where he meets another scientist Lindsay Crouse who has similar suspicions.  They are of the opinion that aliens are transmitting messages to aliens already on earth and he makes a startling discovery underneath the village...an underground alien lair who are speeding up the Greenhouse Effect in order to colonise the earth. Bad haircut bad goatee bad glasses bad lines.  That is Charlie Sheen for the most part of this science fiction thriller the same part that crawls along rather uneventfully making you wish you had chosen to watch Braveheart again.  However suddenly the heat is on when the aliens become aware that their plan is under threat and Ziminski loses the specs and becomes a bit of a unlikely hero. For all its problems The Arrival manages to create a small amount of tension as you start to wonder just who is on Ziminski's side and who is an alien.  When you think things are looking up the film fizzles out to an uninspiring end though and it's another missed opportunity for Sheen.  The special effects are impressive yet subtle but they are not enough to warrant this movie a must see.  Better luck next time Mr Sheen if there is a next time.Rating ".

To start off it's got some of the worst acting by an entire cast in a major motion picture. Some of this is due to the wretched dialogue but most of it is due to what seem like firsttake scenes. Charlie Sheen is overacting incredibly and everyone else is just plain wooden. The story would be interesting if it were not botched completely with unbelievable situations and silly action sequences. The direction is entirely unremarkable and the special effects are wholly unamazing. Plus it's got a kid in it  a sure flaw in any film for adults. Truly terrible.".

So it shall be. Therefore let us be happy let us be kind generous affectionate and good. Therefore it is necessary and not in the least shameful to take pleasures in the little world good food gentle smiles fruittrees in bloom and waltzes excerpted from Fanny  Alexander by Ingmar Bergman.Camille Pascale Bussieres a professor at a Protestant college is engaged to Martin Henry Czerny a sympathetic minister and fellow professor who clearly loves Camille. As career Christians they are urged to get married and to become cochaplains of the New College of Faith. But Camille is vaguely unhappy with Martin and her life and when her beloved dog dies suddenly she begins to lose her grip. As she sits weeping to herself in a laundromat Camille meets Petra Rachael Crawford a flamboyant circus performer. Anyone who has ever lost a pet knows how intangibly devastating it can be and Camille is sincerely shattered. Petra realizes this tries to offer solace and is so attracted to Camille that she finds a way for them to cross paths again. When they do meet again Petra flirts brazenly with Camille who is deeply offended confused yet curious as well. Petra who lives in her own paganly decorated trailer is part of a modern primitive circus not unlike The Jim Rose Circus Sideshow filled with freaks artists and jolly folk of all ilks. Petra who is looking to have Camille under the moonlight with her head thrown back balks when Camille sheepishly asks if they could just be friends instead like Thelma and Louise but without the guns? wanting to take her time. The two do become friends and Petra takes Camille hang gliding even though she has to convince her that the price of adventure is fear. For the first time in her proper and very intellectual life Camille's desire comes rushing forward. She is shocked to find that she is infatuated with Petra. Soon she believes that she is in love.But all is not well with the circus. Hounded by creditors the circus must leave town threatening to tear the new lovers apart. Meanwhile part of Camille is still deeply attached to Martin who is away trying to get a paper of his published in a seminarian journal while Camille and Petra discover each other. When Martin returns from his business trip and begins to figure out what has been happening his frustration comes a hair's breadth from turning into rage and tries getting through to her that experimentation is one thing but a three year bond is something else entirely. This is a beautiful little film by Patricia Rozema who also directed the lovely 1987 character study I Heard The Mermaids Singing. Due to a strict Calvinist upbringing Rozema had seen no films before the age of 16 and this film almost serves as a dialogue for her muse before and after she escaped the doctrines of the church. Pascale Bussieres is wonderful as Camille who is able to tread that fine line between confusion and curiosity very well. She has an inner beauty that draws not only Petra but the viewer. There is a calm in her soul that is so very soothing. There is no trace of anger or impatience in her character whatsoever instead she turns inward and mentally reviews her situation on such a continual basis always searching for balance that her trepidatious innocence is the allure that Petra finds so fascinating. With Bussieres' almond eyes auburn hair and porcelain skin hers is a very classic sense of beauty that is so dissimilar to Petra's attractiveness black sexy passionate whimsical that they make a very complementary match. Petra's initial impetuosity soon smoothes itself out and Camille's reticence begins to ebb as they both realize how much they can learn from each other if they can let their blossoming love develop naturally. There is such a wellmeasured sense of balance in this film that the love scenes are in turn very highly erotic as well as touching and moving. Perhaps the most difficult thing a person can ever do is look their partner in the eyes while making passionate love tell them 'I love you' and have it sound like the most intimate and genuine thing they'll ever hear. Bussieres is able to do this effortlessly. The character of Camille is so very obviously treading into deeper waters than she's ever fathomed before but she proceeds cautiously enough so that she is able to slowly and wisely understand that the love and understanding she has already been able to appreciate on an intellectual and otherworldly level through the church need not mean that it must be denied to her sensually simply because it's a body of another gender. In fact the lovemaking she shares with Petra is so unbridled that it unleashes her enough to be able to bring her new found passion back to her fianc which he duly notices and appreciates.Don't misunderstand me She does cheat on her fianc and in so doing Martin's anger is perfectly understandable but by that time the world that Camille has tasted and chooses to be a part of is chosen simply because it is one that is not as blindly judgmental as the church. If anything I would say that the film is too short by half an hour simply because the end is more of an escape than a conclusion but maybe that's the point. Or perhaps in the tradition of Traffaut Rozema plans to followup her story with Part Two.There aren't any evil characters in this film each of the leading roles are characters that are drawn and performed so well that you do end up caring for all of them so much so that when Martin realizes what has developed between his fiance and her new girlfriend the delight you feel for Camille is offset by the empathy you feel for Martin. No matter how painful it is for Martin to lose the love of his life the film makes it clear that it is much more than just sex with another woman that has persuaded Camille away It is a way of life that has more to do with living than the cloistered regimented facades she has grown to endure her entire life. If anything you wonder why Martin doesn't join them too.I hope this film gets a general release and finds an audience in the shopping malls because it could very gently and significantly open up conversations across middle America about the relationship between desire and gender.".

I have never seen love portrayed in such an openhonestwanting  unsured of their feelings kind of way. It is presented in a way most of us feel when we fall in love for the first time or when we fall in love with someone that is not the norm according to society. Even to this day I am impress with the way Patricia Rozema show the characters in such an emotional way that leaves the audience understanding why these two people fall in love. By the way Pascale Bussieres and Rachael Crawford were GREAT in this movie! After seeing this movie a viewer truly stops categorizing this moviein a genre such as lesbiangay canadian film etcand see that showing a love story is the true purpose of this film.Guys! Don't critize me too much!".

Camille had to go thru emotional battles with her feelings for her boyfriend and the Christian school job. The circus performances scenes were great and interesting.

As we all know it's not only common but inevitably predictable that heterosexually created films depicting G  L characterizations will include at least one of the aforementioned. Another aspect I find tremendously appealing is that the women involved in the depicted lesbian relationship are anyone's woman  meaning not mannish or ostentatious at all. The script direction and acting are immensely above average in the lesbian film genre! All of the actors portray their characters convincingly. The circumstances in which they come together are easily conceivable in a real life scenario. The way it's filmed is appealing and displays moments of arty elements.

What I admire most is the idea of putting together two women of very different patterns and create a romantic masterpiece Camille Baker a strict but sensitive university professor who teaches at a religious college and Petra a charming circus performer.I reckon Camille Baker and Petra's encounter resembles a child's first visit to the circus. All those colored and glittering lights the clowns who make him burst into laughter the most risky numbers make him feel odd but happy. For Camille Baker visiting the circus is entering the tunnel of love. Instead of thousands of lights she sees only one and she's afraid of reaching it instead of risky numbers she is dealing with love and hopelessly tries to deny it. She is no longer Camille Baker the conservative figure but plainly Camille. They are just two women Camille and Petra an expression of pure love.WNIF is an emotional and haunting film which also gives a fascinating a insight on circus life. I express my admiration towards Rachel Crawford who portrayed an intelligent deadly feminine and independent woman who didn't give up her pursuit of happiness.There is a chemistry between Camille and Petra which is kind of rare. They are both beautiful women with loads of sexappeal but they're beautiful in different ways Camille is the sober type betraying her chained passion by a pair of exquisite lips and Petra is the exotic beauty like a panther in captivity which is left into the wild. Along with her appearance she put Camille's boyfriend Martin into shadow and straight away he becomes Camille's cat's paw in her process of denying her feelings for Petra. I give this movie 1010 because it didn't come out as a lesbian movie but as a gorgeous love story.".

When Camille meets and is attracted to nervy and vivacious circus acrobat Petra an inner tension begins to build within her. One gets the feeling the filmmaker double majored in Art and Theater as this film is bursting with circusthemed surrealist metaphors and intense use of saturated colors. The surrealism sometimes seems a little heavyhanded but I understand the filmmaker was trying to contrast the Christian college milieu with that of the circus folk. The acting is very good and the film excels at depicting the hesitancy and awkwardness involved in striking out in an entirely new direction. Can you simultaneously reach physical fulfillment and grow spiritually by finding your erotic center and exploring new sexual possibilities? That's the question this film deals with. To the scriptwriter's credit the professors and ministers who espouse decidedly conservative positions with regard to homosexuality are not superstitious fire breathing gaybashers. There are some beautifully filmed and  by U.S. standards  quite revealing scenes of lesbian lovemaking in When Night Is Falling so if this sort of thing disturbs you steer clear. In sum this film works well and conveys the difficulty awkwardness and joy of discovering new ways of being. To quote first Camille and then Petra I'm nervous.

The process of building the business focuses on obtaining venture capital based solely on the idea with the actual mechanics of the website seemingly almost an afterthought or at least one left primarily to the hired help.

I think that speaks volumes for expectations during this era.I feel like some of the other IMDb reviews are off the mark. Yes the movie is sometimes hard to follow. But it was shot in the Cinmavrit genre and that is to be expected. It is an uncompromising real life look and it is up to the viewer to decipher sometimes this works sometimes not. Some previous reviews wondered how the company folded. Honestly its a movie about an internet company why do you think it failed? Having said this I think more could have been shown of why Tom got the axe and the love relationships of Kaliel could have been better developed.According to the DVD the producers cut some realistic and boringly technical scenes to focus more on the relationship between Tom and Kaleil. This is where they succeeded. They are trying to tell the story of the company downfall through the interplay of these two characters. It is fascinating because it is real. The most compelling part is the coorelation between their relationship eroding as does the company. Viewed from that point of view this movie is really not a documentary. Nevertheless it is entertaining and gripping. What amazed me was the unfettered greed and their enormous hubris which prevented them from acknowledge their role in this sinking ship.".

The fact that they wanted to document the startup of this venture from day one is another testimonial to their ego greed and lack of focus.I agree with most of the comments others have said about the movie. It's fragmented and has gaping holes in it relating to explaining what's going on. The viewer ends up really not having a clue as to why the venture failed which is another testimonial to the principals in that apparently the nature of what went wrong wasn't nearly as important to them as the fact that it did go wrong and their dreams weren't realized. Boo hoo.After seeing the movie and not having much additional information on the project I am left with my own thoughts as to some of the blanks that the film left open. Specifically these guys failed because they were more interested in the fruits of their labor than the labor itself which was a means to an end. That's why they failed. The only reason they got as far as they did is they ran into others greedy employees greedy financiers who were just like them and had no passion for the job just the brass ring that was promised at the end.They might have had good people working for them but I'd bet that there wasn't a single person in the company who actually had innate passion for the application and industry they were in. If you ask any successful businessman what's the secret the first thing they'll likely tell you is Do something you enjoy doing. I'm sure Kalil enjoyed hobnobbing with rich people but that wasn't the purpose of his company though it looks like his subsequent career involves that.We're left to try to figure out exactly how things went wrong.The one thing that I'm left with is the tech end of the project never worked right. I'd bet good money the whole foundation was built on Windows technology and was never very flexible or manageable. And Tom is probably responsible for dropping the ball there but then again like I said these guys didn't really care about the business... they just wanted to be successful.If anything the movie doesn't really teach us lessons about startups.

	schema:reviewBody "At the time of the dot.com boom Kaleil Tuzman and Tom Herman start up their own internet company seeking to offer a platform to enable activities carried out at the local Government level such as the payment of parking tickets applying for licenses and so on. We join them at the very start of this journey as they gather funding grow the employee base and begin developing their product and compete for business and investment. However in business as in life things do not always go to plan.I was quite looking forward to this film not least because it was one of the documentaries screened as part of the ten year anniversary of the BBC's Storyville stable  Storyville being known for the quality of the documentaries. Secondly I did also think the film sounded fascinating on many levels due to the subject matter but also the amount of access it had to the top people in the company throughout the entire process. I'll get to what I think of the film in a minute but firstly let stress that my focus will be what I thought of the film and NOT simply personal views on the people. Reading reviews here I was surprised by the number that said little on the film but seemed to be reviewing Kaleil and Tom  several with opinions and insinuations that I personally would call offensive at best racist at worst.Many have commented on the way Kaleil and Tom delivered or failed to deliver their product but again the concern for me as a viewer is how the makers of the film have failed to deliver. I'm not sure where the failing occurred but how it appears is that they thought the battle had been won simply because of their great access and that simply being there would be enough to make this fascinating viewing. They are wrong. I'm sure it must have been tough to edit the film down from two years into this running time but it feels like all they have done is cut together bits that are important without really packaging it together or helping the audience understand anything beyond what we are seeing. As a result it really fails to portray much of value in regards business or the dot.com era  hell even the closing captions seem brief and disinterested.Without a focus from the makers we are left to find our own and of course we end up on the individuals of Kaleil and Tom. This makes the film more of a flyonthewall reality TV show relying on personal tensions etc to drive the story forward but you know what? It isn't that good. Both men are interesting to a point but neither individually or together do they justify a film to share this with the world. It is a shame because the film is not terrible by any means but without any sort of focus and a real lack of vision from the makers we are left with very little of interest to work with and annoyingly it becomes increasingly apparent as you watch.".

Secondly I did also think the film sounded fascinating on many levels due to the subject matter but also the amount of access it had to the top people in the company throughout the entire process. I'll get to what I think of the film in a minute but firstly let stress that my focus will be what I thought of the film and NOT simply personal views on the people. Reading reviews here I was surprised by the number that said little on the film but seemed to be reviewing Kaleil and Tom  several with opinions and insinuations that I personally would call offensive at best racist at worst.Many have commented on the way Kaleil and Tom delivered or failed to deliver their product but again the concern for me as a viewer is how the makers of the film have failed to deliver. I'm not sure where the failing occurred but how it appears is that they thought the battle had been won simply because of their great access and that simply being there would be enough to make this fascinating viewing. They are wrong. I'm sure it must have been tough to edit the film down from two years into this running time but it feels like all they have done is cut together bits that are important without really packaging it together or helping the audience understand anything beyond what we are seeing. As a result it really fails to portray much of value in regards business or the dot.com era  hell even the closing captions seem brief and disinterested.Without a focus from the makers we are left to find our own and of course we end up on the individuals of Kaleil and Tom. This makes the film more of a flyonthewall reality TV show relying on personal tensions etc to drive the story forward but you know what? It isn't that good. Both men are interesting to a point but neither individually or together do they justify a film to share this with the world. It is a shame because the film is not terrible by any means but without any sort of focus and a real lack of vision from the makers we are left with very little of interest to work with and annoyingly it becomes increasingly apparent as you watch.";

The days when there was so much money being invested into promises and how the dot com bubble burst and took so much with it.Even though we now know where the story ends the documentary is gripping from start to finish. It charts the venture from the inception through to its demise although it focuses more on the early stages. I was part of a dot com venture and it really brought back the memories of everything is impossible we are unstoppable that was pushed by those that run the ventures. And in the case of govworks.com the gorgeous and charismatic CEO even met Clinton. How could it all go wrong? The documentary also charts in fact in particular charts the effect of the company on the personal relationships of those involved. Some of the agonies they face are better than stories you see in scripted dramas and because they are so real they are very involving.It's a shame that the latter stage's of the company's demise are skipped over we cut from them having over 200 employees to just 50 with no real explanation on what happened in between. Maybe it wasn't really required maybe they didn't want to be filmed but it felt like a bit of a hole. It's the only real complaint about the documentary however.Overall it accomplished showing us the birth and death of a dot com very well and how it affects those involved. And anyone who watches the documentary will probably like me go to www.govworks.com and with sadness see that the domain is owned by one of those companies that registers dead domains and feel such a sadness that all that blood sweat and tears ended this way.".

Lack of real backgrounds for these men is another failing of the film. A narrator could have told us what was really going on when their Asian cofounder walked away with 700000 what experience the men had working with venture capitalists none how the business was really going to work.

No narration no charts or graphs and no discussion of the other founders besides Tom and Kaliel who are only slightly interesting because the former is a gay single parent the latter a sexually overactive multiethnic who I took for an Arab or Semite of some sort. Lack of real backgrounds for these men is another failing of the film. A narrator could have told us what was really going on when their Asian cofounder walked away with 700000 what experience the men had working with venture capitalists none how the business was really going to work.

	schema:headline " A year in the life of a dot bomb";
	schema:reviewBody "The late '90s dot com boom was a time where young men quit jobs hooked up with friends started business and hopefully got rich. Most of those guys came crashing down as this era of business proved to be nothing but a wild spending spree where advertising pretty offices and boasting as to how much capital someone had raised from venture capitalists was commonplace. Startup.com is a documentary that records one company from this era govworks.com that started with a handful of friends grew in size quickly and then collapsed as many others would. Along the way girlfriends come and go friendships are strained software bugs emerge and are quashed and people come out at the end with little in their pockets.Startup.com begins when Kaleil Iszaza Tuzman quits his job with Goldman Sachs to become CEO of the then unnamed govworks.com. The company is the brainchild of Kaleil and Tom Herman who have known each other since high school. They are determined to create a website that will allow individuals to easily interact with their local governments to do such things as pay parking tickets their principal focus. As Kaleil first joins the venture it becomes obvious that he is a driven and very strong individual at one point he wants to name the site untocesear.com. Tom is a much softerspoken individual trying to keep everybody happy and deal with problems. Tom is the technical brains and Kaleil is the money go to guy.We watch as Kaleil begins making the rounds of venture capitalists trying to raise the funds to pay for their operation until they can reach their IPO and start seeing some cash influx. He enters into meetings the purpose of which is for companies to hand over millions of dollars all on the speculation that it will pay off in the future. It is here that first possible chinks in the armor of the two friends emerge Tom starts mentioning ideas in meetings that Kaleil doesn't want to pitch to the investors and quickly becomes frustrated with his inability to stay on message. Kaliel knows they have to pitch exactly what they want not a bunch of interesting ideas but Tom doesn't immediately think the same.Startup.com unfolds in footage that is shot in a variety of locations often in cars as individuals race from one meeting to another and we are presented at one point with a montage of scenes of people walking into and out of buildings rushing to catch planes trying their best to rub elbows with big money. You get the distinct impression that the biggest part of this world is showing up to put your hand out and say Please. Then comes the first major hurdle a third founder a coworker of Kaleil's from Goldman Sachs decides that the risk of the venture is too much and he wants out but not without a compensation of 800000 dollars. They deal with it as best they can and move on.Startup.com is in many ways less a story about a business than about what happens when you go into business with people you know and like and quickly find that business doesn't always allow you to deal with your friend as a friend but as a business associate. Aside from the capital raising Startup.com doesn't really give you a good indication of what it is like to run an internet business. In some ways this isn't necessarily a fault because it is easy to imagine that a bunch of people huddled around computers staring at screens filled with indecipherable code is probably not to exciting to watch. Even so as the film marches on and the months pass as the site is readied it is difficult to completely grasp all the issues involved in the technical aspects of the company.The film's major drama really hits when Tom and Kaleil begin having a falling out. Kaleil thinks Tom doesn't have the technical knowledge to really run that aspect of the business and is also becoming frustrated that Tom wants to be considered a coCEO and doesn't respect Kaleil's authority. It eventually leads to terse meetings and a letter dismissing Tom from his duties and then the ever famous scenes where a fired employee is escorted out of the building by security. It is somewhat difficult to watch some of these scenes as the individuals involved must fight the pain and hurt of putting their friendship through this wringer.Startup.com also doesn't really do a spectacular job of showing the company's final days as the film jump cuts over six months to a single line from Kaleil that reveals that the company is out of money and being sold. Again despite the desire to show a startup dot com business the business is sometimes what directors Jehane Noujaim and Chris Hegedus seem least interested in. Despite that Startup.com is still an interesting look at a brief but fascinating time in these peoples lives and proves enjoyable.".

It could had easily put some more focus on its subject starting a dot com company or more on the 2 main founders of it.The documentary really doesn't explain thoroughly what the entire idea and functionality behind govWorks.com was. So the viewers are being pretty much clueless at what the creators of this website are actually trying to achieve and how they think that they can rule the market with their one idea and concept. It's therefore hard to truly distinctive for the viewers what they were doing right and what they did wrong with their concept.It also doesn't help much that none of the key persons in this documentary very rarely recapitulate or explain anything into the camera. We don't get to see why they made certain choices or even how the website got developed or marketed. or why certain people had to leave the company because they weren't considered suitable enough for the job. Apparently this got shot over the course of about 2 years but the movie is being told and cut in such a way that it actually feels like a couple of weeks. Seems to me that the camera only showed up once for a day every two weeks or only when a special event or important day got planned. So to me the documentary just doesn't feel like a natural and well flowing whole because too much stuff and time got omitted and it was lacking in focus or detail.Perhaps this all could had been saved and more interesting if the two main founders were presented as some more interesting individuals as well. They now instead more come across as two inexperienced young guys who have plenty of ambition but are pretty much clueless at what they are getting themselves involved with and the movie really doesn't focus enough on their characters at who they are and what is driving them. Because of this you are not really feeling at all involved with any of them or their dreams and goals.It probably sounds as if I hated this documentary but this is far from the truth really. It still remains a good watch because it still has a good subject and it's always fun and interesting to see other people working hard and dealing with all kinds of ups and downs.

Edmund pretends he's old enough to work but when he's denied that opportunity he steals sells items in the black market or allows his former teacher to caress him lasciviously for a few marks. What's more impressive in this film is the lack of sentimentality  compared to De Sica's children movies and the absence of preaching when one character does preach he would have better stayed shut! I think that many scholars are no longer interested in the aesthetics of Italian Neorealism butin my appreciation Roberto Rossellini is one of the big names in the history of cinema far more important than other filmmakers who are idolized and his war films are more interesting to me than later works as Voyage in Italy.".

War shaped the content of much of cinema's finest period whether as direct historical reconstruction distortion for propaganda purposes or simply by feeding the necessity for romantic escapism.  By the end of the war Italian neorealism was entering its great period.  A nation that had suffered much looked unflinchingly at its society.  It is not therefore surprising that an Italian Roberto Rossellini was able to empathise so acutely with the plight of the German people in their zero year following the collapse of the Third Reich.  Amid the rubble of Berlin 12 year old Edmund does what little he can to earn trifling amounts to help feed his family including a chronically sick father. They are not popular with their neighbours as an ill man is an encumbrance and there is still a residue of the Nazi dogma of the survival of the fittest abroad.  Something of this eventually gets twisted in Edmund's immature mind causing him to embark on the terrible path of patricide.  Innocence is thus destroyed in a particularly horrifying way. Germany Year Zero is as bleakly pessimistic and despairing as any film to come out in the immediate aftermath of the war.  Other films equally grim such as Wadja's Kanal SandersBrahms's Germany Pale Mother and Klimov's Come and See are recollections after gaps in time.  The strength of Rossellini's work is its documentary immediacy.  The bombs have all but fallen and trams have started to run again.  The graves being dug at the beginning look as if they are for real and the horse that has collapsed in the street that has excited a group of gathering carnivores could have died moments before the camera arrives.  Germany Year Zero is neither comforting nor uplifting but it looks so real it had to be.".

Roberto Rosselini captured a tragedy that has been largely ignored and his haunting work screams the pain of post war civilian suffering in Berlin louder than any documentary.Not only filmed in the very streets where a million died only months before all those appearing in Stunde Null were quite clearly living the very experience they were enacting. These were not actors. Their performances are clumsy and strained without the polish of professional training or Hollywood editing. But that was the magic of this production. This was not drama but rather a window of reality. Their faces were scarred by the terrors they had just survived and one can only wonder at their courage to enact their own daily suffering for the entertainment of others.The essence of the plot is simple enough. It is the story of ordinary German civilians trying to survive the starvation and deprivations of 1945 Berlin. The central character is a 12 year old boy Edmund who has to endure anything and everything in order to provide for his family. And in the end.....Well nobody knows what really happened to Edmund Moeschke the ex Hitler Jugend who was playing himself. After filming the external shots in Berlin the entire cast were taken to Rome in 1946 where the interior scenes were put together. And of course most of them attempted to remain there. Edmund disappeared from history and probably met his end somewhere in the Roman streets. Certainly he has never emerged to claim the accolades that would undoubtedly be poured upon him were he to only mention his name.But Edmund will never be forgotten because his tragic story touches the soul and speaks for millions of other youngsters who were so cruelly sacrificed in that terrible conflict. This is not a film it is a masterpiece.".

Their drama is hunger and misery the problem is recurrent never solved. The father is too ill to help out. The older brother an ex nazi hides from the police. The sister goes to the dancing to meet French and Americans. It is finally Edmund only 12 years old the youngest of them all who really struggles to improve things and find food and money. At one point he starts following bad advice and the tragedy begins. What Germany Year Zero shows us is how adults unaware of it can influence a child into making drastic and dramatic decisions. As the movie goes on he becomes more and more isolated physically and morally. The last scene is very poetic and at the same time tragic  one minute you see him playing in the ruins like a child kicking a stone with his shoe playing with a piece of junk sliding down a beam the next minute he puts an end to his life. To be seen by all lovers of neorealism. With some similar themes I also recommend Visconti's Rocco and his Brothers and The Damned.".

At one point he starts following bad advice and the tragedy begins. What Germany Year Zero shows us is how adults unaware of it can influence a child into making drastic and dramatic decisions. As the movie goes on he becomes more and more isolated physically and morally. The last scene is very poetic and at the same time tragic  one minute you see him playing in the ruins like a child kicking a stone with his shoe playing with a piece of junk sliding down a beam the next minute he puts an end to his life. To be seen by all lovers of neorealism. With some similar themes I also recommend Visconti's Rocco and his Brothers and The Damned.";

	schema:reviewBody "One of Roberto Rossellini's masterpieces Germany Year Zero suffers only from one minor liability which is not totally the filmmaker's fault. The film was shot in German with the native language but it was later shown around the world at least I think around the world in an Italiandubbed print which is also the version currently available on American DVD. True Rossellini as far as I know didn't speak German and he had it in Italian so he wouldn't have trouble getting the film distributed in his native land where he broke ground with Open City and Paisan. But it is a fair enough indication that not EVERYTHING in a film such as Germany Year Zero is based in total reality based on seeing this version. Once this is looked past though one can get into the actual story and characters which is what Rossellini is after getting at least the emotional loss in this world perfectly clear.Germany Year Zero  the third in a socalled trilogy of films that began with his breakthrough Open City and continued with Paisan  was brilliantly executed in the quasidocumentary cinematography by Robert Juillard the appropriately sorrowful score by Renzo Rossellini and in the performances by first timers like Edmund Moeschke as Edmund Koeler the main character Ingetraude Hinze as Eva Koeler Edmund's desperate sister and Erich Guhne as Herr Enning Edmund's exteacher who becomes a crucial supporting character. Edmund is a preteen who's lived through the devastation of the War like his family the families he lives with and everyone else around him in the city and he tries to get work despite his alltooyoung age. Things seem bleak for his family as his brother doesn't want to work for fear of being caught as a prisoner of the war his elderly father can't work and his sister goes out every night looking for things that only help herself. When Edmund runs into his once schoolteacher Enning who is part of the cold evil remnants of the Nazi regime and this leads into the last act of the film with startling heartbreaking results.While the story of Edmund and of the line that scorches a kid's conscience between childhood innocence and the horrors of the real world is a compelling and historically important one to tell what Rossellini achieves here more than anything is the sense of dread in a desolate atmosphere. He achieved that in Open City too I have yet to see Paisan so I can't comment but that film had the tendency to take a little too much time involving us in subplots. In Germany Year Zero however the images presented stay with the viewer long after the film has ended since they're akin to the kind of sensibility Polanski had with The Pianist in a technical sense we're following someone in his own personal struggle for survival in an environment that's in rubble with many of the people around the character without much hope. There's also the theme of sacrifice like in the other two films in Rossellini's trilogy and that plus a theme of a sort of helpless hope in human spirit stays true through the seventy minutes of this film. Highly recommended the language dubbing practically regardless.".

If the viewer has seen the documentary of Leni Riefenstahl Triumph des Willens about of the Sixth Nazi Party Congress in 1934 or the megalomaniac dream of Hitler about the fate of Berlin in Undergngens Arkitektur he or she will be certainly more impressed with the totally destroyed and chaotic postwar Berlin. Germania Anno Zero depicts the lack of hope starvation and ruins of ordinary people mostly women elders youths and children doing anything to survive. This pessimist film is a milestone of the Italian NeoRealism and it is amazing how the German people were able to rebuild their nation and Berlin from the ashes. My vote is ten.Title Brazil Alemanha Ano Zero Germany Year Zero".

Rossellini remains one of the best Italian directors or directors in general of all time!!I believe this filmGermania Anne Zero will gain popularity and be listed amongst the greatest films of all time!! Don't Miss It !!";

	schema:reviewBody "Besides victory and its subsequent prestige one of the many privileges the winners get is the participation to the process of History writing. Naturally it doesn't mean that this writing would be made of lies but sometimes we can lie by omission  there must be a reason why the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagazaki doesn't get the same emotional coverage than the Holocaust or talking the bombing of Dresde or Cologne or any German town seems indecent. Naturally out of all the three Axis countries Germany will pay the war's biggest price and carry forever the seal of infamy.And this is why even today it's still embarrassing or discomforting to talk about the suffering of the German people. They started the war after all so in a way they had it coming and who'd cry on people who were so blinded they let a man like Hitler take the power. Of course it takes to know a minimum about history to understand that there are fifty shades of gray in these black and white images and that a poor German grandmother still has less blood in her hands than the pilot of the Enola Gay. But that's the essence of war it is written by winners and this is why Germany Year Zero is not a film it's a historical document.Its historical significance lies on the simple fact that the film is shot in 1947 when Germany was still inhabited by people who lived the War where kids were still young enough to remember the Soviets coming to Berlin where Hitler's voice still resonated in people's mind. Germany was slowly recovering from the pleas of World War II the Nazi's officers were all hanged some nostalgic kept a low profile no doubt that Germany was at her lowest level and an Italian director Roberto Rosselini decided to show that historical sequence for posterity as a part of his PostWar trilogy. I don't know if Italy being an Ally to Germany inspired this sympathy but I can only applaud the gutsy aspect of the project.Germany Year Zero focuses on a little boy named Edmund and in the purest Neorealist tradition we're invited to follow a kid's journey within the ruins of a devastated Berlin trying to find ways to nourish his impoverished family. And as we follow him we realize that the greatest heals are the moral ones those that can't be sealed like that women tempted to prostitute themselves impotent men condemned to be a burden for their family young kids forced to steal to smuggle food young girls to exchange a few touching and kissing for cigarettes an exsoldier hiding not to be enrolled with the police and soon and so forth  yet the most painful character's arc is for the little Edmund. As usual for NeoRealism kids represent the innocent present corrupted by the corrupting effects of the past on the future.Edmund looks like one of these Hitlerian youth pictures he's 13 but sounds younger he's obviously a good kid who hasn't been brainwashed by Nazi propaganda but his ineptitude to read between the adult lines and to understand the lies and the cynicism will lead him to devastating decisions. And this is the story Rosselini tells us not Germany but a part of Germany's soul lost by the War whose effects are still significant even if the swastika is history. The film shows us another facet of war it isn't over when it's over its effects and damages last and we can almost talk about a sacrificed generation. Those who fought died those who lived will suffer and when the babyboomers will grow old they'll understand why the elder say a good war that would teach you.And after watching Germany Year Zero I was glad I didn't have to go through that nightmare to understand the value of life. But I confess I didn't need the story for that seeing the characters surrounding Edmund was enough. This is why I'm asking myself if we movie lovers feel forced to love a film just for the subject it tackles. I will never go as far as saying that it is a bad movie I must say the story of Edmund didn't leave me quite an impression I mean I felt sorrier for German people than Edmund. And I almost feel guilty for that I mean for once that a filmmaker decides to focus on a postwar Germany... It's not that I wanted to love the film I thought I would love it I loved Bicycle Thieves and much more Sciuscia but Germany Year Zero left me cold.I know the film is supposed to show a child lose his innocence being a victim of desolation and the destruction of all the values that brandished the German flag higher than any European culture but I couldn't find any difference between Edmund from the beginning and Edmund from the ending. The film is supposed to be dark I give you that but how about showing a truly enthusiastic kid in the beginning eager to make money from black market and then palpable reactions from all the hardship he endured in other words the kid wasn't a good actor or lacked some direction from Rosselini to make his character's arc believable.But neorealism often employs amateurs actors well the main protagonist in Bicycle Thieves was an amateur how about the performance of the child who played his son or the other child in Sciuscia. Yes this is coming from someone who love Italian neorealistic period and its influence on the 50's New Wave this artistic wave is responsible for Fellini's greatest work. but these are movies about characters it's all about hooking your heart on another one no matter how flawed he or she is. But here it's like Rosselini took for granted that because we're watching a child it will win our sympathy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Germania anno zero is a blackandwhite sound movie from 1948 so this one soon has its 70th anniversary. The star here is the director namely Roberto Rossellini who also wrote the film. The film basically plays also the very same time when it was made namely in Germany that is completely destroyed after World War II. We follow a little boy named Edmund also the actor's real name and the actor is one of several examples from this movie who never appeared in a film before or afterward again. The reason may be that Rossellini usually made Italianlanguage films so this one is a big exception and he could obviously not cast the people from this film again because of language barriers. However this is also not a big problem as in my opinion none of the actors left a really lasting impression. But the real problem here was the story. There were 2 really shocking developments at the end of the film one in the very last scenes and I felt none of these felt authentic or realistic unfortunately.The movie is about a boy who meets a former teacher and makes a connection with him. As the teacher is still a loyal Nazi obviously nothing good can follow from it. I guess people from allied countries must have really enjoyed this film back then as it shows the Nazis at pure evil but really never gets to the core of the problem. It was never about making people kill other people for them. It was all about committing the crimes themselves and talk and act towards the people in a manner that they accept it as necessary but do not really do it themselves. This is also why I guess the film does not make much sense in a political context apart from believing that the boy's actions especially the killing did not make any sense and would not have happened like this in reality. And the film is all about these developments really. The scenes that do not have to do with these or almost not are not very interesting to watch either. I have not seen any other Rossellini films I think but this one here did not get me in the mood to do so anytime soon. Fairly disappointing and I do not recommend it. Good thing it only runs for a very short 73 minutes as these felt already too long. The IMDb rating is way too high. I give Germania anno zero a thumbs down.".

The boy in the lead role is really good and the supporting cast is also very realistic. Thumbs up for the boldness!".

In this one Rossellini nearly forgives the Germans for everything they have done and depicts them in their actual situations all the actors are real people. The boy in the lead role is really good and the supporting cast is also very realistic. Thumbs up for the boldness!";

Minor spoilers Edmund comes off like way too nice of a kid to be persuaded towards something so obviously wrong just by a quick rant! I felt the motivations just weren't there throughout the film. The ending just felt way too forced for the sake of shock. The lead up to it could've had worse things happen than some kids not wanting to play with him and a Nazi slapping him! Overall I felt this film was more interesting being filmed so close to the real events.

	schema:reviewBody "The print of Germania Anno Zero discussed below was hard to watch because although it takes place in the postWW2 ruins of Berlin the German cast is overdubbed in Italian and the subtitles are in English. As if this weren't enough the abundant dialogue is delivered very rapidly in the Italian style so the eye and attention are constantly darting from the actors to the subtitles and missing the emotional and visual element. And if you don't follow the subtitles you miss telling details of what's going on. Reviews from the period of its initial release indicate that it was once screened in German with English subtitles. Perhaps that print has been lost if so a shame. The Italian language being so very different from German in its feel and cadence not only disorients us but dilutes the essence of the experience. Another problem is the acting which is mostly on the wooden side so you never get under the characters' skin. At the heart of the film is a little boy and simply because he is a little boy he touches our hearts  but only to an extent his acting is so robotic that it's hard to tell what he is feeling so that the film's resolution comes as quite an arbitrary shock. The whole film in fact has a perfunctory and contrived structure like a diagram hastily drawn on a blackboard brought to life.That said this film is worth seeing simply because of where and when it was filmed. It's a quasi documentary showing the price of war on human beings. But it's not the only one of its kind. The Big Lift and A Foreign Affair were also filmed in postWW2 Berlin and dealt with the effect of war on the populace. I think what added to the impact made by neorealist films of the late 40s was their immediacy use of actual  and usually harsh  locations and nonprofessional actors. Those elements seemed refreshing and bracing to audiences who had been accustomed to the artificiality of the Hollywood template.".

He's not filled with despair exactly but there are times when he wishes himself to be out of the way. It's a family of four but they are trying to survive on only three ration cards because his older son who fought the war to its bitter end is afraid to turn himself in despite reassurances from others that he won't be punished by the Allied occupation authorities. He's in his 20s and he's bitter as hell about it all. There is a blond daughter too and she takes care of Papa when she's not out banging soldiers for a few cigarettes.But the story centers about Edmund the younger son who is about twelve years old. He's just at that age at which people begin to form a more enduring pictures of themselves but his particular self image has a multitude of lacunae. He absorbs what values and ideas he can from his family but they're all screwed up by poverty.Then among his Dickensian adventures Edmund runs into his former teacher who does him little favors and caresses his cheek lasciviously. Herr Professor seems to have a thing going with a stern authoritarian figure who apparently has a thing going with several young boys.The teacher is not merely a pimp but a philosopher and as he guides Edmund around through the streets that have only recently been cleared of broken granite he begins to spout a kind of Social Darwinism as much to himself as to Edmund and without passion or even much conviction. You know the weak must die and get out of the way for the strong the survival of the fittest dog eat dog it's a zero sum game.Edmund though is a kid and he takes this bushwa seriously because he doesn't know the difference between philosophy and everyday life. Shakespeare for what it's worth new the difference. In The Merry Wives of Windsor he has Falstaff remark sarcastically There never was philosopher could bear the toothache patiently. But Edmund is too young to know. So he goes home poisons Papa and the old man dies. No one knows what Edmund did so he's taken aback by all the grief shown by the family and the neighbors. Not that the sadness of Papa's passing prevents the neighbors from speculating about what will be done with Papa's shoes.There is also the problem of the body. What do you do with a corpse when you don't have money for a casket let alone a funeral? You can't just let it lie there. For me the most horrifying episode on Crime and Punishment was when a man dies in Raskolnikov's apartment house and the family having no money the body deteriorates and causes a smell. The neighbors haul the body out onto the balcony and leave the family to deal with it.I wonder if in a way the story of Edmund's development is not meant as a summary of the evolution of Germany before during and after the war. He begins as a naif. Then under the tutelage of a reckless and unthinking lunatic he embraces a dangerous philosophy. And then he suffers the same fate as his nation.".

The Price Of Power 1969 and the comical Il mio nome  Nessuno 1973. Films like these make Valerii the Italian Western's most memorable director besides the three Sergios Sergio Leone Sergio Corbucci and Sergio Sollima. But Valerii who also served as assistant director to Sergio Leone for A Fistful Of Dollars and For A Few Dollars More is not only a great Western director. Mio Caro Assassino aka. My Dear Killer of 1972 is an excellent and highly intriguing Giallo and the ideal proof that Valerii is also a master of ThrillerHorror cinema. This is arguably THE Giallo with the most complex plot ever and the constant twists make this film a tantalizing and absolutely unpredictable experience that no lover of Italian Horror can afford to miss. My Dear Killer does not deliver casual entertainment however  This film's exceptional complexity requires the viewer to concentrate on the plot. I can assure however that no Giallo fan will regret concentrating on this film which is stunning throughout and excellent in all regards.Ispector Luca Peretti George Hilton is investigating a murder series that is somehow connected with the kidnapping of a little girl that occurred a year earlier... As my fellow Giallo fans should appreciate the death toll rises constantly and the twists and number of suspects make it almost impossible to guess who the killer is. This excellently photographed film has the typical atmosphere of good Gialli from the early 70s and the many twists are highly elaborate. Regular Giallo leading man George Hilton is great in his role as the investigating inspector. The cast furthermore includes such great regulars of Italian genrecinema as Piero Lulli and William Berger and all other performances are also very good. This is may not be quite as bloodsoaked as some other great Gialli such as Sergio Martino's Torso or most of Dario Argento's films but the exotic choices of murder weapons should also make this interesting enough for the gorehounds out there. The film's main focus is the complex plot but the killings are depicted in a violent and very stylish manner. None other than maestro Ennio Morricone delivers the great score the highlight of which is an exceptionally eerie lullaby theme song. From the great beginning to the ingenious end  Mio Caro Assassino is a complex and tantalizing mustsee for all Giallofans and also highly recommended to all other lovers of suspense and great cinema in general!".

Slowly more people are found dead and the inspector investigates the strange killings with numerous suspects Monica Randall Alfredo Mayo  William Berger.Tonino Valeri 's great success is compelling directed with startling visual content.This frightening movie is plenty of thrills chills bodycount and glimmer color in lurid pastel with phenomenal results. This is a classic slasher where the intriguetension suspense appear threatening and lurking in every room corridors and luxurious interior and exterior.This genuinely mysterious story is well photographed by Manuel Rojas with magenta shades of ochre translucently pale turquoises and deep orangered .The movie belongs to Italian Giallo genre that was invented by Mario Bava along with Riccardo FredaSecret of Dr. Hitchcock  they are the fundamental creators . These Giallo movies are characterized by overblown use of color with shining red blood usual zooms and utilization of imagesshock . Later appears Dario ArgentoDeep red SuspiraInferno another essential creator of classic Latin terror films. Tonino Valeri's soso direction is well crafted here he's less cynical and humorous and more inclined toward violence and lots of killings . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Manuel Rojas . Very good musical score by the classic Ennio Morricone. The picture is well directed by Tonio Valeri  an expert on Western as proved in The hired gun   My name is nobody  with Fonda and Terence Hill  The price of power  with Giuliano Gemma and Van Heflin  The day of anger with Lee van Cleef and  Taste of Killing with Craig Hill and George Martin . Rating Good this is one more imaginative slasher pictures in which the camera stalks in sinister style throughout a story with magnificent visual skills.".

Slowly more people are found dead and the inspector investigates the strange killings with numerous suspects Monica Randall Alfredo Mayo  William Berger.Tonino Valeri 's great success is compelling directed with startling visual content.This frightening movie is plenty of thrills chills bodycount and glimmer color in lurid pastel with phenomenal results. This is a classic slasher where the intriguetension suspense appear threatening and lurking in every room corridors and luxurious interior and exterior.This genuinely mysterious story is well photographed by Manuel Rojas with magenta shades of ochre translucently pale turquoises and deep orangered .The movie belongs to Italian Giallo genre that was invented by Mario Bava along with Riccardo FredaSecret of Dr. Hitchcock  they are the fundamental creators . These Giallo movies are characterized by overblown use of color with shining red blood usual zooms and utilization of imagesshock . Later appears Dario ArgentoDeep red SuspiraInferno another essential creator of classic Latin terror films. Tonino Valeri's soso direction is well crafted here he's less cynical and humorous and more inclined toward violence and lots of killings . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Manuel Rojas . Very good musical score by the classic Ennio Morricone. The picture is well directed by Tonio Valeri  an expert on Western as proved in The hired gun   My name is nobody  with Fonda and Terence Hill  The price of power  with Giuliano Gemma and Van Heflin  The day of anger with Lee van Cleef and  Taste of Killing with Craig Hill and George Martin . Rating Good this is one more imaginative slasher pictures in which the camera stalks in sinister style throughout a story with magnificent visual skills.";

	schema:reviewBody "Anyone who ever saw My Dear Killer is most likely to agree when I claim that it's nearly impossible to find another horror film with a more convoluted plot! I never thought I'd say this but this movie almost exaggerates with the constant adding of new twists and complexity! My Dear Killer which is a giallo in the purest definition of the term features nearly a dozen murder victims and an equal amount of suspects. Paying close attention to the development of the plot is difficult enough already so guessing along for the killer's identity is pretty much out of the question. And yet it's another wondrous example of Italy's finest horror sub genre with brutal slaughters controversial themes and great music! Gialloregular George Hilton All the Colors of the Dark Case of the Bloody Iris plays Peretti a police detective charged with investigating the eerie murder of an insurance inspector. He was obviously getting too close to someone's dark secrets and in order to solve the case Peretti has carry on with the decapitated victim's research. All traces lead to the unsolved kidnapping and eventual murder of a young girl in the area. The killer clearly doesn't know how he is to getting caught as he precautionary starts to eliminate everyone close to the case. Be advised that the above is a very vague description of the plot as a more detailed summary would cover several pages. Apart from a few minor holes in the plot and a handful of illogicalness My Dear Killer is a hugely compelling and intense murdermystery. Especially the violence will appeal to hardcore horror fans as the killer even uses circular saws and construction machinery! Tonino Valerii is not a very eminent Italian horror filmmaker or at least not as eminent as say Dario Argento Lucio Fulci or Sergio Martino but his directing is truly stylish and he obviously read the big book of gialloguidelines carefully before he started making this movie. Highly recommended!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Italian mystery or 'Giallo' sub genre is great. You can almost always count on an entertaining ride while watching a Giallo and while 'My Dear Killer' isn't one of the top examples of the sub genre it definitely does deliver a good time and fans of the style of films will not be disappointed by it. Some Giallo's follow a more urban setting Seven Blood Stained Orchids The Case of the Bloody Iris while others take place in the rural countryside Don't Torture a Duckling House With the Laughing Windows. The latter often make for the better films and My Dear Killer is a part of the rural Giallo section. I actually prefer the cityscape for a mystery setting but it doesn't matter because it's always the plot that's more important than the setting anyway. The plot is here is pretty much Giallostandard and it follows a detective on the case of a murder that seems to be linked to a horrific crime that took place years earlier. As usual he follows leads and gets deeper and deeper into the mystery when he finds that there's more to the case than originally met the eye...The film starts off with a very unusual murder scene. It sees someone killed via a big mechanical digger and while this scene is rather silly and over the top it does show that the film obviously isn't afraid to go over the top. I was surprised to find after the opener that the film only features on other stylish murder and although it's very nice girl sliced up with a circular saw I tend to expect a bit more gore when watching this sort of film. The locations in the movie are rather uninspired but this doesn't stop director Tonino Valerii presenting a nice atmosphere that helps to make the film more exciting and interesting. The lead role is taken by Giallo regular and star of The Case of the Bloody iris George Hilton. It's quite clear that he's done this sort of thing before as his performance gives the impression that he's not all that interested in his subject material. Still it doesn't matter because the plot is interesting enough and this combined with an intriguing mystery and some nice nudity and gore make this an admirable entry in the list of 'Giallos'.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the opening strains of its eerie babylullaby theme song to its haunting final shot of a child's drawing My Dear Killer 1972 is a giallo pervaded with a sense of tragedy. A year before the action depicted in the film a young child had been kidnapped from her wealthy parents' country villa and left to die and now a wave of homicides seemingly connected to this tragedy opens the case anew. Giallo regular George Hilton plays Inspector Peretti here a character who surely deserves a medal or promotion of some sort for getting to the bottom of this case indeed My Dear Killer is one of the most complicated gialli that I have ever seen. It is the type of film that you watch by the skin of your teeth just barely comprehending the plot as things unspool a repeat viewingin my case anywayreveals that this seemingly unfathomable plot does make perfect sense. Anyway Hilton mustachioed here for a change is excellent as usual director Tonino Valerii keeps things nice and suspenseful and the maestro Ennio Morricone provides a score that if not his most memorable is appropriately nerve jangling and eerie as I mentioned up top. While not a particularly violent giallo a pair of set pieces should make this film of interest to all the gorehounds out there one decapitation murder using an enormous dredging machine and most horribly the death of a gorgeous schoolteacher with a circular power saw. Don't all women have this tool lying around their apartment? This latter scene although not overly graphic still proved kind of hard for me to watch. As far as the killer's identity is concerned I suppose it IS possible to figure this one out but my advice would be to just relax and enjoy the fun. The DVD that I just watched by the way from the fine folks at Shriek Show looks just fine but includes no subtitling option...not even with the interview extras which are all in Italian! A pity...I would have enjoyed Hilton's comments on this very entertaining giallo all these years later....".

Then along the way of course everybody who was involved meets some sort of sticky end which was another aspect that excited and interested me especially the girl who gets attacked with a buzzsaw which was both terrifying and well done.Okay there are some bad points like for starters the pacing was rather slow at times and some of the characters didn't quite stand out I couldn't tell some of them apart and there weren't enough colourful characters to fully ingage in. But what saves things are the delightful twists and turns round every corner and especially loved the scene at the end where the detective gathers round the last remaining suspects in a Agatha Christie kinda way about the reveal the identity of the killer which was delightful especially when the lights go out and then someone screams.All in all a fairly entertaining addition to the Giallo genre but not one of the best ones though but still decent enough.".

	schema:reviewBody "A man is decapitated by a dredger when trying to find an unspecified item from a swamp. The victim Paradisi worked as an insurance investigator on 'the Moroni Case'  an unsolved crime where a little girl was abducted and held to ransom. Her father delivered the ransom but he and the child were subsequently killed. The swamp murder sets off a series of killings as the killer feels the law getting too close. Inspector Luca Peretti is called in to get to the bottom of the mystery.My Dear Killer is a very good classicstyle giallo. It has a very convoluted plot even by the genre's standards. So it demands that the viewer pays close attention. Director Tonino Valerii has managed to put together a quite gripping mysterythriller here where the various twists and turns are incorporated into the narrative very effectively indeed. The film has the occasional giallo theme of childkilling. This ensures that there is an especially uncomfortable undercurrent to proceedings. Indeed one of the suspects appears to be a paedophile and there does appear to be a very young naked girl in his apartment  this scene is extremely shocking to be honest. More typical of the genre is the usual array of violent murder scenes the most famous of which involves a circular saw. The stalk and kill sequences are all wellhandled and quite tense and scary although overall the focus is far more on the police procedural mystery than the more gory violent aspects.George Hilton puts in a very good performance as Peretti and really holds things together well. His character is fairly rounded with a home life too which adds to the overall depth. Adding to the atmosphere immeasurably too is Ennio Morricone. Il Maestro provides yet another nice score that fits the tone very well especially good is the creepy lullaby theme that echoes the childkilling background to the story.As I said this is a giallo with a much more pronounced whodunit angle with the mystery always given precedence. Sometimes this can make a film a little tedious but not in this case. The Agatha Christie side of the story lends itself well to a central police figure and the final scene with all the characters gathered is in particular from the Christie mould. In any case it seems like the best way to present this particular story. In fairness this isn't one of the more visually striking gialli out there  it was director Valerii's only entry in the genre and maybe because he was more used to making westerns this reflects the grittier look and feel. But this aside My Dear Killer is certainly a consummate giallo that does not disappoint at all.".

The most graphic is a young woman being butchered by a buzz saw  the DVD case proudly displays this on it's cover. It is also uncut. This would have been very gory for 1972 but these days it is relatively tame. Probably the most shocking scene involves a nude young girl full frontal.Plot wise it is quite complex and very heavy on dialogue those watching it purely for it's gore will probably being reaching for the FFWD button. However the finale when the killer is revealed is excellent. Perhaps this is a film that would benefit from a repeat viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "This one starts out originally enough. You don't usually see someone getting murdered by being decapitated by the jaws of a hydraulic digger. The dead guy was some sort of insurance investigator yet again but why he wished to dredge up a water filled quarry and why anyone wanted to kill him is a mystery only George Hilton can solve.Yep  George Hilton's back in yet another giallo only this time he has a moustache! Plus he's playing this one ultraserious too. First off he tracks down the driver of the digger only to find he's hanged himself...except he hasn't as George proves using the actual corpse of the driver to demonstrate! George has a quarrysized mystery on his hands here which seems to be tied in with the kidnap and subsequent murder of a little girl some eighteen months prior and it seems that the killer is trying to rub out all of the people involved. And some that aren't really that involved for good measure. George has to retrace what happened back then to find out what's happening right now and you know what means right? Suspects!Suspects! include shifty businessman William Berger his sister who is married to the one handed guy and then there's the staff especially the driver and there's the guy who likes to paint nude children can't see that scene occurring these days! and also has a bunch of statues in his cupboard similar to the one that the killer used. Patty Shepherd appears as a teacher but isn't a suspect so of course the killer cuts her up with a bandsaw in a rather gory scene  while she's watching Django.The film veers wildly from gory scenes like that to drawn out scenes of policemen standing around but although lacking in the usual craziness still manages to be a decent giallo due to George Hilton and William Berger a nice Ennio Morricone soundtrack and taking the unusual step of having all the suspects gathered in a room for the reveal of the killer. What  no rooftop chase?".

	schema:headline " By the book giallo but still plenty of reasons to tune in";
	schema:reviewBody "Bearing in mind that I'm not the world's biggest giallo fan this typical entry in the genre is very much of the seen it all before type. There's a mysterious blackgloved blackcoated sigh killer going around bumping off lots of different people in diversely unpleasant ways a dogged inspector tracks down the murderer but always ends up staying one step behind until the end and lots of people argue fight and make love along the way. The story of this one is as garbled and confused as ever and typical of this genre you're never really given the full picture of what happened and too many characters make things hard to bear. This time around it's something to do with kidnapping and unpleasant hints of child abuse.However the film does have some plus points in its favour. It's set entirely in the Italian countryside which looks very nice indeed and the central crime scene  a stagnant lake surrounded by derelict buildings  is an aesthetically pleasing almost Gothic one. The film is enhanced whenever Ennio Morricone's typically excellent music plays this time taking the form of a sad lament sung by a crying woman  it's really eerie and adds a little atmosphere to the proceedings. The giallo genre is renowned for its sadistic slayings and this film is no exception people are bludgeoned strangled and in the gory highlight displayed prominently in the film's advertising a woman is taken to pieces with a circular saw  a very nasty scene indeed. However my favourite murder is the one which opens the film which is so overthetop that it has become my favourite opening scene of any giallo a JCB picks a guy up BY HIS HEAD and decapitates him! A great cheesy moment that hints at similar moments to come but sadly no more arrive.The script is quite interesting for a change and the film has been well dubbed into English. George Hilton one of the giallo genre's hardest workers is fine as the inspector if a little unsympathetic he's supported by a range of interesting character actors in the likes of William Berger and Manuel Zarzo and attractive Euroactresses like Patty Shepard and Helga Line whom the director somehow contrives to make look unattractive. The film does have some intermittently good 'detective' moments straight out of an Agatha Christie book including the fun 'whodunit' climax. But in all other respects it's very much by the book.".

	schema:reviewBody "After a gruesome murder a police investigator looking into the incident finds a connection with the victim and an unresolved child abduction case in the past and races to solve the connection of the cases before more victims wind up dead by the killer.This here was quite the enjoyable giallo with a lot to like about it. A lot of this is due to the film's incredibly gripping central mystery at play here which manages to come off incredibly well with the way this one makes for a wholly enjoyable storyline. What initially appears as a simple murder at first leads into a supposedlyunsolved abduction case from the past that creeps back into focus here that's quite logically worked into the main story and forces him to bring that one to light as well. That this here is a pretty entertaining and engrossing mystery comes off as a big plus for the film for it manages to make for a wholly more enjoyable time here with two such mysteries at first that need solving and it's worked through in quite a logical manner with a nice assortment of clues that get worked over here as the scenes of him attempting to unravel everything with the help of the inspectors and later his girlfriend which enables him to find the last remaining piece in the puzzle needed. By the manner of which he manages to reason and uncover clues he comes off as one of the more competent representatives of the law that one will find in the genre and proves to be a capable nemesis for the elusive which is fortunate since the bulk of the film is devoted to this investigation. Alongside this fun factor there's plenty to like with the actual slashing and stalking that's put into play here which has plenty to like about this one. The opening attack with the digger is a standout the different stalking scenes against the two women early on are rather fun with the big scene involving the murder of the teacher in her house after a meeting with the killer and then uses a handheld circular saw in a really messy sequence and the thrilling sequence at the old woman's house is a fine stalking scene as well all giving this some rather enjoyable giallo sequences to match the investigations. There's a few minor flaws here which starts with its peculiarly odd pacing. This one isn't as fast paced as many other films in this style as instead of allowing for some pleasingly intricate mysteries to mature and unfold it's just a little too laid back for it's own good. There isn't enough dramatic contrast in the film for it to truly engage despite the solidly laidout mystery there's very small spurts of action to carry it along. The other small problem with the film is that it simply ends much too abruptly once the identity of the killer has been revealed which seems to get announced just seconds before it ends rather than having a little more time to process everything that happens so quickly. Otherwise this one here manages to be one of the better secondtier efforts in the genre.Rated UnratedR Graphic Violence Language Nudity and a brief sex scene.".

Inspector Luca PerettiGeorge Hilton in fine formand partner Chief MarSalvo Randoneare on the case and soon discover that his death that of Vincenzo ParadisiFrancesco Di Federico is tied to the kidnapping of a little girl..the Moroni case and the horrifying double murder that resulted shortly afterward. Peretti must exhaust every lead even the most minute detail trying to uncover Vincenzo's past..his investigation of the Moroni familyif he wishes to discover the killer.Director Tonino Valerii crafts a very difficult complex story that wields some very unsettling unnerving truths about the Moroni family and the sadistic lengths a killer will go to remove key evidence linking himher to the murder of Paradisi. Particularly disturbing is the discovery of a sculptorartist who spent abnormal amounts of time with the deceased girl Stefania and it's subtly implied that he's an obvious pedophile. Clues develop that might shed light on just who was responsible for the murder of Stefania and her father..an artistic rendering of a specific house drawn by Stefania and a mirror of such great importance that someone is willing to kill viciously for it. Other potential victims such as Vincenzo's girlfriendHelga Lin a school teacherPatty Shepard and a belligerent penniless brute MattiaDante Maggio who lives in a shack located near the quarry where Paradisi was murdered..also involved is Mattia's livein girlfriend Adele portrayed by Lola Gaos. Mattia collects various items left in garbage cans or nearby the quarry and he attains a key piece of evidence that makes him a target. The school teacher is involved because Stefania was in her class and the art book in her possession contains a leftover piece of a drawing ripped from it..the larger piece of the drawing was in possession of Vincenzo's female companion who was strangled shortly after removing it from a safe deposit box. The film shows that the killer stays one step ahead of Peretti almost every step of the way..as soon as the Inspector figures out a potential detail..or character detrimental to solving the case almost always the killer gets to it or them first. There were several people involved with this film's complicated exceptionally convoluted storyline and it unfolds with one hell of a revelation..the girl Stefania was bright enough to implicate her killer while her hands and feet were bound by wire using a mirror she rolled down a hill for another to discover. The finale has Peretti confronting all suspects using a mirror to reflect each person's face..it's a nifty indictment of each person who perhaps were responsible in one way or another in the result of Stefania's left to starve next to her dead beloved father's body! Tullio Valli is the onearmed brother of the murdered Moroni Oliviero and his estranged wife Carla is portrayed by Mnica Randall. William Berger is Giorgio Canavese under suspicion for perhaps assisting in the kidnapping operation who runs a shipping business and is involved with trafficking drugs.While not particularly gory the violence is still potent and shocking enough..one's head is cracked over the head with a statuette another is attacked with a Black and Decker saw with the opening decapitation quite stunning way of opening this gialloand there is some nudity..both Shepard and Maril Tolo as Peretti's girl remove their shirts displaying their breaststo keep giallo fans satisfied. It was neat watching Hilton is a rare detective role sporting a mustache but his life away from the investigation..his strained relationship with Maril Tolo  serves as nothing more than filler an attempt at giving his character a backstory regarding how his work interferes with his lovelife. Eerie spinetingling score by composer Ennio Morricone. Fans of Helga Lin will be severely disappointed because her role is of no real depth..basically a victim role whose character is bumped off due to a drawing clinched tight in her dead hand. Alfred Maya is especially creepy as the pedophile whose studio is used as a place where he brings naked girls..one such scene is shown as Peretti is questioning him with a nude girl interrupting their conversation.".

Only Jamie Bell gives it some effort his cynical Irish jumper would have made a much better lead character than Anakin.However while the film is pretty shallow there are some glimmers of goodness. The action sequences are fun fast and frequent the visual effects are cool and there's never a dull moment due to the films super fast pace.It might sound like Im being too harsh on the film but its hard not to be when the movies concept is so great and the end product is as underdeveloped as this.

Jackson always lends credibility and I was interested to see Hayden Christensen for the first time since Star Wars  I haven't seen Awake yet. I persuaded a friend to come with me based on the special effects in the trailer. The plot goes much like this Boy discovers he has the power to teleport himself. Boy learns to control his powers. Boy lives idyllic life of leisure and travel until he discovers that people are chasing him and that he is caught up in a war between people who can teleport and those who hunt them. Unfortunately Jumper isn't much more than a geography tour. The story is well laid out and the main character behaves in a believable way. if you've ever imagined having the power of teleportation you will buy into this premise big time. Sadly the movie fails to build on that premise and action sequences aside is quite boring. My friend fell asleep! There is no chemistry whatsoever between David and Milly and their romantic relationship is unrealistic. Jackson plays the same character he always does Rooker is underutilized although Jamie Bell adds some muchneeded momentum when he arrives. Allin all if you want to leave your brain at home for a night Jumper might be for you but I would recommend waiting for the DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film last night and i must say i was pleasantly surprised I have been reading lots of comments on IMDb to get an idea of what to expect lots of people were negative about the acting performance of Hayden Christensen well i don't agree I think he handled the character in an interesting fashion considering his character left home at the age of 16 or so raised himself and used his abilities to support himself in a wild and fun manner. So he is not your average run of the mill kid nobody knows what he can do and he can basically do and go where he wants creating an aloof type of character so under these circumstance i think his performance was okay maybe not worthy of an academy award but totally interesting to watch I enjoyed his intensity. Overall i thought it was a great film for what it was special effects are great and the story holds together in most aspects. The concept of Jumping is something we have all thought about at one time or another just like time travel. I think that a lot of people who comment on IMDb have no idea of what goes into making a movie but just like to be critical as possible. When i go to the movies i want to be entertained this movie certainly did that!! Check it out and don't forget the popcorn!!!710".

	schema:reviewBody "After falling into a lake covered in ice David Rice teleports himself into a public library. He leaves home and goes to New York to hone his skills which he uses to rob banks. After 8 years David finds that he's not the only one and that there's been a war going on for centuries. Now those people sworn to kill Jumpers are after him.Hayden Christensen was wooden as a board as Anakin in the Star Wars prequels but out of nowhere showed he actually has some acting chops when he played a lying journalist in Shattered Glass. Well now he's back in the scifi genre and for some reason he decides to jump back on that wooden board. I don't know why but it seems that scifi films bring out the bad in him.Jumper is an intriguing idea it has the opportunity to bring a new series to film. The idea of people who can teleport to anywhere at anytime has been done before yes but now we have people who have been sworn to kill them and that they've been doing it for hundreds of years. Sounds pretty epic but Jumper doesn't really jump into any of that they only mention it. Why? I have no clue to me it sounded more interesting then what they were actually showing us. The filmmakers had a great chance to go back in history and show us this war as one character mentions but not once do we get any idea of any of it. There is a lot more story to tell with these Jumpers but we never get any of it we only scratch the surface. Are they that confident that it will do so well that they will give a bit more in a sequel? Or did they really have no idea what they were doing and just hope the audience liked the jump scenes.Those jump scenes by the way are nicely done. No they never reach the coolness of Nightcrawler from XMen 2 but they are very well done. One second your in New York and the next your sitting on top of Big Ben in London. With a film like this you know the special effects will either make or break the film because so much of it relies on that. The believability that these people are actually teleporting themselves to another location. They pulled it off for the most part. My complaints are pretty much what other people will probably have. They teleport in open area for everyone to see but unless there's a fight going on no one seems to notice or care. Also wouldn't Christensen be really fat by now? 8 years of teleporting means he never moves anywhere. He won't even slide 2 feet over on a couch to get a converter. Does teleporting burn calories as well? You know those people sworn to kill them one is Rolan played by Samuel L Jackson. Jackson does what he always does be a bad ass mofo. Here is sports white hair and spews off some dialogue that only God should be at all places at once. Are they the good guys? After all our so called hero is robbing banks and breaking Italian Collisuem rules. Christensen isn't really likable so many people will end up routing for Jackson to take him out. They fight scenes are too special they consist of jumping and using a device that Scorpion from Mortal Kombat should sue for. Once you take away all the jazz from the jumping you're left with nothing really.The story is boring. Guy can jump people find him and try to kill him he gets away. In between he gets back together with a girl he use to like when he was a kid they go to Rome because hey all girls will put their lives on hold to go to Rome with a guy they knew back in Highschool but haven't seen for 8 years...and maybe I'll have sex with him too. Bilson is cute but she is given nothing to do besides ask questions. The real star here is Jamie Bell who plays Griffin another Jumper. He's the person we really want to follow in this story he's funny kicks ass and takes no crap from anyone.By the time the film is over you're left sitting in your seat asking yourself but what about this and what about that. There are so many loose ends in Jumper it's funny. We never know what happens to his father we never know what happens to Griffin we are never given anything but a sentence for a back story on these people. Also the last 5 minutes seems like a last minute addition to try to tie one of those loose ends up. It seems way too forced but you know it has to happen because there is no way this film can end without them going back to it. These loose ends will most likely be sorted out in the sequel. That's how films like this are probably going to end now leave so many things unanswered that there just has to be another one.Unless you want to see another special effects ridden scifi fest skip Jumper cause there is no real substance. No real story or plot no character development and no fun...well there was a bit of fun but there should have been so much more.".

But he didn't. He got superpower he use it to enjoy life. It's that simple.But isn't it what we would all do if we got his power?

	schema:reviewBody "To sum it up quickly Too much setup. This entire film should have been the first halfhour of a bigger story. They try to make this just a first chapter like an origin story in a superhero film but if you're gonna spend the whole film setting up a story and leave an ending wide open for sequels you better be damn sure the public will actually care enough to see more. I don't think that will be the case here. Perhaps if it had been filmed and marketed as a teen flick as the book was the series could have a longer life but as an adult franchise I'd be surprised if there are further installments.It wasn't a bad flick. It was a fun distraction for an hour or two with some good action and visuals but it was certainly nothing special. I think much of that is due to the cast. Diane Lane is always good but she was barely in it and Samuel L. Jackson was just distracting  partly because of the pointless white hair and partly because pairing him with Hayden Christiansen constantly reminded you of Star Wars and took you out of the movie. The main stars Christensen himself and Rachel Bilson were just so...blah. I actually would have preferred if Jamie Bell had been the star instead of just a supporting role.".

	onyx:emotionText "To sum it up quickly Too much setup. This entire film should have been the first halfhour of a bigger story. They try to make this just a first chapter like an origin story in a superhero film but if you're gonna spend the whole film setting up a story and leave an ending wide open for sequels you better be damn sure the public will actually care enough to see more. I don't think that will be the case here. Perhaps if it had been filmed and marketed as a teen flick as the book was the series could have a longer life but as an adult franchise I'd be surprised if there are further installments.It wasn't a bad flick. It was a fun distraction for an hour or two with some good action and visuals but it was certainly nothing special. I think much of that is due to the cast. Diane Lane is always good but she was barely in it and Samuel L. Jackson was just distracting  partly because of the pointless white hair and partly because pairing him with Hayden Christiansen constantly reminded you of Star Wars and took you out of the movie. The main stars Christensen himself and Rachel Bilson were just so...blah. I actually would have preferred if Jamie Bell had been the star instead of just a supporting role.";

I am still reeling 6 days after being stuck in the cinema for 80 minutes I left once the credits rolled. It is astonishingly bad. Thank goodness it was a free preview pass.The premise was promising enough. A boy Hayden Christensen who should just give up acting discovers in a neardeath situation that he can teleport to anywhere he wants. So he grows up to become a rich globe trotter where is the IRS when you need them courtesy of bank vaults he can enter undetected jumping from one end of the Earth to another living the high life. Maybe because he was bored I knew I was bored out of my mind by then he goes back to his hometown to look for his teenage crush Rachel Bilson who is painful to watch. Interestingly no one bats an eyelid to see him come back from the dead the girl doesn't question where he has been and agrees to fly across the globe with him to Rome. There he bumps into a fellow jumper Jamie Bell the sole glimmer in this abysmal mess who warns him that there are Paladins lead by Samuel L. Jackson sleepwalking through the role who are out to get them. Right. Who ARE the Paladins? Why the vehemence? No one knows. And by now I am sure no one cares. Lots of destruction ensues as our hero tries to save the girl and beat the bad guys. Oh and there is the mom Diane Lane in a thankless bit part a Paladin who is conflicted about having a son who can jump and abandoned him to save him. Whatever.But the thing that clued me in as to how bad a movie I was about to sit through was the voiceover at the beginning. Note to the writers Narration should ADD to what is on the screen not TELL US EVERYTHING THAT IS HAPPENING. It reminded me of annoying people in the cinema who comment on every action played out on the screen. You just want to find the remote and hit Mute.The hohum ending points to future sequels and prequels. It is the only logical reason I can think of to explain why a good director and THREE excellent writers left out so much to make this crap.Can I vote 0? No? OK then. 1. For the trailer. Nice job Doug.".

Well let's just say that about 13 the way through I found myself wholeheartedly rooting for the paper thin religious Zealot character played by Samuel Jackson oh and by the way I'm an Atheistthat's how bad this movie is! Really when a movie has you empathize with the stereotypical and underdeveloped 'bad guys' then you know it's complete and utter trash. The problem lies not in the movies overall concept which I will admit is somewhat interesting but in its bland characters out of the 3 'heroes' not one of them is likable in the least and in fact the conceited main character David is almost unwatchable. Christensen's character David is just so narcissistic and selfabsorbed I was dumbfounded by it all. From his first lines This morning I saw the sun rise over the pyramids had breakfast in Paris and then caught some waves in Australia all before lunch. But I wasn't always like this... to his very last he remains nothing but an arrogant selfish prick. Also he is a brat who lacks even an ounce of human compassion. I mean there is just so much wrong with his character and yet the movie barely seems to notice. Throughout the movie he never grows as a character he never learns anything. Instead he does everything for himself. Not only does David posses NO redeeming qualities even worsehe robs banks and doesn't save innocent people from dieing first in the Tsunami and then in Chechnyahe literally just lets some poor guy get run over by a tank that's our hero for ya!. You really could not make his character more unlikable if you tried well maybe if you had him murder puppies but still he is pretty close to the absolute worst.While the movie tries to get you to hate him I couldn't bring myself to blame Jackson's character for wanting to kill Christensen and in fact by the end of the film I am using the term film here very loosely I am sure most will find themselves rooting for Jackson against Christensen and his brain dead girlfriend! Throughout the movie I saw Jackson's character as the only pathway to redemptionnamely my redemption if he killed Christensen I would finally be allowed to leave the theater Christensen would be dead and I would be free everybody wins! The worst part of all of this is that the movie isn't even so bad its goodits just bad. Few movies have made me sick to my stomach but this one did for 2 hours all it stands for is egotism and awful kindergarten acting. That said can I say anything positive about this movie? Hmmm well the special effects were a bit above average though they did little to make up for the fact that I had to spend time with the vapid Christensen. Please please don't be fooled by the preview. While it looks a little like Xmen it has much more in common with The Ugly American As a side note the director either hates Americans or more likely is a selfabsorbed SOB. There is just so much MORE wrong with this movie Rachel Bilson did they lobotomize you before shooting? Just don't see it. Take my word for it your time and money are better spent elsewhereto say the least. I knew little about this movie before going into the theater to see itnever again.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film is so awful  I don't know where to start... First of all Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson are such terrible actors looking good in nice clothes doesn't make you an actor but Hollywood begs to differ I guess! It is just painful to watch these two moving around Christensen with an emotionless Iamsocool face and Bilson acting like a 5year old girlie at a Nativity play!! What makes them look even worse is the presence of talented actors like Samuel L. Jackson and the less famous Jamie Bell. Diane Lane is totally underused here and seems to be kind of embarrassed by her minirole... But even if they had cast better actors for the lead roles it wouldn't have saved the film simply because the script is astonishingly bad. It is not following any internal logic and plausibility guy suddenly discovers his supernatural powers when he is 15 although his mother knew about them since he was 5 ?!? then decides to rob banks which don't seem to have any surveillance cameras and just leaves his father behind not caring about him anymore. What he cares about is living a shallow and materialistic life in his penthouse jumping around postcard locations screwing horny chicks in Britain after watching people drown on the TV news etc. The script does not even try to imply that this is wrong  Christensen's character is portrayed as the main protagonist i.e. the good guy and all these actions and behaviour as being just a normal part of his life! The twisted message to all the adolescent viewers is that it's quite cool to steal money from banks as long as you don't get caught and then live it up  it is as simple as that! Our hero shows of course no remorse for his actions whatsoever even the slightest concept of guilt responsibility and conscience would have been beyond the scope of this tripe. The final redeeming quality of his character is supposed to be the fact that he did not kill the villain but left him stuck in the middle of nowhere instead?!? Wow how noble and imaginative...

	onyx:emotionText "The film is so awful  I don't know where to start... First of all Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson are such terrible actors looking good in nice clothes doesn't make you an actor but Hollywood begs to differ I guess! It is just painful to watch these two moving around Christensen with an emotionless Iamsocool face and Bilson acting like a 5year old girlie at a Nativity play!! What makes them look even worse is the presence of talented actors like Samuel L. Jackson and the less famous Jamie Bell. Diane Lane is totally underused here and seems to be kind of embarrassed by her minirole... But even if they had cast better actors for the lead roles it wouldn't have saved the film simply because the script is astonishingly bad. It is not following any internal logic and plausibility guy suddenly discovers his supernatural powers when he is 15 although his mother knew about them since he was 5 ?!? then decides to rob banks which don't seem to have any surveillance cameras and just leaves his father behind not caring about him anymore. What he cares about is living a shallow and materialistic life in his penthouse jumping around postcard locations screwing horny chicks in Britain after watching people drown on the TV news etc. The script does not even try to imply that this is wrong  Christensen's character is portrayed as the main protagonist i.e. the good guy and all these actions and behaviour as being just a normal part of his life! The twisted message to all the adolescent viewers is that it's quite cool to steal money from banks as long as you don't get caught and then live it up  it is as simple as that! Our hero shows of course no remorse for his actions whatsoever even the slightest concept of guilt responsibility and conscience would have been beyond the scope of this tripe. The final redeeming quality of his character is supposed to be the fact that he did not kill the villain but left him stuck in the middle of nowhere instead?!? Wow how noble and imaginative... So if you are looking for stupefying entertainment  this film is for you. Be warned  you might lose some brain cells by watching it.";

	schema:reviewBody "To begin with the confessions I should state that thus far I have not felt motivated to complete my watching of Jumper which leaves this review a little unfair. Furthermore  and pretty much in the same vein  I am not a typical member of this film's target audience! To such an outsider Doug Liman's 2008 piece is intriguing as an example of the genre. It starts off hugely attractively  it's slick fast worthwhile nicely filmed with clear motivation. A story smoothly and elegantly told and all is well.We take a first knock when it becomes clear that the older David Rice is living his playboy lifestyle by stealing but  what the heck  many a crimethrillercomedy has played with this level of immorality before whether it be the The Lavender Hill Mob the Italian Job or Now Your See Me.At around the same point in the film we get a little teaser which tells us quite a lot within the film plot but also maybe about the piece itself. Our hero sees a TV news report to the effect that nobody would be able to reach people threatened with death by flooding in time. It then becomes clear he is looking for an umbrella and a mac but ... he goes nowhere near the flood and instead heads for London for a clubbing and onenight stand experience. Hayden Christensen's handsome young smoothie is not fundamentally evil even if he robs banks and ignores the plight of people he could save and he did have a difficult childhood which he at times uses as a mask... and at this stage the immorality is still only at the level of poortaste joke cashing in on the British capital's infamous weather. And perhaps this naughty joke is even a worthwhile one since it makes it definitively clear that our jumper is NOT any kind of selfless superhero. If the makers are satirising the character or wanting us to hate him well OK but that is by no means clear from the context of the film which does seem to be lionising David even at second glance. Hence it's still in dubious taste somehow. Presumably those flood victims are indeed victims by the time he's hopping into bed with his conquest of the evening but it's not weighing heavily  or at all  on David Rice's conscience and do the makers REALLY condemn this attitude?After that we are very rapidly jumped to a tropical forest scene in which pretty much without warning and seemingly out of context a whitehaired Samuel L. Jackson as Roland  let's say a representative of the fully adult world as opposed to David's stilljuvenile pleasure world  is murderously plunging a knife into the belly of a trussedup young man making gloating and nasty remarks.At this point we have left comedy and charm and genuinely young as opposed to youngadult viewers behind in a way that prevents them from ever really returning no matter how hard the film tries. For try it apparently does seeking to bat on with more romcom stuff no matter how disturbingly hopeless that cause may now seem  at least to an adult audiencemember.Thus a similar circumstance ensues as the longedfor romantic encounter between David and his attractively grownup childhood sweetheart Millie played by Rachel Bilson finally takes place ultimately in that loveliest and most cultured of cities Rome. Unfortunately the wouldbe love scenes at the Colosseum are ruined  again irrevocably  by a fight breaking out between our jumper and what later emerge are the longtime enemies of his kind. This fight involves both death and destruction  to an extent that again renders any attempt to rescue comedy or romance from the ruins impossible  at least from the point of view of a watcher of my age.This is intriguing as the above description would apply equally well to any James Bond film and yet... Bond manages to fuse the different emotions while Jumper just seems cruel sneering cynical and amoral. The deaths and violence here are just too throwaway and somehow a line of decency and taste is irrevocably crossed.As someone who works with young adults on a daily basis I do note an increasing difficulty with such people not knowing where to draw the line. The only remaining question would be do films like Jumper encourage such moral ambiguity or do they just reflect what is already happening out there in the people they aim at?".

I wanted to like the character David Rice but found myself not caring for him at all. His selfish actions were horrible robbing banks not using his ability to save drowning victims. He is no hero and I'm not sure if the point was to make him unlikable. I enjoyed the scenes with Griffin and agree with many here who say he stole the screen every time he appeared. My favorite was the fight with Roland and that highly mentioned car racing scene in Hong Kong. This is the first time seeing Sam L. Jackson in a flat out villainous role. He does it well. I won't be watching it again for the faulty plot but so far it's the most interesting movie in the theater.".

Wait a second... my plausibilitysense is tingling. Without any question of his history she agrees to travel the world with someone everyone thought was dead.Just at the right moment Samuel L Jackson appears wearing a white wig and bearing the spinetingling name Roland. Right. To be fair Jackson is the only actor in the movie who shines  Hayden Christensen plays his character more wooden than... a plank of wood and Rachel Bilson playing Millie is distinctly unabashed when she not only finds her dead friend on her doorstep but when she finds out he can teleport across the globe.So more fights the Sphynx brief historical backplot about 'Jumpers' and 'Paladins' supplied by a very energetic Jamie Bell who carries the movie into more of a frenzy which is a good thing because there is never any real sense of danger at all. Jamie Bell speaking very fast in a Northern accent definitely adds to the excitement but again we only get more questions and less answers.Jumper finishes very openended and many will feel cheated by the time the credits come up. It all seems like you've been spending 86 minutes gearing up for a final showdown... then the names roll.However on an entertainment level it doesn't disappoint. The teleportation idea works very well for some fight scenes  look out for the Colosseum one in particular  but they don't last long and they are few and far between.But hey it's only a movie.".

I will say this some of the action scenes at the end are the best of the movie and worth hanging around for especially since the film is less than an hourandahalf. However as most other reviewers seem to agree when you have a lead character who is not likable it really detracts from the story. Hayden Christensen plays that lead David Rice a young guy given the powers of teleporting where he can instantly change where he is  from Ann Arbor to Cairo if he so desires. After some practice he can learn to bring other people and objects with him. The only times I've seen Christensen are when he's played Anakin Sykwalker in two installments of the megahit Star Wars films. Jake Lloyd played the very young Skywalker in Anakin's first appearance.However he's no Skywalker in this film goodguywise. He isn't exactly Peter Parker either. As Spiderman Parker's creed is With great power comes great responsibility. With Rice it's more like get everything you can and screw 'em! I make the Spiderman analogy because Rice has super powers with the teleportation thing.This is not a superhero movie though because the lead character is not a hero in any sense of the word. To emphasize that point there's a scene early on in which Rice is watching a TV program about flood victims and he just nonchalantly walks away from the set totally disinterested. That's one of the points the kid has these powers to do some good and could care less. The problem with that beside the obvious moral shortcomings is that it doesn't give the viewer  you and me  anyone to really root for in the picture. He meets another teleporter and that guy is the same a slimeball only interested in saving his own skin. That guy is Griffin an Irishman who as a kid played the lead in Billy Elliott. The villain in the movie is Roland played by Samuel L. Jackson's who sports a ridiculouslooking ultrawhite do. He plays a religious zealot there is no other kind in the film world out to kill all the teleporters. He's a paladin as is someone else in the film which is a surprise.Since none of the characters were anyone you could root for I tried to just sat back and enjoy the specialeffects and the scenery which were the positive points of the movie. We get quick tours of the world from the Grand Canyon to Rome and the specialeffects of the teleporters jumping from one location to another was cool.There was a love interest but little chemistry between David and Millie Rachel Belson a pretty but another annoying character.So there you have it the good and the bad.

	schema:headline " Returning to Bergmanesque Roots";
	schema:reviewBody "It's worth noting that in 1978 ten years before he made Another Woman Woody Allen created another quiet film a drama with prominent Bergmanesque influences. The film was called Interiors and it was a tribute or an American take on Bergman's Cries and Whispers. Interiors examined the relationships of three sisters and their husbands in the face of the divorce of their dominant mother and detached father. The film essentially detailed the fall of interiors or illusory worlds created by the dominant mother in the face of tragedy and loneliness.Another Woman made ten years later shares similar themes with Interiors but it is more akin to Bergman's Wild Strawberries than to Cries and Whispers. It is a story of a university professor played spectacularly by Gena Rowlands in whom something stirs when she overhears a therapy session with a young 30something woman who is discontent with her life. The professor Marion feels an emptiness rise inside her  an emptiness that had settled there years before that she can consciously feel now. Little by little like in Interiors the world she has constructed for herself a cold cerebral world deconstructs.Marion despairs enters into conflicts with herself and questions endlessly trying to reason her way out of her malaise. But the cure for her malaise is not rational resolution and she realizing that her strongest characteristic namely her rational intelligence is not enough to untangle what worries her finds herself entirely helpless in the face of an unraveling existence.Her drama is very much like the drama of Professor Isak Borg from Bergman's film a man on his way to receive a medal for his lifetime achievements. And on the road he also succumbs to the same malaise as Marion the same questioning and the same painful reevaluation. The horror shared by both Marion and Professor Borg of course is that despite their highly lauded accomplishments and their intellectual selfsatisfaction they feel void. There must in other words be something else to life than strictly intellectual work however satisfying it may be.In Bergman both Cries and Whispers and Wild Strawberries and in Allen both Interiors and Another Woman life falls under question. The entire existence is evaluated its worth and meaning doubted. In Interiors and Cries and Whispers however the meaninglessness pervades everything in the films  the dialogues behaviors and even visuals. The sisters in Interiors shatter the mother's reality and find nothingness  they continue as they were much like the two sisters in Cries and Whispers for whom the death of their young sister changed absolutely nothing and only confirmed their beliefs about the world.However Another Woman is not as stark though it is stark indeed at times. Marion grabs at the chance to reevaluate the life she feels she painfully wasted and tries to start again. It's not a false choice or a gimmick on Allen's part but it's a true depiction of Marion's sincere desire to continue to struggle because her life does have value for her. She rediscovers a passion for the struggle and her motivation is the same curiosity that made her go through the questioning process in the first place.Another Woman is a testament to the fact that Woody Allen was still at the top of his game in the late 1980s. It is a brilliant honest and surprisingly warm film. It is not a remake or ripoff of Bergman's work though it is highly influenced by him which shouldn't seem so surprising to anyone because Bergman himself was influenced by the most basic questions of existence. Another Woman is an existential film that is both uncompromising and not hopeless. It's one of my favorite Woody Allen films and it reveals to us not only a great American director but one whose films are of worldly greatness.".

	schema:headline " A FILM OF GREAT POWER AND FEELING";
	schema:reviewBody "Woody Allen's Another Woman is upon rediscovery a film of great power and feeling. Sadly not many people will be open to rediscovery after the initial viewing.Gena Rowlands stars as Marion Post a 50ish philosophy professor whose life is in order. She rents an apartment to work on her latest book. By accident she discovers that through the heating duct she can hear all conversations from the psychiatrist located in said building. At first she covers the duct with cushions to block the sound but she decides to listen in after hearing by accident the testimony of a young pregnant woman. This sets in motion a chain of events that changes Marion forever.Woody has said that he originally conceived the idea as a comedy and indeed it could be played that way on a smaller scale in Everyone Says I Love You. But here Allen resists the temptation to play it for laughs. In fact there is not one single moment of comedy relief in his film. I think that is a wise decision. I was so absorbed by Marion's journey that comedy would have broken the mood of the film. This film is another venture into Bergmanesque cinema and Another Woman can compare with the very best Bergman.Gena Rowlands hasn't had a role this good since the films of her late husband John Cassavetes. This in fact shows another side of Rowlands a more restrained mannered character than the fiery passionate characters in the Cassavetes films. It just shows the different types of roles Rowlands can play so well. She deserved an Oscar nomination for this.In fact the whole film is well cast by Allen. Gene Hackman is great in a mellow part as Marion's exlover. Blythe Danner makes a return to form as Marion's best friend. It is great to see Danner do what she does best especially following the horrible Brighton Beach Memoirs in which she was underused. Ian Holm is superb as Marion's husband who as Roger Ebert puts it must have a wife so he can cheat on her. In his final film John Houseman allows himself to appear weak and frail quite a change from the pillar of strength in The Paper Chase and a good cap to a great career.I mentioned at the beginning that not many people will be open to rediscovering Another Woman. I think that is correct. Here are my reasons why. First the film is deliberately paced even with a short running time of 81 minutes. Most viewers' attention spans won't be able to tolerate the long takes Allen is famous for. Second the film doesn't offer any instant gratification or closure. Allen's story is one of those stories that just can't have a typical happy Hollywood ending. Third there is TA even though adultery plays a large part in the story. So if you're looking for a fast paced film with TA and guns and action and a happy ending you might as well move on.Another Woman is one of those films in which rediscovery is necessary. Allen packs so much into 81 minutes that multiple viewings are necessary to absorb it all. If you make the effort to see it again you might find that Another Woman is a film of great power and feeling that works better every time you see it. out of 4 stars".

	schema:headline " This film blew me away";
	schema:reviewBody "I just watched this last night and I've been thinking about it all day. What an amazing film!  So poignant so subtle.  A woman reevaluates her life and begins to lament the choices she made years ago.  Such a simple premise such immense possibilities.  This film demands a lot of its audience.  There is no humor no action and very little plot.  Most people won't be into this at all I imagine which is a shame.  This film offers a really wonderful perspective on a subject that is so very rarely addressed in films today aging.  This film is about a woman taking stock of her life at the age of fifty.  She looks back she sees the choices she made and how they turned out.  She sees the compromises she made to get where she is today very successful head of a philosophy department about to write another book and she begins to appreciate for the first time what those compromises cost.  This is in my opinion the central tragedy of human existence.  You only get one shot at life and no one ever tells you how to manage it.  So you make mistakes and one day when you're fifty you've finally learned enough to start making the right choices.  But by that time is it too late?  This film doesn't answer that question at least not for its central character. But it does offer hope.  The film is propelled by several dynamite performances.  But even in such a crowded field of great performances it is not difficult to pick out Gena Rowlands who gives an unforgettably nuanced performance as Marion the film's central character.  You may notice that this film is propelled by a number of coincidences. Every chance encounter however has an eerie relevance to Marion's soulsearching.  It may look contrived but it isn't.  These aren't coincidences at all.  The pregnant woman played by Mia Farrow is instrumental in setting up each of these 'coincidences' and that character's name is Hope.  I was halfexpecting a Fight Club revelation at the end but it never came which is good.  This film could stand both ways and it's better for the director to leave the audience to consider the relationship between Hope and Marion on their own.  Like I said I've been thinking about it all day.".

This time it's the character herself who tells the story which is really unusual for Allen. By leaving every other trade mark in plot and topics away Allen concentrates on the intellectual dialogues and the analyses people make about each other. It's characteristic that Marion Post is a professor for philosophy. She automatically analyzes everybody around her which leads to the fact that they start analyzing her. Her crisis begins when she learns that people talk about her  which of course is something completely natural  and therefore starts analyzing herself.

The film is very serious stuff involving repressed emotions and alienation.  There is simply no place for Woody's usually nervous character in Another Woman.  You can still tell that this is one of his films because of the characterizations.  Gena Rowlands is in nearly every scene and is classy as usual and the rest of the ensemble cast is just as good.

One other problem Another Woman has is a couple of very clunky scenes and a few poor bit performers which were much bigger problems in September which was actually the last Allen film that I saw and the one that made me subconsciously avoid him for the past several months. Allen's script here is excellent. He has produced an excellent character study which is probably unsurpassed in all of his other films that I've seen. The lead actors are wonderful here Rowlands Ian Holms Blythe Danner Sandy Dennis and Gene Hackman. Allen's use of piano music is beautifully touching. It all adds up to a very touching and sad little film. It might not be Woody's best film but it ought to be better respected and known. 810.".

It is not a minute too long and the dialogue is great but if one was to flaw it Allen's choice of music seems a little offbalance the narration is a touch cold and whilst not bad the performances are generally rather ordinary.

She is an expert in Art music and an amateur painter. She is in a comfortable and successful marriage to a physician Ian Holmes and has a close and friendly relationship with her husband's teenage daughter from an earlier marriage Martha Plimpton. Marion is writing a book and decides to rents an office in a downtown building. When in the office she inadvertently overhears a woman Mia Farrow in a session with her psychoanalyst and begins to look back at her own life identity relationships and purpose. I watched Another Woman for the first time last night and I am totally engrossed by it. I love everything about it. Actually it is the first Allen's strict drama that I love so much. It will go very high on my Woody's favorites list. The film is so Woodyesque even if it doesn't have any laughs  it is still his style his Manhattan his favorite music his long takes his intellect his sincere intelligent and emotional contemplations of life's disappointment regrets and losses. I think it is one of Allen's most profound and warmest films. Yes warmest because Marion looks at the first 50 years of her life in a true and painful light but she also would learn that there is hope that anything can be changed and life could be started over even at 50. She will reevaluate her life and her relationships with her husband father brother stepdaughter and friends. She may not find the answers for all the questions but she certainly learns a lot about herself. I've seen John Cassavetes' A Woman Under the Influence 1974 and I know how great the actress Gena Rowlands is but I was amazed by her performance in Another Woman. Allen gave her wonderful material to work with and she was superb  strong reserved brilliant woman incredibly attractive at her 50. It is a dream role for an intelligent middleaged actress but sadly Hollywood does not provide them very often. A lot has been said about Bergman's Wild Strawberries I'd add Cries and Whispers and Face to Face influence to Another Woman but it is not a remake. We all at some point of our lives lose the way we traveled by and enter a dark forest. The artists by the power of their talents capture the moments of search for meaning and put them on the canvas on the paper or on screen. Even if they meditate on the same theme each artist uses his unique tools and brings his unique vision and talent.In Another Woman Allen created an excellent character study which is on par with his best and more famous films. Wonderful Rowlands is surrounded by the first class supporting players including Ian Holms Blythe Danner Sandy Dennis and Gene Hackman. Allen's use of music is touching and delicate as in all his movies. Another Woman is one of the best unfairly forgotten films and it deserves to be rediscovered respected and admired. It is certainly the best of Allen's pure drama films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Devastating unlike anything I've seen from Woody Allen so far. This was a very quiet deliberately paced exploration into a woman facing a midlife crisis played with extraordinary skill by Gena Rowlands. It leaned maybe a little too much on narration when it could have utilized her talent as an actress instead but that's a small complaint when the final result is so powerful.Rowlands' Marion Post rents an apartment in order to work on her novel and through hearing the patients of the psychiatrist's office next door slowly begins to examine her life and the choices that she has made. We see her interact with those surrounding her be it her husband her daughter her brother but she always feels a level removed from all of them. Over the years she has isolated herself from everyone around her and examines them rather than interacts and Rowlands plays this with a knowledge so fitting and serene.There's an extended dream sequence a little over halfway through the picture that is one of the most surreal emotional and illuminating experiences I've had in a Woody Allen picture and one of my favorite moments in the twenty or so films of his I've seen. It imagines her life as a stage play that she watches take place and it opens the world back up to Marion which is displayed in master strokes on the alltelling face of Rowlands. She gives a performance for the ages here working mostly from the inside out although there are a few devastating scenes of her letting herself fall apart.I was surprised at how little Mia Farrow was in it given that she's on the cover for it and the plot synopsis makes her part seem a lot more major but she manages to leave an impression although the most surprising of the supporting cast was Gene Hackman. I'm used to seeing him and loving him in varying crime pictures so it was nice to see him take on a more grounded and every day character which despite only appearing for a brief time he manages to leave a lasting impression with his emotionally conflicted portrayal. You can really feel this character that he displays feel his love and heartache in every breath.Still the film absolutely belongs to Rowlands who resonated so deeply inside of me and will surely stick there for a while. She knocks it out of the park in a film that is so unique cerebral and magnificent from Woody Allen.".

It simply is an objective and unbiased look into a woman's life.The music in this movie is very beautiful. Woody Allen is a master of introducing music to influence mood and he is very subtle about it. Unlike the often abrupt and rather abrasive incorporation of music by directors aiming to forcefully manipulate one's point of view and emotional response Allen knows that this will happen through subtle presentation. Again what is so brilliant in this movie is its subtlety. To me that is what makes everything so real. You are presented with someone's life through a window you hear their thoughts and observe their actions. You find that the events of their life follow a progression without implications without obvious foreshadowing. You are left with your own insightfulness and the struggle of the character to find her way out of the darkness she is in.The acting is stunning. Gene Hackman and Ian Holm give incredible supporting performances and Gena Rowlands is remarkable. She does not come across forced or attempting to be something she is not. It is as if she were playing herself she is very believable.I think this movie is a masterpiece. I recommend paying very close attention to the ending it is haunting.".

Allen excels in sequences of chatty couples interacting with the dynamics of two sparking something unintended he also loves delving into the romantic complications between teacher and student usually with infidelity a key ingredient and all of those aspects work their way into this story which has a moral grounded center despite the cheating adults even a younger teen gets a guilty moment having sex in a forbidden place but of course she feels cheap afterward!. Allen loves a contradiction as well as any writer but his main character played stunningly by Gena Rowlands who also narrates is living in the subconscious and is forced into continually being enlightened. This is handled quite well with dreamy interludes and flashbacks to childhood but this narrative actually should be more compelling instead it's gossamer drama with Bergman or Chekov overtures. A lastact fling between Rowlands' husband and a friend is disappointing with Woody falling back on the clich couldn't Rowlands leave her sexless marriage on the basis of boredom alone?. As a director Woody is very careful and strict with his actors and Gene Hackman as a novelist surprises the most his harsh attempt at seducing Rowlands is straightforward and yet almost neuroticand you can see the anguish and passion on his face Martha Plimpton continues to be far too eager but Rowlands Ian Holm Betty Buckley Frances Conroy and Sandy Dennis have some incredible moments. As the other woman whose life parallels Gena's Mia Farrow has very little onscreen time but her plaintive voice and sensitive face are just right for this brief role. A fine drama about choices and regrets I'm not sure just how deeply a man like Woody Allen can empathize with a lady in her 50s trying to stay afloat in a loveless life but there are several scenes here that really dig below the placid surface.  from ".

	schema:headline " But seriously folks...";
	schema:reviewBody "If there is a moral to Woody Allen's ANOTHER WOMAN it is that we should live our lives with passion spontaneity and optimism. Ironically these are the very elements that are noticeable missing from the film. ANOTHER WOMAN seems to be selling products it doesn't have in stock let alone on display.ANOTHER WOMAN is an immaculate movie sensitively acted concisely written and lovingly filmed. But like so many of Allen's serious films it is cold and strangely impersonal. It is Woody standing back and looking at someone else's life composing a precise picture but with a handsoff leavenofingerprints approach. It is one of those films that is so easy to admire but very difficult to embrace. It desperately wants to touch you but refuses to come within touching distance. The film's central character is described thus She's just a little judgmental. You know she sorta stands above people and evaluates them. That is how Allen approaches his characters here like they're specimens. There is of course two Woody Allens the comedy genius and the always aspiring dramatist. Most of his comedies are pretty good but the best are those that let the serious Woody sneak into the film and give the material backbone as in ANNIE HALL MANHATTAN STARDUST MEMORIES and DECONSTRUCTING HARRY. He allows the serious Woody to make cameo appearances in his comedies but when he sets his sites on meaningful drama the funny Woody is barred from the set. It is as though Allen is afraid that so much as a smile will break the mood and make people forget just how serious his intentions are. He so easily mocks intellectual thought in his comedies that he seems to have no faith in his ability to be serious and mean it. As such his serious comedies are alive and filled with insight while his serious dramas are filled with pretense. How seriously can one take a line like I shouldn't have seduced you. Intellectually that is.? I mean who the heck talks like that? In his comedies such dialogue shows how pretentious the characters are in his dramas it seems meant to show just how sincere the characters are. And words are an important element of ANOTHER WOMAN. Allen's dialogue and narration is eloquent and sophisticated but stiff and formal. Even when discussing their deepest feelings or expressing anger or reliving joyous moments in their lives all the characters speak as though they are discussing the terms of their life insurance policies. There is a solemn emptiness to the tone of the film even at the end when Marion tries to make amends for past failings she seems to be negotiating a contract not saying Let's start again. Such pompous droning seems designed to reflect the tone of the characters' lives but the end result is monotonous and deadening rather than being poetic and compelling. The film does have a clever conceit the always marvelous Gena Rowlands plays Marion Post a professor of philosophy who sublets an apartment to serve as an office where she can write her latest book. A quirk in the ventilation system allows her to inadvertently eavesdrop on the conversations going on next door. The next apartment is the office of a psychiatrist who counts among his patients a young pregnant woman played by Mia Farrow. The young woman discusses at length her sorrowful life and suicidal impulses. Because she identifies with the younger woman's feelings of loneliness and alienation Marion becomes obsessed with eavesdropping on the sessions and uses the situation as a springboard for reevaluating her own life. It is significant that just as Allen tells the story from a sterile distance Marion reviews her life only indirectly though voiceovers flashbacks dreams and even symbolic stage productions. Even her psychoanalysis is conducted through a surrogate Farrow's character who is rather obviously named Hope. Much of the interaction with other characters occurs in Marion's mind. And rather predictably Marion's journey of self discovery is well rather predictable. She discovers  as protagonists in this sort of film always discover  that her successful career and her wellordered life are a facade hiding her empty relationships and assorted personal failures. Her life of satisfied accomplishment is meaningless and the trust love and respect she believes she shares with others are delusions. It's like IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE in reverse Just as the angel Clarence acts as George Bailey's conscience to show him how valuable his life has been Hope acts as Marion's conscience to reveal how empty her life as become. ANOTHER WOMAN has a counterpart in Allen's 2003 film ANYTHING ELSE another film with an obvious doppelganger. The former is about a woman who encounters her younger alter ego and reevaluates her past choices while the latter is about a young man whose encounters with his older alter ego played by Woody Allen effects the choices that will shape his future. The same basic story is approached from opposite directions.It's dangerous to speculate but it seems that Allen made ANOTHER WOMAN during a time in his life when he was hugely admired for his accomplishments and he was deeply involved in a relationship with Mia Farrow and her extended family. Certainly Farrow's playing a pregnant woman and Marion's second thoughts over placing career over personal relationships seem to suggest a parallel. By contrast ANYTHING ELSE made a decade and a half later finds Allen's character playing a mentor at a time when he is apparently happily married to a much younger woman and where his status as a filmmaker is more iconic than in vogue. As such his surrogate changes from being the central figure to the sadder but wiser voice of experience.Both films are steeped in regret but make an effort to end in an upbeat fashion. But while ANOTHER WOMAN is an accomplished polished work striving for a cool perfection it is not persuasive in its attempt to inspire us with optimism. ANYTHING ELSE is rambling and unfocused and well sloppy but its optimism is honest and funny. ANOTHER WOMAN is about getting another chance but there is no reason to believe that anything will really change in Marion's tight introspective little life.".

Gena Rowlands gives a spectacular performance in this introspective insightful and intuitive Woody Allen film. It's beyond me why Gena was never recognized by Oscar for this film or how this film never has gotten as much recognition as other Woody Allen films like Hannah and Her Sisters and Annie Hall and even Interiors. This is a film not just for women but for all who demand intelligence and something challenging and worthwhile in the movies they see.

	schema:headline " An intensely felt drama.";
	schema:reviewBody "Very much in the same vein as 1978's Interiors Woody Allen returns to serious dramatic fashion with Another Woman which like Interiors explores the inner workings and details that make up a family. In particular this one focuses through the parameters of Marion brilliantly played by Gena Rowlands as an icy cold woman who has managed for years to shield her true feelings and emotions from practically everyone close to her.Unfortunately this begins to fall back into her lap as she talks with her stepdaughter husband and old friends and family who tell her that she is nearly impossible to communicate with and not very feeling. This comes as a shock to Marion and us we don't notice it and how did this happen? Woody Allen is certainly one of the great comedic writerdirectoractors of the last 50 years but his serious dramatic turns are just as impressive. With the help of Ingmar Bergman's legendary cinematographer Sven Nykvist Allen creates a mesmerizing canvas of dark surreal colors and palates that give off a moody and depressing tone felt by all the characters especially Marion. This is certainly a film only for true Woody Allen fans as it doesn't have any of his usual zany or selfdepraved humor. Yet what it does have is terrific performances by Rowland Ian Holm Mia Farrow and Gene Hackman as well as a solid script and direction by Allen. A mustsee for any of his fans.".

	onyx:emotionText "Very much in the same vein as 1978's Interiors Woody Allen returns to serious dramatic fashion with Another Woman which like Interiors explores the inner workings and details that make up a family. In particular this one focuses through the parameters of Marion brilliantly played by Gena Rowlands as an icy cold woman who has managed for years to shield her true feelings and emotions from practically everyone close to her.Unfortunately this begins to fall back into her lap as she talks with her stepdaughter husband and old friends and family who tell her that she is nearly impossible to communicate with and not very feeling. This comes as a shock to Marion and us we don't notice it and how did this happen?

She soon reevaluates her own life and realizes that she is not a good person and the people in her orbit hate her. There is snotty husband Ian Holm underachieving brother Harris Yulin bitter best friend Sandy Dennis and truthtelling sisterinlaw Frances Conroy. Rowlands has so much thrown at her it's a surprise she doesn't just kill herself. There's not a single sympathetic character in this whole 81 minute angst ridden treadmill test. It's cold humorless and stodgy. It's a pseudo intellectuals idea of a Bergman film that fails at every level. Pretentious and then some this film has to hold some sort of record for its continuous mention of poet Rainer Maria Rilke. Blech! Gene Hackman Blythe Danner Martha Plimpton Betty Buckley John Houseman Philip Bosco David Ogden Stiers and Mia Farrow contribute absolutely zero with their small roles.".

	schema:reviewBody "As I'm warming up to watch Whatever Works Woody's new film this weekend I've just watched two underrated films from my favourite director September 1987 and Another Woman 1988 for the first time. I've seen most of his films but there's about a dozen I haven't been fortunate enough to see yet. I think even his minor films are good at least but Another Woman is on the same level of his greatest achievements The Purple Rose of Cairo my personal favourite and somewhat underrated itself Annie Hall Manhattan Husbands and Wives and Hannah and Her Sisters among others.Another Woman is only 81 minutes long but its power lingers. This morally complex quietly devastating tale about a woman in her fifties Gena Rowlands extraordinary as always who overhears the conversations between her next door neighbour a psychiatrist and his patient 'Hope' Mia Farrow in a role similar to the one she played in September  continuation of the same character maybe? a younger pregnant woman. As she gets drawn to the plights of Hope she discovers dark truths about herself  her feeling to help Hope discloses her own insecurities and flaws and this new perception of herself changes the way she can relate to other people around her. The supporting cast  Ian Holm Gene Hackman Martha Plimpton Sandy Dennis Philip Bosco Blythe Danner Betty Buckley and a cameo by Frances Conroy 13 years before Six Feet Under as Rowlands' sister  is also top notch. Erik Satie's Gymnopedies for Piano No. 3 is the moving haunting musical theme.Basically Another Woman is to Allen's career what Persona 1966 is to Ingmar Bergman's not by chance the cinematographer is Sven Nykvist Bergman's usual collaborator and 3 Women 1977 to Robert Altman's. Another Woman is not as much about identity theft in a literal sense as it is about human connections revelations and false perceptions but the female psyche is clearly at the core of the story. Those who say Allen is only obsessed with the neurotic Jewish New Yorker male don't really know his work. Although it's true some of his themes can get almost repetitive he's still the man and it's great how a long time fan like me can still be constantly amazed by his work both old and new. When someone is 73 and still makes an average of one film a year you can't expect for much. However Woody always delivers something to be enjoyed or profoundly admired and I hope he makes at least 10 more films before he dies. I know you don't believe in God Woody but I do and I thank him for giving us a genius like you. You once said that if your movies make at least one person more miserable you feel you accomplished your job. I don't believe you actually mean that because I'm sure you know that your films make lots of people myself included very happy. Thanks for existing! 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Another Woman was the first in a decade of gems in Woody Allen's filmmaking canon nearly all of them small dramas with very precise stories. It is perhaps among his best because of how modest how quiet and how emotionally and psychologically affecting it is. Surprisingly so.It is the story of a classic introvert played with magnificent discipline by Gena Rowlands who has constructed a very tight shell around herself she never realized she lived behind. But from the moment we see her and hear her narrative voice in the opening frame we see it. We feel it. And we relate to it while we also scoff at it.And bit by bit in her small corner of life in Manhattan's old stoney bythepark world where the film is set Marion's shell is cracked and peeled by the inevitable twists of life even for people like her. And the funny coincidental shocks  most penetratingly through a device Allen uses  end up stirring Marion's selfdoubt and selfawareness for the first time in her life. She whirrs to life finally. She feels real pity real humiliation real regret and real girlish passion under a Central Park bridge in the middle of a rainstorm.Indeed much like a classic introvert all of Marion's turning points happen when she is alone except of course the romantic one  but alas it only is realized as she relives it alone in a room. And if you've ever hopelessly loved an introvert like Marion you'll applaud Allen's insight into the way such people operate. Perhaps it's the only film of his in which Allen really communicates the hell and the loneliness of such a personality without any tonic of humor.But this is not a dreary film far from it. It has a golden beauty to it despite the beigeyness. When Marion's real warmth and humanity pulses to life in Another Woman it has a hopefulness and naivety that redeems all of her blathery intellectualism much like we must forgive some of Allen's dialogue which must read better in subtitles overseas than it sounds to us much less so in this film than of its butterscotchy predecessor September.Indeed in Another Woman  much like in the smallandgolden films that followed like Crimes and Misdemeanors Shadows and Fog Alice and finally with a gush of fully rerealized wonderful sentimentality in Everybody Says I Love You  Allen doesn't hide so much behind his shtick and comes right out and says how he feels.Added in are some really fantastic cameo performances. Mia Farrow's whiny hormonal character has a humanity to it that leaves just the right kind of taste in your mouth by the end. Blythe Danner is wonderful as the best friend who ends up being more or perhaps less complex than you initially realize and Ian Holm is pitchperfect as the moral match for Marion's craniallysteeled self. Martha Plimpton does the young rich prepschool girl justice without making her a cartoon. Sandy Dennis' two scenes are riveting  her character's emotionality clearly something Marion had an intense jealously toward and Dennis hits it out of the park so well in a way that you imagine the main scene was done in one take. And John Houseman in his last moments on screen brings a sort of brave memorable rawness to his speech about the end of life  Allen owes a great debt to him for this.If you have someone like Marion in your life someone intelligent whom you love yet you find maddeningly introverted and remote  go onto Amazon and quietly send them Another Woman with a very sparing note. And while you probably shouldn't expect a very revealing note back a week or so after it arrives be content to know that it will likely have quite an effect. A small and golden one.".

The programme notes also stated that this film was so popular upon its original release that it was rereleased a year later in a new edition with substantial new footage added and previous footage removed. I'm a bit surprised that it survived at all in its original version.'The Way to Strength and Health a film of modern body culture' is very much an artefact of the Naturist fad that swept Germany at this time. It was part of the same trend which helped the Nazis come to power with their obsession for racial and physical purity and the beauty of the German countryside. This isn't a Nazi movie but it comes directly out of the same school of thought which facilitated the rise of Nazism.There's lots of footage of naked young bodies here most of them German or at least by Nazi definition Aryan. I felt very uncomfortable watching these sequences because I felt that they were somewhat dishonest. Audiences for this 1925 movie were fullydressed and anonymous in the darkness while watching adults and teens of both sexes who are naked performing gymnastics and other physical rituals. I couldn't help wondering how much of this movie's original success was down to sexual prurience and voyeurism rather than a sincere interest in health and fitness. Lest I seem hypocritical I freely admit that I felt very aroused indeed at the footage of the very sexy young Leni Riefenstahl in this movie.At this late date this movie's prime interest is historical. If you're interested in seeing naked bodies  female or male or both  you can see far more attractive nudity on offer in other films. I'll rate this one just 2 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Film review Faust Director Alexander SokurovBe warned Do not expect Goethe's Faust. While acknowledging the most famous adaptation of the Faust saga and using some lines from Goethe's text this is entirely Alexander Sokurov's vision. The final instalment of a tetralogy about power the other parts having featured Hitler Lenin and Emperor Hirohito Faust is far removed from the wellknown drama about the knowledgeseeking explorer of ultimate truths we have come accustomed to associated with the name. The things this Faust although a scientist is looking for are much more basic. At first he is little more than a hungry beggar trying to get food and money. Later he craves for Margarethe whom he regards as little more than a desired sex partner. There is nothing Faustian about this Faust who believes neither in God nor a soul and has discarded knowledge along with the other two. When he disembowels a corpse in the opening scene he no longer expects to find anything he does it out of little more than boredom. And even if he did find something He wouldn't really care. This is an aimless Faust  and because of it a restless one. He is constantly on the move less concerned with where he is going than getting away from wherever he is. A driven wanderer not a determined searcher frantic harassed as if on the run. Sokurov's camera stays with him mirroring his hectic movements and creating a rhythm very much its own. This not at all metaphysical search is conducted at an ever increasing speed threatening to swallow up the protagonist. It begins to slow down when he meets the usurer a grossly disfigured man who is Sokurov's version of Mephisto. But as Faust is much reduced in grandeur so is the devil's agent a miserly moneylender and pawnbroker nothing more. As Faust meets the usurer the frantic pace eases into something of a ghostly dance as Faust properly fed turns his desire on Margarethe. When he succeeds all comes to a stop Drenched in angelic light there is a moment of complete arrest time stands still and we just see their faces in total forgetful bliss. But it can't last. And it doesn't.Repeatedly lines from Goethe's drama are spoken but as the film advances more and more of Faust's words end up uttered  and often ironically altered  by the usurer. They sound hollow at best and are at worst exposed as nothing but beautiful nonsense. The meaning we seek  and believe to find  in Faust it has long departed if it ever existed. The soulless universe Faust proclaims  Sokurov gives it its face This is an ugly world inhabited by ugly or at least strange people  memorable Hanna Schygulla as the usurer's wife  bizarre but unquestioned happenings and no good whatsoever. There is a pale sometimes blinding light over this universe shapes get distorted in what appears to be the world of a dream a nightmare. Who is the dreamer? Faust the devil we?All appearance of any sort of reality vanishes after Faust finally succeeds in his wooing of Margarethe. Faust finds himself and the usurer in a barren landscape remnant of Goethe's Faust 2 he meets the dead but there is nobody living. In a final act of childlike defiance he stones the usurer however he doesn't die. Faust doesn't need him anymore  they have long been one and the same. As Faust wanders off he has become an unthinking pleasure seeker the polar opposite of Goethe's explorer and man of action.Sokurov has created a visual and atmospheric universe very much his own. The images seem covered with a yellowgreenish patina in their paleness they embody the lifelessness of those dream creatures those walking dead. Distorted figures and shapes help propel the film more and more into a dream state yet the world Sokurov conjures up  whether real or not  is fully consistent. At times it feels like being inside a Hieronymus Bosch painting it is a dirty ugly primitive dying world. There may be no other living director who is capable of creating such a distinct and thoroughly convincing vision.Yet this strength is also the weakness of his film. The deliberately placed shock moments the total refusal to create any believable character the strict adherence to a counterreality totally removed from anything we know helps close this universe hermetically. We may get a glimpse of it but it is like looking from the safe distance at something disgusting. So fascination is replaced by disgust what first seems like a revelation becomes annoying and in the end this whole story turns to a modestly shocking horror tale that leaves the viewer cold. What remains his a visually stunning almost revolutionary piece of film making that perfectly reflects its subject it lacks a soul.httpstagescreen.wordpress.com".

It premiered In competition at the 68th Venice Film Festival in 2011 was shot on location in Spain and Iceland and produced by Russian composer and producer Andrey Sigle. It tells the story about scholar Heinrich Faust a man with a great hunger for knowledge. Heinrich is not pleased with his mundane life but when allured by Mephistopheles he becomes enchanted by a woman named Margarete.This characterdriven and dialogdriven voyage into the human psyche has a stringently structured narrative with continuous dialog and is an atmospheric dramatic and visually exceptional movie experience which is distinctly directed by a masterful director who creates versatile perspectives and invigorating scenes with his characteristic use of colors and soft focus. His detailed period piece takes place in the Harz mountain chain of Northern Germany between the Weser and Elbe Rivers during the 19th century and contains adventurous milieu depictions which are complimented by Elena Zhukova's ardent production design and French cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel's noticeable cinematography.This wandering philosophical and indepth study of character about a man who makes a lifealtering compromise for the sake of knowledge is significantly reinforced by the marvellous use of light and the engaging acting performances by Austrian actor Johannes Zeiler Russian actor Anton Adasinskiy and the understated acting performance by Russian actress Isolda Dychauk in her second feature film role. The fourth and final part of Alexandr Sokurov's tetralogy about the nature of power and how it influences man was preceded by Moloch 1999 Telets 2001 and The Sun 2005.

	schema:reviewBody "The 2011film Faust was one of the big awards players outside of Hollywood. It is not the first Sokurov movie in German her made one in 1999 already in a movie series where Faust is already the fourth entry. He is one of the most famous Russian directors right now and has been especially present at the Palme d'Or film festival in the past. And he is also a writer for the movies he makes such as this one. Personally I feel this film looks much older than not even 5 years ago.The main character is played by Johannes Zeiler and he looks a bit like Ralph Fiennes. Mephisto or the Moneylender has not acted in movies after this one here but I read he has his own theater so he's probably pretty active nonetheless. Apart from them there are several known German actors in here such as Hanna Schygulla or also Antje Lewald who I saw first in the Campers TV show. The film runs for considerably over two hours and is of course about the Goethe work but still several steps are inbetween. It is based on Yuriy Arabov's adaptation and was altered again by Sokurov into the final version. I am not too sure how close it is still to Goethe's work as it's been too long since we had it at school but the three central characters are obviously all there.All in all I was not too impressed and sometimes I even felt it dragged so I would not really recommend watching it unless you love story and are really curious about this adaptation.".

	schema:reviewBody "I came to know quite late the works of the Russian director Alexander Sokurov and I cannot say I know them well today either. The first one I have seen was Russian Ark a splendid exercise in virtuosity composition and visual beauty but lacking almost completely any epic structure. Next came the 3rd film in his tetralogy about men and power The Sun which had emperor Hirohito in his days of defeat at the end of WWII as main hero. Now I have seen the 4th film in the series a very different special and personal version of the story of Faust. I am yet to see the first two films in the same series which deal with the portraits of Hitler and Lenin as well as other of his works that drew the attention of audiences and critics like 'Father and Son'. So the impressions here are to be seen as partial notes on my route of better knowing one of the major artists in modern cinema. I am yet to form a dependency for his work or to declare admiration for the director but I may get there some day.On many respects this 'Faust' is close to 'Russian Ark'. It is one of the most beautiful and complex pieces of visual art that I have seen lately and I cannot skip mentioning here in this context the name of the director of photography Bruno Delbonnel author of such other wonderfully filmed works like 'Amlie' or 'Harry Potter and the HalfBlood Prince'. Sokurov creates a world of his own with hundred of characters costumes and behaviors studied and acted to the smallest detail. The world is a synthesis not only of the German world at the time Goethe wrote the original story but of all that was Europe from the Middle Ages to the 19th century. It can happen and it actually happens at any of the moments in that period.Sokurov takes inspiration from the work of Goethe but does not follow it closely. This film is certainly not Goethe's Faust it is at best 'inspired' by it. It is Sokurov's Faust before all  a work about a man a scientist and a philosopher searching for the sense of life mired by an incarnation of the Devil into knowing the savage real world and the wild people who populate it choosing beauty in the person of a beautiful girl selling the soul he does not believe it exists in order to spend a night with her and eventually revolting against the payment he signed for. A more human Faust than in most of the other versions we know.If this Faust was only a video art work I would have completely fell under its spell. It does have however a narrative dimension and this is where I found the pace and the style unnecessarily complicated and the usage of dialog too heavy to follow easily and to be a pleasant experience for the viewers. Acting on the other hand is exquisite  Johannes Zeiler is a Faust torn between the desire to conquer the universe by understanding its mechanics and the passion that burns up his human shell Russian actor Anton Adasinsky is amazing as the ugly subhuman Moneylender who opens the door to Faust's meeting with the ugliness of the world and the contrasting Isolda Dychauk as a young botticellian Margarete who descends directly from Vermeer's paintings. This is one of these movies where the attention is drawn at any moment by visuals and when it ends you tell yourself that you must have missed many of the hidden and deeper ideas. This may be true but not completely as Sokurov seems to be one of those directors who love to keep some of the details explained for himself only assuming that he knows them at all.".

	onyx:emotionText "I came to know quite late the works of the Russian director Alexander Sokurov and I cannot say I know them well today either. The first one I have seen was Russian Ark a splendid exercise in virtuosity composition and visual beauty but lacking almost completely any epic structure. Next came the 3rd film in his tetralogy about men and power The Sun which had emperor Hirohito in his days of defeat at the end of WWII as main hero. Now I have seen the 4th film in the series a very different special and personal version of the story of Faust. I am yet to see the first two films in the same series which deal with the portraits of Hitler and Lenin as well as other of his works that drew the attention of audiences and critics like 'Father and Son'. So the impressions here are to be seen as partial notes on my route of better knowing one of the major artists in modern cinema.

	schema:reviewBody "Where to begin with a review of Aleksandr Sokurov's Faust? Loosely based on Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's 19th century play this Russian film resolutely defies description on normal terms. Sokurov adorns his film with sumptuous visuals throughout but adopts a very idiosyncratic storytelling technique which will prove baffling for most viewers. This is not a film to be watched lightly  you will need to be wearing your intellectual hat if you're to make it through two and a half hours of Sokurov's exceptionally erudite moviemaking style.In the 19th century Heinrich Faust Johannes Zeiler a tormented scientist desperately seeks answers to questions that hang tantalisingly beyond his grasp. Often he hires local grave robbers to dig up corpses so that he can dissect them exploring the inside of the human body to satisfy his gruesome curiosity. What are the various organs for? What makes the body work? Is there such a thing as a soul and where is it to be found? Hopelessly disillusioned by his father's fake cure business which mostly causes the death of patients rather than their recovery Faust decides that he has had enough of spending his life chasing enlightenment. He is about to commit suicide when he is interrupted by the arrival of devilish deformed racketeer Mauricius Anton Adasinsky. Mauricius leads Faust on a grotesque tour of the town taking him into the underbelly of the community and tempting him with various sinful pleasures. He manipulates Faust at every opportunity involving him in indulgence lust and murder. Soon Faust finds himself infatuated with young washerwoman Margarete Isolda Dychauk and Mauricius eventually reveals that Faust can have her if he agrees to sign away his soul.The film is remarkable to look at with an array of amazing sets and locations beautifully captured by cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel. The characters consist of a gallery of peasants rogues and freaks all performed evocatively enough by the actors but too obscurely written for the audience to truly identify with them. Indeed therein lies the main fault with Faust it's not just the characters but the story itself that is too obscurely drawn for the film's own good. Faust won considerable admiration on the international circuit crowning its achievements by becoming the recipient of the prestigious Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. It certainly has its strengths such as the splendidly creepy performance of Adasinsky as the story's Mephistopheles figure and the wonderfully evocative photography. However one would have to question whether the film deserves to have been showered with the accolades that it has received. Things like confusing subtitling perplexing dialogue and unclear story development drag it down somewhat and make one wonder quite why it has earned such towering praise. Having said that Faust is worth a look especially if you are interested in Faustian literature e.g. Goethe's play Thomas Mann's novel or even the original Elizabethan play Doctor Faustus by Christopher Marlowe. Just be sure to prepare yourself in advance for a very heavygoing experience and don't allow yourself to anticipate some sort of extraordinary experience as promised by the glowing reviews. A lifechanging mindblowing masterpiece no. A flawed but interesting Gothic melodrama yes.".

As Dr. Faust is not an invention of Goethe but actually a 15th century German legendary character Sokurov portrays here the original story at its source. Faust is not driven by the wish to gain esoteric knowledge but knowledge of how to seduce Margarethe as quickly as possible. Here lies the core ANY character even the ones that are not relevant to the story at all is portrayed suffering from heavy psychological disorders. You name it you find it phobias generalized anxiety disorder social anxiety disorder panic disorder agoraphobia obsessivecompulsive disorder posttraumatic stress disorder schizophrenia delusional disorder schizoaffective disorder antisocial personality borderline personality histrionic and narcissistic personality disorders even paraphilia sexual arousal to objects situations or individuals that are considered abnormal or harmful to the person or others is displayed by Mephisto who is shown in this adaption as Moneylender. Wagner who is Faust's student is shown suffering from classic egodystonic sexual orientation. This is actually what the whole adaption seems to be about showing various characters with heavy psychological disorders who are fitted together in the storyline of the legendary character Dr. Faustus. The idea that Sokorov seems to have intended to portray is that the sexual force is the actual driving force of not only Dr. Faustus but of most people in the sense of a primal force. My personal feeling is that the portrayal of psychological disorders is not helping to give the storyline of the legendary Dr. Faustus more appeal but is as depiction of the human soul as dark cabinet unique as such and Faustian in itself as adaption. If you enjoy viewing a world of heavily disturbed personalities that are credibly acted out this is your movie. If you want to see a movie that saves you reading Goethe's Faust go find another movie. My vote 6.5 of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Back in 2011 Russian director Aleksandr Sokurov tackled the iconic story of 'Faust' something that has been interpreted and done many times over since Johann Wolfgang von Goethe first wrote the version most recognized days a few hundred years ago. It's quite a big feat to tackle this subject matter and make work on an artistic and entertaining level but Sokruov make it work and eventually the film went on to win the top award at the Venice Film Festival of that year.If you're unfamiliar with the story of 'Faust' don't let this box art trick you. If you go solely from the box art you might think this is a very boring period piece but you would be wrong in that assumption. So wrong in fact that the movie basically starts out with an image of a corpse's sexual organs. I know how very 'Nekromantik' of them right? The film centers on a man named Faust Johannes Zeiler who is very interested in what makes the world function humans love and if people really have souls.Faust tries to research this and learn for his own sake. He even goes so far as to literally dig and play with people's guts and blood in order to find a higher plane of existence and soul to humanity. And yes there is enough gore for your horror hounds out there to enjoy. Fast befriends Moneylender Anton Adasinsky who is basically the Devil himself as he takes Faust on a journey through town showing him the bad things of the world. But Faust soon comes infatuated with a beautiful woman named Gretchen Isolda Dychauk.Faust literally sells his soul to his new friend the Devil in order to have Gretchen which sets off a series of events which ultimately leaves Faust in Hell. Sokurov tends to tell this gruesome and twisted tale in an abstract way more so than a literal way and it takes a little time to understand what exactly is going on.His camerawork is excellent and is a new take and very fresh adaptation of this classic tale. The set design is haunting and award worthy as well. The actors deliver on their performances spot on with this type of story telling which to say the least is not for weakstomached. It would have been nice to have a more cohesive narrative here rather than someone narrating for us the entire time and a movie that is made with an abstract eye rather than a literal one would have done wonders for the entertainment value here but one thing is for sure you won't be able to look away here.

But as in the case of 'Russian Ark' one cannot deny his talent for opulent visuals and creative camera movement. However how one could possibly deem this very loose adaptation of 'Faust' laudable is completely beyond me  because there are far superior film versions of this wellknown story first and foremost among them Murnau's.What has always bothered me about Sokurov is derogatory treatment of female characters and use of superfluous or gruesome details  in this case best exemplified by the opening shot of a man's penis then revealed to be that of a corpse in the process of being harvested by Faust for research. Or a totally unnecessary scene involving two drunken Russians. All women here are mere furniture especially Gretchen who hardly appears enough to merit even a reduction to an object of desire. Instead there are endless interchanges between a bewildered impoverished Faust and a lessthanimpressive Mephisto who is portrayed more as a salesman than a demon thereby depriving the tale of much of its zest and unduly limiting the means of expression of the actor  definitely the worst Mephistopheles I've ever seen on either screen or stage.What I find absolutely unforgivable though is the altered ending which takes excessive liberty with the tale as it is  and I'm not talking about Goethe even though it is already quite preposterous to title the film as an adaptation of Goethe's Faust and then but quote a few lines from the play. While art of course is at liberty to interpret the lore of culture freely one cannot let Romeo and Juliet live for instance because then the whole point of the story is gone.That is pretty much what Sokurov does to Faust here  for the sake of demonstrating his ability as a director he changes the entire story to the extent of being unidentifiable with no regard to the audience or just about any definition of taste. Unfortunately such creative sadism meets with the masochism of entrenched festival juries preferring the old and tiresome over the young and relevant which to me is about the only explanation how this selfindulgent boring dreadful piece could win the Golden Lion  notwithstanding the fact that this award has already lost much of its luster.".

	schema:reviewBody "Faust has quite rightly fallen under everyone's radar. I had never heard of it until I saw it in a list someone made. It looked interesting and then I read that it made one of my all time favourite directors Darren Aronofsky cry. He has also infamously stated that Faust is the kind of film that has the power to change your life or something along those lines. I then watched the trailer and it looked intense powerful and not too much unlike Darren's own operatic masterpiece Black Swan which happens to be possibly my favourite film of all time. Thus of course I was sold. I bought the film on blu ray for 6.26 and was extremely excited to give it a watch. I went into Faust very openminded. More than openminded because I was honestly looking forward to it I was expecting a beautifully intense and dreamlike film but unfortunately that is not what I received.The highest point in Faust is the brilliant opening shot which gracefully glides through the sky where a mirror is bizarrely floating. We then pass underneath the clouds to reveal some awesome mountains and a village. It's a brilliant shot reminiscent of Baz Luhrman's Moulin Rouge! We then get a nice closeup of a dead man's penis and some grisly depictions of an autopsy. It's here that the film slowly goes downhill or rather curiously meanders down a dull path which should hopefully cure anyone of insomnia. A lot of reviewers seem concerned that the film is not a direct retelling of the Faust legend. Unluckily for me I have never read or seen anything to do with Goethe's Faust which is a shame because it may have helped me to understand what was going on as I was sometimes lost.My first problem with the film is that it has been unnecessarily boxed up. By this I mean that the film has black bands either side of the screen which makes it more difficult to appreciate one of it's biggest redeeming features the visuals. I don't see the point in doing this unless it's only on the UK blu ray version of the film which by the way is not blu ray quality! It's also very easy to get lost in the film and not in a good David Lynch kind of way but a tedious way. I watch a lot of subtitled films because I have a passion for foreign cinema but even I found it difficult to keep up with. Someone is always talking at quite a brisk pace meaning that you've got to keep up with the subtitles meaning that a lot of the visuals get lost. The dialogue is also quite boringly pretentious with talks about philosophy and the like.However if you strip back the story of the film there really isn't too much to it. It's just about a man who befriends an old man who I think is supposed to be the devil and he randomly falls for a young bereaved woman and decides to sign his soul away in order to spend a night with her. But for some reason the film has been ludicrously padded out to 2 hours 20 minutes it feels longer. Much of the film just follows Faust as he plods around with the devil who rambles on for nonstop about things I don't entirely understand. It's the walking equivalent to a road movie only nothing very interesting happens. I found much of it very boring but I stuck with it.Faust isn't all bad though. It's at its most interesting when it's using surrealism to a bizarre and sometime unsettling effect. There's a monkey on the moon an old man with a body like Danny De Vito in Batman Returns and a small person in a jar made from the liver of a donkey. Unfortunately these moments are few and far between. The film is much more interesting in lecturing the audience through boring characters who don't really develop or interest in any way. The film is also very often fantastic to look at. I loved how the film looked like it had all the colours drained from it and the locations were rich with period detail. The costumes were also lavish. The production values are actually quite excellent for an unknown German film. Unfortunately the screenplay isn't.Faust isn't the most boring film I've ever seen but then again you're reading a review written by a poor chap who has sat through such cinematic stimulation as ImportExport and Uzak. Two of the most boring films on the planet. Faust doesn't come close to the level of boredom they caused but if you've seen them then you'll know that that really isn't saying a lot. Faust is boring and has little plot or characters that capture your attention. It does have sporadic moments of creativity and surrealism but there aren't enough of these moments to warrant it being watched. I think it's a film strictly for pseuds. Unfortunately I failed to find it intense powerful or life changing. Ironically Faust is a film with no soul or perhaps that's the point. I don't know. All I know is that I wasted 6.".

The film is also very often fantastic to look at. I loved how the film looked like it had all the colours drained from it and the locations were rich with period detail. The costumes were also lavish. The production values are actually quite excellent for an unknown German film. Unfortunately the screenplay isn't.Faust isn't the most boring film I've ever seen but then again you're reading a review written by a poor chap who has sat through such cinematic stimulation as ImportExport and Uzak. Two of the most boring films on the planet. Faust doesn't come close to the level of boredom they caused but if you've seen them then you'll know that that really isn't saying a lot. Faust is boring and has little plot or characters that capture your attention. It does have sporadic moments of creativity and surrealism but there aren't enough of these moments to warrant it being watched. I think it's a film strictly for pseuds. Unfortunately I failed to find it intense powerful or life changing. Ironically Faust is a film with no soul or perhaps that's the point. I don't know. All I know is that I wasted 6.";

The story behind the ghosts being in the house is developed quite well and makes the ghosts themselves more enjoyable. The ghosts range from almost comical to truly frightening and it is fun to wait and see what kind of spirit you will encounter next.The house itself is a rather nice piece of real estate and I'm sure some people have driven around Los Angeles trying to find it. Martin Milner plays the lawyer who facilitates the will giving the family the house and it is interesting to see him in his preAdam 12 days.13 Ghosts is definitely worth watching especially around Halloween.

When Buck accidentally discovers the hidden fortune in the house the ambitious Benjamin lures the boy with the intention of stealing the money for him. But Dr. Zorba's ghost is also in the house and will protect his family. 13 Ghosts is an original movie directed by William Castle actually a family entertainment. The plot is very simple but the greatest attractions are the ghosts in Dr. Zorba's mansion. The DVD delivers special goggles that allows the viewer to see the ghosts in a unique frightening experience. The only problem is to repeat the scenes to share the goggles since everybody wants to see the ghosts. My vote is six.Title Brazil 13 Fantasmas 13 Ghosts".

William Castle at the time was the PT Barnum of horror movies and this was one of his latest gimmicks.

	schema:headline " The Best of William Castle";
	schema:reviewBody "Ghost movies are among my favorite horror movies even over vampire pictures because you can't screw up a ghost movie while so many vampire movies rewrite vampire legends to fit their plots. William Castle knew how to make really good haunted house pictures. House on Haunted Hill is a classic even with it's soso remake but I think Thirteen Ghosts deserves to be counted as Castle's best. In this movie he sets up a family nearing financial destitution despite the father's white collar job. This family with its knockout daughter and flighty son I shouldn't complain that boy acts and talks the same way I was at his age loses everything except their private belongings and then discovers a forgotten rich relative has left them his house and fortune. Wouldn't you want that to happen to you ? Before you say 'yes' the house turns out to be haunted by the eccentric relative's ghost collection this was years before Ghostbusters. The family has to decide to give up the house which may be hiding the relative's missing fortune or give it all up. It's a great plot but the Illusio used at the time to create the ghosts with special glasses doesn't translate well to the black and white of today's tv screens not even if you try to substitute 3D glasses.Still for what you see of them the ghosts are chilling in a surreal sort of way as they go about their business and scare the family on the side. Some of the acting is campy particularly De Camp's reactions to the ghosts in the kitchen. The boy Buck can be particularly chilling in the way Haley Joel Osment was for The Sixth Sense. The daughter Medea played by  obscure Jo Morrow overdoes some of the stern sister's acting but the father is played somewhat wooden. Adam12's Martin Milner looks out of his element as the family lawyer but he was near the start of his acting career. Kudos have to go to the casting of Margaret Hamilton from The Wizard of Oz as the housekeeper who may or may not be a witch in this movie too. Can you imagine what this movie would have been like with Ann B. Davis ?".

	schema:reviewBody "This film by William Castle about a family of four moving into a house professed to have no fewer than 13 ghosts is a great deal of fun. Donald Woods is Cyrus Zorba a paleontologist down on his luck. His furniture has just been removed from his flat and his wife and two children Medea and Buck seem used to being in continual dire financial straits. While sitting on the floor for Buck's birthday party a creepy message comes telling Cyrus to see a lawyer in the morning. Cyrus and wife Rosemary Decamp go and discover that Cyrus has inherited a huge mansion from his Uncle Plato as well as a package containing some weird type of glasses. It seems that Uncle Plato collected ghosts. The rest of the story details what life is like in this house that has these ghosts. I did not have the pair of glasses so cannot tell you what it looked like in IllusionO but I bet it was even more fun. Castle always seems to do a good job at creating entertaining fun films though none of them ever seem to be much more than that either. The mystery is not hard to figure out at all. The acting is good all around with youngster Charles Herbert giving a nice performance as Buck. Woods is good as the family patriarch and Jo Morrow is just beautiful as daughter Medea. Martin Milner plays Ben the lawyer. And as a retainer in the house is Elaine played by none other than Margaret Hamiltonalways a joy to see her. When Ben first arrives at the house to see how the Zorbas are doing Buck says ring the bell and you'll see a witch. Of course the witch reference goes throughout the whole film as Hamilton looks witchlike and this is one marvelous inside gag about her Wizard of Oz performance. The effects for the film are pretty tame and very hokey but this film is just good oldfashioned fun. I liked it from beginning to end. If you loved the new one and decide to go back and see the old one  you will be very disappointed. Just as I was disappointed having seen the old one and moving to the new one. They have nothing except some threadbare incidentals in common and a producer named Castlethough a different first name for each.".

Cinematography is by Joseph Biroc and music by Von Dexter.When the Zorba family inherit a house from the recently deceased Dr. Plato Zorba they think their luck has turned for the better. But pretty soon it becomes evident that Plato was known to be a dabbler in the supernatural and the house is haunted by a number of ghosts.By the time of 13 Ghosts' release William Castle was well into his stride as a showman producer. Following on from The Tingler one of his best films that featured his best gimmick Percepto he brought to his target audience IllusionO basically a two coloured viewer that the audience could use if they did or did not want to see the ghosts in the film a subtitle flashed on the screen prompted use of the viewer. Unlike The Tingler 13 Ghosts isn't a good enough film to be considered better than the gimmick that accompanied it. Yet there's a glorious sense of fun about the film anyone under the illusion o that Castle was trying for a serious horror to scare the teenagers could do with listening to Von Dexter's score for some of the ghostly goings on. Wonderfully tongue in cheek the whole thing is played for nervous smiles rather than shrieker schlock.The effects used red images in a black and white movie are more than good enough for tone and purpose of this particular production in fact if you watch in the dark in the right frame of mind then the ghosts do have a creepy enough vibe to them. The narrative while hardly taxing for the brain does contain a couple of surprises while the presence of the wonderful Margaret Hamilton Wizard of Oz's Wicked Witch of the West is a major plus point especially since she closes the picture down with eyebrow shifting glee. Critics across the years have always been hard on the film and for sure it's weak in direction writing and a high percentage of the acting but it was a hit at the box office. There was a market for it back then and there still is now you just gotta be into fun and in an undemanding horrorcomedy mood.Just above average for a cheeky chiller blues lifter. 610".

No it's not scary by today's standards but it's strangely disturbing in some way which puts it ahead of about 90 of the gorefests out there. The plot device that makes it work is extremely clever a special pair of glasses made from a special glass that enable the view to see ghosts while the others can't see the danger that looms over them. There's a great subtle moment that would never be found in today's hack bloodfests the scientist who made the glasses puts them on his desk for the night  a fly buzzes over them only to disintegrate. The embarrassing remake had Everyone wearing the glasses so the entire suspense of being the only one that can see them is gone! The movie is directed so that the viewer has the experience of being the one wearing the special glasses so the Look Out Behind You! factor is very high. If the effects weren't so campy this would be very effective even today and still could in the right hands this would've made a great idea for the XFiles or similar original show. However some of the effects are still disturbing it is atmospheric as heck for those who have an attention span and you get to see a great ending that put a smile on my face only because I love Margaret Hamilton so much. It's a crime this great actress wasn't starring in more films of high caliber a true waste of talent. Check it out on Halloween for your kids if it isn't on TV. If they haven't been desensitized by chain saws  decapitations yet they'll like it. Then again maybe I'm just nostalgic.".

Films like this wouldn't do very well these days hence the reason the remake is so different as the chills mostly come in the form of wind whistling through windows and pots being thrown off kitchen shelves things which wouldn't scare people anymore. However it's delightful to see a film like this  especially one directed by one of the kings of horror entertainment William Castle. 13 Ghosts works from the assumption that its audience wants to believe in ghosts and the result is a cheerful little flick that Castle manages to steer away from patronisation and keep firmly within the realms of the fun horror film. The story is halfway between a tale of ghosts and a story about mad science and we follow a family who find themselves between a rock and a hard place when the repossession men take their furniture and the father's uncle dies leaving them his house. However he dabbled in the occult and the house that he's left his nephew's family is filled with ghosts! Hot on the heels of his successes with Vincent Price starring films The Tingler and House on Haunted Hill 13 Ghosts is another gimmicky film with over the top special effects and once again Castle does a great job of entertaining the audience. The plot doesn't have a lot of originality but it doesn't matter because it's successful where it counts. The family are shown as the classic American set up of a father mother daughter and son and they're all very easy to get on with which makes both of the 'evil' subplots easy to buy into. The special effects are one of the most notable things about this film. William Castle clearly doesn't subscribe to the idea of 'less is more' and 13 Ghosts shows that quite clearly. The ghosts here leave nothing to the imagination and I was very happy with that as the main reason I don't usually like ghost stories is that they take too long to get going. This one doesn't suffer from that and although it's a bit silly at times  13 Ghosts is a real good time and comes highly recommended to all!".

Not that the cast in this one is bad or anything this film just suffers from being a bit too predictable and while most of the cast was good the kid playing the son was just annoying. The effects were about what one expects from a film from this era while the tone is a bit more comedic in tone than what I was expecting.The story has a man who works at a museum who seems to have a hard time paying his bills on time. His stuff is getting repossessed and his son wishes that they could get a house with furniture that no one can take away. As if by magic the curator finds that he has inherited an old mansion. Of course the catch is that he and his family has also inherited the ghosts the old man who owned the house 'collected'. A strange woman who insists on living on the premises tells the son of the ghosts as does the lawyer of the man who owned the house. Something seems suspicious but at the same time the house does seem to be haunted as a box containing special glasses is also given to the curator and with them he sees the spirits at play.I actually watched the remake of this one well before ever viewing this one. I am surprised by how much of this one's plot did make it into the remake. I was thinking it was going to be a remake in name only and perhaps both featured 13 ghosts but the glasses in this one made their way to the remake's plot as did the fact the family was getting kicked out of the house. I prefer the remake only because the ghosts in this one were just not very scary mainly being more funny in nature.So I am glad I finally watched this film if for no other reason to get another horror film under my belt. I prefer other haunted films from this era though like House on Haunted Hill the one with Roddy McDowell and various others. This one was just a bit too cutesy as it played off a lot of the ghost encounters as funny. It started out with a bang but after awhile it also gets repetitive and if you cannot figure out the one character's motives then you are really young or really naive.".

That's right up there with PATTON THE YOUNG LIONS and the like.Brando plays Robert Crain who is assigned to go undercover on board a German freighter transporting a cargo of rubber to the war zone. He must impersonate a Nazi to do this and must face some hard choices as to how cruel he can be to appear realistic. Brynner is Muller the captain of the freighter who has accepted the job as his last chance to save his career in the German merchant marine. He is fair and compassionate and must rein in the fanatical Nazi secondincommand that his superiors have appointed for him. En route the freighter picks up the survivors of a Uboat including Esther Janet Margolin a beautiful young concentration camp survivor who is so brimming with hatred and vengefulness that she can no longer even accept human compassion.Brando is very good in his role but he is completely upstaged by Brynner who gives the performance of a lifetime. His conflict between his patriotism and selfpreservation on the one side and the vileness of what the Nazis are doing to him and to his country on the other is marvelously realized. The movie also features a beautiful exchange between Brando and one of the passengers  I was a political prisoner. Falsely accused of course. No. Not falsely accused. smiles. I have a soft spot for movies where adversaries come to respect each other and MORITURI is one of the best of that type.Good luck finding this movie.

I read Peter Manso's Brando biography which states that the film was panned and I really don't understand why. The film boasts two commanding performances by Brando and Yul Brynner. Brando plays a German man who's blackmailed by British Intelligence to pose as a NAZI officer on a German ship commanded by Brynner. Brando's German accent was full on the whole way through. And after seeing various Brando films it was really cool to see Brando play a double agent that was light on his feet sneaking in and out of rooms on a German ship in an attempt to sabatoge the ship. The supporting performances are solid all the way around. Trevor Howard has a nice cameo at the beginning of the film as a British Intelligence man. I've always known about Yul Brynner but this is the first time I see one of his performances. I can see why he's a legendary actor. The guy has tons of personality and has the acting ability to go with his charisma. And watching him work with Brando was an absolute pleasure. Now I definitely have to go and rent more of Brynner's stuff. Brando's career presumably took a dive in the 60s but Morituri is definitely a good movie with excellent performances by its two leads and it boasts some of the best camera work I've ever seen. On a scale from 110 I'd give the film at least an 8.".

I decided to give this film another shotand I'm glad I did. I found that it is quite interesting after you watch it a couple of times you understand the purpose of Brando's character in the film. He is great in this film his accent is flawless and he looks just greatI wish he would have done more actionoriented films. The cinematography is also great and I absolutely loved the musical score.

	schema:reviewBody "A whole lot of Marlon Brando's films have been unjustly neglected from the sixties and Morituri is one of them. It's a nice espionage yarn set on the high seas in a voyage from Japan to occupied Bordeaux in France.There's no other way to put it Marlon Brando's character is a draft dodger who if he had done so in The Young Lions he'd have been much better off. But he's got certain engineering skills that British Intelligence learns about and they essentially blackmail him into a mission for them. The British Intelligence officer is Trevor Howard and quite frankly I'm surprised the two of them are sharing the screen again. They had pointedly not gotten along during the making of Mutiny on the Bounty. Maybe the dislike put some bite into the scenes where Howard persuades Brando to enlist in the Allied cause.The mission is to disable a German freighter leaving from Japan loaded with several tons of rubber ore. The allies don't want the ship sunk they in fact want Brando to disable the various charges put around the ship that would enable Captain Yul Brynner to scuttle if need be. What I like about Morituri is that there are no heroics here. Brando's cover is that of an S.S. man traveling as a passenger on the ship. He's got no back up at all and he's got no James Bond like spy devices. His character has to survive on his wits alone and Brando proves very clever at out thinking foes that are not stupid. He's helped in this by a very good script.Brynner also has his problems. He's a patriotic German not particularly in love with the Nazis. He has a son in the German Navy though. Brynner was drunk on his last voyage and may have been indiscreet due to alcoholic influence a fact that Brando cleverly exploits in letting them think his real mission as a 'passenger' is to keep an eye on Brynner.Both stars get their moments to shine in the film. Brando was able to use his star power to get a role for his best friend Wally Cox as the ship's morphine addicted doctor. Cox was trying in the sixties to branch out into serious parts and doing it successfully. Morituri is a good espionage tale with a very tight and literate script brought to the screen by a pair of the best actors around.".

	onyx:emotionText "A whole lot of Marlon Brando's films have been unjustly neglected from the sixties and Morituri is one of them. It's a nice espionage yarn set on the high seas in a voyage from Japan to occupied Bordeaux in France.There's no other way to put it Marlon Brando's character is a draft dodger who if he had done so in The Young Lions he'd have been much better off. But he's got certain engineering skills that British Intelligence learns about and they essentially blackmail him into a mission for them. The British Intelligence officer is Trevor Howard and quite frankly I'm surprised the two of them are sharing the screen again. They had pointedly not gotten along during the making of Mutiny on the Bounty. Maybe the dislike put some bite into the scenes where Howard persuades Brando to enlist in the Allied cause.The mission is to disable a German freighter leaving from Japan loaded with several tons of rubber ore. The allies don't want the ship sunk they in fact want Brando to disable the various charges put around the ship that would enable Captain Yul Brynner to scuttle if need be.

	schema:reviewBody "Don't worry I won't give away many spoilers at all. This is a great piece of work. I have read that it didn't get great reviews and I wonder why! This is as close to an action film as Marlon Brando ever did. He mostly performed in dramas and when he did appear in actionadventure films it was usually in a supporting role Superman The Score. And he totally delivers.He plays a man named Schroeder masquerading in India as Robert Crain. Trevor Howard plays a British military man who finds Schroeder in hiding and gives him two choices Go on a suicide mission on a German freighter and defuse all of her scuttling charges so the Allies can take her cargo....or be turned over to the Gestapo in a prisoner exchange. So essentially he has to choose which way he is going to die. Except that with the mission he has a small prayer of coming out alive.Yul Brynner plays the levelheaded captain of the German freighter which is loaded with political prisoners bound for France and is he ever at the top of his form in this one. In fact he commands the best scene in the film...which is him reacting to an incident at sea involving his son. Janet Margolin is also haunting as a Jewish prisoner transferred to the German freighter in the middle of the voyage and becomes part of the plans of Schroeder called Kyle on the mission and the political prisoners to take over the ship from the Nazi crew.The cinematography in this film is outstanding. We get lots of long shots of the crew on the ship and the special effects do not look too dated...which is saying a lot considering this is a black and white film made in the 1960's. This movie has a little bit for everyone...Fans of action films will enjoy the tenseness of the climax of the film and fans of spy films will find a lot to like here. Brando's character is in the midst of impossible circumstances which only get worse as the film goes on but he always manages to keep his cool as only Marlon Brando can. This is a mustsee for Brando fans if only to see their favorite actor take on such a role. As I have written before...this is as close to a pure action film that Brando ever made with himself in the starring role. The plot runs very smoothly and there aren't any lulls in the narrative. Extremely underrated picture.".

Fantastic black and white cinematography which provides some great noirish moments especially belowdeck and Marlon Brando make this a very beautiful movie to look at. The 60's are generally thought of as Brando's down period between his giving up the part of Lawrence of Arabia and ending up being falsely blamed for the project he chose instead of it going over budget Mutiny on the Bounty 1962 and his massive comeback with The Godfather in 1972 by the way Marlon's simple reason for his choice between the two projects was he'd much prefer to be swimming in beautiful Tahiti for three months than stuck in a hot desert for three months!. Because of this myth Brando afficionadoes seek out movies from this period and test how accurate a reflection of talent and ability public opinion and moneymaking is. I haven't yet seen all of them but the example of Morituri suggests that there was no reason to suspect Brando's talents ever dimmed. Some projects he had no respect for and clearly just walked through the part  but when he cared and when the director could tell the difference between a full take and an empty one Brando was electric. Morituri is an example where we see Brando at his best. His German accent in this is actually quite good  certainly better than his English accent  and it contains quite a few special Brando moments like when he is discovered belowdeck by someone who isn't aware he shouldn't be there. Jerry Goldsmith's Omen score is a highlight. Very Herrmannesque.".

From the standpoint of today this is almost extravagant since which director would nowadays go through the pain of hiring real German speakers for the roles of Germans? If Europeans seldomly enough make a movie about America they hire  Americans. If Americans too often make a movie about Europe they hire  Americans. If you see how well Wicki trained Marlon Brandy to make him able to speak with an almost perfect German accent only in order to hear this two hours and eight minutes long is worth watching the movie.However Morituri is full of similar surprises. There is Max Haufler in the movie. Haufler played basically bum characters in the old Swiss movies directed by Kurt Frh. Besides that he worked with Orson Welles in Kafka's Process and with a few comparably illustrious directors and actors. Doubtlessly with his role of Branner  Brunner  Brynner? Wicki wanted to let him put one foot in Hollywood's door. However this was Max Haufler's last role. Desperate from his experiences in the US he returned to Zurich where he hung himself up at age 55. Also one of the most illustrious though rather dubious characters of German film is in this movie Prince Wilhelm Von Homburg who had his one big role in Werner Herzog's Stroszek 1977 although he is known to a wider audience because of his character Vigo in Ghostbusters II 1989.Morituri is one the most sympathetic war movies because it transcends its genre. If it would have been made with solely American actors and an American director it would not be practically overseen. However the foreign crew is exactly what turns this Morituri into a little gem. Such movies were already about to die at the time when they were made.".

The light is dramatic the sharpness clean. And he got nominated for an Oscar for his work. The interior of the ship is large and filled with strange turns great heights lots of interior and exterior spaces that take you by surprise. Beautiful stuff.The plot moves more quickly than you'd expect too with little surprises and turns like finding a burning American ship at night and rescuing survivors. One of these is a young woman who was born in Berlin and they question herwhy is a German on an enemy ship? And she says she is not German. And they ask what is she? You expect here that she might say she was American but even better she says I am antiGerman.The script is tight and believable. The scenario which is not formed from fact as far as I could discover it's based on a novel seems reasonable. And it ends up being more subtle than you'd expect. Yes there are aspects that are obvious dramatic additionsthe one woman who appears for example happens to be Jewishbut these end up being ways of showing people's characters.

Naval films feel more like chess games than almost any kind of war film. Very cerebral lots of talking but things do pick up and Janet Margolin's death scene is the price of admission. Lots of great atmosphere and the movie's music is in that chilly haunted style Jerry Goldsmith perfected. It seems like your standard espionage film but the acting is more deeply engaging. Trevor Howard's bit in the beginning seems more like the end to a completely different film. Like he's the hero who has tracked down his prey in a fugitivechase type of film. The ending to this film feels disorienting. You wonder if the fact that the ship is saved is really worth it considering all the lives that were lost on both sides. Maybe it does feel a little like a draw in chess.".

He then boards a blockade runner disguised as a Gestapo officer in hopes of claiming its cargo of rubber for the Allied forces. Brando has some terrific scenes playing psychological catandmouse with the ships captain played by Yul Brynner.Anyway it's a film mostly about the conflicts between duty and beliefs. Brando's character views war as useless while Brynner has managed to see the war turn people into merciless fanatics including his very own son. He's a patriotic German but he has no love for the Nazi's and what they've done to his country.There were three major scenes that really stand out and two of them involved Janet Margolin who plays a Jewish prisoner. The first is when Brando confronts her over the Gestapo.  YouYouYou have no idea what these people are capable of he tells her. She responds with just a shot to your heart responding as someone who is brimming with so much hatred and vengefulness that she can no longer even accept human compassion. She is a broken person.The second scene belongs to Yul Brynner the radio has just said that his son has sunk an enemy vessel....everybody comes over to congratulates him and one of the crew grabs a navy book to know what this sunk ship looks like..and in 5 seconds we see Yul's face turning from happiness to bitterness..the ship his son sunk was an Hospital Ship. Brynner then proceeds to get himself completely wasted and then destroys his quarters screaming  Hail Cannibals! Then there is just one moment that is simply a Holy Sht moment. It is so horrific and disgusting that it literally shocks you to the core. The look on Brando's face pretty much sums it up.".

	schema:headline " Brando  Brynner!";
	schema:reviewBody "The highlight of this movie set on a German cargo ship during the Second World War are the superb performances offered by Marlon Brando and Yul Brynner. Brando plays a German expatriate disguised as a Swiss national who's living in British ruled India in 1942. He ends up being drafted very much against his will by the British to go undercover as SS agent Keil to divert the cargo ship which is carrying a very valuable  to both sides  cargo of rubber into American hands. Brynner plays Mueller  the ship's captain  a man with a drinking problem trying to regain his reputation after having a ship torpedoed out from under him while he was drunk but a man who's also no fanatical Nazi.Both are very believable in their roles. There's also a strong performance from Martin Benrath as First Officer Kruse  who is a fanatical Nazi who doesn't trust his captain and who's as happy to have an SS officer on board as the captain is unhappy about it.The movie is always interesting. It's not an action movie in the modern sense of the word but it's increasingly tense as suspicion grows about Keil and as the ship awaits a report from Berlin about him. As good as Brando and Brynner and even Benrath are though  and as tense as the movie becomes about whether Keil's real identity will be uncovered  the most powerful part of the movie might have come in a scene featuring Janet Margolin. She played a Jewish medical worker who was taken prisoner along with a number of American sailors when their ship is sunk by a U boat. Speaking with Keil as he tries to convince her that he's on her side his SS identity notwithstanding she recounts  in surprisingly and uncomfortably even for today and so shockingly so in 1965 graphic detail  her abuse at the hands of the Gestapo. Without going into detail the words hour after hour after hour are haunting. It was a truly sobering scene. You can't watch it and not find yourself in sympathy with a character who otherwise really isn't that central to the overall story.This is overall a very good movie with a very strong cast. 810".

	schema:headline " Wicki at His Peak";
	schema:reviewBody "Morituri was released 48 years ago... It seems nobody saw it. Or maybe influential but dumb film critics boycotted it. Based on a novel by Werner Jrg Lddecke it is a cynical antiwar movie made during a time when the US government was in the midst of its war campaign against Vietnam. This explains a bit the audiences' response but does not justify the bad service of the film guides. I did not see it either. In 1965 there were many good releases it is true but I at 14 years old was more into watching my idol Paula Prentiss playing a suicidal poetstripteaser Shirley MacLaine trapped in a harem in the Middle East Julie Andrews singing in the Alps Sandra Milo wearing chiffon and big hats for Fellini Barbara Stanwyck shrieking each time she saw the ghost of her blind husband or Virna Lisi emerging from a gigantic cake. I caught up with Darling The Hill and King Rat but it took me decades to see The Pawnbroker or Alphaville. And now 48 years later I discover that Bernhard Wicki's Morituri is very good! Marlon Brando is cynicism personified as Schroeder a demolition expert who refused to enlist something that in 1965 was not unusual among young Americans who opposed to US intervention in Vietnam and went to live with a forged passport in India under the name of Crain to avoid the Fhrer's armed forces. But being India under British regime and him a prisoner he is found by Trevor Howard a member of British Intelligence who blackmails him to put him aboard a cargo ship with 7000 tons of rubber for Nazi tires and other applications that is sailing from Tokyo to occupied France captained by Yul Brynner. The Allies are interested in the cargo. It is never clarified why they need to take someone else's rubber instead of getting their own but what matters for the purpose of the story is that if a Nazi ship is trapped the captain must sink it and that is why Marlon must disarm all the bombs so a convoy of American destroyers can capture the ship and keep the cargo. It is great to watch Brando and Brynner confronting each other and it is their merit that none plays the divo or diva. Especially Brynner who was so adept to pose for the camera as one of those models of vintage physique magazines check Kings of the Sun! is often restrained and effective. We don't have to talk much about Marlon  he was always good of simply Brando in the worst turkeys. Add to the events the introduction of a Jewish girl a character with an intense charge of pathos and you have 123 minutes full of interesting dramatic action and there is some physical action too well handled by Wicki and with exceptional cinematography in black and white by Conrad Hall the maestro who shot the classics In Cold Blood 1967 Butch Cassidy  the Sundance Kid and American Beauty. The cast also includes very good performances by the German players Martin Benrath as the stereotypical Nazi bastard and Hans Christian Blech as an antiNazi political prisoner Hungarian actor Oscar Beregi Jr. as the German admiral veteran Russian actor Ivan Triesault often cast as German villains as a collaborator of the Allies in the German Embassy in Tokyo and Janet Margolin as the Jewish Esther Levy. Highly recommended.".

It infiltrated the freighter a member of the British intelligence Brando in order to derail the mission. Brynner is the ship's captain honest and conscientious man who no longer has illusions with Nazism. Janet Margolin beautiful plays a Jew who during the trip is collected along with other refugees on the ship. Film made in black and white has a great shot and was made exactly 50 years ago. It is a powerful movie with great acting of the cast and I think it is a film that did not have the deserved welcome as it is of great value as a cinematographic work. A great movie!".

Janet Margolin beautiful plays a Jew who during the trip is collected along with other refugees on the ship. Film made in black and white has a great shot and was made exactly 50 years ago. It is a powerful movie with great acting of the cast and I think it is a film that did not have the deserved welcome as it is of great value as a cinematographic work. A great movie!";

	schema:reviewBody "An exciting spy thriller produced on a remarkably lavish budget. Filming aboard a real freighter adds tremendously to the film's sense of authenticity and realism. The spectator really feels caught up in the events on the screen. Skillful performances help a lot here. Although Marlon Brando is still inclined to mumble  with a German accent yet  one soon forgets about his mannerisms and concentrates on the double role he is playing. Other performers also register strongly particularly Yul Brynner as the principled captain Martin Benrath as his unprincipled first officer Hans Christian Blech as a mutinous donkeyman Oscar Beregi as the suspicious Admiral and Janet Margolin whose portrayal of a girl with a death wish is one of the film's most memorable. Actually it is wrong to describe the performances with a single adjective as each contributes a rounded realistic portrait. One of the signs that the film is adapted from a novel is this development of characters who are realistically sketched with more than one side to their nature. This characterization is preserved in Daniel Taradash's concentrated screenplay. Most of the action takes place on the freighter. In fact the introductory scenes are a trifle slow and one was evidently designed to build up a role for Trevor Howard whose part is confined to the introduction. But once on board the freighter with the camera prowling down cramped companionways and infiltrating the greasy grimeladen passages of the engine room excitement mounts both from the interplay of character and external action.Bernhard Wicki's direction is extremely capable and uses his real locations most effectively. The action scenes are thrillingly handled with some spectacular explosions and extras milling about realistically topped by some breathtakingly effective tracking and crane shots obviously filmed from a helicopter. Conrad Hall's atmospheric blackandwhite photography is despite the hazardous conditions of filming in confined quarters technically flawless. Composer Jerry Goldsmith has contributed a haunting leitmotif the sets are enormous and realistic the film editing is as smooth as silk. Production values as said are exceptionally lavish. It's rather odd that a movie featuring two superstars like Brynner and Brando seems to have disappeared. Even more odd when that movie offers such terrific entertainment. Perhaps the title is no help. And of course it's in blackandwhite!".

Sporting a great cast including Paul Dano Robert DeNiro and Julianne Moore could this be another of those rare gems that get lost on the shelf or will it be one that's clear to why it got such a limited release.Being Flynn follows a father and son who haven't been in contact with each other in years. When the father reaches out to his son he realizes he cannot outrun his fate and realizes that he has the chance to make a life for himself as well as for his father. This drama is filled with some interesting characters and great performances most notably DeNiro who seems to be letting it all out in one of his strongest performances in some time. Paul Dano does a great job carrying his own weight alongside DeNiro playing off of each other to bring this troubled relationship to life. The story takes a deeper than expected journey into human emotion and the thin line of genius and madness. Everyone gives great performances delivering a powerful film that works really well. The biggest issue is the pacing. At times it comes off as really slow and long and others will keep you interested. With an emotional film like this it's important to maintain a sense of cohesion so the heavier moments don't get lost in a sea of useless moments. That's not necessarily the case here it just runs a bit longer than it feels it needed too.While not a film that will really deliver anything all that new it does sport a great performance from DeNiro that is worth checking out. This film does sport some drug use and racist moments that while nothing you haven't seen are necessary due to the direction of the film. If you decide to give this film a shot just make sure you are prepared for some heavy content.httpwww.examiner.commovieindallasbobbyblakey".

The performances by De Niro and Dano are captivatingly dark gripping and absolutely discomforting when they are the most believable. You must understand the storyline before considering watching the movie.It's hard to tell if De Niro is overplaying the character or if the real Flynn was that bad of a drunk either way that makes the veteran of the screen's performance a memorable one. I tend to believe the performance of Robert De Niro here and like to think he does portray what Jonathan Flynn must have been like as it feels too real not to be. Anyone who's known a problematic alcoholic knows the De Niro's role was very demanding. I have a soft spot for movies with narration and the one delivered by Paul Dano playing Nick Flynn to perfection was both well done and required in the context of the story.The ending after a roller coaster ride of the life of an author with unyielding self confidence was guaranteed to bring a sigh of relief and it won't surprise me a bit if you exclaim 'son of a bit' as I did.

The situation and the why people turns to be homeless is a subject explored and showed in a clever and entertaining way without any distortions to make it look more 'interesting' for the viewer.

Growing up alone with his mom Julianne Moore one might think this is yet another dysfunctional family story but Nick has a lot more to tell baring his soul to recount the painful absence and hard fought reaching out to the only close relative he's got and this journey is one that reminds us on blood being thicker than water or alcohol for that matter here.Under the direction of Paul Weisz whose filmography included vulgar flicks like American Pie and The Little Fockers which of course also starred De Niro it was great that this film gets more closely aligned with his other narratively powerful films like About a Boy and In Good Company. While the book by Nick Flynn had a whole host of styles adopted in its various chapters Weisz tried to capture the same essence in adopting different points of views in this film as well as to lightly touch it with some comedy. But what it had set its sights on is to bring out the pain of having to not grow up with a dad present and to be brought up by a single mom and the struggles one has to experience as an aimless drifter until something clicked and one puts the foot down to embark on a determined change of lifestyle.There were elements that I enjoyed in this film one of which is the parallels drawn between the father and son's lives both seemingly getting from bad to worse with nary a roof over their heads and the dependence on substance abuse as a vice be it the bottle or drugs in the hope that these will help alleviate the severe discomfort brought on by not being able to have ambitions developed and met. Like father like son each of them dreams of making it big one day as a successful writer but like the chip off the old block this potential rarely got realized when their lives continue to be at the doldrums.It provides an inspiration to those of us who deem it impossible to pursue our dreams for a variety of reasons and while it delivers that awkward feeling of having to reconnect with someone related to by blood especially if that's a mom or a dad it pushes anyone caught in similar dilemmas into the same direction of reconciliation for bygones to be bygones and that there's nothing more powerful than having to rediscover relations that once was or even never had begun. Weisz adopted a rather fractured narrative that tells of the present day with Nick and Jonathan's crossing of paths when the latter gets kicked out of his apartment and having to live on and off in the homeless shelter his son volunteers in and interspersed that with Nick's memories of the days being brought up by mom through a series of flashbacks seen through a relatively innocent prism of a young boy growing up in harsh times.Subplots came and went without much fanfare such as Nick's onoff romantic relationship with Denise Olivia Thirlby a coworker at the shelter and we don't really get to know the other coworkers with any depth other than they each come with issues but are volunteering time at the shelter. But there are moments that sneak in to make you pause and take stock about whether similar situations with the homeless do exist in our own country and wonder just what is being done by others as well as ourselves in contributing to make some change for the better whether donation in terms of time or in kind. And not to mention how bullies often target those without support that will make one seethe at the senseless violence dished out.Robert De Niro continues to prove to be a dramatic tour de force in putting up another fine performance as the cranky and what I thought to be proud man who thinks rather highly of his nonexistent talent and subtly shows how Jonathan is actually very proud of the son he should have made contact with many years ago. Paul Dano may have perfected playing laid back characters but perhaps having to act opposite a veteran such as De Niro forced him to up his game as well resulting in a natural chemistry between the two that carried the film from start to end. Recommended with an eclectic soundtrack serving as a bonus.".

	schema:reviewBody "Few films concerning fatherson relationships have been able to produce the emotional impact of this masterfully written and directed and acted BEING FLYNN. Paul Weitz directs and adapted the 2004 memoir by Nick Flynn Another Bullshit Night in Suck City A Memoir and brought together a superlative cast that just may be Robert De Niro's finest hour. Nick Flynn deserves the credit for this articulate tale of his own life he was born and grew up in Scituate Massachusetts south of Boston. His parents divorced when he was young and his mother committed suicide when he was 22. He drifted through several jobs before starting work at a homeless shelter in Boston where at age twentyseven he met his estranged homeless father for the first time. That is the core of the film.The nature of the film works very well we simultaneously meet Jonathan Flynn Robert DeNiro a man who believes he is 'America's greatest writer along side Mark Twain and JD Salinger who lives life day to day in a drunken stupor driving taxis acting out con games etc until he becomes homeless and after seeking shelter from old friends he has neglected he ends up in a homeless shelter. We also meet his estranged son Nick Flynn Paul Dano in a breakout performance who is striving to discover who he is perceiving himself as a writer but unsuccessful with relationships Nick's mother Jody Julianne Moore we see only in flashbacks because she committed suicide and his only communication with his absent father has been through letters. Also homeless Nick moves with with two characters Eddie Rouse and Steve Cirbus who manage to help Nick find a job in a homeless shelter. As Nick adjusts to working at the shelter he comes into connect with a potential girlfriend Denise Olivia Thirlby and begins to feel as though his life has some degree of meaning. The jolt comes when Jonathan seeks shelter in the homeless shelter where Nick works and it is this coming together of two bruised and pained people who happen to be father and son that sets in motion the resolution of the story. Both men are pitiful but both have redeeming characteristics and it is this struggling coming together that makes the film breathe. In addition to the brilliant acting of the main characters there are also exceptionally memorable roles by Lili Taylor Victor Rasuk Thomas Middleditch Wes Studi Chris Chalk and others.Not only is the film pitch perfect in nearly every detail but it also gives the viewer the opportunity to consider the plight of the homeless around us. How many tragic stories like this are untold or never will be known? When a film can produce that degree of involvement with the audience it goes beyond simply being a film and becomes art  art makes us consider think and change. Grady Harp".

	schema:headline " Wonderfully Raw Film That Makes You Feel the Characters";
	schema:reviewBody "Being Flynn 2012  12 out of 4 Touching and mostly depressing film about a young man Paul Dano trying to make his way into life but things change when he sees his father Robert DeNiro staying at the homeless shelter he's working in. The father and son haven't seen each other in nearly twentyyears but soon the son starts to realize that this might have been a good thing. I really wasn't sure what to expect going into BEING FLYNN but I came out extremely impressed and I honestly can't remember the last time I watched a current movie and felt more for the characters involved. Not only do we have the father and son relationship but there's also the flashbacks with the mother Julianne Moore the son's relationship with a coworker Olivia Thirlby and other small characters that we meet. The amazing thing is that the screenplay makes you feel for each of them with all their problems. I think one of the greatest assets is of course the performances with DeNiro leading the way. It seems over the past decade film buffs have complained about the type of roles that the actor has been taken. Of course whenever he does turn in quality work like here or in EVERYBODY'S FINE no one goes and sees the film which is a real shame as both offer the actor at the top of his game. The character he plays here is at times funny at times hateful and there are times where you don't want to see him again. The character is a racist sexist and there's no question that he's a drunk a deadbeat father and a crazy person. The way DeNiro plays all of this is pure perfection and shows that the actor still has that magic. The way DeNiro not only delivers the lines but also watch the small things he does with the look of the character the way he moves and even the expressions he gives. Dano stands right up there with him and the two characters are so different that they're both able to stand strong against each other. I was also impressed with Moore although she doesn't appear in too many scenes. Thirlby is also lovely in her part of the girlfriend and I thought she nearly stole every scene in which she appeared. The appeal of BEING FLYNN is going to be small I mean after all this is a depressing raw and open look at relationships and bad ones at that. The film isn't always easy to watch but the characters are so full and you want to love them so much that it's easy to be drawn into the story. BEING FLYNN is certainly a special little gem and best of all is that it features DeNiro at the top of his game.".

The script does not sugarcoat any aspects of addiction or homelessness. It tells it like it is. The key characters are multidimensional and I found myself rooting for them at times and wanting to kick their butts at other times. Besides the obvious subject matter of addiction and homelessness the film also address the challenges we all have dealing with whether we are or are not our parents  or at least looking at parts of ourselves we don't like that we also don't like in our parents. And the feelings of guilt and shame experience by Nick over the death of his mother are palpable. The only thing I found disconcerting was that fact that it was supposed to be set in Boston and with the exception of one recognizable Boston location it was so obviously filmed in New York.".

	schema:reviewBody "What do you do if both of you are lost and you both wind up in the same place...waiting? Nick Flynn Dano has had a hard life. His father De Niro ran out on him and his mother when he was young and his mother killed herself. Trying to start a new life he moves into a new apartment and takes a job working at a homeless shelter. While working there he sees his long lost father and is not sure how to act. This is a very very good movie. De Niro is trying to go back to acting again instead of playing in movies like Machete and Little Fockers. While he was good in this I never really got into it like I did with old De Niro roles. On the other hand Paul Dano is fantastic in this and in some scenes actually out acts De Niro which is incredible. The movie is a variation on the child feeling abandoned and father trying to explain why he did what he did story but it in no way feels repetitive. Little by little and simultaneously the father and son both hit rock bottom then build themselves back up into the men they want to be and watching two actors of this caliber really makes it fun to watch. I won't give anything away but at the end De Niro keeps repeating the same word and every time he says it it has a different meaning and the movie is worth watching for that one minute scene if nothing else. I highly recommend this movie and I look for Dano to win an Oscar soon. Overall a great movie with great performances and a perfect ending. I give it an A.".

	schema:reviewBody "Im not going to get into the plot because it takes a while to explain and you can already find it in previous reviews done on this film. Anyway Being Flynn is an incredible film. There was honestly not a single thing about this movie that I didn't like. The only reason that I gave it 9 out of 10 stars instead of a 10 is because I think that it may seem a little slow to certain viewers. I am not one of those viewers. First off this is the best acting I have seen from Robert De Niro in a very long time. This film goes up there with his best Taxi Driver Goodfellas Heat etc. The same goes for Paul Dano. His acting in Being Flynn is on par if not better than in There Will Be Blood. I will warn those who are very sensitive you will cry at some point during this film. It is incredibly sad to see the deterioration of Robert De Niro's character. You truly feel for his son Paul Dano and what he is going through with this complete nutcase of a father. Paul Dano's character is treated very similarly in Being Flynn by Robert De Niro as he is in There Will Be Blood by Daniel Day Lewis. I guess he is just an actor we are meant to feel bad for. Anyway I am so glad to see Robert De Niro doing good films again The last one I saw him in was Little Fockers P. It is a shame that most people will not see this movie and because it is an early 2012 release and is a limited release this will get absolutely NO recognition at the Academy Awards.... Robert De Niro and Paul Dano truly both deserve best actor nominations and the movie deserves a best picture nomination. I know it is pretty early in the year to be saying this but this film is going to be damn hard to beat. Go see Being Flynn you wont regret it!".

	schema:headline " Frustrating waste of a great cast";
	schema:reviewBody "The prospect of two actors of this caliber Robert DeNiro and Paul Dano drove me to see this movie last night.

But in the words of REM sometimes you need something more sub sub sub substantial. Both Robert De Niro and Paul Dano give strong performances but I do slightly worry that Paul Dano might keep being typecast as the lost creative sensitive type. It was nice to see De Niro in a noncomedic role which he seems to play recently. And it's a good reminder of here is an actor that can act.Well worth watching in my opinion. Don't expect the movie to be wrapped up nice and neat at the end. I couldn't see how they would be able to do that without resorting to Hollywood clich's. I'm still astounded this is by the same director Paul Weitz who directed the frighteningly bad Little Fockers.".

So basically things seem to have worked out as well as you could hope for these two. And when this comes to an end you are very very grateful for the hopefulness of the ending because  in all honesty  this is for the most part a rather dark and sometimes depressing story.It revolves around the relationship between Jonathon and Nick  an estranged father and son who haven't seen each other for 18 years. Both are struggling. Jonathon lives a fantasy about being a classic American author who's written a classic novel  notwithstanding that no one will publish it. He's an alcoholic taxi driver really and he ends up on the streets after being kicked out of his apartment. There's some play made of him being racist and homophobic but those characteristics really didn't take centre stage for me. He was just difficult. Nick also fancies himself as a writer but he's dealing with a lot of demons from his past  the fact that his father was never present in his life and the fact that his mother played in flashbacks by Julianne Moore committed suicide he thinks because she read an unfinished story about herself that he wrote before he had a chance to add at the end of it how much he loved her and what a good mother she was. He drinks he does drugs but eventually he lands a job at a homeless shelter and  much to his surprise  into the shelter one day walks Jonathon. The story goes from there.While often dark and depressing this is an interesting enough story made even more interesting that it's based on Nick Flynn's actual memoirs. Aside from the fatherson relationship one of the most interesting aspects of it is the depiction of life in a homeless shelter. It also features magnificent performances from Dano and especially from De Niro who proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that he's still got it. His portrayal of the troubled Jonathon was superb.This is dark and depressing at times. But if you can work your way through that it's also a very good movie. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Like many men of his generation Nick Flynn Paul Dano is defined by his relationship or lack thereof with his father Jonathan Robert De Niro. Jonathan is a racist a homophobe and a drunk and he abandoned Nick and his mother Julianne Moore when Nick was only a small boy communicating with his son only through letters. The only bonds these two share are blood and a preoccupation with writing. But despite his disgust for the man Nick never can quite shake the need to live up to his father's image even if that image is completely fabricated. After nearly twenty years of silence Jonathan reaches out to Nick in need of a favor and almost out of curiosity more than anything else Nick lends a hand and suddenly finds himself interacting with a man he both hardly knows and knows all too well. Before long Jonathan has been forced to take up residence in the homeless in which Nick works forcing the younger Flynn to take a long and painful trip down the path to internal peace with both his father and himself.Being Flynn is based on the memoir of the reallife Nick Flynn who worked as a social worker in a Boston homeless shelter in the late '80s where he ended up under the same roof as his father. The tale of the Flynns is a complex one to say the least and it is presented here in a style that pulls no punches. Indeed Being Flynn is much more difficult to watch that I expected going in. Jonathan Flynn is for lack of a better familyfriendly term a miserable old coot a holdover from a different time who has never adjusted to the world around him. On top of his vocal racism and homophobia he is thoroughly arrogant in the worst way possible he's never accomplished anything with his life and yet he expects others to treat him as if he has. In Jonathan's mind there have only been three great American writers and he is one of them despite never having had a work published. Worse yet a life of poor choices and weighty entitlement have only aided in the speed with which his brain is deteriorating leading Jonathan to lash out violently in both word and action. In short he is an impossible character to love and even to feel pity for him proves difficult. In the midst of this stands Nick torn between the childhood need for a father and the adult reason that tells him to kick the man to the curb. He simultaneously hates his father and desires his approval. This dynamic creates a tense painful atmosphere that made it a challenge for me to sit still without squirming. To be honest with you I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.On the one hand it could be argued that director Paul Weitz's goal is to stick the viewer squarely in the middle of the awkward and terse central relationship and force the audience to engage. In this way Being Flynn is a great success. But on the other hand being this close to the fray so to speak also forces the viewer to react to Jonathan in a personal nature. For me this led to the overwhelming feeling that Jonathan would deserve whatever fate befell him and stripped me of any emotional attachment I might have had to his plight. Being Flynn should be relatable to anyone who has ever struggled with his or her relationship with a parent but instead I found myself sympathizing some for Nick and feeling nothing beyond good riddance for Jonathan.That's a shame too because this is without question the most significant role De Niro has taken on in well over a decade. This might be his best performance since 1996's Sleepers and it is a fantastic hopeful sight to see him go back to something worthwhile. Despite nearly 15 years of utter mediocrity I am still of the opinion that when given a reason to invest De Niro is one of the five best actors in the industry only he keeps taking awful role after awful role. He does an excellent job of fully committing to Jonathan creating a memorable character even if it is memorable for being a wretched human. Likewise Dano is very good in his role and brings a lot of realism to the part. In the hands of another director not necessarily better hands just different Being Flynn might have turned into a showcase piece for Dano for which I could see a world in which he would garner award attention. As it is however De Niro overshadows him and perhaps this keeps Dano and Nick from reaching his full potential. Being Flynn is an interesting film and one that is almost as tough to grade as it is to watch. At times it makes a push to point itself toward great but more often than not I felt it floundered despite the best efforts of cast and crew. Please see my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Greetings again from the darkness. Having done no research to determine how closely Nick Flynn's autobiographymemoirs entitled Another Bull Night in Suck City follows his real life it is safe for me to say that there is some pleasure to be had from a movie that lacks the traditional Hollywood ending of redemption for rotten souls. We do know that in real life as in the movie Nick met his longlost father while working at a homeless shelter. This happened after Nick's mother committed suicide.This story will strike a familiar chord with anyone who has experienced abandonment by a parent or two. Hopefully your story doesn't also include the alcohol and drug abuse as well as the guilt of believing you were responsible for the loving parent's suicide. Nick's story does.Nick is played well with an almost detached passive aggressiveness by Paul Dano. He seems constantly numbed by the situation life places him in. Astonishment kicks in when he comes face to face with his father Jonathan a selfproclaimed brilliant writer but also con artist and racist. Jonathan played by Robert DeNiro is first seen as a taxi driver. Yes Robert DeNiro as a taxi driver almost 40 years after his iconic turn in Taxi Driver! It's a startling image for a movie lover but one that doesn't last long. Jonathan loses that job as he has lost everything else.Nick's internal battle is obvious. He doesn't want to be his father but constantly sees glimpses that they are more similar than he would prefer. Nick manages to mess up a good thing with his coworker played by the terrific Olivia Thirlby. She experiences the frustration of trying to save someone who doesn't really want to be saved.Strong support work comes from Wes Studi Dale Dickey William Stadler Lili Taylor Nick Flynn's real life wife and Julianne Moore. Ms. Moore plays Nick's mother but really has little to do. Though she provided a strong foundation for Nick this is really the story of Nick and Jonathan. It's DeNiro's best dramatic work in years and is a reminder that he is capable of more than the Focker movies Paul Weitz actually directed Being Flynn AND Little Fockers as well as About a Boy and American Pie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Greetings again from the darkness. Having done no research to determine how closely Nick Flynn's autobiographymemoirs entitled Another Bull Night in Suck City follows his real life it is safe for me to say that there is some pleasure to be had from a movie that lacks the traditional Hollywood ending of redemption for rotten souls. We do know that in real life as in the movie Nick met his longlost father while working at a homeless shelter. This happened after Nick's mother committed suicide.This story will strike a familiar chord with anyone who has experienced abandonment by a parent or two. Hopefully your story doesn't also include the alcohol and drug abuse as well as the guilt of believing you were responsible for the loving parent's suicide.

	schema:reviewBody "This is like a realistic portrayal of father and son bonding movie. Except it goes a bit too realistic to make it moving or touching for that matter. I mean it's difficult to see how the bonding can be difficult if the father leaves the family for 18yr without any good reason. But there just wasn't enough intimate moments between the father and the son maybe just one scene that stood out. And the father Jonathan FlynnRober De Niro is a conceited and detestable guy he is also a racist. Not a extreme one but still a racist. Anyways he is a failed writer that is fool of himself and has nothing else to do but look down upon society and the people. While his sonPaul Dano who also wants to be a writer has his life spiraling downward because he feels like nothing and because of his past scars. So he decides to work in a homeless shelter where he meets his father. The movie however lacked the bonding elements and just has the two characters having different perspectives and living different lifestyles although they are both struggling. Like how one is a alcoholic and the other a drug addict. Despite their differences there is one intimate moment between them that really stands out. And it's a shame there isn't more of those scenes in this movie. Paul Dano is good but Robert De Niro is magnificent and he pulls off a character that is detestable but you can't have that much hatred for the guy. It's nice to see De Niro at the top of his game again but the movie as a whole just isn't all that good nor does it pull on the heartstrings all that much.610".

However it fell short in more ways than one.The cast was brilliant as Robert de Niro and Paul Dano were both dedicated to their roles and gave their best effort. Unfortunately the characters were difficult to relate to as they continued to make poor decisions without any clear reason as to why they were making those choices. This made them both unlikeable and therefore I began to lose interest rather early on in the outcome of their situation.In addition the plot left me feeling entirely unsatisfied. The development of the story was quite slow and I can't indicate any particular moment that served as a clear turning point. It was as if the viewer was only seeing glimpses but was never provided with the entire picture. Very frustrating indeed.I have no temptation to see this film in the future nor would I recommend it to others. Unless of course you are a diehard Robert de Niro fan who is able to look past the weak plot in order to appreciate his acting.".

	schema:reviewBody "In 'Being Flynn' Robert De Niro plays a taxi driver who resents the world around him. Yes this is a clear reference to 'Taxi Driver' one of De Niro's best films. And no 'Being Flynn' is not in the same league with this masterpiece. But yes De Niro shows in this film that he still is a superb actor. It is somehow fashionable to denounce Robert De Niro as a hasbeen. True he has played some parts that tarnished his reputation based upon his work in the seventies and eighties. But in 'Being Flynn' he does a great job playing a taxi driver who becomes a homeless bum but retains his dignity by convincing himself that he is a great writer. His homeless existence is in fact a blessing because it produces lots of 'material' for his great novel he tells his son who works in the shelter where he spends the night. The confrontation between father and son is the central element in this movie. The son hates his father who left the family and never cared about his child. But at the same time he realizes that he could become just as irresponsible as his father  his life is just as aimless. In the end it all turns out well. Remember this is a Hollywood product. That's also the reason the producers took the regrettable decision to change the title of the film. The book it is based upon is called 'Another Bullsht Night in Suck City' which in my opinion is a truly great title. Just say it aloud a few times. It has a nice rhythm and of course it describes a whole mindset in just a few words. The title 'Being Flynn' is bland dull uninspired and meaningless. Is says a lot about the US that a relatively innocent word like bullsht can't be used for a mainstream film. I have to write an asterisk instead of an i for the same reason. Still there are not many other commercial concessions in this film. There's no sentimentality nor any moral standpoint. It's a wellperformed and efficiently directed fatherson drama with De Niro's great acting as a cherry on the cake.".

	schema:headline " Just getting this one filmed was a huge accomplishment.";
	schema:reviewBody "Friedkin claims this was the toughest film to make of his career and it isn't hard to see why. The balance of this film takes place in some woe begotten Latin American country. You can just feel the poverty and desperation in the air as the only work is for an oil drilling firm who doesn't exactly seem bent on worker safety. The elements are intentionally brutal and they only add to the tension. And thats even before this story really gets going.Early on we are introduced to four characters who are all guilty of doing something terrible in one corner of the world or another. Roughly a half hour into the film all four find themselves in a tiny impoverished Latin American village trying to eek out a living and forget the troubles they left behind. Not only is the local economy weak but the place is socially on the verge of revolution. It's amazing the kind of jobs men will volunteer for to get out of these circumstances. Anyway these four men are given the chance of transporting some highly explosive dynamite through rugged terrain in crappy old trucks so it can be used to put out a massive oil fire some 200 miles away. It is noted by one of the men that more than enough explosives are being transported. Obviously at least one of the trucks is not expected to make it! Not only do you have an explosive cargo with unreliable trucks but also there are armed rebels along the way who probably won't just let you pass right on through. Still the reward for completing this job is just too much to pass on.The film is very very good. In fact the skill that it took to make the film is responsible for most of the stars I'm giving it. The story itself is often just not believable. The journey these four men take is ludicrously perilous. They drive their vehicles over rickety bridges that nobody in real life would have tried to get over in those trucks. Like in other Friedken films no character is completely likable but that only makes it tougher to figure out who will live and who will die. There are a few nice twists here and there right up to the very end to keep you guessing. The acting is exceptional. Scheider was Friedkin's fourth or fifth choice for the main character. Steve McQueen originally wanted it badly but he demanded a part included for then wife Ali McGraw. Friedkin balked at this and then later regretted the decision. He later stated that he never thought Scheider was a good enough leading man. This is an error however. Scheider is a terrific actor and his performance here is outstanding.The film bombed badly at the box office. Heck if you weren't in line to see Star Wars that year you were in line to see Smokey and the Bandit! This is definitely one of Friedkin's best and it has somehow almost been completely forgotten. The film apparently got a PG rating but it is filled with violence and all manner of evil goings on. You'll have to suspend your disbelief for some of the scenes but you'll be glad you did. I'll give it 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.Added Feb 14 2008 RIP Roy Scheider!".

Watching this film it is not only easy to see why the film was both a huge financial and commercial disaster it is downright obvious. This is the most unamerican hollywood commercial film backed by a major studio I have ever seen. It is a tough gruelling 126 minutes that goes nowhere fast yet holds you firm in its tight grip and beats you senseless throughout. I was exhausted when the film finally arrived at it's rather downbeat ending. The multinational cast is faultless. Scheider is magnificent. This is an exceptionally demanding difficult role and he hits it head on creating an antihero who is very very real desperate frightened and desructable. Taking this role at the height of his fame was either very brave or very stupid. I'm going with brave. His performance here is a million miles away from his work on Jaws and Jaws 2 yet equally compelling. The photography is in a league of it's own I only wish the DVD came with an original 2351 print assuming there is one as the current disc is presented in a 43 full frame and the music from Tangerine Dream complements the vision perfectly. This is a brilliant piece of film making from the most daring decade of cinema made by one of cinema's true unpredictable's. Tense dazzling dark and fresh this is an underated film that deserves to be reevaluated.".

When this movie was released there was lines around the block to see it and then in it's second week NOTHING! The movie died a horrible death at the box office and was alway relocated to the Heaven's Gate Orphanage for lost movies. Such a shame. Sorcerer is a mind blowing ride into desperation and horror. The Story is this four men who committed large crimes ranging from Fraud to armed robbery and outright terrorist attacks to cold blooded murder flee to a small south America country once there they struggle to survive. When an oil well explodes and the fire runs out of control the only option is dynamite to cap the well. But the dynamite is old and the nitro is leaking out making transport hard but not impossible. No one wants the job so they recruit 4 men our heroes in an manner of speaking take the job for a incredible amount of money They are given two trucks to repair and overhaul the trucks become main characters as well according to the movie novel they were abandoned army trucks left after WW2 and superstitious natives named them SORCERER and LAZLO . When the trucks are ready the journey itself proves to be the road to hell. one of the most famous scenes is where the Sorcerer truck is trying to cross the swing rope bridge during a harsh storm and the sorcerer almost does not make it that scene in it's entire sequence is a incredible feat of film making. Right to the end the suspense and the fear are kept up and Friedkin a master of this knows how to do this. The Story is excellent so is the acting all of whom should be more then proud to put this film on their resumes. Outstanding work by all.".

As an exercise in pure cinematic storytelling Sorcerer may be the best film of the three Friedkin greats.Structurally similar to the other two of his films and working from a tough barebones Walon Green script Friedkin gives us all the back story we need in the first reel.  Once the characters are brought together in the South American jungle the film grabs you and doesn't let go until the final frame.  The viewing experience is supremely visceral.  You literally feel the tension as the four major characters and their two trucks loaded with nitro encounter and attempt to overcome the elements and some very rough terrain.  Each scene is its own brilliant set piece.  The film would work well as a silent movie but the sound design and Tangerine Dream's musical score in themselves are among the film's towering achievements right along with the direction cinematography and production design.I'm perhaps the only one not put off by the film's allegedly inappropriate title.  On the contrary I think the title adds an element of mystery to the story  as if trouble is being concocted by an unseen force acting upon the film's morally dubious main characters.  It gives a demonic personality to the confluence of fate and dumb luck.  The title also serves to give the film some added distance from the very fine Clouzot original.The performances are all firstrate if economic and Roy Scheider stands out with some real toughguy charisma.  He also gets to wear the coolest hat this side of Gene Hackman's porkpie derby in The French Connection.".

I could speak highly of its qualities for hours cast and crewthe work on the soundthe Tangerine dream's scorethe sequence of the bridgethe surreal atmosphere of the last scenesbut it's already been described in other commentslet's say it's a very specialprecious and unforgettable film to me.Hoping now there will have in next months a beautiful dvd edition like those of to live and die in L.A.and a serious rehearsal.It deserves it.";

	schema:headline " 4 desperate men and two trucks called Sorcerer and Lazaro carrying a cargo of tempestuous explosives.";
	schema:reviewBody "Sorcerer is directed by William Friedkin and adapted to the screen by Waldo Green from Georges Arnaud's novel Le Salaire de la peur The Wages of Fear. It stars Roy Scheider Bruno Cremer Francisco Raba and Amidou. Music is scored by Tangerine Dream and cinematography by John M. Stephens and Dick Bush.It bombed famously at the cinema was a location shoot nightmare with rows aplenty between cast and director and even recently a court case erupted over the film as Friedkin sued Paramount and Universal over ownership of the picture. A film with such a mystical sounding title could it be cursed? All the shenanigans surrounding Sorcerer have sort of had it hovering around the forgotten bin where were it not for the Friedkin purists and 1970s movie aficionados it would have dropped in and had the lid put on it. However if ever a movie from 1977 deserved to be revisited and treated better on home formats then Sorcerer is the one. Where in its complete two hour form plays out as a lesson in skilled story formation letting us know how these guys came to be in the situation they find themselves in which in turn gives way to utter suspense as desperate men fight nature's jungle whilst perched on the precipice of explosive doom.There are a number of factors put forward on why Sorcerer failed at the box office. The title itself is a classic case of misdirection the name given to one of the trucks in the story it conjured up images of mystical and magical dalliances it's safe to say that the film is a million miles away from that sort of genre. It also went up against the box office monster that was Star Wars in comparison and Friedkin readily admits this it's dwarfed in production scope and cross demographic appeal. Then there is the matter of the cut version that did the rounds where almost thirty minutes were chopped to allow more showings in theatres without Friedkin's permission the resulting film was a travesty of Friedkin's vision. Lead man Scheider who is terrific didn't want to promote the film such was his anger at Friedkin cutting a subplot involving his character being shown in a sympathetic light. Have to say the director was right in keeping it grim.Also there's the Clouzot's factor and his version of the Arnaud novel released in 1953. Much beloved by many a critic as some sort of sacred cow of French cinema Clouzot's The Wages of Fear is a very good film but hardly a masterpiece. Looking back at some of the reviews upon Sorcerer's release it seems that some big critics of the day wanted to appear cool by lauding from the roof tops about a foreign movie and how it shouldn't be remade. Weird really since Sorcerer isn't a remake it's an interpretation on Arnaud's source. Inspired by Clouzot? Undoubtedly but it's not remaking his movie. They moaned about the good hour of build up calling it slow but I'm sure I remember it rightly that Clouzot's movie does the same thing and that didn't have Friedkin's fluid camera and Tangerine Dream laying hypnotic synthesisers all over it.Though the current Region 1 DVD of the film is full frame and grainy in print the skill of the director photographer and actors really comes to the fore. Film is often gritty and realistic and playing better now thematically than it did back in the 1970s. The locations are real and you are easily transported into the character's world you feel the danger as nature and human bandits enter the fray as if it wasn't bad enough with the case sensitive explosives in the back! There are risks at almost every turn breath holding the order of the day and the famous bridge scene is as good a sequence as 70s cinema has to offer a logistic nightmare for Friedkin that required take after take to finish. All this only works because we have had the hour of build up previously. True we may hanker for deeper character interaction as they traverse the perilous terrain but this isn't about bonding it's about men risking their lives for freedom and redemption. It beats a black heart and never once cops out. A truly great film crying out to be rediscovered by old and new film lovers alike. 8.510".

	schema:reviewBody "I've not yet seen The Wages Of Fear but I have seed the American B picture remake The Violent Road. That was a good no frills film but Sorcerer is really first rate and shows what can be done by a good director with the budget to use it. A lot of which was spent by hiring a truly international cast to play his four protagonists.The phrase 'international cast' is a rather overused description for a group of players of various backgrounds. But in this film William Friedkin used four players who were top names in the cinema of their respective countries. Roy Scheider Paco Rabal Amidou and Bruno Cresson insured that the various countries they represented would be plunking down their money to see Sorcerer as well as guaranteeing some great performances.These four people who no one would say are the cream of the crop from their society all wind up in exile in a South American jungle working on an oil rig under assumed names. Roy Scheider is a gangster from America on the lam because he pulled the wrong job and shot the priest brother of a Mafioso. Paco Rabal is a contract killer from Spain he might be there looking for Scheider. Bruno Cresson is a French war hero fleeing a banking scandal. And Amidou who is from Morocco is a terrorist the Israelis want real bad.There's an oil fire that's threatening to burn over the jungle and the only available explosives to use to blow it out is some really unstable nitroglycerin which has to be transported 200 miles on some bad roads and other hazardous conditions. So four guys who really have nothing to lose volunteer to drive the stuff in two trucks.William Friedkin made some great use of the location cinematography in the Dominican Republic to show what the great risks these guys are taking. You feel yourself riding shotgun with all of them on the trip.As it happened I took a vacation in Spain in 2001 and when I got there the Spanish media was full of news of the death of Paco Rabal on a flight from Montreal to Madrid. You would have thought the head of state had passed away he was that idolized by the people there. He and Roy Scheider played well off each other their scenes are the best in the film.Sorcerer is destined to be one eternal classic over the years don't miss it if broadcast or better revived on the big screen.".

The premise is brilliant. Four men on the run with lives each flushed down the hopper united in some mad and dangerous journey.Set up.An oil rig has blown in some forsaken hole in South America under some generic dictatorship. The rig is burning and they need to blast it out as soon as possible.Problem The only cache of explosives big enough to do the job were kept 218 miles away and they weren't stored properly. Dynamite sticks need to be turned every so often in storage or else the nitroglycerin bleeds out the bottom and pools at the bottom of the stack. This makes it incredibly unstable and ready to blow.Solution Drive two trucks through the most treacherous and insanely difficult terrain to get the really unstable explosives from point A to point B 218 miles away. Offer a truckload of money and find four men desperate enough to do it. Our heroes men on the run with nothing to lose and little to live for who just happen to also be crack mechanics and damn good truck drivers. They're using two trucks because odds are one wont make it. They're actually carrying six times as much explosive as they need to do the job.So after a brief road test to see who can do the job they turn the men loose. And what you get in my opinion is some of the most insanely dangerous and brilliantly filmed sequences ever captured on film. This movie rocked. In this film is a moment that is on the top of my top ten list of most amazing moments captured on film. It's when the second truck a 10 ton rig tries to cross a rickety swaying bridge that isn't fit to hold up an anemic mule. The guide is hanging on for dear life waving the truck forward there's a torrential downpour hammering down there's a flooding river beneath them and this truck just teetering on the edge of flipping over making its way across. Not one lick of computer animation in it and it totally kicks the butt of anything captured on modern film.

	schema:headline " No One Is Just Anything.";
	schema:reviewBody "Sorcerer's keynote is epitomized early on when introducing Bruno Cremer's wealthy character living an ivory tower existence with no reason yet to feel insecure about much. His wife reads to him a war article. He comments Just another soldier. She replies No one is just anything. Indeed in William Friedkin's merciless adventures heroic characters tend to be defined by any and everything contemptible villains are unknowable the lines between them are exceedingly vagueand arbitrary. The French Connection manversusman. The Exorcist manversusunexplained. With Sorcerer manversuschance an indefinable undetected competitor. The realm of Friedkin's visualization is a perilous brutal ethically insolvent one where there bluntly is no God just randomness meaninglessness pure survival.Unlike Clouzot's incredible original film Friedkin doesn't allow for easy identification with any of the central figures and despite Roy Scheider's impressively physical central performance it remains emotionally aloof. But that doesn't matter. Seeing each man's prior exploits tells so much voyeuristically about their behavior when they happen upon each other in the thirsty alien setting where they're all out of their elements. We also see how regular joes can be monsters.Also throughout their respective prefaces Friedkin foretells the boiling dangers awaiting our scandalous foursome with sardonic counterpoint. Francisco Rabal abandons the hotel in a wroughtiron elevator decorated green as are the hotel walls. As Amidou and his coconspirators plan their getaway they hurriedly study a map. When he chooses the long way the suggestion's far more poignant than he realizes. It's also in the early New Jersey fastsketch that Friedkin's murky jesting emerges In a church cellar various priests calculate thousands of dollars wearing visors more like bookies than Christ's followes. Armed robbers break in. At the wedding upstairs the ceremony's priest declares Christ abundantly blesses this love. Back to the basement as dollars gush from canvas bags robbers jam their pouches. Upstairs You've strengthened your consent before the Church. Friedkin pushes into bride and groom. The bride has a black eye.In a Paris caf comprising closeups of enticing culinary delights Cremer his wife and their friend babble about substandard lobster in humid South American waters while Cremer merely halflistens. The truck Scheider runs into has a Meridian Freight insignia. Friedkin's pessimistic joking could be doubled here Scheider zigzags off a meridian in a manufacturing district a massive water tower dwarfing everything else. He'll eventually find himself in a manufacturing gutter of the world. During his getaway he passes big color signs promoting things he won't see have or enjoy again.A handful of exiles and fugitives from starkly different backgrounds cultures nationalities are driven by desperation to go into hiding working in an obscure oil drilling operation in South America. When fire breaks out of control they each seize a chance to earn enough money to escape their hellholes earn citizenship feel as if they might restore honor by transporting crates of unstable dynamite through miles of perilous jungle in rusty rickety old trucks. But this dynamite negligently stored literally oozes nitro. Any shock any vibration they detonate. Somehow driving in pairs these men must carry their cargo past a crumbling ropesuspension bridge swinging ferociously in a savage storm over a floodheaving river a colossal tree blocking the road and a flock of forlorn vicious bandits.The cash sum being rewarded to the drivers is erratic all through the film. The oil company first says they will pay 8000 pesos to each driver. Later the demand doubles. Later one boasts that he and another one will get double shares of 20000 each. By the end a check reads 40000 pesos which would be just 10000 each. This seems like one of Friedkin's sadistic impositions of his thematic intentions. We're drawn into circumstances so desperate so reckless any amount sounds beautiful any amount will do then eventually returning to any semblance of relatable civilization is all that matters.Friedkin and screenwriter Walon Green strip the source story's existential themes to the core. Driven by a series of striking images it ultimately goes one step further than Clouzot by suggesting that humankind is subject not only to the vagaries of fate and nature but to its own vengeful venal essence. What's so enrapturing about Sorcerer is that the needs and situations that occur one after another are so primal these characters are hairpin turns between murderously divided and collaborating with implicit trust. Friedkin exemplifies the seduction of voyeurism in the very close detailed but utterly omniscient way we follow each unrelated character to this godforsaken place where they know absolutely nothing of each other but we've seen them all in their respective realms of normalcy the shameful predicaments that got them here. But just as well we're ever so subtly implicated in the vengeful venal not in what we see but what we find ourselves expecting. Take for example the riot that erupts in the street after the oil explosion. The townspeople are violent frenzied relentless but Friedkin leaves out the authorities' retaliation. And we expect itindeed we begin to want it relate to it. It's a disturbing feeling.Friedkin loves to show mechanisms the down and dirty way things work as in the montage with minorkey synth music showing the ragtag bunch preparing trucks. It makes us that much more conscious of the threadbare fragility of the utterly extraordinary ensuing action sequences most notably the hazardous rainstorm crossing of the fragile ropebridge. No matter how much these men exert themselves to cover every corner suspect everyone spot every detail do whatever they can to ensure their survival they never have any control over their own fates not how they got into this mess or how or if they get out of it. They don't all speak the same language none of them trust or even understand one another or even use their real names. Even if they do succeed or some or none they have about as much control over their deaths as they do their births.".

	onyx:emotionText "Sorcerer's keynote is epitomized early on when introducing Bruno Cremer's wealthy character living an ivory tower existence with no reason yet to feel insecure about much. His wife reads to him a war article. He comments Just another soldier. She replies No one is just anything. Indeed in William Friedkin's merciless adventures heroic characters tend to be defined by any and everything contemptible villains are unknowable the lines between them are exceedingly vagueand arbitrary. The French Connection manversusman. The Exorcist manversusunexplained. With Sorcerer manversuschance an indefinable undetected competitor. The realm of Friedkin's visualization is a perilous brutal ethically insolvent one where there bluntly is no God just randomness meaninglessness pure survival.Unlike Clouzot's incredible original film Friedkin doesn't allow for easy identification with any of the central figures and despite Roy Scheider's impressively physical central performance it remains emotionally aloof. But that doesn't matter. Seeing each man's prior exploits tells so much voyeuristically about their behavior when they happen upon each other in the thirsty alien setting where they're all out of their elements. We also see how regular joes can be monsters.Also throughout their respective prefaces Friedkin foretells the boiling dangers awaiting our scandalous foursome with sardonic counterpoint. Francisco Rabal abandons the hotel in a wroughtiron elevator decorated green as are the hotel walls. As Amidou and his coconspirators plan their getaway they hurriedly study a map. When he chooses the long way the suggestion's far more poignant than he realizes. It's also in the early New Jersey fastsketch that Friedkin's murky jesting emerges In a church cellar various priests calculate thousands of dollars wearing visors more like bookies than Christ's followes. Armed robbers break in. At the wedding upstairs the ceremony's priest declares Christ abundantly blesses this love. Back to the basement as dollars gush from canvas bags robbers jam their pouches. Upstairs You've strengthened your consent before the Church. Friedkin pushes into bride and groom. The bride has a black eye.In a Paris caf comprising closeups of enticing culinary delights Cremer his wife and their friend babble about substandard lobster in humid South American waters while Cremer merely halflistens. The truck Scheider runs into has a Meridian Freight insignia. Friedkin's pessimistic joking could be doubled here Scheider zigzags off a meridian in a manufacturing district a massive water tower dwarfing everything else. He'll eventually find himself in a manufacturing gutter of the world. During his getaway he passes big color signs promoting things he won't see have or enjoy again.A handful of exiles and fugitives from starkly different backgrounds cultures nationalities are driven by desperation to go into hiding working in an obscure oil drilling operation in South America. When fire breaks out of control they each seize a chance to earn enough money to escape their hellholes earn citizenship feel as if they might restore honor by transporting crates of unstable dynamite through miles of perilous jungle in rusty rickety old trucks. But this dynamite negligently stored literally oozes nitro. Any shock any vibration they detonate. Somehow driving in pairs these men must carry their cargo past a crumbling ropesuspension bridge swinging ferociously in a savage storm over a floodheaving river a colossal tree blocking the road and a flock of forlorn vicious bandits.The cash sum being rewarded to the drivers is erratic all through the film. The oil company first says they will pay 8000 pesos to each driver. Later the demand doubles. Later one boasts that he and another one will get double shares of 20000 each. By the end a check reads 40000 pesos which would be just 10000 each. This seems like one of Friedkin's sadistic impositions of his thematic intentions. We're drawn into circumstances so desperate so reckless any amount sounds beautiful any amount will do then eventually returning to any semblance of relatable civilization is all that matters.Friedkin and screenwriter Walon Green strip the source story's existential themes to the core. Driven by a series of striking images it ultimately goes one step further than Clouzot by suggesting that humankind is subject not only to the vagaries of fate and nature but to its own vengeful venal essence. What's so enrapturing about Sorcerer is that the needs and situations that occur one after another are so primal these characters are hairpin turns between murderously divided and collaborating with implicit trust.

	schema:reviewBody "An unfortunate circumstance slipped Sorcerer into the ether. And that circumstance was Star Wars. They were released at the same time and any film up against the Wars of the Stars was dwarfed in comparison. It's terribly unfair as Lucas' success consequently became Friedkin's downfall. Sorcerer is a very good film a great one in fact. Based upon the same book as the classic French film The Wages of Fear it's material worth repeating in the perpetually sweaty grit of the 70s. The problem with Wages is that it spent an unnecessary hour and a half on setup. Sorcerer is a bit better spending an hour instead but it's much leaner and doesn't waste time. Opening with quick engaging vignettes I can see how a viewer who wasn't aware of their appearance would feel alienated. They're not exactly necessary but it opens up the world of Sorcerer in a way that it wouldn't do otherwise. It's thanks to its dynamic editing super quick and super sharp all the time while holding onto the tension.As a result the film is like the most thrilling parts of The French Connection put into one volatile barrel. It's a shame that Friedkin doesn't like working with Roy Scheider in hindsight considering he got him an Oscar nomination for Connection but I'm a big fan of him. He's a great leading man in All That Jazz for example. Here the cast do struggle to stand out and make their mark but that's because the material doesn't lend itself to personalities and inner struggle. They're best used metaphorically which Sorcerer doesn't do overtly. Instead the joy is watching the men's resourcefulness especially in a sequence where a big trunk is in the way or the nailbiting bridge scene. What stands out is the remarkable sound design that makes every crunch feel lifethreatening. It's a shame the score by Tangerine Dream is so dated even if it was celebrated at the time. Works at times doesn't at others. Sorcerer is a rough around the edges movie but a thrilling ride nevertheless.810".

It builds slowly even a little bit too slowly at the beginning but it serves a greater good this way it could catch our attention and pulls us to the world of the story.Furthermore Sorcerer was still a part of the Hollywood Renaissance movement so it is very ambiguous movie. It criticizes the society of the 70s. It represents Americans and Europeans as filthy outcasts who see the Third World only as the source of money and power. And Sorcerer sentences this attitude to death. Therefore it is no wonder that the audience of the forced optimism of the late 70s did not like this perspective. They wanted to forget the traumas of the past. They wanted an other Galaxy instead of the mud of the rain forests. They wanted Star Wars instead of Sorcerer. Fortunately real film fans could enjoy Friedkin's achievement in spite of its box office failure.".

Seen on a big screen and in proper widescreen SORCERER was a gripping revelation. Thoughts of scenes and images lifted into the MAD MAXs and APOCALYPSE NOW also became noticed. However it is the utter reality of the filming location and the overwhelming nightmare concept and visuals of the truck trek through the hell of the wet jungle climaxing in the most startling stunt work on a suspension bridge with both trucks creaking they way across rotten logs with a torrent river below that literally had grown men in the audience gasping in sheer horror. This is a monumental film and I can see why it cost 22m. Roy Schieder proves again why he was a great and reliable actor. If you can see SORCERER as a film in cinema you will appreciate it's full scope. Outrageously and insulting is the DVD which is a square screen cropping and should be binned until the blu ray comes out in full terror splendour.".

	schema:headline " A harrowing documentarylike thriller and one of the 70's lost masterpieces ...";
	schema:reviewBody "When I learned that The Wages of Fear had inspired a remake my immediate reaction was 'Why'? Remaking a popular and universally acclaimed classic such as HenriGeorge Clouzot's masterpiece sounded as blasphemous as the idea of remaking Gone With the Wind or The Godfather. You simply can't touch movies that already achieved a certain level of cinematic greatness. But that was an immediate reaction  My interest toward Sorcerer increased I found out that the movie made Roger Ebert's Top 10 great lists of 1977 an interesting endorsement. The casting of Roy Sheider spoke also in favor of the film not only for my deep appreciation of this actor but also because his name is associated with some of the greatest thrillers of the 1970's  Marathon Man Jaws and of course The French Connection which has another name in common with Sorcerer  William Friedkin.We all are familiar with the plot of The Wages of Fear four men recruited for a suicide mission to drive two trucks full of nitroglycerin over mountain roads. Any bump and the truck explode with no warning and the four men must deal with natural and psychological obstacles with nerves of steel. The film was simply one of the most suspenseful movies ever. So who else than the same filmmaker who directed the chase sequence in The French Connection or the psychological thrills of The Exorcist could have handled the story with the same if not better level of intensity? So I finally discovered Sorcerer  And all I can say is that William Friedkin proved again his masterful talent to accentuate the tension and the sense of pressure with a gripping documentarylike realism that almost surpassed the original. I almost blamed some parts for having indirectly pointed out minor flaws from the original film. Indeed while The Wages of Fears had the entertainment value of a great adventure film Sorcerer made me touch the dirt smell the grease or feel the humidity in the Nicaraguan tropical jungle and on these men's boiling foreheads.I was positively surprised by the deliberate distance taken from the original with never betraying the core of the film. The four protagonists are all criminal running from the law and outcasts in their respective countries as the only reason that could justify their motivations to move on in such a hostile setting. In a long almost halfanhour sequence we're introduced to each one of them. The SouthAmerican Nilo Francisco Rabal the Arab terrorist Kassem aka Martinez Amidou a rich French businessman accused of fraud Victor Manzon aka Martinez Bruno Cremer and a mob killer Jackie Scanlon aka Juan Dominguez Roy Sheider From Paris to New Jersey with a detour to Jerusalem the movie shows the characters' backgrounds providing an international feel to better underline the deadend aspect of the location they will all end up. It's a very significant change from the original film as it respects our intelligence enough not to throw borderline stereotypes in our faces and make their flaws more understandable and the eventuality of their death more poignant. The movie avoids any kind of cinematic clich including the waitress character that's physically far from the glamorous Vera Clouzot but her relationship with Scanlon provides a genuine oasis of tenderness in a rather harrowing film.The movie gets even deeper by explaining how the explosive liquid was in fact dynamite badly conserved which transformed it into 'sweating nitro'  what's the purpose of such subtleties? I think this the kind of details that make the difference never taking anything for granted just because the material worked before. Thoughtfully dedicated to Clouzot I will never go as far as saying that the movie is better than the original version but it does create an atmosphere that exclusively belongs to it an atmosphere embodied by the electronic score of Tangerine dream that captures the thrilling vibes of the late 70's.Among the uniquely memorable scenes of the film there is the cult moment when they drive the truck on the suspended rope bridge. This is filmmaking at its best you must see it to believe it and I couldn't believe a few people only experienced that in a theater. The special effects the editing the direction everything is perfect and when you have this big truck that can't go back driving on a swaying bridge under a violent wind and a pouring rain if ever there was a Top 10 most nightmarish situation from a movie I would include this one.The nightmarish feel increase as the elements and fate never cease to harass these men descending them into a level of madness highlighted by the existential realization of their missions' innate futility where there's more than a reward to gain there's also honor and dignity. More than a remake Sorcerer is an extraordinary work of art and I can't believe its astounding sequences didn't earn it more than a lousy Oscar nomination for Best Sound.Now why isn't the movie more famous or appreciated  I considered the answer might come from the release's year and my suspicion was confirmed. The movie opened just after a certain movie named Star Wars  and besides that cruel irony of fate the movie suffered from a particularly misleading title. I'm among those who believe the title was wrong. Seriously just ask yourself what you would expect from a movie named Sorcerer released by the guy who made the Exorcist? You know what the title in French is The Convoy of Death how cool and relevant does that sound? Or what if the title was simply The Wages of Fear? If one thing it would have at least avoided a misinterpretation as there's absolutely no supernatural elements in that film!Mystery it's as if the movie was victim of its own sorcery ".

But upon closer inspection this movie is almost like a minor horror movie somewhat reminding one of The Sixth Sense with its twisted vision of a man in hell. If one were to pay close attention to several scenes in the film one would come away thinking that the main character played by Roy Scheider has literally died and went to hell. From the beginning when he is involved in a car crash what follows is a subtle yet highly symbolic underlying theme of a man who is on a journey to the devils domain. COnsider the car crash was Roy Scheider the only survivor or was he indeed dead perhaps a ghost. Consider the group that he was forced to join on their suicide mission an assassin a terrorist a swindler and a gangster all headed for the fall and a trip to hell for their bad deeds. Consider the burning fires of the oil factory this is where they are headed the fires are symbolic of hell itself. Consider the crossing of the bridge in the storm. The sound of that terrifying wailing wind the demon wind could that have been the entrance the gates to hell itself there are so many slight references to the idea that this is more then what it seems. In a nutshell Sorcerer is simply brilliant the kind of movie that they just do not make anymore.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the world of crime there are many things a criminal could do to have someone seek revenge. If one chooses to go ahead with the crime without regards to the outcome then it is said the devil will have his revenge in due time. The author of the book George Arnaud  Wages of Fear  said as much in his original work. If you read the novel you begin to realize there are a couple of organizations in the real world who might have been created by the devil. The two are The Mob and the second is the F.B.I. With the help of InterPol International Police anyone who makes their most wanted list will never be able to hide anywhere in the world. The second and more sinister organization is The Mafia. Commit a crime against them and its said 'you can run but you cannot hide' from them. This basis is the foundation of the film  Sorcerer . Although the first choice of star for the film was the Late Steve McQueen the second choice of Roy Scheider as Jackie Scanlon was fated to be just as good. The rest of the cast Bruno Cremer as Victor Manzon Francisco Rabal as Nilo and Amidou as Kassem all join in to create a feature film of superb quality. Each man is someone else when an oil company reaches into the heart of the Amazon seeking desperate men for an extremely hazardous job of trucking a cargo of sensitive and unstable Nitro over rugged mountains treacherous bridges and monsoon jungles. The men hired are hiding and on the run but each seek redemption through wealth if they live. The hand of fate had left them in obscurity but the film alludes to what length it will go to remind them of their destiny. An excellent job by director William Friedkin as he offers this movie to anyone seeking a dramatic classic. ".

The four prologues of the men are confusing at first because viewers aren't sure of the common thread binding them together until well into the film.

Directorproducer Friedkin utilizes all the classic conflicts man vs. himself man vs. man man vs. nature man vs. machine and man vs. fate. The film moves incredibly fast for one that clocks in at just over two hours with jawdropping scenes prompting viewers to wonder aloud how certain scenes were possibly filmed. The film received an Oscar nomination for best sound losing to a film entitled Star Wars. Also the film bombed at the box office due to its release during the Star Wars phenomenon. Walon Green wrote the screenplay based on Georges Arnaud's novel. It remains one of Friedkin's best films and his personal favorite due to its nailbiting tension and lack of lulls.  of 4 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Koyannisqatsi wasn't a copy of anything so why would anyone expect Powaqqatsi to be a copy of it? Fortunately I saw this film on the big screen without seeing its predecessor and I was delighted. The movie begins with a shot of an African diamond mine. You see a miner ascending a ladder in slowmotion carrying a bag of mud on shoulders accompanied by a heavy pounding music. The effects and the music work together to highlight the miner's tiredness and strain. Other images follow most of them from the third world. In each case the focus is not a thing but a quality.Powaqqatsi revolutionized my concept of the world  Go ahead and laugh! The film shows a vastness and variety and energy in the world that was beyond anything I could have imagined when I went into the theater. Everything is presented for what it is there's no Western narrator to reassure you and tell you what everything means. There is perhaps no higher praise for a film than saying it changed the way I think and Powaqqatsi deserves that praise.".

	schema:headline " A Worthy Continuation of Reggio's Vision";
	schema:reviewBody "Don't worry no spoilers here. I felt the need to rebut several of the negative reviews I have read about this film  both here and most notably from critics Maltin and Ebert. This film follows a totally different concept from Koyaanisqatsi which concentrated on largely inanimate structures in the continental U.S. This is a film about people and lifestyles of the developing world and for that I believe Reggio chose wisely not to utilize many specialty visual techniques i.e. timelapse and highspeed photography and settle for a more lowkey approach. Though the film cannot match the visceral geewhiz impact the original 1983 audience must have felt with all the revolutionary visual stylistics of Koyaanisqatsi Powaqqatsi has greater thematic depth. Essentially Koyaanisqatsi was best at impressing the audience and this film is better at making the audience think. To tackle such a wideranging subject as globalization is a tricky task yet I believe this film to be the best cinematic portrayal I have seen of the effects of modernity upon the 75 of the world that still lives much of its life the same way it did hundreds of years ago.All of the shots of people working carrying baskets on their heads etc. show the immense effort required in the third world to carry on an industrial revolution one hundred years behind the West and in a much shorter span of time. Essentially the societies in the Periphery are being forced to play catchup. The imagery of the fallen laborer being carried up a hill the opening shots of the film which are later referenced at the end represents the immense hard work and sacrifice necessary to build a modern society  an idea lost upon many in the First World who protest the working conditions of societies on the Periphery yet do not realize that their own Western industrial revolutions faced the exact same hazards tribulations and hardships one hundred years ago  yet did eventually manage to emerge successfully. Like Koyaanisqatsi Powaqqatsi is a film one can view multiple times and absorb new meanings upon each viewing.The structure of the film is the same as that of Koyaanisqatsi which I believe is the most important consistency between this film and the first in Reggio's trilogy. Both films are divided into three distinct sections primitivearchaic life early industrial life and finally fullfledged modern existence lifestyle or qatsi being the connecting thread within and between the films. In addition Philip Glass score is a superb accompaniment to the visual images. Otherwise the films are not at all alike and should not be unduly compared to one another. Both films show their American audience something they have not seen before in Koyaanisqatsi it is simply themselves from a very different angle and in Powaqqatsi it is the rest of the world.".

	schema:reviewBody "My first impression agreed with the post above but it grows on you. Here are some reasons why.Koyaanisqatsi was made by Americans about America for Americans. The image style and content and the soundtrack turn it up even better by the 1998 rerecorded soundtrack and turn it up are all familiar to American eyes and ears.Poyaanisqatsi was made by a mixed team of nationalities about the countries of the Southern hemisphere. It goes places where we do not usually go we face the unfamiliar. The soundtrack does the same thing. It uses rhythmical and melodic styles from the countries visited once again unfamiliar to our American eyes and ears.I enjoy Koyaanisqatsi for the awesome imagery including time scale effects a nd the unusual view it presents to us of what we live in everyday. Both movies use picture with music but no words. The creators intended it to carry a message but left it to the viewer to create it. Here's a single example from the opening of K. The visual shows the beginning of man's journey from Earth to moon and the camera is put where we can see the rocket engines come to life close up. The soundtrack is completely contrary to the obvious visual idea. Instead of trumpet fanfares and explosions of sound we strain to hear deep solo voices chanting the title of the movie over and over as the dramatic rocket launch visual is slowed down so that 3 seconds ocupies 3 minutes. The result is a strange contrast between sound and vision which stands apart from conventional ideas. AS the rocket trembles in a shower of ice we are invited to ponder all the meanings that this event might possess and the space and time provided for our imagination to operate inside encourage the same contrary thoughts. The time distortion means that we no longer experience the explosive impulse created by man's mastery of metal electricity and chemicals and let loose in a mighty roar when the clock counts ZERO.Here there is no clock the deep voice marks the passage of time and the picture we see is of some machine never seen before that can rise gently up into the air to the sound of chanting. Poyaanisqatsi explores the more ancient ways still existing outdoor manual labor rather than factories seasonal activities self sufficiency by sailing fishing digging plowing reaping and grinding the crop on small scales.Less time is given over to time compression which was a strong feature of Koy'si. More time is given to time expansion slowmotion cinematography and multiple exposure process. We spend time with the camera close up with people individuality begins to become important as we are able to disriminate groups and individuals within groups. The second half of 'P'begins to include material that may have a direct distressing affect on the viewer perhaps only an uncomfortable feeling at first which in my experience with repeated viewing becomes stronger. There are a handful of moving images that for me have become outright disturbing and more so each time I see them. There is sense of something dreadfully wrong going on that we know about but are helpless and unable to name it and abolish it. If anything the soundtrack of 'P' is superior to 'K' but again upon repeated listening. There is a piece of singing at about 80 mins that is in Muslim religious style and which blew my socks off with the combination of vocal strength and clarity subtlety of melody subtlety of rythmyic phrasing and powerful capability to attract attention. I have no hesitation recommending 'K' to anyone including children. 'P' is more difficult by the end you have seen some uncomfortable truths about the poor quality of life affecting a large proportion of the world population. How comfortable can we be on our sofas watching this tale be told to us?".

	schema:reviewBody "Last week I watched for the firs time Qatsi trilogy which includes the films Koyaanisqatsi Powaqqatsi and Naqoyqatsi. All of the film titles are taken from the Hopi language Koyaanisquatsi meaning life out of balance Powaqqatsi  life in transformation and Naqoyqatsi  life as war.The films were made by Godfrey Reggio and the music score which plays as important role as the images do was written by Philipp Glass.The films have no spoken dialog or plot and have to be experienced viscerally first and then analyzed because everyone sees different in them. For some viewers  they are glorified long music videos for the others  the revelation that may change the way we perceive ourselves as human kind and our place on Earth.As for me personally I realized that the collaboration between Reggio and Glass may be one of the best creative unions between a visionary director and a brilliant composer ever.Of three Qatsi movies my favorite is certainly Powaqqatsi and I know I'll come back to it many times more until my last day because it is not just a gorgeous movie with amazing images it is one of very precious experiences that happen rarely in life. What made this experience possible is above all and without doubt the MUSIC. It was not the first music by Philip Glass I heard. I like his minimalistic and somehow disturbing scores that go right to your senses for The Hours Notes of the Scandal and The Illusionist 2006. Powaqqatsi was the second movie in Reggio's Qatsi trilogy for me. Just before it I saw Koyaanisqatsi 1982 or Life out of Balance the first of three ReggioGlass movies. I like Koyaanisqatsi very much but I think it is the images that make it so memorable. Powaqqatsi for me is about Glass's magnificent unearthy divine and literally uplifting and transcending score. It is the music that could've been played after God had finished his work of creation and looked down at Earth and saw that it was good. I am a music lover and I love music of different genres epochs and cultures. I enjoy listening to Mozart and Beatles Nino Rota and Metallica Zamphir and Scott Joplin Bob Dylan and Lucianno Pavarotti Bach and Edith Piaf. I love them all but I don't recall ever being so moved and taken out of this reality feeling happy and overwhelmed proud to be able to witness and enjoy the incredible achievement of human creativity and genius as when I was watching and listening to three Anthems and Mosque and Temple scenes of Powwaqatsi Life in Transformation. I don't buy the DVDs very often I am not a collector but when the movie leaves unforgettable impression when it brings something amazing into my life I have to have it. I already ordered and received both Koyaanisqatsi and Powwaqatsi on DVDs and I keep rewatching my favorite scenes and the music has the same impact at me making tears of joy coming to my eyes every time I hear the majestic hypnotic triumphant sounds of music written by Phillip Glass.I would like to add the words of one of my favorite writers. They match perfectly the feelings and emotions the film has evoked in me Mother Earth. She lived this world of trees and rivers and rocks with deep stone thoughts. She breathed had feelings dreamed dreams gave birth laughed and grew contemplative for millennia. This great creature swimming in the sea of space. What a wonder thought the man for he had never understood that the Earth was his mother before this. He had never understood before this that the Earth had a life of its own at once part of mankind and quite separated from mankind another with a life of her own. Harlan Ellison The Deathbird".

Some of the Powaqqatsi scenes are simply breathtaking.

As much as I admired the latter it did concentrate on the 'lifeoutofbalance' scene in USA to the exclusion of the bulk of the world's population.Powaqqatsi redresses that imbalance...and adds the second chapter in this trilogy.First a few words about the music a choral and orchestral mix that is simply spinechilling and transcendental at the same time a thematic tourdeforce that celebrates the almost tireless strength and perseverance of today's preindustrial world which encompasses South America Africa India and China. It's worth seeing this film just to listen to that music in my opinion.The visual however is just as compelling beginning  and briefly ending  with scenes from an earthly hell the gold mines at Serra Pelada  Bald Mountain  somewhere in Brazil where the workers march to the lure of riches accompanied by staccato tomtoms to carry bags of goldflecked earth to the top of a ridge for collection. This is work at its meanest... and often most grueling as shown by two men bearing a stricken worker on their backs to the top.But it's not all bad. Sparkling images of boats on the sea glistening sunlight shimmering a lone eagle silhouetted against an evening sun masses of people celebrating in dance reflections in water of people walking an amazing shot of a tree reflected in water...All of which segues into the modern accoutrements that enhance and yet which begin the process of enslavement to the god of consumerism trains in motion videos on TV the crowded commercial areas in China Africa and India watching a cricket game no less industrial smog garbage dumps bizarre bazaars international trade commuter trains and boats staggering under the load of humanity that joins the daily rush rush rush...except for one little girl who stops and stares at the camera for the longest time watching thinking wondering...You could argue I suppose that the negative side of industrial development is overdone I'm sure many would see this film in that regard. However considering the time that this film was made  twenty years ago  I tend to think that the negativity is appropriate because much is now worse particularly in China and India where unchecked development is  literally  a smoking time bomb of industrial pollution.Powaqqatsi's message about life on earth going the wrong way is spot on from the despair in the eyes of workers as they grind away at their wheels or machines to somber children facing the camera to once again the symbolically crucified worker on the backs of his coworkers at Serra Pelada every person who sees this must pause and reflect upon themselves and their purpose on this earth however imperfectly just as those who in the final scene often see themselves reflected in shimmering water  but ever moving walking jostling forward to we all hope better times and bigger rewards.At the end of this film the viewer learns that powaqqatsi is formed by the combination of two Hopi Indian words 'powaq' meaning 'sorcerer' and 'qatsi' meaning 'life'. Thus  life sorcerer one who has power over life and death.Was it Pogo who said I have seen the enemy and they is us? See this movie and answer for yourself.".

I saw neither of these in this film and would caution others to beware the advertising. Powaqqatsi is a visual feast of scenes of variegated humanity and sweeping cultures stitched together to show the people's of the world their work and their works set to powerful orchestration with no narration whatsoever. Just film and music with a strong aesthetic appeal and a very nebulous message. If you're expecting a documentary about globalization as was I you'll likely be disappointed.

	schema:reviewBody "Powaqqatsi is the second picture in filmmaker Godfrey Reggios' ...Qatsi trilogy a series of features that basically meld visuals and music without resorting to a conventional narrative. This one has a message clearly stated throughout about the cost of progress. Its first half shows us different rural cultures all over the world from Nepal to India to Kenya etc. and derives a great deal of impact from giving us a portrait of good oldfashioned honest hard work as well as displaying a cornucopia of beautiful images. The heartfelt music score is once again the work of Philip Glass and it supplements the images wonderfully although it can be repetitive.Where the picture becomes a little less interesting is in the next 25 minutes or so when we're confronted with the sights and sounds of the urban jungle in which many of us exist. Among the visuals utilized during this portion are those things that we all experience everyday advertising newscasts and the like. But it all comes together in the final quarter where we see that progress does come at its price that it can lead to loss of identity and be built on the backs of others.All done without the use of a narrator this is documentarystyle filmmaking of a different variety. It does force one to stop and think about the world we live in and about all the things that many of us take for granted.This viewer went in blind to this picture without having seen Koyaanisqatsi the previous film in this trilogy. And one doesn't have to have done so. The material has a compelling nature regardless.The title is a Hopi word explained at the conclusion before the end credits. It means a life form that consumes other life forms in order to extend its own existence. That pretty much sums up the whole theme of the film right there.One of the most highbrow projects that the legendary GolanGlobus team of Cannon Group fame ever made.Seven out of 10.".

None of the chilling selfawareness or mathematical beauty the original evoked is even approached there is mostly a tinted assembly of stereotypes very much concieved from a NorthernWestern perspective.The objective alien assault on the familiar that was so shocking when trying to absorb Koyaanisqatsi is eerily missing from the mix and the presentation of the decaying old way of life is little more than a light confection of slums old people children and temples stitched into a jarring quilt of assorted Asian African and South American agricultural and urban vignettes. The slightly patronising notion the title suggests  the corruption of innocence by technology or the consumption of life by an unsubtle metaphorical demon  is barely present and makes its welcome entry into the fray at a rather late stage ultimately failing to look like anything but natural progression. The staged shot of the child being clouded by dust from the truck in Luxor was a desperate artistic measure and too little too late.It would be fair play to argue that this is not assessing the movie on its own merits but to be honest if it weren't part of this trilogy it would be discarded as a clumsy undergraduatestandard montage of dry Third World clichs which if not filmed at superromantic frame rates would probably come in at around 30 minutes.As a huge Philip Glass fan I would comment here upon the music if I weren't so bitterly wounded by the dismal score which succeeded only in making a chore of an already slightly tedious venture.".

It is therefore more remarkable that the images both visual and auditory have stayed with me for so long. This is a difficult movie to compare to others because it is unconventional. It relies mostly on sound and stunning visual images of the quality that one may find in the National Geographic. The narrative is not prescriptive and allows the viewer to construct the meaning. In this way the message if one chooses to see a message in it becomes all the more powerful. Leaving the cinema I remember having the kind of feeling that I had when leaving the Tate gallery in London. This is Art! It is also social comment and documentary and one can not remain neutral towards the issues addressed in the picture. If the purpose of both art and documentary is to shock and create awareness of issues in Powaqqatsi these two genres find a perfect marriage! If one has to group it with other movies I would think of something like Quest for Fire and a French movie Le Ball. These movies share only one thing and that is that almost no spoken dialogue is used. The viewer only uses pictures and sounds to create meaning. This takes the experience out of the cerebral sphere and allows one to feel it more. Subsequent reports of one's experience then tend to become watered down because one has to use words to describe it. Enough words for now! I hope that I can see this movie someday again and preferably on the big screen.".

There is no consistence of any kind. Some scenesare going on for way too long the gold mine sequence in the SerraPelada Brazil is nice but becomes tiresome already before themain title.  Other sequences are uneven and cluttered and wedon't know where we are. The movie is almost entirely overcranked in slow motion asopposed to the perfect combination of time lapse much of it withmotion blur to make it smoother plus smooth camera panningslow motion and the use of stock footage in Koyaanisqatsi whichhad a wonderful atmosphere to it and works on many levels.Powaqqatsi is supposed to make no statement about how thingsshould be  according to director Godfrey Reggio. Why then thesequence editing US American tv commercials and militaryimages is this evidence of how Reggio felt about Powaq. notcoming close to Koyaanis. in meaning? Powaq.'s photography is of great quality yet many motifs aresimply not interesting enough to be on screen for that long. I havethe feeling that the team simply didn't come home with enoughinteresting footage in the can and had to make something out ofwhat they had in the editing room. The few great shots which letsus emerge in unfamiliar worlds don't make up for the higherpercentage of footage of no interest whatsoever.Check Ron Fricke's Baraka to see what Powaqqatsi could havebeen and should have been. I also agree about some comments regarding Philip Glass' score.It is sometimes is flat out corny and sounds very much like whatone might expect in a late 1980s we are all one world beer orcookie commercial.  Philip Glass is a great and original composer for symphonicminimalism but as a composer of world music he hasn't got thevein. The Powaq. score is several notches below the magic ofwhat he did for Koyaanis. Again Baraka has a better score as well.Watch Powaqqatsi to ifill yourself in on the second installment ofthe ..qatsi trilogy. It's not a bad film but IMHO Godfrey Reggio wasunable to deliver the footage for this concept. Ron Fricke did it inBaraka.".

	schema:headline " Possibly the alltime ultimate WIP movie classic";
	schema:reviewBody "Arguably the finest women in prison WIP film ever made CAGED HEAT proves that even a trash exploitation film can aspire to decent artistic values. Jackie Erica Gavin an accomplice in a drug related crime is sent to a southern penitentiary run by an oppressive wheelchairbound warden Barbara Steele. Jackie's cell mate Lavelle Cheryl Rainbeuax Smith suffers from suicidal nightmares while another prisoner Pandora Ella Reid is reprimanded for entertaining her fellow inmates with a mildly lewd vaudeville act and placed in solitary confinement. Her loyal friend Belle Roberta Collins begins sneaking through the ventilation ducts to bring her food from the kitchen until she's caught when she surprises an elderly staff member who abruptly dies of a heart attack. Meanwhile the prison bully Maggie Juanita Brown picks a fight with Jackie and gets them both in hot water. Though the warden is a bit stern the real threat turns out to be the demented prison doctor Warren Miller. He subjects Jackie and Maggie to illegal electric shock therapy and prescribes a more permanent cure' for Belle corrective brain surgery which he intends to perform with a Black and Decker power drill !. Jackie and Maggie finally work out their differences and manage to escape in a highjacked prison truck. But Jackie can't bring herself to abandon Lavelle Pandora and especially the doomed Belle. With Maggie's help she plans a daring prison break to rescue her friends.Jonathan Demme's script provides believable characters and several imaginative dream sequences and his direction is filled with impressive camera angles and novel wipes and dissolves. He even commissioned an appropriately down and dirty soundtrack from blues legend John Cale. Because of these frequent artistic flourishes CAGED HEAT is one of the few WIP movies to win the respect of critics. In spite of the abundant exploitation and nudity the film unexpectedly also won the approval of some feminist groups who praised its positive depiction of Woman Power.'A hugely appealing cast helps the movie immeasurably. Ms. Steele earned a reputation as the original Scream Queen' with her edgy performances in horror classics like Mario Bava's BLACK SUNDAY and Roger Corman's THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM both 1961. She's cast largely against type here as the prudish warden but a dream sequence in which she performs a raucous Vegas style dance number wearing glittering tights and sheer stockings reveals her character's repressed eroticism a quality Steele projected in all her roles. Leading lady Ms. Gavin made her screen debut several years earlier in one of the first hardcore adult features Russ Meyer's VIXEN! 1968 which was a gutsy career move in an era when many actors were arrested for performing sex acts on film then still a punishable crime. The petite Ms. Smith enjoyed a busy career in exploitation films during the '70s and early '80s she tragically died of hepatitis in 2002. But beautiful blueeyed Ms. Collins who had already appeared in two previous WIP movies THE BIG DOLL HOUSE and WOMEN IN CAGES both made in 1971 steals the show as the endearingly faithful Belle. The character takes considerable personal risk to help her friend Pandora and ultimately suffers for her effort. When we see her molested by the perverted doctor and learn that she's scheduled to become his next lobotomy victim the news is genuinely shocking and upsetting which nicely sets up Jackie and Maggie's race against the clock to save her. In other words Belle ultimately becomes the emotional focus of the entire plot and Ms. Collins handles the pivotal role with winning charisma and grace. She went on to appear in countless more cult B movies including a fourth WIP film VENDETTA 1986.Demme of course went on to even bigger and better things becoming one of the most successful directors of his generation. He won a Best Director Academy Award in 1991 for THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS which also won the Best Picture Oscar.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ahhh... 'Caged Heat'! I get a big grin on my face just typing the title! Look you either dig Women In Prison movies or you don't and if you do 'Caged Heat' is the second best one ever made in a tie with Jack Hill's 'The Bird Bird Cage'. The best for me is still 'Chained Heat' starring Linda Blair and Tamara Dobson made a few years after this genre is generally regarded as being at its peak. I think the only thing stopping it from being number one is the absence of Pam Grier. If she had played the character of Pandora instead of Ella Reid 'Chained Heat' would be IT. Funnily enough three of the major cast members Juanita Brown Roberta Collins and Rainbeaux Smith had costarred in various Grier vehicles 'Foxy Brown' 'The Big Doll House' and 'Drum' respectively. This is Jonathan Demme's directorial debut after serving his apprenticeship with Roger Corman as a writer and producer and he really came up trumps. Demme manages to make a tough and tense W.I.P. movie and a playful tongue in cheek parody of one simultaneously. He has made more accomplished and successful movies since this but arguably none more entertaining. The cast is an impressive one not just Brown Collins Smith and Reid but Russ Meyer bitch goddess Erica Gavin 'Vixen!' and horror legend Barbara Steele 'Black Sunday' 'Pit And The Pendulum' 'Night Of The Doomed' 'Shivers'etc.. I also liked the perverted Dr. Randolph played by Warren Miller. 'Caged Heat' is first class trash and a perfect example of 1960s70s exploitation movies exemplified by the energetic and fun output of American International and New World Pictures. We will never see their likes again! Enjoy!".

I read that Caged Heat was praised by critics I could probably see what they saw in comparison to other girls in prison flicks. It didn't have that aspect of a campy movie. It had some style to it which is good. It shows that Demme had some sense of artistic view from the very beginning of his career.  You can tell that he took time in planing out shots. The best example of this is when the camera is passing by the prison cells and you can see each inmate doing something different. Those are also signs of good directing. The characters are memorable and well developed. The movie doesn't aim for showing a lot of skin.  Sure some of the girls are very attractive especially the two blond ones still the movie doesn't rely on sex at all.I guess you can say this is a decent first attempt.  Considering the budget he had to work with I'd say its pretty good. Its good to see directors work their way up but never forget where they came from. Demme was grateful to be working with Roger Corman and it shows. He gave him a role in Silence of the Lambs. Nevertheless Caged Heat is nice to check out. It's great entertainment that's for sure. And isn't that what films are all about?".

	schema:reviewBody "To finally see what many consider to be the greatest womeninprison film of all time I felt like I had accomplished something as ridiculous as that sounds. Boy it sure contained the elements I expected and delivered so much more. A constant I'm discovering in these films is the toughness and grit of the actresses in the roles of prisoners preparing for escape while their threshold tolerance and resolve..not to mention sanitybeing tested by their superiors. While most of them were hired for the way they look naked because the nature of the genre demands such gratuitous elements something else emerges other attributes such as attitude and guts that I ultimately respond to.This as you may know all too well was Demme's debut for his mentor Roger Corman and he provides the target audience with exactly what they desire while putting his own stamp on the proceedings. For instance there are bizarre dreams certain characters have which define their current psychological states..there's a particular number featuring warden Barbara Steele where she reminded me of Alex de Large of A Clockwork Orange.The film has female prisoners planning a daring escape tired of the crazed antics of their wheelchair bound warden and her nutty prison doc RandolphWarren Miller. Juanita Brown is Maggie the tough sassy sister who is fed up with the environment and will do whatever it takes to get out. She's the one all the girls fear to cross. Erica Gavin is Jacqueline Wilson the newest prisoner who was busted by police and sentenced for the murder of a cop unwilling to give up the names of those she was involved with. Roberta Collins is Belle a serial kleptomaniac best pals with PandoraElla Reid. Belle becomes the obsession of Randolph who promises Superintendent McQueenSteelethat through a surgical procedure he can remove her violent tendencies. Drugging her up Randolph takes nude pictures and sodomizes her whimpering like a little girl due to his own mental deficiencies while hugging her naked body in his arms. Cheryl Rainbeaux Smith is Lavelle in prison for life for murdering a scumbag whose relative was a Senator. Lavelle receives work in Randolph's office and is the one responsible for relating his dirty antics to Pandora. Demme effectively builds the movie to the expected finale as a planned breakout using those behind the various traumas inflicted on the prisoners as hostages with gunfire erupting.I was quite impressed with the photographic work of long time Demme collaborator cinematographer Tak Fujimoto as he is able to establish some visually arresting moments within the cramped confines of the prison cells and rooms not an easy task. The prison is appropriately crummy and the girls despite being quite attractive look the part of desperate inmates longing yearning from the very pits of their souls to escape such horrid entrapment. Steele is superb as the warden understanding how to take the role close to the brink without going to far candidly able to express the madness of her repressed character within a restraint..notice how she works her glasses and settles herself without blowing her top particularly when certain behaviors she has contempt for push her teetering to the edge. Cale's bluesy score is incredibly depressing while also casting a wink to the audience that the movie is still funandgames..I think Cale's score mirrors Demme's handling of the material. Cale and Demme's partnership is an uncanny alliance that presents the setting as a sad isolating oppressive place while almost simultaneously showcasing a humorous tone that permeates due to the colorful characters thanks in part to the personalities of the cast. My favorite scene happens outside the prison as two of our girls..joining forces with a thirdinterrupt a bank robbery already in progress..the kicker is it was a bank they were planning to rob! As you might expect you get naked women in showers prisoner in solitary a cat fight shootouts attempted escapes which go awry and other exploitative elements..such as a horrifying shock therapy session not to exclude the shocking aforementioned sequence where the screwy doc takes advantage of Belle. Interesting enough Demme relates the film to the audience without a whiff of pretension understanding exactly the kind of movie he was making.".

But next to his colleagues Brian de Palma and Martin Scorcese producer legend Roger Corman gave him the right kickstart! The film  itself has all ingredients a good Bmovies got to have because Caged Heat is dirty suspensepacked and happily far beyond the political correctness of Demmes later films! Nudity soft sex violence... theres nothing left out a decent exploitation movie should contain! Two appearances are absolutely shiny the one comes from Erica Gavin the unforgotten boob queen in Russ Meyers hilarious sleaze classic Supervixen! However the even greater performance is given by the grand dame of horrors Barbara Steele! Her part as a paralysed and prudish prison director is the main attraction in this rough WIPflick! Director Jonathan Demme should have made more films like Caged Heat! Unfortunately Oscars became more important to him than honest movies...".

	onyx:emotionText "Unbelievable that a director like Jonathan Demme responsible for clean and sober Hollywood stuff  la Silence of the Lambs or Philadelphia started his career in the sleazy world of the Bmovies..! But next to his colleagues Brian de Palma and Martin Scorcese producer legend Roger Corman gave him the right kickstart! The film  itself has all ingredients a good Bmovies got to have because Caged Heat is dirty suspensepacked and happily far beyond the political correctness of Demmes later films! Nudity soft sex violence... theres nothing left out a decent exploitation movie should contain! Two appearances are absolutely shiny the one comes from Erica Gavin the unforgotten boob queen in Russ Meyers hilarious sleaze classic Supervixen! However the even greater performance is given by the grand dame of horrors Barbara Steele! Her part as a paralysed and prudish prison director is the main attraction in this rough WIPflick! Director Jonathan Demme should have made more films like Caged Heat! Unfortunately Oscars became more important to him than honest movies...";

	schema:reviewBody "Jonathan Demme's feature length first unit directorial debut was this women in prison favourite done for his boss in the 1970s Roger Corman. It stars Erica Gavin as Jacqueline Wilson a young woman nabbed by the police during a drug bust. While serving time she meets a variety of convicts among them the ultra tough Maggie Juanita Brown the equally feisty Belle Roberta Collins and the more low key Lavelle Cheryl Rainbeaux Smith. When two of the ladies perform a risqu routine in order to entertain the others the superintendent Barbara Steele decides to come down hard on her charges.Once one stops to think about it they do realize that there is more going on than in the standard issue type of W.I.P. feature. It is exploitative of course Demme does realize what's required of him. Still he waits until about 24 minutes into the movie before he even begins showing off the birthday suits on the babes. There are shower scenes and cat fights and generally agreeable mayhem. There's also a decent subtext about the degrees to which males exploit females and take advantage of them and what can happen when enough females band together to take preventative steps. One can hardly fail to notice the depravity of a central male character the nefarious prison doctor Randolph Warren Miller who has a taste for electro shock therapy and for taking nude photos of his patients at their most vulnerable.The script by Demme is also laced with humour at appropriate moments. The characters maintain a good amount of rooting interest with exploitation veterans like Brown and Collins offering standout performances. However the most intriguing person here is Superintendent McQueen played as being very repressed by Ms. Steele. In the real world McQueen is confined to a wheelchair and has one very erotic dream sequence.Fans of the 1970s B movie will recognize a number of the supporting and bit players Crystin Sinclaire Carmen Argenziano John Aprea Patrick Wright Gary Littlejohn. Pay close attention to catch Demme's regular cinematographer Tak Fujimoto as a sex emporium customer.Caged Heat is sexy and violent paced reasonably well and delivers some excitement in its climactic prison breakout sequence.Seven out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jonathan Demme's directorial debut for Roger Corman's legendary exploitation outfit New World Pictures rates highly as one of the finest chicksinchains 70's grindhouse classics to ever grace celluloid. Beauteous Russ Meyer starlet Eric Vixen Beyond the Valley of the Dolls Gavin gives a robust winning performance as a brassy resilient new fish who does her best to persevere in a grimy hellish penitentiary. The always fabulous Barbara Steele offers a deliciously wicked portrayal as the mean crippled sexually frustrated warden her erotic dream about doing a slow steamy striptease in front of the lady inmates is a real dilly. Longtime favorite 70's Bmovie actress Roberta The Arousers Unholy Rollers Collins delivers a hilariously raunchy and endearing turn as a cheerfully forward foulmouthed kleptomaniac felon who tells a gutbusting dirty joke about Pinnochio. Lynda Gold a.k.a. Crystin Sinclaire of Tobe Hooper's Eaten Alive and Curtis Harrington's Ruby makes her lively film debut as uninhibited wildcat Crazy Alice. And the evercuddly Cheryl Rainbeaux Smith does a lovely touching reprise of her fragile frightened innocent role from Lemora A Child's Tale of the Supernatural. Although this picture does deliver the expected ample amount of coarse language nudity rape and violence it's still by no means a typically crass and sexist piece of lurid mindless filth the movie very effectively explores the many ways in which men cruelly exploit women and strongly asserts the profeminist notion that women can overcome any obstacles if they band together into a group so they can bravely face their misogynistic oppressors as one mighty fighting force. Demme's zesty confidant direction comes through with a glorious abundance of astutely observed incidental details and delightful moments of engagingly quirky human behavior. Furthermore both Tak Fujimoto's vibrant cinematography and John Cale's marvelously dolorous oddball blues score are 100 on the money excellent. Patrick Wright Sheriff Mack in the uproariously awful cheaprubbermonstersuit creature feature howler Track of the Moonbeast has a sidesplitting bit as a jerky cop who has his car stolen by a trio of prison escapees when he stops at a gas station to use the bathroom. Lively rousing and immensely enjoyable Caged Heat qualifies as absolutely essential viewing for 70's drivein movie fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I think 'Women in Prison' my mind often goes to sleazy ItalianSpanish productions by directors such as Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei and while these films are often very sleazy they're also very samey and once you've seen one you might as well have seen them all. I have to admit that these types of films generally aren't my favourites but in fact the idea of women behind bars has been done very well on several occasions outside of Italy and Spain and Roger Corman's New World Pictures is responsible for some of the best of them. Caged Heat is the directorial debut of Oscarwinning director Jonathan Demme and it's a well done little flick with plenty of entertainment value! Naturally the film centres on the story of a girl who is caught committing crime and sent to a women's' prison where she is introduced to a host of violent inmates. This prison is ruled over by the stuff wheelchair bound Superintendent McQueen and she takes offence to a play put on by the girls leading them to plot an escape.This film is much lighter on the sleaze than I'm used to in a women in prison flick but this is more than compensated for by some great action scenes and dialogue and that's what ensures Caged Heat entertains throughout. It does have to be said that the plot is not particularly original or ambitious and basically follows a structure similar to many other women in prison films that came before it but that's not such a big problem. The film never gets boring and is peppered with standout scenes including an escape attempt while out working in a field and a bank robbery. The film is helped along by assured direction from the man who would go on to helm the masterpiece The Silence of the Lambs and a great cast with plenty of standouts including best of all the legendary Barbara Steele in the role of the head prison warden. Overall Caged Heat may not leave the viewer with much to think about by the end but it's a brilliantly entertaining little grindhouse flick and anyone that enjoys this type of film will surely want to track it down.".

Sure the plot consists of a bunch of women in prison who wear street clothes btw quite comical but NOTHING happens.There aren't strong rivalries no one tries to seduce the warden or doctor in order to try and escape and no inmates make out. There are 2 shower scenes that I suspect is just recycled footage but no fights breaks out  no one is seduced here  or anywhere for that matter! Aside from the lack of plot unconvincing unsympathetic and flat characters a couple of inmates that do manage to escape actually return to the prison in order to free their fellow inmates??!!PUHLEASE the movie should have just ended off with the escapees riding off into the sunset...as opposed to letting this mess continue!I feel scammed.".

	schema:headline " a women's prison movie meant to shock and weird you out more than titillate... and that's good!";
	schema:reviewBody "Jonathan Demme started out in such a way that might not seem all that auspicious he somehow got connected with Roger Corman after years of being a film publicist and at first was writing and producing and sometimes for some fine exploitation product like the underrated or just underseen Angels Hard as They Come which is the most pornybutnotporn title for a film ever but near the end of the womeninprison craze that Corman cooked up via his New World Pictures Demme asked to take a shot at the genre. What he wrote and directed  used with the budget of what I assume is literally the change that Corman had left over after he called in the phone booth to make the deal for the lights and other things for the crew  is a weird little number a movie that titillates but only incidentally and is more concerned with showing how women  or simply PEOPLE in general  are oppressed and repressed to the point where they got to bust out and escapetake over. It's a real late 60'searly 70's feel to this one.Where it gets weird is in the overall tone and in part in Barbara Steele's performance as the prison warden. Early on there are a few dream sceees and delusions of grandeur Steele's warden who goes about in a wheelchair because... um because she can and it seems creepier I suppose with her costume and hair and glasses and voice sees a performance put on by a couple of the girl prisoners to the rest of the prisoners and it's a tasteless burlesque maybe if one wants to get all film history since Demme at the time was a selfprofessed movie buff is a little reminiscent of a similar crossdressing scene in Grand Illusion  I have no way of knowing if that was inspiration but I'd like to think it was and it gives her fantasies of... seeing herself as if she is a dancer and performer in front of the girls. This horrifies her to the point of putting the hammer down even harder and this includes medical experiments like electroshock not really how it should work but it's a Corman movie let it go and overall oppression on the prisoners.What's cool about the movie is that it does have a story that unfolds and that you can follow though at first it doesn't seem that way early on it feels like it'll be episodic like we'll follow this character or that as they do one thing or the other. It may even feel a little light as far as some of the requisites for these exploitation fare. Demme only stages one catfight between two girls albeit in the shower though clothed but this is actually clever because he does this to draw the characters who get into this fight closer together  one of which the white woman who we think might be the main character since she's the one seen at the beginning of the film being arrested after a botched robbery not really the case as it's an ensemble  and they become the pivotal characters in the story.Some of this may have been heightened by the DVD transfer which seemed as though it was simply slapped on from an archival 35mm print I normally don't give warnings in a review such as this but the audio here for my speakers was among the worst mixed I've had for a DVD by a major director such as Demme before but it feels as though Demme and company had little to work with technically speaking. This is even to the detriment of a shot or two like I wondered if Demme and Tak Fujimoto even his name sounds like film had time for 2nd takes as one of the shots loses its shutter for a few seconds midshot and goes dark. And yet this also adds to the grit of the picture the characters shoot guns a lot and it's sloppy but that adds to the thrills and the humor. It feels closer to something like real life than the manufactured hackneyed work of a journeyman or someone punching in for New World Pictures.Demme seems like someone who has something to prove even if it's for a prison picture that involves an overthetop sadistic doctor what IS he going to do with those polaroids? and an unfolding of a story that eventually has a tight logic to it as far as what the two women are going to do who had that one catfight and are now on their own. To be sure there isn't a lick of subtlety to this but I like it that way all the way down to the soundtrack full of harmonica hootin'blues ala the end of Stroszek and the acting which is.... ACTING all around! I loved the energy most of all that Demme kept the pace so that we could have a moment or two to take a sequence in  like when the one woman goes through the vents counting every second down so she can bring food to her beleaguered colleague in solitary confinement of all things though I'm sure part of Demme's commentary on how nakedness in this situation is stripping women's freedoms  and then it goes back into overdrive.It feels like a movie by someone with something to SAY as opposed to routine and while not all of it works enough of it does to where you can be entertained especially by the ending where it goes into madnessmode and if one were to by some miracle come to this first in Demme's oeuvre without seeing anything else one might think ... huh. What happened to that guy? God bless Roger Corman for taking chances like this one. 7.510".

She also meets the warden Superintendent McQueen Barbara Steele who takes a sadistic approach to any infractions of the rules. Along with that there is also a psychotic doctor named Dr. Randolph Warren Miller who is even more demented. At any rate while I certainly liked the presence of Roberta Collins and to a lesser extent Erica Gavin I didn't think that the talents of Barbara Steele were used as effectively as they could have been. Neither did I care for some of the cartoonish aspects in regard to Dr. Randolph. But all in all this movie wasn't nearly as bad as it could have been. But other than Roberta Collins I didn't see that much to be impressed with either. Slightly below average.".

It doesn't take long for her to realize she's in for a long ride as the prison is being ran by a sadistic warden Barbara Steele as well as a crazy doctor Warren Miller who is doing bizarre experiments on the women.CAGED HEAT was the first film from director Jonathan Demme. Yes that Jonathan Demme who would win a Best Director Oscar seventeenyears after this film with THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. By the time CAGED HEAT was released the womeninprison genre was several years strong and by this time producer Roger Corman already had a formula down that he wanted followed. Of course you had to have a short running time and in that short time you had to have plenty of violence action and of course nudity.Demme manages to deliver a pretty fast film although there's no question that there's really nothing new on display here. He at least managed to turn in a fun exploitation picture that has all the elements needed for a Corman picture so to speak. The film has an attractive cast with Gavin fitting the lead role just fine and we've also got cult favorites Roberta Collins and Juanita Brown. Miller is good in the role of the crazy doctor and it's certainly fun and strange seeing Steele here. I thought the cult favorite was decent in the part but I'm not sure she seems too thrilled being in it.The film has plenty of nudity with a lot of beautiful women and of course there's the required shower sequences. The action is pretty good and for the most part there's really nothing overly bad here. As I said the prison genre was already going strong for a few years so there's nothing new here but CAGED HEAT is fun.".
