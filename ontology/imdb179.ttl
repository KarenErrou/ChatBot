Very entertaining and action packed sequel that is almost better than the original and THE only sequel in the series worth watching. What works here for this sequel is there's more action bigger special effects offthewall humor a more intense and dramatic score Mick Garris's directorial debut and of course there's a memorable moment where Lee the faceless bounty hunter from space looks at a Playboy magazine and transforms into a beautiful nude blonde centerfold babe played by Bmovie beauty Roxanne Kernohan. Look for Eddie Deezen  best known for Mandark on Dexter's Lab and Eugene from Grease as a restaurant manager and there's an amusing Freddy Krueger injoke since the movie is from Freddy's home known as New Line Cinema.".

The fact that this one decides to get the creatures out quite early with the discovery of the eggs and the town becoming aware of what's going on with his reappearance to their total dismay and a series of isolated attacks that clearly signal the creatures are back and ready to continue their rampage as before only making the creatures as completely oblivious to the others around them makes for a rather fun time with the different attacks not being recognized until the midway point results in some nice fun. With the different tactics of trying to get the creatures under control still providing a lot of laughs as well it makes for much more fun to be had when it plays off the previously established guidelines for the series as well as injecting a lot of clever and sometimes creepy points in this to add in a horror angle when all is said and done makes this one a lot more entertaining and enjoyable. There's enough gore in this to appeal to the more traditional horror fans with their attacks on the townspeople in the diner the church and the final attack in the storage locker not only provide some fun moments throughout with their fun combination of mixing lighthearted action with some rather gruesome moments to add up to a bunch of fun times. While there's some flaws here in that the continuous jokes about the events in the first film are used to make it appear that he's just insane and should know better about spreading such information around get tiresome quite quickly there's enough to like here that it's enough to overcome the few flaws.Rated PG13 Language Violence and Nudity.".

It was a fun movie and the critters grouping together was cool. The female bounty hunter's death was surprising. The acting was believable and the story was fun.

He was branded a liar and hoaxer and apparently no one believed his stories of the Krites and extraterrestrial bounty hunters. Which is a little harsh considering they had several eaten humans and dead Krites as proof. And as soon as he returns the Krite eggs seen at the very end of the first film begin to hatch and the feeding frenzy begins all over again on a bigger scale.There's fun to be had in watching the critters go mental all over town. And the film could have been a fourstarrer but there's a major lull at the end of the second act in which nothing happens and it really slows down. But the massive furball at the end is brilliant.They really should have left the Critters movies after this and I wouldn't bother with 3 and 4. They're rubbish. Still the Krites are cute I don't care what you say and Brad's girlfriend is gorgeous too.The DVD is in great looking 1.851 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. Some trailers are included.".

I thought this would be like Batman  Robin a goofy lighthearted sequel to a dark epic badass film. I then sat down to watch the movie ironically before Easter the holiday that this movie takes place in and thankfully it wasn't like Batman  Robin.This sequel gives us back Bradley Brown the boy from the first film who has grown up a bit. Time has passed since the Crite incident but people still remember the Brown family. Crite eggs are found but are mistaken for Easter eggs. The eggs end up getting into the town and when they hatch... All Hell breaks loose! This is a sweet sequel. The puppeteers really showed off their abilities here case in point The Criteball which is a highlight. I love Bradley Brown's character and I'm glad that they picked him for a Brown family member to bring back.Also just like the predecessor the bounty hunters are still cool as ever. Surprisingly Ug is still disguised as Johnny Steele.So far this is the last Critters movie that I saw. I plan on seeing the other two but have second thoughts on them. Critters 3 looks okay and Critters 4 just looks boring.Another thing I believe that the rating for this film on here should be up a bit at almost the same rating as the first film.".

If you like eighties cheesy horror. And I do.I've only just watched it since the early nineties and I'm amazed at how much I remember. I'm sure I didn't spend my entire childhood watching Critters 2 but I seem to recall some of it word for word. If you haven't seen the first instalment then don't worry. This one hardly requires much prior knowledge of the franchise to understand. A couple of years ago some nasty little aliens landed on Earth terrorised a farm and were ultimately despatched by the alien bounty hunters helping the local townsfolk. That's actually also the plot to the sequel. Only this time it's bigger and better.There are more Critters. The Critters are generally nastier while blatantly being funnier at the same time. Critters 2 bounces between horror and comedy whereas the first film was more horror with the occasional dose of humour. In many ways Critters 2 is to Critters what Gremlins 2 was to Gremlins  bigger louder funnier but ultimately not as well received.Critters 2 is hardly horror. Sure there are a few gross moments and the Critters themselves are beautifully ugly. But it's one of those films that you have to know what you're getting before you sit down. It's popcorn fun to the max. Any alien who can turn into a Playboy centrefold and then remove the staple he's inadvertently copied hardly sets out to take itself seriously. The film is never that serious so you shouldn't try to take it so.If you like nasty little eighties puppetmonsters and daftness to the max you'll like this. Put your brain on hold and don't overthink anything otherwise you might start to question why a space ship i.e. a ship that flies in the vastness of space comes equipped with an Earthmade parachute.

These are sold to a local hustler by a punk who's out to score beer and pornographic reading material. Said hustler then sells the eggs to the local church so they can be used in the townwide Easter Egg Hunt.Yeah. You can see where this is going.Believe it or not Critters 2 is much more well done than its predecessor. It's cheesier filled with schlocky gore and actually realizes that it's not going to ever be truly scary. Because of this it ultimately feels like Gremlins 2 you know the one where all of the little monsters reeked havoc on a Manhattan skyscraper.The ripoff effect isn't quite as poignant as I had originally feared though. Things quickly escalate from ridiculous to ludicrous and it seems as if screenwriter David Twohy and Mick Garris realized that this sequel should be as absurd as possible. This time around the people of Grover's Bend are goofier than ever and the Crites reveal they're ability to morph into one gigantic critter ball that carves a path of destruction throughout the community. The hilarity is also taken up a notch by the decision of one alien bounty hunter to undergo an incredibly fakeincredibly awkward transformation so as to represent a Playboy playmate. Watching a super model state gruffly Kill Crites is a lot funnier than it probably sounds. There's innuendo worked into the equation in the form of extending intergalactic shotguns and this manages to elicit its fair share of hardyharhars.Is Critters 2 worth watching? It depends. If you like idiotic creature features that know how to successfully selfparody themselves then sure by all means give it a shot.

Not as good as the first film in my opinion because i loved the whole Brown family  the farmhouse seige aspect but here at least we get the awesome Bradley Brown Scott Grimes back as he comes back to his hometown to visit his gran  things go wrong!!! Also it's nice to have the awesome bounty hunters back UgLee  even Charlie has joined their little team  that's all good fun.The old sheriff returns also but played by someone else this time but that's fine as the sheriff wasn't a main character in the first film anyway so all is well done  thought out for this crazy sequel.The Critters look fantastic as always  again the fx are stunning  i really love the opening scene where we get to see the bounty hunters on a mission hunting an alien creature it's so awesome  sets up the universe of the Krites.A perfectly fun  crazy sequel to a classic 80's Horror scifi comedy with alot of Heart too  real love for the characters these Critters films are just really nicely made  i enjoy these movies even more today as an adult as these are a nice reminder of how films used to be without the c.g.i takeover  everything super hero!!!

	schema:headline " Critters 2";
	schema:reviewBody "The insatiable appetite of the Crites continues in this inevitable sequel.It seems the bounty hunters missed a small batch of Crite eggs when they were last on Earth. You'd think they would have known to check for something like that considering they are bounty hunters and apparent experts in various alien lifeforms such as the Crites. Alas no the professional bounty hunters bungled their last job by forgetting to check for eggs. Oh yeah and its Easter time on Earth. Crite eggs...Easter...got it. So after a brief hologram message from some wiry alien creature must be the new space prison boss. The last hovering alien was probably fired for fcking up and allowing the Crites to escape probably the bounty hunters are off to Earth yet again for another ultra destructive rescue mission.So lets just address the most obvious change here. This franchise started after the classic 1984 horror comedy 'Gremlins' yet it was apparently written before. This critter sequel came out in 1988 two years before the sequel to 'Gremlins' in 1990. And still like the original films the similarities between the sequels are easy to spot. Where as the original movies both 'Critters' and 'Gremlins' were basically horror comedies with a somewhat semiserious dark thrilling vibe the sequels go down the comedy route. Everything in this movie is one step up more in your face more lunacy more cartoonish. But lets be clear this isn't a goofy spoof which 'Gremlins 2' kinda turned out like. No this is still a semi dark thrilleresque horror comedy for sure it just has more laughs at the Crites expense. The Crites themselves have definitely gone down the cartoon route for certain scenes. They are still threatening and make you wanna pull your feet away from the edge of the couch but at the same time they are now used as the butt of some definite goofy visual gags. Nevertheless this movie doesn't ever go down the metaselfreferential route for its gags it doesn't satirise the original movie. The basic plot still holds up and plays out.So lets have a look at the plot. Well its the same as before only more! More Crites more feeding more blood more gore etc...Oh and Charlie is now a bounty hunter. Why is Charlie Don Opper a bounty hunter? Beats me no clue why Ug would allow this clearly weak human to accompany him into space as a trainee. We even see how bad Charlie is at the job at the start. Meanwhile on Earth Brad Scott Grimes is all grown up now and visiting Grover's Bend to see his gran conveniently. For some reason Brad has a bully problem from a guy called Wesley in a very 'Back to the Future II'esque scene. Not sure why this guy was in the movie. And Sheriff Harv has now been recast with the younger at the time I think Barry Corbin who was at one time the main man to cast for any authority figure...usually in a small town type scenario. This guy is the most Texan Texan I've ever seen his name should be Tex Stetson McSixShooter.One of the big attractions with this sequel for all us dirty minded underage boys at the time was of course Ug's partner in crime now called Lee. In the first movie his gimmick was shapeshifting between various human forms for comedic effect. This time things got a bit more grownup a bit more seedy dare I say a more lowbrow hook or carrot on a stick. Yep this time Lee shapeshifts into a hot sexy blonde with big boobs that adorned a Playboy magazine cover that Charlie finds lying around in a field as if. I should also point out that not only does Lee's face change his body changes too. Complete with firm arse huge boobs that inflate like balloons complete with whining sound and even a nice tight thong. Because of course that would be included in his shapeshifting. The other big draw with this movie was the Crite special effects. Basically the new tricks and gimmicks the puppets could do and the various comedic ways in which they got killed. And with that we see critters getting blown to pieces with the bounty hunter space guns. Getting run over and squashed flat. Boiled in a vat of chip fat until lobster red and bald. Electrocuted in a very cartoonish manner. Biting on a car tyre and inflating like a critter balloon. Splattered against a wall. Seeing Crite facial expressions such as their little eye bulging out of their head when scared. And the coup de grce where all the Crites join together like an organic Transformer to form the giant critter ball which eats people alive as it snowballs along. Everyone loved that bit the bit where the critter ball rolls over some guy reducing him to a quivering bloody skeleton in its trail.Quick note Ug transformsmorphs into a critter in this movie. That is something new which leads to questions such as why did he not do this before? Surely that would have helped in the first movie. How can he do this?? It is kinda assumed these shapeshifters can only transform their face but in this movie it seems they can transform their entire body shape and even size! So clearly the goalposts are being moved to suit the plot here which is fine I guess this is a Bmovie but also troublesome for consistency.So what's the lowdown? Well I'd say this movie is pretty much on par with the first movie. The original is more of a genuine horror thriller with reasonable jump scares and tension the sequel is more of a horror comedy with more silly Crite hijinks. Both movies are good stand alone flicks both are easy to follow and both deliver exactly what you would expect. Some folks will prefer the original and some will prefer the sequel and that's completely understandable. Myself now I think I slightly prefer the original as it takes itself a tad more seriously a bit darker. When I was a youngster I preferred the sequel because bewbs. But overall weighing up the pros and cons I'd say they were about equal.710".

	schema:reviewBody "The furry space munchers are back in Grover's Bend...Critters 2 has a good storyline that is easy to follow and also serves as a great continuation of the storyline from the first movie. It is a combination of the events in the storyline and the detailed characters that makes the movie good.It was nice to have Scott Grimes playing Brad Terrence Mann playing Ug and Don Keith Opper playing Charlie return to the sequel which added a great sense of continuity to the movie. Furthermore the movie also have Lin Shaye Barry Corbin and Sam Anderson on the cast list so if you have watched movies during the 1980s there is a good amount of familiar faces to be seen here. But in general the casting was good and they had some nice talents appearing in the movie. And people were doing good jobs with their given roles and characters.The pacing of Critters 2 is fairly much the same as in the previous movie. However it takes some twenty odd minutes before the movie starts to get up in gear. So taking 20 something minutes to set the atmosphere and build up the story was a bit tedious. Especially since we already am familiar with the concept of the critters from the first movie.Some of the scenes were actually quite nice especially when you had the critter's point of view of the surroundings and the world in which it was running around in before it got squished.The special effects team were doing a great job with their work on Critters 2 and it was nice to see that they had given them more money because the effects were definitely a notch up in comparison to the effects seen in the first movie. The critters are starting to look more interesting and more lifelike.There is a a good atmosphere to the movie and the setting was good. And it worked out quite well with the specific style of cinematography and the work of director Mick Garris. There is a very Gremlins 2 feel to this sequel with the increased comedy level of the movie. So if you like that or not is a matter of personal preference of course. I did enjoy it.The music score for Critters 2 is quite good and it suits the movie and the atmosphere of the movie quite well. It is subtle enough to function as background music yet still prominent enough to demand attention.I must say that the critters design is really interesting and I like it quite a lot. They are every bit as funny as they are ferocious. They looks like cuddly small creatures but are in fact crazed feeding machines. But the design of the featureless bounty hunters is also quite interesting and I especially like their shapechanging ability that allows them to mimic the appearance of others.If you enjoyed the first Critters movie then you will definitely also like the sequel. And like its predecessor Critters 2 is a wonderful mix of SciFi horror and comedy with the introduction of more comedy compared to the previous movie.".

But at the same time a nest of Crite eggs hidden in an old shed begin to hatch. As the killer furballs begin attacking the townsfolk the polymorphic bounty hunters Ug  Lee along with fellow hunter Charlie McFadden return to the town in order to wipe out the Crites for good.Critters was a knockoff of the Joe Dante classic Gremlins that became a cult hit in its own right picking up most of its audience on video. The film's success  it was pitched right to the family viewers with its delightfullymeanbutnottoonasty attitude  meant that it was turned into a minor franchise.Critters 2 was the first of three sequels none of which managed to quite match the original's recipe for light fun although one did come close. Unlike the original which nailed its humour right on the nose Critters 2's attempts at humour were so clumsily mounted that it ends up shooting itself in the foot. First off the film's militant provegetarian stance is utterly ridiculous  humans are NOT herbivores instead we are omnivores capable of eating both plants  meat on a personal note I found that if you don't use any polyunsaturated fats which have been falsely considered healthy by misguided nutritionists misled by the seed oil industry you'll live longer  won't have cancer or diabetes. Add to that the LCD style humour that insults the intelligence of its viewers  you've got a recipe for disaster.To be fair the film has some mildly amusing moments  the alien hunters are capable of shapeshifting but their choice of form is skewed  one hunter turns into a blonde woman after glancing at a Playboy mag but even adds a large staple to her midriff the same character also attempts to change into Freddy Krueger after spotting a poster for A Nightmare on Elm Street  and the fast food outlet shootout is hilarious for having the Critters pigging out  even one taking a nap in a deep fryer leaving it with no skin. But these moments are rare  have not enough mileage to sustain the film for long.".

Add to that the LCD style humour that insults the intelligence of its viewers  you've got a recipe for disaster.To be fair the film has some mildly amusing moments  the alien hunters are capable of shapeshifting but their choice of form is skewed  one hunter turns into a blonde woman after glancing at a Playboy mag but even adds a large staple to her midriff the same character also attempts to change into Freddy Krueger after spotting a poster for A Nightmare on Elm Street  and the fast food outlet shootout is hilarious for having the Critters pigging out  even one taking a nap in a deep fryer leaving it with no skin. But these moments are rare  have not enough mileage to sustain the film for long.";

At the end of the film the critters are all destroyed but we see that they lay several eggs which in critters 2 are found and sold as easter eggs. The eggs hatch and the critters go on an eating spree devouring everything in town. The townspeople hole up in a church to try and wait them out. The bounty hunters return now with Charlie from the original as another bounty hunter in this film and again try to destroy the critters. One of them is devoured and the other one slips into a deep depression. Now it's up to the towns people to find a way to destroy the critters. They decide to try and contain the critters in a Hungry Heifers factory and then blow it up. It seems to work but the critters burst out of the wreckage in a giant ball of rolling flesh devouring creatures. The movie is fun but just not quite as good as the original. It's definitely still worth checking out but don't expect a movie just as good as the first.".

I've seen several movies that are way better than Critters 2 such as Gremlins 2 now THAT was a masterpiece. However I've also seen several movies worse than Critters 2 such as the sequel to Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.We feel little sympathy for the human characters who are both prey and warriors against the Crites or called Critters. The bounty hunter Ug is depressed that his partner Lee was killed off by the monsters. However the audience don't get the special message of why they should actually love Lee played by Roxanne Kernohan as much as Ug does. The only fact the audience can know about Lee is that she was naked and the audience was supposed to be perverted by the clearlyshownclosetocamera shots where you see her breasts and butt. A very very unlikely reason that someone would like this movie is that this is a PG13 and not R rated movie with porn on it unlike today's movies. So should the audience just be sad that her boobs  butt were eaten by the Critters and they'll never get a close view on them again? Even if the Critters had a deeper impact and made the film scarier and darker the film wouldn't have been that interesting because of how the script and acting were written. The title has described the entire movie's story it's about monsters chasing humans to eat.".

But these were in fact dead Russian soldiers from the First World War.  If so why did these Russian soldiers had civilian clothes on them Mr. Roberts? Moreover I saw the film twice the footage you mentioned was NOT used to show Ukrainian famine victims as you claim. It was used to show victims of the Communist terror. B Frank Roberts states Another good example is the scene where several officers are shown drinking and giving a toast. The Soviet Story claims that this is proof of NaziSoviet collaboration. In reality there were no Russians present at that meeting.  Really? Who is then the officer in the Red Army uniform? A Japanese? What about the Order of the Red Banner on the officers chest? C Frank Roberts states Soviet Story tries to make the current Russian government look bad. How is this done? By showing a clip that the film claims involves Russian NeoNazis. Now what does this have to do with the Russian government? Nothing at all.  Who is the man performing Nazi salute in the film? Nikolay Kuryanovich. Was not Nikolay Kuryanovich a member of Russia's parliament? It is quite understandable that The Soviet Story is so acrimoniously denounced by Communists and those who believe Stalin was a successful manager. No surprise that some proPutin gang even burned the effigy of Edvins Snore in Moscow. The anger and hatred is clearly there. What is missing  is counterarguments.".

	schema:headline " The Soviet Story is a documentary film about socialist terror and SovietNazi collaboration in mass murder.";
	schema:reviewBody "Of thousands of films books and plays on the communist experience this one stands out above all the rest  a monument to millions of innocent victims and a charge against a bloodthirsty socialist theory that killed almost two hundred million people in the 20th century and continues its murderous trail into the 21st.The film was directed by a talented Latvian producer Edvns nore. In its synopsis nore writes This is a story of an Allied power which helped the Nazis to fight Jews and which slaughtered its own people on an industrial scale. Assisted by the West this power triumphed on May 9th 1945. Its crimes were made taboo and the complete story of Europe's most murderous regime has never been told.The film argues that there were close philosophical political and military relations between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union before and during the early stages of World War II. It highlights the Great Famine the infamous holodomor which wiped out seven million Ukrainians the Great Purge in Moscow and elsewhere in the USSR with over eleven million murdered as well as the Katyn massacre of tens of thousands of Polish officers.The film sheds the light on GestapoNKVD collaboration in mass murder of Jews and German opposition Soviet mass deportations and inhuman medical experiments in the GULAG.The Economist praises the film by saying Soviet Story is the most powerful antidote yet to the sanitisation of the past. The film is gripping audacious and uncompromising. The main aim of the film is to show the close connectionsphilosophical political and organisationalbetween the Nazi and Soviet systems Those who keep a soft spot for Marxism may flinch to hear that the sage of Highgate referred to backward societies as Vlkerabflle racial trash who must perish in the revolutionary holocaust. Or that the Nazi party in its early days idolised Lenin Josef Goebbels said he was second only to Adolf Hitler in greatness.This is a revelation for some. Ludwig Von Mises wrote about Nazism and communism as two forms of the same socialist tyranny for a long time. He analyzed two patterns for the realization of socialism when he wrote The first pattern we may call it the Lenin or the Russian pattern is purely bureaucratic. All plants shops and farms are formally nationalized verstaatlicht they are departments of the government operated by civil servants. Every unit of the apparatus of production stands in the same relation to the superior central organization as does a local post office to the office of the postmaster general. The second pattern we may call it the Hindenburg or German pattern nominally and seemingly preserves private ownership of markets prices wages and interest rates.

	onyx:emotionText "Of thousands of films books and plays on the communist experience this one stands out above all the rest  a monument to millions of innocent victims and a charge against a bloodthirsty socialist theory that killed almost two hundred million people in the 20th century and continues its murderous trail into the 21st.The film was directed by a talented Latvian producer Edvns nore. In its synopsis nore writes This is a story of an Allied power which helped the Nazis to fight Jews and which slaughtered its own people on an industrial scale. Assisted by the West this power triumphed on May 9th 1945. Its crimes were made taboo and the complete story of Europe's most murderous regime has never been told.The film argues that there were close philosophical political and military relations between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union before and during the early stages of World War II. It highlights the Great Famine the infamous holodomor which wiped out seven million Ukrainians the Great Purge in Moscow and elsewhere in the USSR with over eleven million murdered as well as the Katyn massacre of tens of thousands of Polish officers.The film sheds the light on GestapoNKVD collaboration in mass murder of Jews and German opposition Soviet mass deportations and inhuman medical experiments in the GULAG.The Economist praises the film by saying Soviet Story is the most powerful antidote yet to the sanitisation of the past. The film is gripping audacious and uncompromising. The main aim of the film is to show the close connectionsphilosophical political and organisationalbetween the Nazi and Soviet systems Those who keep a soft spot for Marxism may flinch to hear that the sage of Highgate referred to backward societies as Vlkerabflle racial trash who must perish in the revolutionary holocaust. Or that the Nazi party in its early days idolised Lenin Josef Goebbels said he was second only to Adolf Hitler in greatness.This is a revelation for some. Ludwig Von Mises wrote about Nazism and communism as two forms of the same socialist tyranny for a long time. He analyzed two patterns for the realization of socialism when he wrote The first pattern we may call it the Lenin or the Russian pattern is purely bureaucratic. All plants shops and farms are formally nationalized verstaatlicht they are departments of the government operated by civil servants. Every unit of the apparatus of production stands in the same relation to the superior central organization as does a local post office to the office of the postmaster general. The second pattern we may call it the Hindenburg or German pattern nominally and seemingly preserves private ownership of markets prices wages and interest rates. There are however no longer entrepreneurs but only shop managers Betriebsfuhrer in the terminology of the Nazi legislation.Both systems as Von Mises pointed out were inevitably doomed to result in barbarism as they promptly did.The film features interviews with western and Russian historians such as Norman Davies and George Watson from Cambridge Boris Sokolov Russian writer Viktor Suvorov Soviet dissident Vladimir Bukovsky members of the European Parliament and the participants as well as the victims of Soviet and Nazi terror.Eminent British literary historian George Watson proved in his research that Karl Marx is the ancestor of the modern political genocide.

Unfortunately the answers to these questions are not short and not without some work. And perhaps not bound to be contained in movie documentaries however well performed as is this one.

	schema:reviewBody "Supported by a fringe neofascist faction of the European Parliament which includes proNazi glorifiers xenophobes and antiSemites of the Fatherland and Freedom Latvia Lega Nord Italy and the Law and Justice Party Poland this propaganda piece with lies and innuendo seeks to generate hatred towards Russia and blacken the image of progressive forces throughout the world.There is nothing new with the approach of this film. Desperate attempts to blacken the Russian Government and equate it to Nazi Germany is part of the old Cold War propaganda struggle waged by the United States Government and neofascist organizations like the John Birch Society. This is ironic given the fact that this film has received the enthusiastic support of the cryptoNazis of Latvia's For Fatherland and Freedom party. Especially disturbing about the revisionism of this film is the denial of the Holocaust by seeking to shift blame from the actual criminals to Russia.To start this piece of pseudohistory does not include contributions from any respected qualified scholars specializing in Russian history or political science from institutions of higher education. One contributor to the film George Watson fabricates and misinterprets quotations from Marx and Engels. Watson it should be noted is not a professor of history political science or any field relating to the film's subject. And while this film presents itself to be some kind of groundbreaking investigation of Russian history it is curious how not a professor of history from Russia is found in this film. Rather the documentary features a freak show composed of degenerates from radical rightwing parties such as Kristovskis of the the aforementioned For Fatherland and Freedom party of Lavia.Concerning the invented quotations of Marx and Engels it is claimed in this film that Engels called Slavs dirty and opposed the existence of Poland. But this is a a falsification of history because Marx and Engels had long been some of the most passionate supporters of Polish independence particularly the 1863 uprising. The film makes the outrageous claim that Marx and Engels called for a revolutionary holocaust against specific peoples. But Engels did not call for the destruction of what he called counterrevolutionary nations but only predicted that such people would experience setbacks as they struggled with the progressive nations. In 1890 Engels would write positively on these backwards nations believing in their right to selfdetermination Magyars Romanians Serbs Bulgars Albanians Greeks and Turks will then finally be in a position to...manage their own internal affairs according to their own judgment. It should be noted however that Marxism is not some kind of immutable dogma Marx and Engels regularly revised their work and acknowledged their errors and mistakes that they previously made.The film makes the spurious claim that a famine throughout Russia and elsewhere in the Soviet Union constituted a genocide against Ukraine that killed 7 million. But as scholars have noted the famine was in no way limited to the Ukraine but affected much of the country. To talk about a Ukrainian Golodomor is a misrepresentation of history. Contrary to what the film and its sources claim the death toll was nowhere near 7 million. Professor Wheatcroft for example estimated that the death toll amounted to an estimated 4 to 5 million throughout the USSR including 1.5 million in Ukraine. And as Tauger proves in his research the famine to a large extent resulted from natural disasters. In particular Extremely dry weather had the effect of reducing crops while extremely wet and humid weather later on led to infestations. And rather than desiring the famine the Soviet Government took measures to provide relief to those areas affected by the famine.Other monstrously false claims made in this film include the lies that Russia refused to enter into an antifascist alliance with the Western Powers Gestapo staff trained the NKVD Russia's extradition of Jews to the Gestapo and Russia's involvement in the extermination of Jews which I do not have the space to go into detail about.Rather than wasting your time with this pathetic excuse for a propaganda film a better choice would be to go to college and study the work of respected scholars to learn the truth.".

Desperate attempts to blacken the Russian Government and equate it to Nazi Germany is part of the old Cold War propaganda struggle waged by the United States Government and neofascist organizations like the John Birch Society. This is ironic given the fact that this film has received the enthusiastic support of the cryptoNazis of Latvia's For Fatherland and Freedom party. Especially disturbing about the revisionism of this film is the denial of the Holocaust by seeking to shift blame from the actual criminals to Russia.To start this piece of pseudohistory does not include contributions from any respected qualified scholars specializing in Russian history or political science from institutions of higher education. One contributor to the film George Watson fabricates and misinterprets quotations from Marx and Engels. Watson it should be noted is not a professor of history political science or any field relating to the film's subject. And while this film presents itself to be some kind of groundbreaking investigation of Russian history it is curious how not a professor of history from Russia is found in this film. Rather the documentary features a freak show composed of degenerates from radical rightwing parties such as Kristovskis of the the aforementioned For Fatherland and Freedom party of Lavia.Concerning the invented quotations of Marx and Engels it is claimed in this film that Engels called Slavs dirty and opposed the existence of Poland. But this is a a falsification of history because Marx and Engels had long been some of the most passionate supporters of Polish independence particularly the 1863 uprising. The film makes the outrageous claim that Marx and Engels called for a revolutionary holocaust against specific peoples. But Engels did not call for the destruction of what he called counterrevolutionary nations but only predicted that such people would experience setbacks as they struggled with the progressive nations. In 1890 Engels would write positively on these backwards nations believing in their right to selfdetermination Magyars Romanians Serbs Bulgars Albanians Greeks and Turks will then finally be in a position to...manage their own internal affairs according to their own judgment. It should be noted however that Marxism is not some kind of immutable dogma Marx and Engels regularly revised their work and acknowledged their errors and mistakes that they previously made.The film makes the spurious claim that a famine throughout Russia and elsewhere in the Soviet Union constituted a genocide against Ukraine that killed 7 million. But as scholars have noted the famine was in no way limited to the Ukraine but affected much of the country. To talk about a Ukrainian Golodomor is a misrepresentation of history. Contrary to what the film and its sources claim the death toll was nowhere near 7 million. Professor Wheatcroft for example estimated that the death toll amounted to an estimated 4 to 5 million throughout the USSR including 1.5 million in Ukraine. And as Tauger proves in his research the famine to a large extent resulted from natural disasters. In particular Extremely dry weather had the effect of reducing crops while extremely wet and humid weather later on led to infestations. And rather than desiring the famine the Soviet Government took measures to provide relief to those areas affected by the famine.Other monstrously false claims made in this film include the lies that Russia refused to enter into an antifascist alliance with the Western Powers Gestapo staff trained the NKVD Russia's extradition of Jews to the Gestapo and Russia's involvement in the extermination of Jews which I do not have the space to go into detail about.Rather than wasting your time with this pathetic excuse for a propaganda film a better choice would be to go to college and study the work of respected scholars to learn the truth.";

	schema:reviewBody "From the disturbed mind of Latvian director Edvins Snore comes an evil masterpiece titled The Soviet Story. It's so bad that it has to be seen to be believed. It's filled with lies lies and more lies. The poster alone should tell you that it's purely propaganda the statue of the worker and the peasant on top of a pile of human corpses. The film includes a creepy narration huge red titles and constant footage of corpses. The Soviet Story won't be taken seriously by viewers in the future. The best Western documentary about the Second World War is titled The World At War 1973. The World At War has faults and one can say that it's also antiRussian. But at least it tries to provide a somewhat objective look at what happened during that war. Adolf Hitler was broken in Russia and the Soviet Union suffered 19 million civilian deaths. This sort of information surely isn't mentioned in The Soviet Story. Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union did have a nonaggression pact due to convenience but Joseph Stalin approved it only because he wanted Russia to stay out of the war at that time. Stalin knew what the British and the French were plotting and he had good reasons to distrust the imperialists. In addition to this Stalin's critics exaggerate the number of victims of his regime to numbers beyond belief. This tells me one thing they don't care about the dead. The several million deaths resulting from state policies are attributed to political repression and rapid industrialization. The Soviet Union lasted until 1991 and what's shown in this inaccurate horror flick supposedly happened before 1950. I wonder what results Snore would have had if he instead channeled his criticism towards Nazism and Fascism European imperialists or the slavery and landgrabs of the Americans. There's also the matter of Western financiers and monopolists against whom Stalin had to fight. I'm not going to go into this matter but I will mention that they brought Hitler to power and they seriously opposed the Soviet Union ever since Stalin abandoned the project of world revolution.Reliable critics and historians already heavily criticized The Soviet Story. One of Snore's tactics is using footage of the dead and claiming that these were the victims of Communism. Can someone sink any lower? The supposed dead from the famine of 1932 here are in fact Russian and German dead from World War I. How do I know this? It's because I've seen the same footage in the acclaimed 1964 documentary series The Great War. But this doesn't bother a man like Snore. He just throws anything that he can find into the blender and hopes for an effective result. So what you get is pictures taken at Nazi concentration camps presented as pictures taken at Soviet labour camps. It's really disturbing how much false footage is used in this film. He claims that his countrymen were brutally oppressed by the Russians. Well there was some oppression during the Stalin period but it certainly wasn't like what Snore imagines. Snore somehow didn't mention that his countrymen joined the Wehrmacht and the SS during the war and then hunted down and killed thousands of Jews and Socialists. Some even participated in the slaughter of civilians in Russia. At the end of the film Snore takes a stab at the second president of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin. Now we get to see why this film was actually released. It was released by a Russophobe to spread antiRussian sentiment. The dissolution of the Soviet Union took place 20 years ago and life got worse in the countries which were part of it. The Soviet government is no more but history continues. Russia was hit hard by the economic problems caused by Capitalism and the West. But countries like Latvia fared little better. Populations in former Soviet republics have been decreasing ever since. The current Westernbacked regimes of the Baltic states want to hide what really happened and instead blame and lie about Russia. Deranged people like Edvins Snore are going to praise this awful film. These poor souls need emotional healing. Those who want reliable information should find something else preferably a good history book.".

While the film tried to make these ideas sound ghastly one only has to turn to the modern western democracy to find its roots in the bloody French Revolution. Weren't entire sects of a society wiped out in that instance? Revolutionary tactics are not exclusive to Communism.The film goes on to say with a negative tone that the Soviet state was content to wipe out entire nations to further the progress of it's superior nation. However this is implying that imperialism is also unique only to Soviet Russia. Did the European colonial powers not exploit and exterminate native nations around the world for hundreds of years? Once again the totalitarian regime of Stalin and his predecessors did not commit their heinous crimes in the name of socialism but rather in the name of power.While 'The Soviet Story' is a great example of government manipulation political oppression and megalomaniacs it does not justify it's own doomed thesis that the entire Soviet State was founded on oppression. The short scene on fate of Trotsky who was a Leninist is enough to prove it was Stalin not Lenin who was the true villain.

	schema:headline " The Soviet Story fails at being informative because it's first and foremost propaganda.";
	schema:reviewBody "There was a bit of fuss about this film so I watched it it's not easy to find though. It can't be taken seriously because it's obviously propaganda. The film's poster alone should tell you that the statue of the worker and the peasant on top of a pile of human corpses. I've seen similar antiSoviet documentaries before. The film includes a creepy narration huge red titles constant footage of corpses and it's full of errors. If you already have a good knowledge of the Soviet regime and of the two World Wars then you won't find much that's new in The Soviet Story. This film just turns up the heat on what's been said before and the way it does this is by showing gruesome footage backed by an effective musical score. Is it an objective film? No. Any good documentary should be. This film's intent is to just be antiSoviet. It's because of this that The Soviet Story won't be taken seriously by viewers in the future. The best documentary about the Second World War is called The World At War 1973. The World At War does not demonize the Nazi regime but provides an objective look at it's failures evils and even triumphs which mostly happened in war. It shows what caused those evils. The Russians are shown in a positive way as they should be because Hitler was broken in Russia and the Soviet Union suffered 19 million civilian deaths. No one can argue with that. None of this information is included in The Soviet Story. One of this film's strongest points is that Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were allies before 1941. Not true. They did have a pact but Stalin approved it only because he wanted the USSR to stay out of the war at that time. It's well known that Stalin's purges caused the deaths of many people. Perhaps as many as 1.2 million. The Soviet Story makes a case that this spread to Soviet occupied lands. That's mostly true but there were hardly any such murders in the Baltic states. Another thing that puzzles me is why the film is called The Soviet Story. The Soviet Union lasted until 1991 and yet what's shown in the film happened before 1950. Shouldn't it be called something like The Evils Of Stalin's Regime? There were no famines or purges after Stalin's death in the Soviet Union. What about the Cold War and the Space Race?I read that several members of the European Parliament all from Eastern Europe gave this film positive reviews. And yet there are others like Tatjana Zdanoka Latvian MEP and historian Alexander Dyukov who said that the film has errors and that it's a propagandistic odd job which is given out to be a new word in history. Dyukov alleges inconsistencies in the film and questions the credibility of some of the film sequences and conclusions of some of the Russian and Western historians interviewed in the film. Latvian political scientist and cultural commentator Ivars Ijabs offers a mixed review of The Soviet Story. On one hand it is a wellmade and effective piece of cinematic propaganda in the good sense of this word whose message is clearly presented to the audience. On the other hand Ijabs does not agree with a number of historical interpretations in the film asserting that it contains errors.Edvins Snore the director should really be ashamed of his film. He included scenes which weren't even about what was said. There was a scene where officers are drinking and giving a toast. The film claims this as proof of NaziSoviet collaboration. In fact there were no Russians present at that meeting. Another example is a scene where Russian war dead were shown from World War I. The film instead claims that these were Ukrainian dead from the 1932 famine. I know this because this same scene was shown in the acclaimed British documentary series The Great War 1964. And these are just the scenes that I know of. There are definitely more of these. A news story about the film informed me that pictures taken at Nazi concentration camps were presented as pictures taken at Soviet labour camps in the film and that a Latvian proNazi parade was said to be a Soviet parade. A fake picture made by Nazi followers was presented as proof of NaziSoviet collaboration in it Heinrich Himmler is shown touring Soviet labour camps and learning from the Soviets. Can a movie that has so many errors some even intentional be taken seriously? Of course not. And what's more disturbing is that Snore at the end uses his film to take a stab at the second president of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin. How does a Russian president fit in a film about the Soviet Union? No wonder The Soviet Story wasn't released on home video. No one would buy this historically inaccurate horror flick.I guess the question is why was The Soviet Story released? The answer is to spread antiSoviet and antiRussian sentiment. The Soviet Union disintegrated two decades ago so what is the point of a film that strongly criticizes a regime that hasn't existed for a generation already? The answer is yet again politics. Latvia the country where the film was made and other former Soviet satellites are afraid of Russian domination. Even with the fall of communism the situation in those countries hasn't improved much and in some cases deteriorated. The current government blames Russia even though Russia isn't involved in those countries' internal affairs. The Soviet Story is a badly made film but those with antiRussian feelings are going to eat it up. I don't recommend it because The Soviet Story is in parts untrue and in all parts extreme. To say that the far right is just like the far left is a major mistake. Those looking for trustworthy information should find something else preferrably a history book.".

	onyx:emotionText "There was a bit of fuss about this film so I watched it it's not easy to find though. It can't be taken seriously because it's obviously propaganda. The film's poster alone should tell you that the statue of the worker and the peasant on top of a pile of human corpses. I've seen similar antiSoviet documentaries before. The film includes a creepy narration huge red titles constant footage of corpses and it's full of errors. If you already have a good knowledge of the Soviet regime and of the two World Wars then you won't find much that's new in The Soviet Story. This film just turns up the heat on what's been said before and the way it does this is by showing gruesome footage backed by an effective musical score. Is it an objective film? No. Any good documentary should be. This film's intent is to just be antiSoviet. It's because of this that The Soviet Story won't be taken seriously by viewers in the future. The best documentary about the Second World War is called The World At War 1973. The World At War does not demonize the Nazi regime but provides an objective look at it's failures evils and even triumphs which mostly happened in war. It shows what caused those evils. The Russians are shown in a positive way as they should be because Hitler was broken in Russia and the Soviet Union suffered 19 million civilian deaths. No one can argue with that. None of this information is included in The Soviet Story. One of this film's strongest points is that Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were allies before 1941. Not true. They did have a pact but Stalin approved it only because he wanted the USSR to stay out of the war at that time. It's well known that Stalin's purges caused the deaths of many people. Perhaps as many as 1.2 million. The Soviet Story makes a case that this spread to Soviet occupied lands. That's mostly true but there were hardly any such murders in the Baltic states. Another thing that puzzles me is why the film is called The Soviet Story. The Soviet Union lasted until 1991 and yet what's shown in the film happened before 1950. Shouldn't it be called something like The Evils Of Stalin's Regime? There were no famines or purges after Stalin's death in the Soviet Union. What about the Cold War and the Space Race?I read that several members of the European Parliament all from Eastern Europe gave this film positive reviews. And yet there are others like Tatjana Zdanoka Latvian MEP and historian Alexander Dyukov who said that the film has errors and that it's a propagandistic odd job which is given out to be a new word in history. Dyukov alleges inconsistencies in the film and questions the credibility of some of the film sequences and conclusions of some of the Russian and Western historians interviewed in the film. Latvian political scientist and cultural commentator Ivars Ijabs offers a mixed review of The Soviet Story. On one hand it is a wellmade and effective piece of cinematic propaganda in the good sense of this word whose message is clearly presented to the audience. On the other hand Ijabs does not agree with a number of historical interpretations in the film asserting that it contains errors.Edvins Snore the director should really be ashamed of his film. He included scenes which weren't even about what was said. There was a scene where officers are drinking and giving a toast. The film claims this as proof of NaziSoviet collaboration. In fact there were no Russians present at that meeting. Another example is a scene where Russian war dead were shown from World War I. The film instead claims that these were Ukrainian dead from the 1932 famine. I know this because this same scene was shown in the acclaimed British documentary series The Great War 1964. And these are just the scenes that I know of. There are definitely more of these. A news story about the film informed me that pictures taken at Nazi concentration camps were presented as pictures taken at Soviet labour camps in the film and that a Latvian proNazi parade was said to be a Soviet parade.

	schema:reviewBody "The horror was inexcusable but there is no mention of our own benefit from this horror. All the World or at least the elites controlling all nations were opposing the Soviets. Thirteen nations invaded to help the White Russians put down the Communist revolt. From the beginning Stalin knew well that Germany wanted a resource rich empire and that the Colonial powers had always thwarted any effort to compete with them in Africa and Asia so they needed to go east. Stalin also had the Japanese threatening on his eastern border where they had been fighting since the Battle of Tsushima. He was desperate to industrialize and build a modern army but the rest of the World wouldn't help a communist country and refused all trade. It was only through confiscating the grain for sale on the international market that he managed to buy enough modern tools to start industry. Thinking the Japanese the lesser threat he built much of that industry in the East. In May of 1939 he attacked the Japanese and defeated them in what was the largest tank battle up to that time. Having started from a feudal society this was an amazing accomplishment. Without this attack by Stalin well ahead of war in Europe the army would have won the argument in Japan and joined Germany and Italy in attacking Russia from all sides. Instead the Navy won the argument and the Japanese went south. In August he signed the pact with Germany stalling off their attack and pushing his western boundary west to the centre of Poland. He may also have sent some resources to Germany as depicted again to stave off the attack he clearly knew was inevitable. Once Germany attacked the Russians fought back as best they could. They were the proletariat with no hundred year old military colleges so their command and control was the worst possible against German officers with a hundred year tradition behind them. They built more tanks and more planes in every month of the war than did the Germans but the planes especially were no match for the Messhersmits. It was a victory if a Russian plane could kill one German tank before it was shot down. In the largest tank battle ever fought at Kursk 100000 Germans were killed or wounded vs. 850000 Russians. They fought poorly but if they hadn't been tying up the bulk of the German army Britain would certainly have fallen and the Third Reich would be with us still. I repeat we are the major beneficiaries of Stalin's stealing of the grain the nerve to attack the Japanese and the resolve to sacrifice any number of his 'comrades' fighting the Germans.".

	schema:headline " Definitely Not Another Teen Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "In a world wrought with unoriginal and humorlacking teen movies The Girl Next Door provides a beacon of light. The director's hardest battle was to insure that although 90 of the cast are teenagers that this movie should not be labeled as a teen comedy.The first comparison that should be made between your average Hollywood teen offering and this movie is the humor. Some movies American Pie 1 Road Trip are genuinely funny but in a slapstick way. The Girl Next Door provides more intelligent jokes Eli saying that Matthews's motel advances towards Danielle was a little forthcoming for instance.Even after this fact is acknowledged it is still tempting to accuse The Girl Next Door of being a teen movie but suddenly the thought springs to mind. Hang on did that movie have a story line? And the answer is of course too right it did. The story line revolves around a life changing loss of innocence for primarily Matthew and Danielle and secondarily Eli and Klits.Matthew starts the movie in a tether of his scholarship acquirement's he spends hours studying and speech revising. enter Danielle in the space of 2 weeks she turns Matthew from a text book geek into the king of the school I refer of course to his control over the jocks on prom night.. Danielle for all her real world experience is an emotional black hole. Matthew in the movie breaks threw this and Danielle makes love for the first time.Eli the local porn king thinks he sexually knows it all however even the slightest sexual conduct and he turns and runs i.e. the porn star asking EliKlitz to feel his girlfriends breasts. Klitz like Matthew is a text book nerd and lacks any confidence in his appearance what so ever. With the help of April he breaks through this gaining a silent reputation for the prominence of his manhood.So let's compare these major story lines to some admitted teen movies. American Pie 2 The story line singular in this story is to go on vacation and get laid. WOW. Not exactly a feast for the thought. Road Trip This time round the storyline singular is that a guy suddenly realizes that his pen pal is a girl and sets of on a several thousand mile trip to profess his undying love.. Rubbish.One similarity I am happy to point out between this work and the selfproclaimed teen movies is that it has an excellent sound track. A few examples of the excellent choices in music would be David Gray's This Years Loving. This song perfectly matched the budding affections of Danielle and Matthew both while they share their first kiss and when there have sex for the first time. On a smaller scale Lapdance by NERD perfectly captures the moment when the new and improved Matthew strolls into the Prom and officially becomes the Godfather of the school. On the topic of the sound track I could go on for pages so ill just stop that now.The best movie to compare this piece to is Risky Business. You've all seen it I'm sure. The academically perfect Tom Cruise's parents do away for the weekend. And Cruise erupts. Going wild for the weekend he dance around the house pantsless easily one of the most famous scenes in movie history and more importantly from a story line point of view meets and falls in love with hooker Lana Rebecca De Mornay. On comparison I preferred The Girl Next Door. The relationship between HirshCuthbert is far more convincing then that of CruiseDe Mornay and more importantly there was no real foundation for the change in Cruises character whereas Matthew is forced out of his shell by the lifeoffun character of Danielle.Unfortunately Risky Business is unshakable from it pillar as one of the best movies ever. But the Girl Next Door deserves to stand right up there beside is it.If you haven't seen this movie but have read this. sorry. but go get the movie anyway trust me i didn't talk about about 90 of the content of this masterpiece. If you have seen it then I hope you agree with my synopsis.This movie is worthy of much more recognition then it is currently receiving. And ill bet that the reason is in the first eleven words of this review.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Girl Next Door's tagline Matt didn't see her coming...but all his friends have! is very deceiving because the movie is not like that at all. When you see this you'll expect a raunchy borderline porn movie but what you get is a refreshing adorable and sweet love story with great performances from Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert.Matthew Kidman Emile Hirsch The Emperor's Club Lords of Dogtown is not a geek by any means. He's your everyday nice guy who's never really 'lived'. He is the top student the class president and he's in charge of bringing a teenage super genius to the U.S.A. Everything is going fantastic because he even gets accepted to Georgetown. Only problem is he needs the money to get to the school and this can only be paid by winning a scholarship. A few days before his speech on why he deserves the scholarship Matt meets Danielle Elisha Cuthbert '24' Weezer's 'Perfect Situation video a breathtakingly beautiful girl who after a hilarious few scenes where they meet he instantly falls for and she falls for him.For the first part of the movie you see Danielle the near unfairly sexy girl push Matt to limits he hasn't gone to such as running in the street naked swimming in a stranger's pool and skipping school. They're falling in love and it's easy to see on screen and it's adorable.Just when it can't get any better for Matt things take a turn for the worse. One of his best friends Eli the hilarious Chris Marquette who is a massive porn addict goes through his collection and finds a tape...and who is the star? Danielle. Turns out Danielle had just quit her job as a porn star and decided to turn over a new leaf. After a near tearjerking scene Danielle returns to her old career by contacting her old boss a gritty and suave porn producer named Kelly Tim Olyphant. It's at this point that Matt decides that he doesn't care about Danielle's past and he's in love with her. He decides that he'll do anything to get her back including taking on Kelly the porn industry and some very weird people.After some events the plot strays away from just Matt and Danielle and thickens to become a real movie not just a teen movie. The movie does an excellent job of keeping us interested because just as the plot becomes serious Eli and Matt's other friend Klitz add some very funny moments and ideas. Yes the movie does sound like the classic Risky Business but it does things that separate itself from that movie. The chemistry between Hirsch and Cuthbert is magical and despite her gigantic sex appeal the character of Danielle is so lovable for how sweet and caring she is to Matt. There are some great plot twists that keep you interested not to mention hilarious in jokes and one liners and not to mention a classic quote The juice was worth the squeeze. You'll understand. Tim Olyphant is great in a somewhat opposing role and veteran actor James Remar makes a few appearances as a porn producing giant. The movie's ending is so great and funny that you can't help but enjoy not to mention mysterious keeping you hanging by a thread the whole way through.Luke Greenfield has directed a movie that is so well liked and cherished that I have never heard a bad thing against this film I'm 17 and all my friends guys and girls loved it. I own it on DVD and have watched it at least 10 times. I've finally gotten around to writing a review because writing this has reminded me of how great this movie is. In a few one word sentences The Girl Next Door is...fun. hilarious. sweet. lovable. classic. I recommend this movie to anyone from the ages of 13 to 30 because this is the age group it is intended for.".

This happens throughout the movie making The Girl Next Door one of the most charming smart and subversive teen comedies I've seen in a long time  beautifully written perfectly cast a real pleasure from start to finish.  Emile Hirsch Elisha Cuthbert and Timothy Olyphant shine in their respective roles as the young man at a crossroads in his life the girl next door of the title equally confused and the scuzball with a heart who knows he has to do the right thing even if it goes against his 'business instincts.' These characters are not onedimensional thanks to the superb writing nor are they caricatures they come across as genuine individuals and the comedy in the film comes not at their expense but rather organically as part of their journey. As Olyphant's character asks Hirsch at one point Is the juice worth the squeeze? In this case it most definitely is.".

Just when you think you've got the next twist figured out you're surprised.  This happens throughout the movie making The Girl Next Door one of the most charming smart and subversive teen comedies I've seen in a long time  beautifully written perfectly cast a real pleasure from start to finish.  Emile Hirsch Elisha Cuthbert and Timothy Olyphant shine in their respective roles as the young man at a crossroads in his life the girl next door of the title equally confused and the scuzball with a heart who knows he has to do the right thing even if it goes against his 'business instincts.' These characters are not onedimensional thanks to the superb writing nor are they caricatures they come across as genuine individuals and the comedy in the film comes not at their expense but rather organically as part of their journey. As Olyphant's character asks Hirsch at one point Is the juice worth the squeeze? In this case it most definitely is.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Girl Next Door isn't a riotous laughoutloud comedy  la American Pie or Road Trip don't get me wrong I think they are fine movies of a different genre nor should it be treated as such when being reviewed. It's much more mature a sweet delight of a story that has you chuckling in amusement rather than rolling on the floor guffawing. For that I would hardly even classify it in the generic 'comedy' genre. I must admit I did go in thinking that I'd spend two hours of my life enjoying yet another teen comedy with an overdone plot jokes bordering on distasteful and up to the brim with gratuitous nudity. However I came out with so much more.It's a classic tale of boymeetsgirl boy falls in love with girl boy lives happily ever after with girl. But what makes The Girl Next Door stand out from the rest is the superb cast. The casting director did a great job placing Emile Hirsch opposite Elisha Cuthbert both very talented young upandcoming actors I wish them well in luck love and life. The pair's onscreen chemistry is undeniably electric. They portrayed Matthew and Danielle's relationship perfectly  loving and tender yet fragile. This boy has fallen hopelessly in love for the first time with the girl of his dreams. He has no past experience to draw on he's terrified and confused and he doesn't know what to do! As director Luke Greenfield pointed out in his commentary Unrated DVD is a musthave for the hardcore fans Emile and Elisha were chosen for their ability to act without dialogue simply with their eyes. The subtleties in each expression brings so much more to the characters when watched closely in detail  every nervous bite of the lip every slight mischievous arch in the eyebrow  you can tell exactly what they're thinking. Now I've seen my fair share of moviesTV shows and I'd be confident in saying that I have not yet seen another actoractress able to fill those roles as perfectly and effortlessly as Emile and Elisha did. They must've poured their hearts out into these characters bringing them to life their romance blossoming onscreen.And how can we ignore the superb supporting cast? Timothy Olyphant and Chris Marquette's work on this movie was simply priceless. They provided the comedy and laughs and it would be impossible to list all of their hilarious oneliners here. A lot of people claim that they made the movie and though I disagree I can sure see where they're coming from.And the music oh the music. I came of no great surprise to me to learn that Luke Greenfield writes all his projects to music. It is this unique trait that embellishes the movie with such a vivid background. From Bowie  Queen's Under Pressure opening montage to The Who's Baba O'Riley closing credits every single song is perfect for its scene particularly David Gray's This Year's Love mine and many other's favourite song in the soundtrack. It kicks in at the exact right moment and manages to capture everything about this innocent pure high school romance. Also Paul Haslinger second to none at composing scores wrote some of his best work for The Girl Next Door. Simply put again stealing lines from the director Haslinger is deadly with a piano. Each score enhances and fills the moment with such tension and suspense most notably Peeping Matt when Matthew watches this gorgeous creature undressing through his window for the first time. There is an element of voyeurism and the excitement of the danger of being caught as he watches the female movement and form unravelling with fascination and awe. He simply can't keep his eyes off her. It's a scene that many of us can connect with.This is indeed one of those movies that ought to be watched on a DVD at night alone rather than on a huge screen in the cinema with others. You'll find yourself leaving the end with a bittersweet aftertaste  will I find that special someone like Danielle? Do I need to be broken out of my shell? Is the juice worth the squeeze? Sure it is an idealist fantasy but it's also sweet endearing and full of heart. It's how an oldschool love story ought be done. Just suspend your belief for two hours and watch the magic happen. Hell just go with it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I did not see this movie in theaters. I usually wait for teen films to come out on video before viewing them. I must say the way this movie was marketed one would figure that this flick is along the lines of such classics as Bring It On and Can't Hardly Wait. Though this movie definitely is now part of the illustrious teen film library it runs a little bit deeper than the average adolescent flick.As the title suggest this movie does have Risky Business written all over it. The characters the pimp vs the adult film director the props glass egg vs the golden trophy as well as the music and language definitely give this film an updated twist on RB. However it would be erroneous to write this film off as a ripoff it just isn't afraid to show it's influence.Emile Hirsch is great as Matthew Kidman the ambitious high school senior who actually looks like he's in high school with an Ivy League future. Straight and narrow his life is spun on it's head once Danielle Elisha Cuthbert enters the picture. Cuthbert playing a freespirited porn star actually gives a rather understated performance that is sincere and sweet. Matthew's once planned out life is now lived more on the edge and with that he encounters some interesting characters such as Kelly the shady porn director played flawlessly by Timothy Olyphant.However as the film progresses the movie didn't delve as deeply into Cuthbert's character as it should have. No insight into her background how did she get to where she is right now etc. She also takes a back seat to the growing tension between the Matthew and the sleazebag Kelly. I must say Olyphant is great in this film. He goes from being hilarious to charming to scary in the span of about five minutes and steals almost every scene he's in. The other supporting characters are great. Chris Marquette Eli and Paul Dano Klitz are funny as Hirsch's dorky friends and hopefully Marquette will land more roles like this. They too seem to become more adventurous once Danielle enters the picture what an influence one person can have.So in the end this does have a lot of the typical teen flick campiness. There are jocks hot chicks on campus geeks and the movie itself has plenty of swearing bathroom humor slapstick you name it. There is a sweetness to the movie as it's amazing what a person will do when they fall in love. This movie has plenty of twists and turns so come along for the ride and have some fun.".

All of this is incredibly beneficial but oh to have a neighbor like Elisha Cuthbert!Elisha plays the 'girl' in the new teen film The Girl Next Door directed by Luke Greenfield The Animal.  Her name is Danielle and she arrives just when neighbor Mathew Kidman Emile Hirsch is writing a speech in hopes of getting a scholarship for his portrayal of moral fiber.  But one look at the stripping Danielle from his bedroom window to hers leaves every fiber pointing in a different direction.This small act of voyeurism leads to all sorts of trouble as Danielle notices her admirers' gazing and immediately heads next door to confront young Matthew.  The result of their new courtship would lead to public nudity breaking and entering skipping school taking drugs and everything else that we used to brag about without merit in High School.And just as everything seems to be going extremely well for the young Matthew one of his geek buddies reveals her true identity that of an upandcoming porn star.  This revelation comes shortly before the arrival of her pimp film producer Kelly Deadwood's Timothy Olyphant who throws a wrench into the infatuational plans of the two neighbors and leads Matthew down a path that jeopardizes his endeavor to win the scholarship.   Soon Kelly and Matthew are attending strip clubs meeting in Vegas and eventually the two are involved in a robbery where Matt tries to win the freedom of the young Danielle.Much has been made of The Girl Next Door's resemblance to the 1983 Tom Cruise film Risky Business.  Truly the comparisons cannot be more obvious. Instead of hookers we have porn stars.  Instead of a house party we have a prom and where there is a family heirloom in play with Cruise's film Hirsch must pull out all the stops in order to obtain a 25000 bank account that was amassed to bring a Cambodian teenager to America.But with all these comparisons evident I enjoyed The Girl Next Door more. The High School situations have been updated and I believed in how Matthew could be easily drawn into his world of love and admiration something I didn't feel with Cruise and DeMornay.Don't get me wrong The Girl Next Door will not have the impact of Risky Business nor will it be the catapult for either Hirsch or Cuthbert that Business was for Cruise.  But it still was a rather enjoyable film.  Not filled with situations bordering on the asinine see American Pie's 2 through 3 The Girl Next Door was a smart film that resembled a John Hughes film of the early 1980's.  I enjoyed all the characters from the geeks who are trying to find their sexual niche to the awkwardness and mature awakening of Matthew through the ordeal of following his dreams.  Whereas adolescent films recently have skewed into gross out comedy in such entries as The New Guy American Pie and Van Wilder The Girl Next Door gives us something fresh a progressive out of character plot backed by the love of a beautiful woman.All these funny and interesting struggles lead to the senior prom where the result might seem far fetched but at least it seems as if the director meant it not to be taken with any notion of seriousness.  We understand the good guys from the bad guys and the movie makes no attempts to throw a surprise or two our way.  Maybe in its simplicity it has found the answer to rejuvenating the youthful film movement.So back to my original blabbering.   Oh to have a neighbor like Elisha Cuthbert!  First noticed wearing pink panties in the 2003 popular film Old School she is something to behold.  But can she fix a ball cock?  Don't answer that!".

I think a lot of guys will be able to relate to Emile Hirsch's charactera young guy who is trying so hard to break out of his shell. Along comes Elisha who is more worldly and adventurous and who actually likes him. He'd follow this girl anywhere and not one of us could blame him for girls like this rarely come along in life.The plot is somewhat predictable but the movie has enough funny quirky and memorable characters that you will enjoy it anyway. There is one very memorable kiss which takes place at a party while David Gray's This Years Love plays in the background. This same song plays again at the end when they are in the limo but interestingly enough the song is not included on the movie soundtrack CD??? For guys like myself who are a little older the movie represents a time in life when anything is possible and within reach if you just have that unreachablebeautiful woman by your side. Thing is most young guys never believe they could get a girl like Elisha. So the movie is about much more than a porno star moving next door. Its about taking risks putting your heart out there reaching for what you want even though it appears unreachable. And finally God is Elisha Cuthbert just unreal!!!".

Emile Hirsch performs passably well with the material he is given and the luscious Elisha Cuthbert provides plenty of eye candy that she could not show in 24. The rest of the characters are onedimensional and barely worthy of mention. But the show belongs to Timothy Olyphant. Although he does not even appear until halfway through the film his role makes the entire movie worth watching again. He screen presence is palpable as the ultracool bad boy that every man secretly wishes to be. Scruffy chainsmoking alternately funny friendly then dangerous he owns every scene in which he appears. Seeing this film makes one that much more anxious for the next season of JUSTIFIED to begin!".

After reading the description plot summary on the interactive program guide I figured that this would be just the sleeping pill I needed to go to sleep with. Thankfully enough I was wrong. As others have mentioned this film pays homage to Risky Business but in its own quirky way. Emile Hirsch simply comes across as a very likable high school kid who's never taken any kind of risk has always had his life planned out has his future all lined up... Until SHE moves in next door. Elisha Cuthberts' character starts out promising but falls flat. There isn't enough development into her backstory aside from one quick reference to her high school days no real telling of her story overall. Which isn't to say her performance was flat it was well above par and a whole different direction from the character she played on 24. Timothy Olyphant is perfect. He has enough depth in his character to make up for any other shortcomings this film suffers from. Overall this is a mostly harmless film that will leave the viewer with a smile and maybe a chuckle or two. If you find yourself with a case of the latenightcan'tsleepblues go ahead watch this. You won't be sorry.".

	schema:reviewBody "Billed on the cover as American Pie meets Risky Business you'd expect The Girl Next Door to be one of the mindless teen comedies so ubiquitous in today's market. Typically I wouldn't have given this DVD a second look but I like Elisha Cuthbert so I picked it up.Not that this is a film destined to change the course of cinematic history but it IS considerably more thoughtful than most of its genre. Yes we know before the first scene opens what's going to happen. This is not just boymeetsgirl this is more like boymeetsfantasygirl and if you've ever been an 18yearold boy or even known one for more than 15 minutes you can see what's coming. The only question is going to be how right? Not really. What you won't see coming is a surprisingly poignant performance by Cuthbert as the girl jaded far beyond her years. The character Danielle is a vulnerable girl guarded by the brittle hard edge of a veteran of the adult film industry. But when she meets Matthew Emile Hirsch who knows her only as Danielle the housesitting niece of his next door neighbor she lets down her guard in the hope that she can reinvent herself in this smallish town where she's an unknown.It probably would have worked too if not for the meddling influence of one of Matthew's friends Eli Chris Marquette. Eli it seems is plugged into the world of porn and reveals Danielle's secret to Matthew.At the prodding of his friends Matthew makes his play to bed the beautiful Danielle. A gambit that is as endearingly clumsy as it is predictable. But it is here that Cuthbert renders what  for me  is the defining moment of the film. And she does it in one word.The word is Okay and is delivered in response to Matthew's suggestion that they get a room. In that moment in that one word we see Danielle pull back from Matthew and resign herself to the idea that she will never be anything more than the porn queen she was back in the big city. She sheds no tears and she makes no sign that she knows that he's found her out until later. But in that one moment we see the hope of the reinvention of Danielle evaporate in a way that's nearly palpable.In the real world this would have been the end of the movie. Lucky for us this isn't the real world and Matthew somehow manages to mature enough in the next few scenes to attempt a comeback.The details of the comeback are a source of great amusement including a breakin at the home of a big time producer crashing the adult entertainment convention in Las Vegas and showing up to deliver a speech to a scholarship committee after being slipped a dose of Ecstacy.Ultimately we can see that the two will eventually sort things out and they do. Though the way they do it is something of a surprise that I'll leave for the movie to tell you about.If you liked Risky Business The Breakfast Club Ridgemont High and the rest of this class you'll like The Girl Next Door. If you LOVED those films you might NOT like The Girl Next Door. Ardent fans of mindless comedy might find this film a little too deep for their tastes. And if you're expecting borderline soft core porn you're going to be disappointed. While the film does contain some nudity it would have been almost impossible for it NOT to it's hardly chock full of gratuitous sex.In the end Cuthbert's character is compelling more so than even her later versions of Kim Bauer on TV's 24 and Hirsch is the perfect foil for her. This is a movie worth seeing  a rare feat in modern Hollywood.".

It's so much deeper and really much more of a love story  adventure because that's what happens.The first 14 is pretty much your average Teen comedy and was mostly what you saw in the trailers. Hard working kid with no time for fun meets hot girl next door who just happen's to be a porn star with his loser mates talking about banging hot chicks and not getting any. Thats the plot overall but that doesn't make an enjoyable movie in my eyes. In fact I only watched this when a friend had it on DVD and let me borrow it. I didn't exactly go out my way to watch this. Now it's one of my favourite films.This is because of where the film takes you and how much you can relate to what's happening. How many of you have felt your working to hard when you're young and not having much fun? How many of you have seen the perfect girl and wanted her so bad you'd do the craziest stuff? Half the stuff that happens through the film especially the ending you wouldn't have predicted from watching the first 14 and I want to tell you all the stuff but that would really spoil the first viewing there will be more.The film is almost perfectly made the kids are all excellent and the two stars have sparks practically flying off them when they are together. The music is spot on and the twists and turns will take your emotions on a rollercoaster ride.This film is perfect for watching alone with friends or with your girlfriend because its feelgood funny and really deep and really deserves better credit as it's more than just an above average teen comedy.

Timothy Olyphant adds a certain menacing charm to proceedings by apparently playing a watereddown version of the character he plays in 'Go'.All in all a pretty good little movie that deserves better than the lukewarm reviews it got upon it's release.

The violence in the movie isn't graphic and the love between Moira and Julie is wonderfully established. Hannah is silky smooth and appears to really fit the role of a dirty   insecure woman.

A suspicious neighbor calls the cops who show up on the scene to investigate and are met with the Netherwoods disturbed from their routines to save their child from being taken by the police.Meanwhile Janie's in a foster home. She's a strange and pretty violent kid the scene with her at the police headquarters is really something to shout at which aren't qualities so much given to her by her parents but just a natural reaction to her alienating environment. We assume that Janie just has been isolated with the exception of the company of her parents for her whole life. And the adjustment is about to be a difficult one for her annoyingly loving foster parents the Cliftons Vincent Spano and Moira Kelly. They don't really seem like the type who can handle a fragile kid like Janie but they make the best efforts.

And it truly turns into a tense and deadly game for all well...not really that many people who know of Janie's whereabouts. And they really prove how serious they are about it too. Although by this point you wonder if it is really Janie they care about. You sense it from the lady Netherwood since she's always staring at this picture of Mother and Child trying to emulate what she sees and at the same time being totally weird about it. She seems very protective of Janie while her husband John just seems to be after some property. The finale is a bit overblown and seems rather out of line. The movie doesn't quite keep you on your toes as say some of the moments where adversary and protagonist almost meet or meet for the first threatening time as they did in 'The Hand That Rocks The Cradle' same producers or 'Pacific Heights.' The ending makes the final reckoning seem all too casual. And most of the screen time used for those awkward paternal bonding moments with the Cliftons and Janie seems too slow and boring while the real action lies in the mounting pursuit of them by the Netherwoods. They should've kept that up throughout because that's where all the interest is generated all the suspense.".

	schema:reviewBody "Slightly obscured today in amid many of its kind The Tie That Binds found writer Wesley Strick taking up directing though he's not credited for this script what is a mashup of two popculture tropes the trashy Lifetimemovieoftheweek kind of thriller and the KillersOnTheRunbutalsolovers movies. This doesn't always have to mean that the former is about a psychotic woman stalking another woman many Lifetime movies concern melodramas involving children who are really fed up and not all killerlovers movies True Romance Natural Born Killers Kalifornia Freeway maybe Doom Generation to an extent pop to mind there are probably others are only just the couple. Strick is able to find some wildly trashy entertainment out of both even as he tends to overdirect things. What I mean by that I'll get to shortly.In this case the premise has a couple of degenerate criminals Carradine and Hannah having the time of their lives in these parts with Carradine being sleazy as all get out while Hannah has that Juliette Lewis flutterycrazy butterfly thing going on like she could kill something in a moment but seems calmer than what Lewis did in NBK with a daughter and after a bad breakin the daughter is left behind and the cops take her. She's turned over to child protective services and instead of going to some bad foster home she's discovered by Nice TV Movie Couple Moira Kelly and Vincent Spano. While she is a photographer conveniently tying in to how Carradine's character also took photos at the scenes of his crimes he is trying to build a house from scratch as a contractor. Neither seem to fully grasp that their newly adopted little girl is traumatized completely having lived a life that is kind of like a wild child only with manic criminalkillerthief people. Drama ensues and meanwhile her real parents go on the long road to hell to track her down.It's got a lot of elements of the 90's and I think that it's not as strong as a lot of examples I could think of. But I think Strick recognizes fully both the potential and the weaknesses in this material we know the good couple are going to be good and the bad couple are going to be completely tasteless freaks. Where Strick goes wrong is mostly near the end and midway through where he tries to go for some planting and paying off by suddenly going into the girl's point of view it's a pretentious move and also an odd thing to see say children in a play with fairy tales being done up with... adults acting with the kids i.e. the Big Bad Wolf is an adult woman and the kids are kids but... huh and then later this pays off or is supposed to with the daughter in a scene in the woods. Strick also is addicted to grandiose overhead shots but without much purpose this was his first feature and in this the big technical maneuvers  perhaps he was taking a cue from Scorsese in some part being the writer on Cape Fear 91  he shows he's still trying to learn on the job and falling flat in this area.But with actors he's much stronger. If you like Carradine and like all the more to see him being an unapologetic scumbag then this is a movie for you and then some watch when he kicks the vending machine after the other guy next to him won't kick it as the first guy says Yeah I can't I'm a prosecutor to then Carradine's response after kicking it hard It's alright I'm a felon  see ya counselor and Hannah too has a lot of great scenes where she doesn't have to do much to get under your skin while at the same time having a small piece of vulnerability to her. She's like the more messedup grotty cousin of Nicole Kidman here or something and a moment where she tries to get her daughter back as coolly as she can from a school recess is amazing.Kelly and Spano may not have as entertaining roles but they do a commendable job and actually make this GoodParentCouple have personality. Strick lets them be real people for a moment or two like an awkward sex scene yeah for some reason the door's open so if the little girl wanted she could totally look in where the main concern is the squealing bedsprings. And all the while there's the little girl Janie Julia Devin I wasn't sure at times how the filmmakers intended her to be presented as a screwedup and victim of abuse and trauma she cuts herself at times and then at others lashes out at people. I would've liked to see just another piece or more than one to give some more context outside of the opening of the film for how Janie got this way. The writing for her gets a little better near the end  planting and payoffs yey  but I also wondered if her placid expression for much of the film was a way to make it easier on directing her. Who knows! The Ties That Bind is really dumb for much of its runtime and I think it knows it. It gets by on throwing together the trashiest parts of its genres of familial dyfunctions on both ends and while Carradine and Hannah may be acting at times in another movie than Kelly and Spano the results don't feel too uneven to me. Not art but a guilty pleasure about what it means to be a parent a child and a member of society.".

The plot centers around a young girl who gets in the middle of a sort of custody battle between two couples. But this custody battle is not fought with legalities it's fought with sharp metal objects and things that tend to make people bleed through the head. It's a clearcut battle of good vs. evil so there's no moral ambiguity. Unless King Solomon was drunk on mevushal he wouldn't need to debate more than 2 seconds on who deserves the kid. So the movie is more like a run from the bad guys sort of thing linear sometimes predictable but fun.Daryl Hannah and Keith Carradine play a psychotic Bonnie  Clyde while Moira Kelly and Vincent Spano play the most ideal yuppie parents anyone could ever dream up. Thus the stage is set. Good performances all around make this entertaining although more cynical audiences may not buy how extremely stereotypical each character is. But hey we're on the heels of the 80s where everything was clearcut black  white. Like I said above don't expect any heavy issues of morality or any question of who is right and wrong. Just expect a straightforward game of keep away but with a bunch of blood. As others have mentioned the ending chain of events is a little over the top but heck. Over the top is what this movie delivers.".

I was initially excited at the thought of Rajiv Rai returning to the action genre but that soon fizzled out. As a Rajiv Rai fan I thought I should at least give it a go but I left after an hour. One reason for me leaving the film so early so the amount of Paki bashing in the film this was not in Rai's previous venture.A lot of directors have tried Paki bashing but I did not expect it from Rajiv Rai Another letdown was the music. Rajiv Rai's have always had good music until now. There is only one good song and that is Tere dekh dekh Ladgayan. The performances are not upto scratch not even from Rai Loyalist NaseerUddin Shah.

	onyx:emotionText "What has Rajiv Rai done to himself? Once a hit director of films like Tridev and Vishwatama is now making one bad film after another. I was initially excited at the thought of Rajiv Rai returning to the action genre but that soon fizzled out. As a Rajiv Rai fan I thought I should at least give it a go but I left after an hour. One reason for me leaving the film so early so the amount of Paki bashing in the film this was not in Rai's previous venture.A lot of directors have tried Paki bashing but I did not expect it from Rajiv Rai Another letdown was the music. Rajiv Rai's have always had good music until now. There is only one good song and that is Tere dekh dekh Ladgayan. The performances are not upto scratch not even from Rai Loyalist NaseerUddin Shah. Avoidable fare from once my favourite director.";

The only downfall of the movie is that it includes the India vs Pakistan theme. Which we could do without now that both countries are starting to come together. Priyanka Chopra is absolutely stunning in the movie. Although the songs just come out of nowhere. The movie would do a lot better if it didn't have this indipaki theme. As well as having too many characters. It just makes it difficult to fit them in the movie. which is about 2hrs 10mins long. If it were at least 2hrs 45mins  3hrs. Then maybe every character would be given more time to adjust to the movie. Overall I would rate this movie 710.".

Subsequently dissolved into the more gripping Hollywood and eventually world cinema.Meanwhile have always followed the changes in the degrees of flesh flashing that has taken place in bollywood. But then the pompous beginning of Tridev remained in my mind and also the strange tonal and also pompous rambling of the villain during a song. Of course the legend of alternate movies Naseruddin shah acting in it made it remote compulsive viewing. Typically 80's with villain's jumping out of every twist and each one having a strong character of their own the dialogues are naive pompous to the point subtlety is like the wind that blows past the window.Many decades later thanks or nothanks to a friend i was persuaded not to miss the ebb and flows of bollywood.Asambhav is definitely an Ebb in the scheme of things. The movie was as ridiculous as a carry over from the 80's but then it seemed deliberate to relive the pompous not at all subtle 80's. But then the twists are a deliberate inclusion and they exist in the format.A handsome Arjun Rampal my girlfriends call him The Dish referring to the tasty meat he can make.A slick the Hulk like comic book edit where multiple screens are adapted to narrate the story. A shapely nonactress but quite a turn on called priyanka chopra she holds on to the nearest hunk like thing it is only Arjun in the movie.The short coming here was that the screenplay remained steeped in the 80's an upgrade to the 2000's screenplay would have aided the idea even more.What is gravely naive and even more funny is that the format that rai adapted and also claims original concept rights to is best suited for a comic strip hero it seems a good adaptation from a naivety point of view but not so in a mature movie space but then bollywood is not a mature movie space but purely a entertainment space for the 16 of the world. What right do we have to assume that a large cross section like that will need mature entertainment?So the 80's screenplay in multiple screen format is the novel inclusion that is if the movie was not multiple screen format it would have been one hell of a long movie that could have served better narrated in a cartoon format.The multiple screens format obviously does create a technical challenge and Rai was up to the challenge less times than he should have been. When the multiple screens format is abandoned the movie gets limp like all the 80's get limp when watched now in the 2000's .Purely from the above stand point of enjoying a clean juxtaposition of concepts the trashy 80's and slick techno 2000's this is a hilarious movie. No matter what Rai's intention was I enjoyed 'Asambhav' from that stand point and if I have to view it from a serious critic standpoint which Bollywood movie is better than the other?".

	schema:headline " Husbands and Wives 1992 ";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of Woody Allen's greatest films but it took me two viewings to fully appreciate it. I first saw it in 1992 at the theatre upon its initial release with my thengirlfriend when I was 30 and she was 24 but this second time was in 2005 on home video with me still in the same relationship thirteen years later and married to this same woman for ten of those it really hit a nerve for me as a middleaged spouse. I'm not so sure it can appeal to every viewer but I'd wholeheartedly recommend it to older married couples everywhere.Allen's hardhitting film dissects the longterm effects of being with the same person for a long time familiarity infidelity stagnation and indifference. To drive the point home still further the photography is crudely rendered in a sometimes confusing handheld camera style which works wonders. Woody's cast is excellent  beginning with the noteperfect Sydney Pollack and strongwilled Judy Davis who play a bored married couple announcing a trial separation shocking and convincing their friends Woody and wife Mia Farrow to take a closer look at their own vulnerable relationship. Juliette Lewis is once again a very good young actress as a twentyyearold student in Allen's writing class who becomes infatuated with him and turns out to be his protg. Liam Neeson is strong as the new man Davis tries to reheat her romantic life with. One of Woody Allen's best performances here too where he's more reserved and human  not as whiny or nerdy as we're so accustomed to seeing him. Even better he actually makes us more interested in the other characters instead of himself.The mature story is sometimes told in a candid documentarylike format where the participants alternately give their own perceptions as though they're spilling their guts to a psychotherapist and then ultimately wind up expressing what they've learned from these experiences.

	onyx:emotionText "This is one of Woody Allen's greatest films but it took me two viewings to fully appreciate it. I first saw it in 1992 at the theatre upon its initial release with my thengirlfriend when I was 30 and she was 24 but this second time was in 2005 on home video with me still in the same relationship thirteen years later and married to this same woman for ten of those it really hit a nerve for me as a middleaged spouse. I'm not so sure it can appeal to every viewer but I'd wholeheartedly recommend it to older married couples everywhere.Allen's hardhitting film dissects the longterm effects of being with the same person for a long time familiarity infidelity stagnation and indifference. To drive the point home still further the photography is crudely rendered in a sometimes confusing handheld camera style which works wonders. Woody's cast is excellent  beginning with the noteperfect Sydney Pollack and strongwilled Judy Davis who play a bored married couple announcing a trial separation shocking and convincing their friends Woody and wife Mia Farrow to take a closer look at their own vulnerable relationship. Juliette Lewis is once again a very good young actress as a twentyyearold student in Allen's writing class who becomes infatuated with him and turns out to be his protg. Liam Neeson is strong as the new man Davis tries to reheat her romantic life with. One of Woody Allen's best performances here too where he's more reserved and human  not as whiny or nerdy as we're so accustomed to seeing him. Even better he actually makes us more interested in the other characters instead of himself.The mature story is sometimes told in a candid documentarylike format where the participants alternately give their own perceptions as though they're spilling their guts to a psychotherapist and then ultimately wind up expressing what they've learned from these experiences. I happen to agree with the idea that a couple must learn to accept imperfections in a marriage and work through them together.

This film follows what happens to them over the course of a year.A fascinating film. I'm not married or even straight but I don't think that mattersthis is about love sex and relationships and has dialogue and situations that anyone can relate to.

During the film they are all interviewed by a never seen personthese interviews really help the story and reveals how everybody feels about the others. It pulls everything together.The acting is almost all great. Allen and Farrow were living together when this was filmedwhen it was released they were in a bitter custody battle. This movie actually provides insight to WHY they broke uptheir argument scenes are just a bit too realistic. Davis and Pollack are just superb in their roles. They let you feel their characters pain and confusionjust great acting. Neeseon isn't asked to do much but he is very affecting in his scenes. However Juliette Lewis is terrible as a college student. Her voice is nasal and whiny and her acting is pretty lousybut it doesn't ruin the film.I saw this back in 1992 in a theatre and loved it. Twelve years later I STILL love it. A great film. I'm only giving this an 8 though. There are two big faults with this film the handheld jittery camera work being the main one. My guess is Allen filmed it this way to make the film more immediate and give it a documentary feel. It works but it IS distracting. Also it gets a little repetitious towards the end. Still this is well worth seeing. Recommended.".

Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives is a film however which sets the viewer in the action on screen. He does this with perfect handheld cameras and jump cuts. The camera work makes you feel like you're right there and it adds a breakneck speed to the film. This seems like one of the most realistic films ever made. I have no complaints about this film myself. I would give it a 1010 but make no mistake this is a very unpleasant film to watch. I like unpleasant films but this one is particularly harsh. The situations develop like a fly landing in a Venus fly trap. A character will walk towards a life which heshe believes will bring sweetness and happiness but the new life quickly engulfs them. And when the film ends the characters are seen stepping into a different trap quicksand. No audience member could be naive enough to think that any of the characters are standing in a desirable place when the film closes. Husbands and Wives is a movie that could cause divorces and could cause longterm lapses  between relationships. If nothing else it is a film that will make you cringe and squirm.".

It has several funny moments and dialogs it is Allen after all but it has disturbing and sad scenes too.When Jack and Sally Sidney Pollack and Judy Davis announce that they're separating this comes as a shock to their best friends Gabe and Judy Allen and Farrow. They start to reevaluate their own marriage only to find out that it is not as perfect as they thought. Very soon Jack and Sally and then Gabe and Judy start to meet new people  young bright and attractive. They all hope that new is better and for some of them it is true while the others come to understanding that true love involves loving another's imperfections even when very well aware of them. This film is for all husbands and wives lovers and partners around the world. It is for couples who've been in a relationship for a month a year or decades. It is for singles who are ready or who think they want to enter a relationship. It is also for people who don't. All of us have been or may find ourselves in a situation or relationship or having a conversation like the ones in the Allen's film. All of us think and talk about love trust understanding fidelity sex and yes  marriage. The best scenes of the film belong to Allen and Farrow. Some of their conversations in the movie probably reflect the situation in their own relationship that ended soon after the film was made. It is the last film Allen made with Farrow. Judy Davis played the role of her carrier practically stealing the film. I was shocked to find out that she received all possible Critics Awards that year and lost Best Supporting Oscar to Marisa Tomei. I love Tomei's performance in My Cousin Vinny 1992 but nomination itself would've been enough. Davis was the Best Supporting actress I saw all films with nominated performances. Sidney Pollack The Oscar winning director of Out of Africa and two times nominee for Tootsie and They Shoot Horses Don't They? and Liam Nisson were wonderful. I did not like Juliet Lewis at all. What she did adorably in Cape Fear with De Niro for ten minutes scene she tried to stretch for over an hour here  did not work IMO.I like Husbands and Wives  it was interesting to watch and it left me thinking if such thing as perfect relationship is ever possible and what it would take to not only find it but to keep it.".

Though I've never read the actual shooting script to Husbands and Wives I can see what he means. I've seen the film several times if not all the way through then usually when it is on TV and it always strikes my attention the frankness of it all how it follows almost no rules. It shares a kinship with another Woody masterpiece Deconstructing Harry also about a neurotic writer and the relationship problems around him. Here he focuses not only on himself but also on another married couple played by Sydney Pollack and Judy Davis the later of which one of Woody's best in his quasi stock company and what he calls the discombobulated characters. It is funny here and there but in reality this is a great film of dramatic sincerity and occasional intensity.Woody himself is in his final collaboration with his exwife Mia Farrow who themselves in the film play a married couple working through some issues. There is also the sensitive passionate man between the two couples played by Liam Neeson who acts as a good mediator between the two intertwining story lines. And Juliette Lewis is surprisingly good as a young wouldbe author who befriends the authorprofessor Woody plays in the film. What works to make all of these relationships with warts and all is that the dialog is always totally without a doubt believable. One can see people like this around the New York city uppermiddle class landscape with the neuroses as intriguing as they are frank and even a little disturbing.While the film shares a kinship with some of the dark brooding themes of Interiors and quintessentially European in a good way attitude towards editing and composition to Deconstructing Harry it also has also 'Harry's' DP the eye of Carlo Di Palma. Di Palma who also worked with Antonioni on Red Desert and Blowup works with great ease with the aesthetics of the scenes. This time the camerawork is practically all handheld lit with nearly seemingly no artificial lights and with a kind of intensity that is sometimes lacking in other Woody films. In wrong amateur hands this style could falter but with the material given the constant interest and conviction in the performances and Allen directing it works. Having Di Palma as a cinematographer is as good a bet as having a mentallyalltogether Marlon Brando as your star and because of the documentary realism involved it always remains interesting. I could watch this movie at least most scenes just as easily as I could with films like Manhattan or 'Harry' because it is one of those special times in the filmmaker's career where everything comes together however how raw it may be.".

	schema:reviewBody "Match Point was the movie that converted me into a Woody Allenfan. I had literally hated the man's work but suddenly I found that these movies really spoke to me more than before. I guess you just have to grow older and get a little life experience before you can appreciate Woody Allen's fabulous writing. Lately I've been catching up on his filmography and was blown away by his immense power of observation. Out of all his classic movies that I've seen in the past couple of days Husbands And Wives made the biggest impression so far. This movie is fearless honest and true. Allen really hits the nail on the head with this one.Unlike movies like Crimes And Misdemeanors or the aforementioned Match Point which are both great Husbands And Wives isn't laden with symbolism and there are no highly philosophical thoughts to be found. The movie is merely depicting the universal truth that it's tough to remain honest and passionate in a marriage. Masterfully Allen shows his struggling characters in all their weaknesses without ever making them unlikeable. These characters falter between loyalty fear of loneliness and an undeniable desire for passion. Everybody who's ever been in a longtime relationship will be able to identify with these problems but only the brave ones will be able to admit that to their partner.That's the beauty of this movie. Allen says what everybody else is either too afraid or too hypocritical or simply unable to. Husbands And Wives shows what the fewest people understand the egoistical side of love the way we cling to relationships because we're afraid of being alone but also the simple fact that sometimes we need to lose something to understand how much we need it. Even when there's still love we can reach a point where we lie and betray the other person just because sometimes people are confused about their lives and their feelings.Nobody has voiced our confusion about love and death as accurately as Woody Allen and he's rarely done it better than here. Husbands And Wives is recommendable for everyone especially couples but be prepared that watching this might lead to uncomfortable discussions. The truth is hardly ever convenient.".

Like most of Woody's work it plays out like a photographed play he's not a highly visual filmmaker but if you've seen any of his other films you shouldn't be surprised.  The film is lowkey at times too lowkey and if you've seen any other relationship comedies of this nature the story should come predictable but the characters are very wellwritten and engaging.  I was especially interested in the relationship between Woody and his beautiful student played by Juliette Lewis.  There are lots of funny moments.  I see that Judy Davis got nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar. She really was great in the film.  It's nice to see that Woody often finds a place for her in all his recent films.  Sydney Pollack is also great. Basically the whole cast is talented and it's pretty much an ensemble effort.  My score  7 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Gabe Woody Allen and Judy Mia Farrow have invited their good friends Jack Sydney Pollack and Sally Judy Davis for a small dinner at their quaint Manhattan apartment. Their abode is full of books and knickknacks all pointing to a comfortable urbanite life in the largest city in the world. Then Jack and Sally reveal some surprising newsafter years of seemingly happy marriage the two have agreed to a separation and eventual divorce. After that bomb is dropped the two couples reexamine their relationships with each other trying to find meaning in romances both current and past while discovering the good the bad and the ugly in marriage.Woody Allen is mostly known for his comedies. But while Husbands and Wives has some pretty spot on observational humor the story is largely somber and dramatic. Not dramatic in the sense of a Wednesday afternoon soap opera but a benign drama that with a few spikes of activity focuses mostly on the characters. There is no clever high concept or narrative liberties here like say The Purple Rose of Cairo 1985 the film is more straightlaced and character driven along the lines of Interiors 1978 and Crimes and Misdemeanors 1989.And what of the characters or rather the actors who flesh them out? Judy Davis Mia Farrow and Juliette Lewis are the obvious standouts representing three very different women all of which are looking for the same thing someone to love and someone to love them back. Davis received an Oscar nomination for her role as a bitter divorce trying to come to terms with her exhusband's infidelity and being single again. She's continually frustrated and confused by the yearnings of the heart occasionally even lashing out on her boyfriend Gates Liam Neeson. She's cynical and wary of attachment yet deep down she knows that her entanglements with Jack aren't over.Mia Farrow is a stark counterpoint to Diane Keaton's brassy personalities of Allen's earlier work. Farrow's intensity lies always below the surface providing the perked looks and mousiness of a young ingnue with the mind and body language of a veteran in the trials of love. It's a shame that out of the twelve Woody Allen films she has been in for which Husbands and Wives was most famously her last she had never received recognition by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for her stellar work.Juliette Lewis who plays one of Gabe's young students from his Literature course has the appearance and vulnerability of a dewyeyed devotee. Yet when the amiable Gabe discovers he might be the object of desire here and Lewis's Rain the controller he recoils. There's a scene where the two are in a cab discussing the latest draft of his book. Unable to take criticism Gabe calls Rain a 20yearold twit and says I'd hate to be your boyfriend he must go through hell. Rain cavalierly responds Well I'm worth it.Those who bemoan Allen's postAnnie Hall 1977 work won't find relief from his more meditative works of the 1980's. While most of the characters are likable they sometimes do unlikeable things each on their own journey of discovery. I suppose we all do things we regret for love and those with a mature outlook on the subject matter will find a lot to enjoy and a lot to flinch at in Husbands and Wives. I suppose the heart wants what the heart wants.httpwww.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com".

Mia Farrow gives a heartfelt performance too. Husbands and Wives is a superbly written film it does have a fair bit of Allen's razor sharp wit and plenty of well thought out observations conveyed bluntly. But few Allen films are this candid and the documentarystyle that the film adopts allows the candour to come through and resonate in a very rich and vigorous way. The themes and relationships explored in Husbands and Wives are ones that any married couple or pretty much anybody will relate tothe Pollack and Davis storyline is the most poignant and insightful. Some of what is shown is very unpleasant and the characters are not likable ones at all but to be honest it's absolutely like that in real life it just goes to show how much the truth can hurt. It really is one of Allen's most relatable films Hannah and Her Sisters I also related to strongly but in a different way being warmer in tone and slightly more multilayeredthat's not to knock Husbands and Wives at all in that regard as it certainly is that. Overall some of what is shown is unpleasant but it is a remarkably candid film with superb writing and acting that a lot of people can relate to. 1010 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Gabe Woody Allen and Judy Mia Farrow live in couple for about 10 years and are friends with Jack Sidney Pollack and Sally Judy Davis married for twenty years with kids in college. The film opens with an announcement from the JackSally couple they're splitting up. Whether it's a trial or definitive separation doesn't matter the news come as a big shock especially to Judy who is so upset that she steals Jack and Sally's thunder. We're too busy wondering what's with Judy that we don't really listen to Jack and Sally's explanations.The opening scene is one of Allen's most inspired moments. What we have is a couple quietly handling the idea of a separation after 20 years of common life making tremendous efforts to rationalize it and convincing the entourage that they're happy with that and another couple totally confused and distressed about it. The directing contributes to create a dizzying effect the scene is shot with a handheld camera going back and forth from a character to another with so many jumps and cuts it conveys a deliberate feeling of reallife confusion. It's just as if the characters played by Allen and Farrow didn't expect the news and the cameraman didn't know if he had to go on or stop filming. The chaos almost reaches the level of a Cassavetes' film except that Cassavetes was a director of raw emotion while Allen more cerebral uses the scene to raise the very questions to which the film will try to provide answers.Jack lived 20 years with a woman extremely cerebral and anguished and not a detail at all cold in bed. Rather than an alibi for Jack it serves to show how sex can cement the harmony within a couple or totally destroy it. After leaving Sally Jack dates a sexy beautiful aerobics instructor. He feels like living again as if he was wasting away with Sally. Of course he would sooner realize that all the fantasies that filled his marital sexless nights couldn't live up to the everyday realities. Any older man is capable to seduce the sexiest bimbo but then would he feel confident enough to introduce her to his friends? As for Sally the life following the breakup oscillated between many attitudes. She's first devoured by jealousy when she learns that Jack sees another woman positive that it's a colleague of him who's like a younger version of her. Judy is so full of herself that she can't imagine Jack going for a 'cheaper model' and it hurts her because she's a confident woman and her pride can't allow this. Yet at one point she's not old anymore but experienced not single but free. She changes her perceptions and it seems to work for a while to a point even Judy is impressed by her self confidence. But from Sally's new perspective Judy is not just impressed her reaction is closer to jealousy and gives some early hints about the reasons of her reaction in the opening scene. Indeed Judy and Gabe is a more perplexing couple they live independently to each other yet passion seems to lack in their relationship. In fact they argue so frequently that the moments of tenderness are more unusual. It feels like they had no chance to live in harmony as soon as their friends separated as if Jack and Sally were the third link of their relationship. The separation of an ideal couple could easily mean a threat to a more fragile couple. To give us more insights about the characters Allen shoots the film in documentary style punctuating the scenes with interviews from the different protagonists. Gabe had a lust for highly libidinous women or nutcases and married Judy because she would reconcile him with a more normal way of life. As for Judy the separation hit a sensitive nerve maybe she was wasting great opportunities with Gabe. But these interviews only illustrate what the scenes brilliantly show. In Husbands and Wives Woody Allen demonstrates again his incredible talent when it comes to human emotions' writing. Halfway through the movie we're so familiar with the protagonists that we can immediately guess their true reactions regarding one or another's actions and not only guess them but also understand them. And it's this very capacity to inspire our empathy that gives all the credit to a wonderfully written screenplay. Indeed the movie tackles the difficult subject or relationships within couples and in a thoughtprovoking move the script succeeds in making us wonder whether marital commitment drives or undermines one's quest for happiness. In other words can this quest not be just personal? That's it in Husbands and Wives we understand any of Gabe Sally Judy or Jack no one is guilty or innocent because no one can actually be blamed of seeking harmony or selfcontentment. Made in a difficult personal time for Woody Allen hi film is thought provoking because it chronicles people's approaches to marital commitment. And while we're committed to live with the same person for the rest of our lives it's impossible not to think about what our life would be with another person or if we were single. Being married for less than a year the film didn't have the same effect on me as on the first viewing. I understood the characters I can understand the lust a man can have on a younger or a sexier on a more or less sophisticated woman. The food in the neighbor's table always look more appetizing.Still why do some people stay together even if they know they don't share the same dreams than their companion? Because although we'd feel guilty and weak not to fulfill our personal dreams guilt and weakness are doubleedged swords when they concern the person we loved for a long time. It's up to us to see on which side those feelings would be more tolerable.".

	schema:headline " Allen at his most bitter and least romantic";
	schema:reviewBody "Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives tellingly came at the taleend of his relationship with Mia Farrow while he was already involved with SoonYi. Allen has always immersed himself and his personality in his films. In the 1970s he viewed himself in a more romantic vein and his films sprang with hope and comedy amid neurosis. By the time his relationship with Farrow was about to come to its volcanic end he is in the bitter grounds. The result is a film that becomes more and more uncomfortable and unpleasant to watch.Allen casts himself and Farrow as the comfortably married couple whose relationship is fraying  he wants a child and she doesn't she is drawn to a colleague at work Liam Neeson and they ignore each other at home. They are shocked when their friends played by Sydney Pollack and Judy Davis announce an amicable divorce. What does this mean for their relationship? Allen finds himself being drawn in by a 20year old student Juliette Lewis with a penchant for flings with older men and a selfconfidence about herself and the torture she puts her men through I'm worth it she states. Farrow is more and more drawn to Neeson but she sabotages herself by setting him up with her newly divorced friend Davis.While the ground being covered by Allen is interesting he clearly had little or no sympathy for his characters. All of them even Neeson who is romantic to the point of being dim become more and more repellent as the film progresses. Scenes seem constructed simply so that the characters can have uncontrolled outrageous emotional outbursts and they do things that are unbelievable in their shortsightedness SPOILERS BELOW Allen's character Gabe is a professor and novelist. Attracted to Lewis and not interested in the input from his wife he entrusts a 20year old with THE ONLY COPY OF HIS NEW NOVEL which she loses in a taxi. While this might have been a believable plot twist prior to cheap and commercially available photocopying say the 1940s by the 1990s when word processors hard drives Kinko's et. al. are common this is a unbelievable. Either the character is exceptionally stupid or it's a plot device to provide conflict between Allen and Lewis. Neither explanation works in the context of the script. We already know Allen's relationship with Farrow is dying both on screen and as it turns out in real life so we don't need this episode as a way to force the characters together.Allen should already be fleeing from Lewis. She has shown with no hint of remorse that she is a oneway train wreck and takes all of her older lovers with her. By showing only that dimension to her and depending on Lewis' prettiness to draw men to the character he is badly miscalculating the audience.Farrow's character is just as bad. She hovers over Neeson at work in a manner that makes it obvious what her feelings are to the viewer and it would seem everyone else in her office. Even at home where she is cold to Allen and he oblivious to her what could have been interesting scenes investigating the dynamic of alienation are wasted. These people have lost the ability to care about one another and don't even notice.Neeson's Michael the lone romantic is also portrayed as stupid. Davis' character in her first date with Neeson is hypercritical and obnoxious about everything about their evening she could have done the Alfredo sauce better she doesn't like Mahler she criticizes the way Michael drives etc. etc. yet Michael is somehow attracted to her. How? He hasn't been shown to be a masochist. Davis is shrewish and antagonistic  there is nothing in the slightest appealing about her. At work Farrow hovers over him in a manner that even an alien to the species would not mistake. She couldn't be more obvious if she doffed her clothes and sat down on his desk with her legs spread.Sydney Pollack fares no better. Having left his wife he takes up with a sexy aerobics instructor Lysette Anthony. Unfortunately she is dim and argues about the veracity of astrology at parties. Having learned his wife is in a new relationship Pollack suddenly becomes jealous gets into a screaming fight with Anthony at the party and high tails it over to his exwife GIRLFRIEND IN TOW to confront her and Neeson. One clever end to this would have been Neeson and Anthony who are simultaneously ignored by their paramours bonding and falling in love with one another although Allen makes this impossible by making Anthony's character too stupid. Pollack and Davis get back together Neeson is heartbroken and eventually soothed by Farrow who leaves Allen. Allen is the only one who winds up alone.Being forced to watch ostensibly intelligent characters ignore the obvious and then be subject to their tantrums is made worse by Allen's pursuit of a cinema verite aspect  the use of a jerky handheld camera zooming around from character to character while they make their pronouncements. Allen is never a bad filmmaker but he has made an uncomfortable and unpleasant film. Of his introspective 90's work I felt Deconstructing Harry worked better. Of course comedies such as Bullets Over Broadway and Mighty Aphrodite are also quite worthwhile.".

I AM STILL CRYING!  It isn't very good.  People might say it's good since Woody Allen made it but from what I've seen his ratio of good to bad films is not overly positive.  I did not enjoy myself nor was I moved to think of anything interesting because of it.  This was also made back when it first started to be cool to move the camera around all crazy and frenetic in an attempt to suggest bewildering conflict.  So it's EXTRAannoying! Yay!".

	schema:headline " Another funny Allen comedy.";
	schema:reviewBody "Yet another Woody Allen film you'd just love to hate but end up liking in spite of yourself  and in spite of the typically ahole characters involved. However these characters are always made to be so funny to the point where it doesn't matter that they are such damn typical bored middleclass Americans with nothing better to do than make problems out of nothing. Everyone is doing it with everyone like in Melrose Place or some such crap TV show but Woody Allen cleverly included a bit in the movie where he defends his character's book's indulgence with everyone doing it with everyone. In the film his character justifies this aspect of his book by saying that it's an exaggeration serving the purpose of more easily making its point which is fair enough I've always agreed that exaggeration is one of the best ways of making any point. Clever indirect defense. There is also great irony in the film concerning the reallife situation between him and Farrow right after the completion of the film. Examples 1 Farrow asks him early on in the film whether he is hiding something from her! 2 Allen falls for a twenty yearold admittedly we know Allen finds 20 too old 3 they eventually split up in the end of the film 4 Allen's character says to the camera that he often involves himself with women which he shouldn't be getting involved with. PURE IRONY in wake of the scandal regarding his present wife and former adopted daughter SoonYi. The overly casual style of the film typical of his movies is a little too much at times but one gets used to it after the first tentwenty minutes. The camera work? What camera work? Allen tried so hard to make it supercasual that he decided that not only did the actors have to look like as though they weren't playing roles but he also must have told the cameraman to pretend he wasn't working on a picture but instead just filmed the family cat falling off a table or something like that. The camerawork looks at times as though it's been put into the hands of a drunk or a playful chimp  or a drunk playful chimp. I'm referring to the everannoying handheldcamera shtick. However in all fairness the wobbly motions of the camera don't irritate all the time. A small plus is that there are no leftwing political statements  which is a miracle considering Pollack's involvement and W.Allen isn't exactly an antiSocialist either. A small minus is the attempt to interrupt the plot with documentarystyle sequences where the film's characters give their explanation about past events. Here Allen's obsession with Bergman's dull movies becomes apparent. It doesn't work because it's trying so hard to look and sound like documentary footage  too much casualness can get irritating with one exception though the sequences in which Farrow's exhusband describes her very funny. Another thing why is this film considered a comedydrama? Where's the drama then? I don't see anything dramatic about bored middleclass morons bitching about their relationships  sorry but I can only laugh at this so to me  if you like  both the film's comedy and drama bits are funny. Judy Davis is the standout in a very effective cast. Neeson is okaybland as usual. Pollack is quite good a far better actor than director. Juliette Lewis is quite miscast I cannot accept her playing a BRIGHT 20 yearold TALENTED WRITER she talks like a typical MTVgeneration Beverly Hills airhead and whenever she uses a word longer than two syllables I get the impression she had never heard of it before reading the script. Can't be much different in real life she is a Scientologist.".

	schema:reviewBody "Woody Allen went the documentary ish route again with his 1992 film Husbands and WIves. The film follows a married couple's deterioration after their married friends decide to separate. By telling the story in documentary format with a handheld camera with a lot of movement and closeup shots the audience is completely immersed in the story almost like voyeurs as we see a marriage crumble apart. Jack Sydney Pollack and Sally Judy Davis break some tough news to their friends Gabe Woody Allen and Judy Mia Farrow that they will be separating. Judy and Sally are quite nonchalant while delivering the news but Gabe and Judy are devastated. Gabe remarks that theirs is a marriage benchmark as he only thinks of them as Jack and Sally. Judy is completely devastated even retiring to her bedroom in a dither over hearing the news. Gabe and Judy console themselves and each other as Jack and Sally go on to see other people. The news changes them as well however. Gabe and Judy both begin to question aspects of their life and relationship and start to believe that they may not be as happy in their marriage as they've grown comfortable believing. Gabe starts succumbing to the admiration of one of his female students and Judy realizes she is attracted to another man. What began as a series of changes in the lives of Jack and Sally has delivered life changing impact for Gabe and Judy.I love the documentary style Woody used for husbands and Wives. I've heard many criticize it yet I think it's perfect to convey the intimate emotions dealt with in the film. I especially enjoy how real Woody depicts human emotions in this film. Who hasn't recovered from a breakup when one moment you are whole moving on and living your life when all of a sudden you get a nagging thought in your head that you just can't shake and you become a mix of anger and desperation in an instant? That's exactly what Woody showed in the scene in which Sally was in the apartment of a man she was to go on a date with but she couldn't shake the news that Jack had moved someone in his home just three weeks after their separation. That scene as gutwrenching as it was was my favorite because it was so real. That really is how emotions work they are wild and unpredictable quickly changing based on new information. Husbands and Wives was a truly human film with rich touches of Woody Allen another Bergman reference and a comment from Woody about walking in Paris in the rain definitely a stand out in the excellent filmography of Woody Allen.".

I've heard many criticize it yet I think it's perfect to convey the intimate emotions dealt with in the film. I especially enjoy how real Woody depicts human emotions in this film. Who hasn't recovered from a breakup when one moment you are whole moving on and living your life when all of a sudden you get a nagging thought in your head that you just can't shake and you become a mix of anger and desperation in an instant? That's exactly what Woody showed in the scene in which Sally was in the apartment of a man she was to go on a date with but she couldn't shake the news that Jack had moved someone in his home just three weeks after their separation. That scene as gutwrenching as it was was my favorite because it was so real. That really is how emotions work they are wild and unpredictable quickly changing based on new information. Husbands and Wives was a truly human film with rich touches of Woody Allen another Bergman reference and a comment from Woody about walking in Paris in the rain definitely a stand out in the excellent filmography of Woody Allen.";

Farrow's Judy takes the Allen role here she is almost offended at this sudden change in their within their comfort projecting hard and yet unable to accept that this is an outcome that she wants for herself. Allen's camera departs from its usual fare the serenity in the stillness the roving unbroken long takes that let the performances and script shine. It whips backs and forth with the jerkiness and blurred vision of an intruder of this intimate moment as unbelieving as Judy herself shocked by the revelation. The dialogue does not pause for a witty insight  it is overlapping interrupting reflecting the fragmentation of their relationships to come and which has perhaps already begun long ago. Judy Davis is a marvel. She is the hit hard the most of the following events despite how Farrow might act because she is the one left initially alone and her exhusband has found a prettier and younger thing. And in just three weeks no less upon discovering this she whips up a fury that seems to charge the frames to rumble themselves. Davis is restless trembling a bundle of nervous energy openly and without inhibition. By contrast Jack seems to be having the time of his life snuggling teasing kissing his new shiny partner flaunting his rediscovery. Gabe predictably treats this as an intellectual sin You're IQ's gone into remission he remarks. It is not like him. The interactions in Husbands and Wives are wonderful because they are full to the brim of bitter distrusting adults that have grown weary of keeping up appearances over a lifetime. The navigation of the business of love and romance and dating in these middles ages is a contemptuous battleground full of baggage frustration and insecurity. Judy asks her husband is she wants someone new and underlines the question strongly with connotations of her own desires but would sooner explode at his wrong answer first. He answers correctly and flips the question back to her and the atmosphere is stagnant with their dual dissatisfaction. Davis can barely contain her misery even after a wonderful night her voiced enjoyment undercut by a biting scorn at Mahler's sentimentalism or watery Alfredo sauce. The fauxdocumentary style is appropriate when we are witnessing characters and relationships exploding and releasing a storm of emotions and yet at times it takes away from the moment. Aside from the handheld there are also snippets of talking heads snap zooms and injections of the snappy narrator's comments but they feel like stealing ripe opportunities right from under our noses moments of truth and vulnerability inbetween the playacting. Case in point Judy has all but set up her dream date for Michael and Sally and is swooning at his descriptions of the night out. The dramatic irony of the sudden rainstorm during their lunch is the universe openly mocking her chances. And yet the culmination of all this is Farrow merely voicing her envy to the camera. Why not follow her shuffling away to the other room sitting down and breathing hard letting the take linger until it becomes uncomfortable? Let Farrow act let her display that tremendous and natural vulnerability within her.The editing is vicious even more so than when it exposed Alvy Singer's hypocrisy in Annie Hall. It cuts deep down into the married couples instabilities juxtaposing the fiery highs and the nostalgic lows into a flurry of realisation. He departs to follow a similar path as Jack chasing after the metaphorical lost youth. Because it is a purely physical affair he ignores the warning signs the fictitious nature of her stormy and tempestuous personality. But surprisingly there is a reversal. She comes to fetishise his maturity and intellectualism which is a dream come true for the Allen type but he falters. There are thunderstorms birthday wishes and candles all set up for him but he does not characteristically pounce. This is not a clumsy autobiographical element as many have proposed. Rain criticises and rightfully if you are familiar with the Allen type the less savoury aspects of his novel and initiates the moment. But he admits that I don't want to hurt anyone. I don't want to get hurt. and realises that it will not last. A romantic illusion but a comfortable one for some.".

The kind of situation that arises simply by living with someone for many years without any major dramatic event occurring.Allen and Farrow plays Gabe and Judy. Since the movie was the last before their acrimonious split most of their dialogue sounds uncomfortably realistic. Pollack and Davis are their friends Jack and Sally who set the story in motion with their trial separation.Soon all four friends are entangled in new relationship or fantasize about one. Sally and then Judy are attracted to romantic Michael Neeson while Gabe is infatuated with Rain Juliette Lewis a student who reciprocates.However Rain is just a serial oldermen lover with the most annoying nasal voice and this indiscretion ends nowhere. On a side note I never liked Lewis who once again plays a lascivious nymphet with little energy.I am not a big fan of Farrow either. With her oversize thick sweaters long skirts and supershort hair Farrow is at her most unattractive in this movie. Her character is also whiny and pushy making her my least favorite of the quartet.The movie ends with a twist that I found hard to believe and a lot of ambiguity about the future of the characters that I found a lot more believable. Not for the romantics but definitely worthy.".

	schema:headline " Woody brilliantly channeling Ingmar Bergman";
	schema:reviewBody "One of Woody Allen's strongest films was the caustic and brilliant Husbands and Wives a 1992 black comedy that doesn't provide a lot of belly laughs but had me riveted to the screen with its scathingly accurate examination of the institution of marriage and the work and commitment that the institution constitutes.One of Woody's strongest outings as a writer and director the film is shot in the form of a documentary that features an offscreen narrator who not only narrates the story but interviews the central characters as well. The film introduces us to Gabe Woody and Judy Mia Farrow a supposedly happily married couple who are rocked by the calmly delivered news that their best friends Jack Sydney Pollack and Sally Judy Davis are planning to divorce. What we then get is a Bergman esque transformation between the two couples as Jack and Sally fail at new relationships and Gabe and Judy realize that they are not as happy as they think they are.There's a strong Ingmar Bergman influence here not surprising considering that Bergman is one of Allen's few cinematic idols as we watch two couples who are basically in the same place but don't even realize it but end up traveling journeys that mirror each other to the point that their lives have done a complete 180 by the time closing credits roll without them realizing what has happened until after it's happened. I found myself having Personna flashbacks the Bergman film about the actress and her nurse who gradually exchange personalities.Woody has put together an intensely personal story here that despite the documentary film technique still has a creepily voyeuristic feel to it. The scenes we are privy to all come off as intensely private and make the viewer feel like they are watching private moments that they are really not supposed to be seeing.As usual Woody has assembled a first rate cast...he and Farrow are a welloiled machine here despite the fact that this was the final film they made together before the SoonYi explosion and the tension between them is apparent on screen but it works for this story. The late Sydney Pollack once again proves that he was one of the few directors out there who could also act with his explosive performance as Jack and Judy Davis's crisp and unpredictable Sally actually earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Davis is just riveting here in a performance that burns a hole through the camera and makes it impossible to take your eyes off the woman and when Davis is not on screen the movie is just a little bit slower. LOVE the scene where Sally asks a blind date to use his phone twice so that she can yell at Jack about moving in with someone else.Liam Neesom is sexy and vulnerable as a coworker of Farrow's who comes between her and Davis and Juliette Lewis in a role I kept picturing Winona Ryder in scores as a student in Gabe's writing class who he eventually leaves Judy for. Lysette Anthony also makes an impression as the woman Jack moves in with after leaving Sally. The scene where where Pollack and Anthony make a very noisy exit from a party is almost frightening in its realism.This is not your usual Woody Allen fare and if you're looking for something with a lot of fall on the floor laughter you will be disappointed but if you're dedicated Woodyphile looking to experience his finest work as a writer and director Husbands and Wives should be at the top of your viewing list. This is a masterpiece right up there with Hannah and her Sisters and Crimes and Misdemeanors".

Before I watched the movie I saw that the movie was rated R. Surprisingly the film was not as shrill as I thought it would be. There is of course sexual content and foul language in the movie. There are no sex scenes but the language in the film is what ultimately gave the film an R rating.The film works because it has a realistic tone. It may be a drama but it is not depressing. It is also not as cerebral as many of his other flicks i.e. Manhattan and Crimes and Misdemeanors. So it obviously is a film that has a less pretentious mood. Combining these three qualities while also balancing the rational and nonrational elements of the relationships in the movie the film ultimately has a very natural flow to it.The actors are all good in this movie. Woody Allen and Mia Farrow are good. Not surprisingly this is Mia Farrow's last flick I counted her being in twelve Woody Allen flicks overall. Juliette Lewis is also good and has a role that strikingly seems to match the other types of characters that she portrays in her other films perhaps she is typecast. Liam Neeson is decent it is interesting to see him in a Woody Allen movie. After all it does not seem to be the type of movie he would ordinarily star in. Sydney Pollack and Judy Davis are the actors who steal the show in the final analysis however. Somemany will disagree but I hold firm to my humble opinion.For all I know my deeming of this to be his best movie may become different. My opinion may change if I see another flick of his such as Blue Jasmine or Broadway Danny Rose. It is interesting to note that the highest rated movie of his that I rated is not a comedy. It is rather unpredictable as to whether or not I will give a thumbsup to one of his dramas or his comedies after watching one of Woody Allen's movies.Concluding note  It generally seems to be the case that Woody Allen's movies are getting better as the years go by. Of course he may have some lulling periods but that's to be expected of anyone's work. I highly recommend this movie it teaches the viewer to be careful about who you marry. Entering into a relationship is obviously not to be taken lightly. Secondly it also causes one to ask the question Will this relationship work? And that as one who would watch the movie may agree is not a question that is easy to answer. Problems latent and seemingly easy to solve may blow up in the couple's face conversely problems that seem impossible to solve actually turn out to be more fixable than one would think.810".

Prudence and Bruce rush back to their therapists Tom Conti and Glenda Jackson respectively for advice... but their therapists are nuttier than they are and soon they Bob Bob's mother Zizi Genevieve Page and the entire waitstaff of a French restaurant are dragged into the fray.Durang's script adaptation and Altman's wallofsound take on it is wickedly funny and so many memorable lines My mother is NOT a transvestite! bounce through the film that the effect is absolutely dizzying the sound design is also memorable for the constant car crashes and china shattering that occurs in the background a metaphor for collision of characters happening before our eyes. The entire cast is absolutely first rate Hagerty Goldblum and Guest have never been better and Altman guides them with a very sure hand.Altman's vision always divides viewers you either like his films or you do not. Although BEYOND THERAPY offers a relatively small cast in a cohesive story it is actually one of Altman's most visually and aurally kaleidoscopic films and it is unlikely to convert those who find his style confusing and frustrating. But that said this is a musthave film for any Altman fan a truly enjoyable romantic comedy with a razor sharp script and a joyous style. Strongly strongly recommended.Gary F.

	schema:headline " It's ALTMAN folks  and a good presentation of same!";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie has been trashed by a lot of folks both professional reviewers and amateurs and gets an overall little better than a 4 average in this site. Some I've seen have given it a zilch  not even 1 star. There are those who bemoan Altman's ruining Durang's great play c'mon he's a good one but certainly not Shakespeare and this story isn't Hamlet. Besides he wrote the screenplay too and who  either writing or viewing this film  should be surprised at Altman's usual cacophony among the participants. This signature trait of his is why so many folks are at the opposite extremes in their opinions of Altman's work I'm one of those who love his films. Columbo is one of my alltime favorite television shows especially the earlier ones after only the great Larry Sanders Show don't know whether Larry David will settle into 3rd place or nudgeout Peter Falk. My late mother couldn't watch Columbo although detective dramas were always her favorite genre. She couldn't abide his mumbling and the way he always schlepped into and out of scenes and always came back for just one more thing. She was very intelligent and didn't need me to explain that these were the key elements of this iconic lead character  she simply didn't like them. So it should be with those who watch an Altman offering and then bitch about it. Go watch some Capra no less great in his own way than Altman but you'll keep your blood pressure down. This flick is outstanding in my opinion. The characters are quirky understatement funny sympathetic and interesting. The main cast  Goldblum Hagerty Guest Conti Jackson and Page  are wonderful as are the supporting group. I'll admit  making the film in Paris with a New York setting is unusual and seems at first an interesting puzzle  but not really who wouldn't for example take the opportunity to film a story set say in Los Angeles in Madrid if the producers would approve?. This is one of those films also where I find myself rewinding the DVD to see certain scenes over again every time I watch it.".

Let's have a bunch of people boys and girls men and women all going through therapy I mean psychoanalytical therapy with two doctors a man and a woman who are the links between them all. They all are disturbed in their sexual identification not because something is wrong with them though the women are nymphomaniac and the men are all in between straight and gay where the two meet exactly where the straight line bends just before breaking. That situation has been used so often by Woody Allen that we may think Altman is making a farcical parody or a fanciful remake. But you would be wrong to think so. There would have been no reason to go to Paris then. In fact the farce is a satire a twofold double entendre satire. The satire of all the comedies we get on the big screen that try to sound dramatic and are pathetic those melodramatic comedies that are supposed to make us both cry and laugh and often manage none or neither. That is an easy satire the easy level of the satire. The second level is targeting the modern middle class in western societies. They have become dead uncreative totally obsessed by themselves just some dead corpses perambulating in the street that we have forgotten to bury last time they opened the gates of the cemetery. At this level the satire becomes cruel with those selfsatisfied baboons we call the middle class who are essentially unoccupied in one other word idle and they have to spend and waste their time the same way they spend and waste the money they don't even spend any energy to make. They buy some kind of trinkets for themselves that have to be expensive and time consuming though harmless and useless. That's what psychoanalysts are all about the circulation of a lot of money in a lot of empty time that gives you the illusion of being so busy that you get giddy and dizzy. I must say it is well done but after a while it gets to shallow to really fascinate my weary eyes.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris Dauphine University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne  University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines".

Christopher Guest basically plays the petulant gay man he would reprise so classically ten years later in Waiting for Guffman.I don't know how Christopher Durang's stage play would read in a different context. It seems paper thin judging by this version but knowing Altman I have a feeling he dealt with the source material liberally and who knows how much of Durang's original play remains.

	schema:reviewBody "Maybe Robert Altman needed the change of pace or maybe it was just because he was in his momentary slump before hitting his stride again with Tanner 88 and Vincent  Theo but Beyond Therapy is a bewildering effort of farcical cinema. He takes a play by Christopher Durang and 'Altmanizes' it I suppose. There's the overlapping dialog the neurotic personalities the quirkycuminsane humor and the characters that float in and out of scenes like they're on a mixture of whimsy and mescaline. He also gives some good actors some things to do and funny things to say  sometimes too selfconscious to be funny at all and sometimes so bizarre that it becomes amusing just to see how far it will go. I couldn't say I didn't enjoy watching it all the time but it would also be unfair to say it's a complete failure. It's just a damn odd duck of a movie.It concerns patients and therapists the patients including blinddaters Bruce and Prudence Goldblum and Haggerty and their own problems with one another Bruce is bisexual or bicurious or just adventurous and Prudence is frigid and a little on edge all the time and their therapists and people they know. There's not a whole lot of variety in how the scenes play out there's arguments there's talking there's bedroom farce behavior tics and a story resolution that kind of folds back into itself just when it looks to get interesting. Some of the dialog whether by Durang or Altman or both can be funny at times or just with the way a character will react to something the premature ejaculation material from one of the therapists is funny  at least at first until the joke becomes tired and some of it just... stinks.The actors do try or at least they try to. It's hard not to like Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Guest and in some of the scenes it's equally fun and painful to see them in this material. Glenda Jackson fares better or just has her own tune to play when playing the therapist who hates gays and goes through a letter ala dictionarystyle to find a word to say. But some of the acting is just weird and not in a good way. Julie Haggerty doesn't deliver anything to make the movie entertaining frankly I never knew she did anything outside of Airplane! and Midnight Summer's Sex Comedy and now I remember why and what must have been some tighter scenes of sexfarce or screwball comedy on stage have been dissected by Altman and not successfully. Some of the director's touches kind of work though barely like the constant cutaways to a bald dude in the restaurant Michael Berryman's brother no? and the slowmotion shootout climax becomes impressive just to see how long Altman can maintain it.But a lot of this is just ridiculous and stupid and insipid as psychosex comedy. Woody Allen could have fared better or perhaps has fared better with similar material and would have in fact told a better story. Altman is so fascinated by his warped characters that it's all that's there warped characters. And if we can't care about any of them ultimately even in the scope of crazy satire why care at all?".

I'm normally an Altman defender in all cases  I'm a fan of stuff like That Cold Day in the Park Quintet and PretaPorter  and I've never seen him as a hitormiss director who has directed half masterpieces and half flops as his reputation tends to go. But this is truly a disaster! It's based on a stage play by Christopher Durang who also adapted this screenplay with Altman. I just can't imagine anyone sitting in the audience watching this garbage thinking Oh man that would make a great movie! unless the play was significantly different on stage. I kind of doubt it though. It has such a peculiar energy and it's not much like anything else Altman made. It feels like something pretentious people might have enjoyed on stage more likely in the 60s than in the 80s because it's just so odd. I'm usually a fan of odd but this one almost made me violently angry at times. Jeff Goldblum stars as a bisexual man living with his boyfriend Christopher Guest but trying to branch out into women. He meets Julie Hagerty on a blind date and they immediately hate each other. After therapy sessions and a second blind date they both change their ads slightly but end up together again they hit it off much to Guest's chagrin. Every character in the movie is constantly going to their therapist the two therapist characters are played by Glenda Jackson and Tom Conti. No one acts like a human being in this film just weird simulacra making faces at each other. There's hardly a laugh in it and the actors universally embarrass themselves. Better off completely forgotten.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jonathan Rivers Michael Keaton is a successful architect. His wife Anna Chandra West is an even more successful novelist. When Anna goes missing one night they fear she is dead. Suddenly an odd man named Raymond Price Ian McNeice shows up and tells Jonathan that his wife has been trying to contact him from the other side via Electronic Voice Phenomena EVPs. Rivers also gradually gets wrapped up in EVPs which lead him to some unusual situations and the heart of a mystery.I had a very divided reaction to White Noise. Some aspects were excellent but in many ways the film had potential that was never actualized. There are also some flaws that kept drawing me out of the film's universe. Overall I felt the film worked but probably not as writer Niall Johnson and director Geoffrey Sax intended.Let's talk about what the film did right first. The major assets as mentioned in the title of my review were the productionset design cinematography and overall atmosphere. The latter largely hinges on the first two. The productionset design and cinematography were nearly perfect. Everything was focused on the idea of white noise especially the most well known visual depiction of white noisetelevision static or snow. The credits introduced a motif of jarring intrusions of white noise which occasionally recurred throughout the film although perhaps not enough. There were clever instantiations of a visual white noise theme in the sets such as the outside waterfall on the lower level of Jonathan's apartment building and the wall of glass blocks inside his apartment. The color scheme was white silver and blue washed out so that the film had an almost black and white feel. There were also more abstract references to white noise such as the running water motif water dynamics are mathematically chaotic as is white noise which is also thought of as being literally random and the arcing electricity. All of this combined to provide a wonderful gloomy atmosphere and in another film would easily compensate for any minor flaws to bring the film up to a 10.However there are a number of problems with White Noise. Keaton's performance was the major sticking point for me. He seems aloof and brooding throughout the entire film. While that may have been perfect for Batman it doesn't work for me here. Both McNeice and Deborah Kara Unger as Sarah Tate were fine but their roles were minor enough to not be able to carry the film. I usually like Keaton a lot and I can't say that I dislike him here but his performance is very odd and offputting.Another problem was the pacing. For a long time White Noise may as well have been a realist drama. While that's fine for other films it also doesn't tend to work in a horrorthriller. The only directors I've seen really able to pull that combination off effectively are Alfred Hitchcock and M. Night Shyamalan. It takes so long to get to the horrorthriller part of the story that many people likely either lose interest by that point or they're interested because they'd rather see a realist drama and the more supernatural ending will be unsatisfying for them. The pacing also doesn't fit with the white noisechaos motif. This is a film that should have been edited like a Michael Bay vehicle.Finally I had a number of problems with the story. One there are quite a few superfluous elements such as Jonathan's son. Two although I'm not someone who usually complains about genre combinations there was an attempt to make White Noise both a benevolent spirit story ala Ghost 1990 and a Ring 2002like otherworldly threat. The two just didn't meld. Three the thriller aspect which enters primarily at the climax of the film seems too tacked on to engender an appropriate emotional reaction from the audience. And four the supernatural aspects and especially the twist revelation of the ending are very rushed and unpleasantly ambiguous possibly in an attempt to hide the fact that the plot in these respects wasn't very well thought out. There is a tremendous amount of potential in the script and it is entertaining enough to marginally recommend but this seems more like an early draft that was rushed to completion or possibly a film that suffered a lot of studio meddling.The bottom line is that while there are enough positive elements to make White Noise worth a watch to serious genre fans and students of filmmaking do not expect the story to grab you by the short and curlies and do not expect much of a resolution. Enjoy the film primarily for its visuals. I'm generously rating the film a 7 out of 10.".

One there are quite a few superfluous elements such as Jonathan's son. Two although I'm not someone who usually complains about genre combinations there was an attempt to make White Noise both a benevolent spirit story ala Ghost 1990 and a Ring 2002like otherworldly threat. The two just didn't meld. Three the thriller aspect which enters primarily at the climax of the film seems too tacked on to engender an appropriate emotional reaction from the audience. And four the supernatural aspects and especially the twist revelation of the ending are very rushed and unpleasantly ambiguous possibly in an attempt to hide the fact that the plot in these respects wasn't very well thought out. There is a tremendous amount of potential in the script and it is entertaining enough to marginally recommend but this seems more like an early draft that was rushed to completion or possibly a film that suffered a lot of studio meddling.The bottom line is that while there are enough positive elements to make White Noise worth a watch to serious genre fans and students of filmmaking do not expect the story to grab you by the short and curlies and do not expect much of a resolution. Enjoy the film primarily for its visuals. I'm generously rating the film a 7 out of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "Interesting. Intense. Somewhat original. All words to describe a conversation with Johnny Betts. But they also apply to Michael Keaton's White Noise. What we have here is a ghost story that tackles the subject of electronic voice phenomenon or as the cool kids like to call it  EVP.For those of you who unlike Johnny Betts aren't master ghost hunters EVP is the alleged communication by spirits through the white noise of staticky radio stations television stations and other electronic devices. People truly believe in it and if you do a quick search on the Internet then you can find plenty of websites with audio files they say prove the existence of EVP. Detractors will brush this off with explanations of the chaos theory and cross modulation. I'll let you do your own research if you're interested in the subject.If you're looking for a factual exploration of EVP's possible legitimacy then you won't find it in White Noise. This is a movie that takes a subject popular with ghost hunters and glorifies it. It reminds me a little of The Mothman Prophecies which was a fictionalized account of what was supposed to be a true story. I have no problem with that. That's what movies are all about.Michael Keaton crawls out from underneath whatever rock he's been under does his best Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense impersonation and dives into the world of receiving messages from the dead. Folks you can nitpick the logic to death if you want and trust me most critics are. Why would he just put his successful life on hold and spend all his time trying to receive messages from his wife through a bunch of radio and TV static? Dunno. The tragic death of a spouse can do weird things to people. Plus you know IT'S A MOVIE! And in the movie he actually does receive messages from the dead. I guess he figured he'd try it it worked so he got more involved. Lighten up. It's called fiction.Yeah well if his wife wanted to contact him then why wouldn't she send him clearer messages? Why does it have to be through static? BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT EVP IS ALL ABOUT! Take it up with the proponents of EVP not the movie. I totally agree that one of the things that makes so many people skeptical about EVP is that the messages are never complex. If I heard an EVP that said Tell Johnny Betts that the afterlife rules and he should keep the Movie Mark going strong then I'd probably be convinced. But what we get is a lot of one syllable words and sounds strung together. That's not the movie's fault. Deal with it and move on.As some of you know I'm a huge fan of the thrillerhorror genre. Admittedly White Noise isn't one of the best of all time in the genre but that's OK. It didn't convince me to run home record a static TV channel for hours and then play it back to see if Uncle Jack was sending me a message from the great beyond. Like an apology for that little streaking stunt that completely ruined my 16th birthday party. However what the movie did do is entertain me. The mystery is deliberately paced it kept my interest and it provided some creepy moments along the way.Things start to get pretty intense near the end of the movie and some people might not be happy with the finale. But keep in mind that trying to communicate with the dead is a bit of a dark subject. Some people as the movie depicts think that if they can contact their dead relatives then they'll have hope they'll know all is right in the afterlife. They want some sort of message for closure. But I'm just curious what if that message is Burning. Hell. I screwed up. ??? I'm guessing that'd be a bit of a kick in the pants.But getting back to the movie... if there's good in the afterlife there has to be evil as well right? In the movie contacting the dead initially seems harmless enough. But why would you think only the good would respond if you create that humanafterlife portal? What would happen if evil decided to communicate as well? White Noise has a viewpoint on that subject and you can't expect everything to be cute and cuddly.Now if you'll excuse me I'm gonna take a closer listen to this static coming from the radio. Let's see. Sounds like Uncle Jack! I can just make it out... Johnny. Reviews. Not funny. Quit. Now. Um yeah just as I thought  nothing but a little cross modulation! THE GIST White Noise is an interesting take on the ghost story using the subject of EVP as its backdrop. It isn't what I'd call scary but it's got its share of creepy moments and effective jump scenes. If you're looking for a docudrama on the scientific accuracy of EVP then you might be disappointed but if you're in the mood for a few chills to start the year then White Noise just might suit you.Rating 4 out of 5".

	schema:reviewBody "White Noise is a film that takes a true scientific phenomenon and makes a film out of it. The phenomenon is one which involves electronic recordingbroadcast equipment. In amongst whitenoise that crackle and hiss you get on a blank recording and static on untuned TV reception there are voices and images discernible. Sometimes these voices have been clear enough to work out and many people believe they are the voices and images of those who have died trying to contact the living.In the film Michael Keaton plays Jonathan Rivers an estate agent who loses his wife. When he is approached by Raymond a man who lost his son years ago and claims he has heard from Jonathan's wife it draws him into the phenomenon and pretty soon he becomes obsessed recording his own tapes and viewinglistening to them for messages. Then suddenly the messages become clear and seem to be premonitions. Can he decipher the meaning of the messages or will he disturb something best left alone? I was uncertain going into the film what to expect. Too many times the film world have come up with a great concept but failed to deliver anything more than mediocre when it is a horror subject. Expecting another Godsend I was pleasantly surprised to find a pretty good film with some nice touches and chills. Admittedly the story wouldn't look out of place on XFiles but unlike the recent The Forgotten it manages to feel complete and doesn't seem to take the easy option at the end.The direction by Sax best know for his TV work such as Tipping the Velvet Dr Who Clocking Off and Spitting Image to name a few is more than sufficient and he uses the whitenoise to great effect. A little buzz here and flicker there all serve to unnerve and you could be forgiven for thinking you are watching another Japanese adaptation. There are a lot of similarities to eastern horror throughout the use of silence the unnerve the distorted images in the TV sets and so on. Only the occasion music to let you know you should jump lets down the tone.Nevertheless with a well woven script which doesn't pander to the lowest denominator and a sterling performance from Michael Keaton who hasn't really had a presence on the screen since 1998s Jack Frost make this an enjoyable little movie which deserves a viewing or two.".

After Batman's funeral he decides to send a message from beyond the grave apologizing to his son for being an idiot evidently feeling that the best way to protect his kid from the horrors of EVP is to expose him to it. The little kid just smiles. Nothing phases that dude not even when his dad Batman of course starts talking to TV's.

The characters are accurate and the subject of Electronic Voice Phenomena is well represented.It is a Hollywoodesquire movie in that some things are portrayed a little bigger than real life but that in no way detracts from the believability of the movie. It has none of the fantasy that things like Ghostbusters bestowed upon a naive audience. I loved this movie. Truly. It touched me on a personal level. It made me think about some of the more risky possibilities of my profession. And some parts really made me jump in my seat!See it. At least twice.".

I was very surprised when half way through this movie I thought I may have broken my husband's hand because I was squeezing so hard. While the beginning of the movie is a little slow it pulls you along because you can sense something is going to happen. When it does I was not disappointed at all.I thought the acting was great even though Michael Keaton is not aging well. It was filmed entirely in Vancouver and was beautiful to watch. The traditional scary effects are used well and wisely and you will jump despite preparing yourself for the scare. While I am not a believer in ghosts this movie made me think and forever question and fear white noise.".

	schema:reviewBody "Keaton loses his wife tragically is approached by a psychic who claims he's getting messages from her through the static on broadcast equipment. At first skeptical Keaton eventually becomes obsessed only to learn there's some down sides to the whole Electronic Voice Phenomenon experience.It's an interesting premise for a horror film. Keaton is excellent playing a nice normal guy slowly going off the rails very convincingly. There are a couple of effective jolts and scares especially in the middle part of the movie.There are two main problems with the movie. One is the climax which is absolutely horrendous bringing in a serial killer and involving other characters in the movie in an absolutely unbelievable contrived kind of way.The other is that the movie tries to be serious and soberminded about it's subject matter which is admirable but it's serious only in tone not content. So we have a lengthy set up to ease us into the horror which is a good idea  but we also apparently are in a world where nobody thinks psychics con them. There are efforts to plug obvious plot holes which is good but we still have Keaton behaving like every other horror movie fruitcake Abandoning the Woman Whom He's Sworn to Protect Delving Into Things Man Was Not Meant To Know Going Into The Spooky Place Alone.In other words the movie's not really serious  it doesn't really want to investigate this idea intelligently. It's using seriousness as a pose much as another might use ironic. And that's a real problem because just as you're being lulled into thinking this is something different and special you get bumped up against some stunning stupidity that ruins the mood. Then just when you adjust to the cheesiness we go back to seriousness again which ruins that mood. And so on.The blame I think has to go with the director who after all controls the vibe of the movie. It's kind of depressing  I think there's a good movie in here somewhere. Better hands might have brought it out.".

I found White Noise to be preposterous beyond our best efforts of suspension of disbelief. Even after witnessing the harrowing ordeal sustained by Michael Keaton I was totally unaffected by his demise. Up until the credits I diligently awaited for somethinganything of substance to connect me to the characters' story but such relief never came. Sure there were the occasional heartstopper moments but only because loud noises tend to do that to the dozing viewer.While the acting was lame Michael Keaton may have played his studliest role to date. Perhaps the only redeeming quality that White Noise has to offer is the stunning archietecture in both of Keaton's abodes. Overall White Noise leaves one with the morbidly depressing idea that those who die are trapped in a world guarded by three malicious shadows contriving to trick the living into following the dead to their own graves.".

If you go with an intense curiosity for the subject of EVP but have no prior knowledge of it you will be somewhat disappointed as the picture does not explain the the phenomena adequately. If you go in a bona fide skeptic you are likely to leave as a disgruntled skeptic.As for me having had prior knowledge on the subject matter I went to this movie quite eagerly and was only slightly disappointed. The film did depict a newly widowed man's grief and the desperation that sometimes follows such a loss. Although not many will go as far as to attempt contact via electronic devices we can identify with the protagonist's need for closure. for who hasn't longed for that last conversation kind word or even a farewell from a deceased loved one.The actors were proficient in their roles and a number of scenes left me quite shocked and unsettled. That is saying quite a lot as I've tried my hand at contacting the spirit world before but have never seen such a frightening experience as that endured by the protagonists.The only things that detracted from the movie was its ending and its confusing pace. Although the first third of the movie went at an almost too slow pace it was easy to follow. The latter 23s of the program could get confusing and almost felt like some one stomped into the studio whilst they were filming and said Come on then! Get a move on! We haven't got until Gabriel's trumpet resounds! It simply went to quickly hence my decision to see it twice. Not to spoil anything for those who have not seen this picture yet but the latter part of the movie left matters to be desired.The generous rating is warranted however for creating an interesting movie around something as timeconsuming and often unrewarding as EVP is quite a feat in and of itself. True they have embellished things quite a bit but if they hadn't they'd not attract as wide an audience. The special effects were done well and the director did the splendid job of keeping the audience tense for the greater part of the picture.If you purchase the DVD plan to watch it twice or thrice to get the most enjoyment out of it. Remember to watch also with an open mind and at least some prior knowledge to the EVP phenomenon. Happy watching.".

I really wanted to like this flick since I couldn't recall the last movie I'd seen him in.On the positive side White Noise was well acted and directed. The scary effects were jolting. The music was exciting and helped to build the tension. The characters were interesting and although I don't particularly believe in ghosts I felt some emotional bond with this theme.Aside from that the movie's script makes little or no sense. The ending was unforgivably dumb and for me the movie was a big waste of time. My husband fell asleep for the last twenty minutes so he was in a better place for the incredibly unmotivated ending.I didn't stay for the credits. Where was this film shot? There are no filming locations noted here at IMDb. The only clue was one character has a business card that says Washington and area code 206.I'm giving it a D and just cannot recommend this movie. However there are some January holdovers that may pique your interest. Try The Aviator  Kinsey  or Sideways this weekend.See you at the movies!".

You leave the theater feeling unsatisfied. The movie had so much to give but couldn't. Just because you can edit doesn't mean you should right? I wouldn't really recommend this movie because you just can't say that you left the movie feeling like it was completed. You'll just be confused.

At the end of the movie you really didn't know what was going on. I pretty much understood the whole movie but the end was confusing. Don't go waste your time with this movie just wait till it's free on TV and that's if you really still want to see it. White Noise is a piece of trash and not worth eight dollars to go see.

It has nothing to do not directly with ITC or instrumental trans communication which is the process of taking a video camera hooking it up to a television output and input as you would if you wanted to playback what you recorded then recording what the camera sees on the television. Theory is that the feedback loop frequency is the same one ghosts are geared to. These two topics of EVP and ITC are closely related but not the same thing. I was immensely disappointed why should I have expected Hollywood to research fully a topic that they put to movie genre with this movie and how it portrayed my field of work. It wasn't even really a good horror movie either.

	schema:headline " Star Power Overcomes Some Comic Weaknesses";
	schema:reviewBody "There are many movies where the performances are so good that the weaknesses of the movie itself are almost oblivious.The casting in this film bringing together the stars of the original with Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as Greg aka Gaylord Focker's parents is sensational.While I admit that I believed I would read comments and reviews about the crudeness of the material I believe the reason this is not a typically tragic Hollywood farce is due to the strength of the performances and the interaction of the characters.As you know the premise of the movie is very simple. Prior to the wedding of Greg and Pam the two families will meet. In typical Hollywood sequel fashion we already know that the Byrnses are somewhat reserved set in their ways. So it is no surprise that the Fockers are almost the complete opposite.Hilarity ensures some crude some overtly sexual. But the cast is skillful and it plays more like a comic version of Closer. You will believe that Bernie and Roz amazing performances by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand are Greg Focker's parents. Not only is their interaction genuine their love for their child is as well. Part of Greg's embarrassment is the knowledge of his parents' quirks and how different they are from the Byrnses. Ben Stiller aptly conveys this while not backing down from his love for his parents.Meanwhile stern Jack Byrnes scans the Fockers for clues to prove why he should not like them therefore not allowing his daughter to be married into that family. His design of the RV is classic Jack Byrnes. What is an improvement in this film is that Jack discovers some things about himself and his relationship with his wife and daughter that change him. This may be the funniest performance in Robert DeNiro's career.Throughout the film there are themes that everyone has experienced but most of all how important love is. The love of another and the love of family and friends. There is a very good example of this in a scene between Teri Polo and Ben Stiller after some new information is exposed that could possibly tear them apart once again.All in all when you know the cast is having a good time the audience does too. I will be seeing this one more than once.".

	onyx:emotionText "There are many movies where the performances are so good that the weaknesses of the movie itself are almost oblivious.The casting in this film bringing together the stars of the original with Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand as Greg aka Gaylord Focker's parents is sensational.While I admit that I believed I would read comments and reviews about the crudeness of the material I believe the reason this is not a typically tragic Hollywood farce is due to the strength of the performances and the interaction of the characters.As you know the premise of the movie is very simple. Prior to the wedding of Greg and Pam the two families will meet. In typical Hollywood sequel fashion we already know that the Byrnses are somewhat reserved set in their ways. So it is no surprise that the Fockers are almost the complete opposite.Hilarity ensures some crude some overtly sexual. But the cast is skillful and it plays more like a comic version of Closer. You will believe that Bernie and Roz amazing performances by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand are Greg Focker's parents. Not only is their interaction genuine their love for their child is as well. Part of Greg's embarrassment is the knowledge of his parents' quirks and how different they are from the Byrnses. Ben Stiller aptly conveys this while not backing down from his love for his parents.Meanwhile stern Jack Byrnes scans the Fockers for clues to prove why he should not like them therefore not allowing his daughter to be married into that family. His design of the RV is classic Jack Byrnes. What is an improvement in this film is that Jack discovers some things about himself and his relationship with his wife and daughter that change him. This may be the funniest performance in Robert DeNiro's career.Throughout the film there are themes that everyone has experienced but most of all how important love is. The love of another and the love of family and friends. There is a very good example of this in a scene between Teri Polo and Ben Stiller after some new information is exposed that could possibly tear them apart once again.All in all when you know the cast is having a good time the audience does too. I will be seeing this one more than once.";

Just the same the title pretty much describes the level of the humor in this Ben Stiller comedy. But that's redundant because it IS a Ben Stiller movie. Clearly my expectations for this movie were not high and maybe because of that I found Meet the Fockers quite funny.Don't get me wrong. This is not a movie for everyone. First off the writers did not miss a single opportunity to play off of the name Focker. It's silly and gets a little old but it somehow works with the other repetitious lowdown gags.Focker is the family name for Greg Focker Ben Stiller. The funniest Fockers however now I'm doing it are Greg's parents Bernie and Roz a loose and liberal Florida hippy couple still living in the last century and enjoying every minute of it. Dustin Hoffman as Bernie displays a previously unrevealed talent for over the top comedy. Fitting perfectly with Hoffman's Bernie is Barbra Streisand as Roz Focker reminiscent of the zaftig Lainie Kazan. Bernie is a yesteryear lawyer who has not practiced since who knows when. Roz is the main breadwinner from her business as a sex therapist to the elderly.Greg is not too eager to reveal his parents' true nature to his fiance's parents as they all come to visit to get to know one another better. Teri Polo nicely plays Greg's fiance Pam. Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner play her stiff and straight parents Jack and Dina Byrnes. Oh  also add in some baby lowbrow by Spencer and Bradley Pickeren two adorable twins playing Little Jack.So go low go loose  or don't go at all  but if you like Ben Stiller go see Meet the Fockers. Dustin's antics will crack you up and you'll enjoy Barbra back on the big screen after so long. Rated a B.".

Overall it was a fine ensemble cast and good scripting of the jokes and situations surrounding the irrepressible exCIA agent and family patriarch Jack Byrnes Robert DeNiro. But Hoffman's character Bernie Focker an attorney who retired to become a fulltime dad to his son Greg Ben Stiller grounds this comedy in solid human values that raise the film beyond the level of nutty comedy.I admired how Hoffman's character revealed genuine pain following the nasty remarks of Jack Byrnes. For example the shrine of framed memorabilia of his son's accomplishments was ridiculed by Jack. One could empathize with Bernie's pain which he registered at the criticism. Indeed throughout the film the most memorable scenes were those with Hoffman's character on the defense but also taking the offensive against Jack. The film also included some wildly funny moments such as the teenager born out of wedlock to Greg's babysitter a young lad with humongous eyebrows who was a deadringer for Ben Stiller's character and Jack's outrageous motor home rigged with listening devices which provided him with his command center for spying on the Fockers. Much credit should go to director Jay Roach for outstanding comic rhythms timing and pacing.In the end this was thoroughly enjoyable movie which had the surprising effect of providing a good window into family values unusual for Hollywood film comedies.".

With no further excuses Greg and Dina join Pam and Jack as they take their RV down to Florida to meet the Focker family. With an eye very much on his bloodline Jack is keen to judge his future soninlaw by his parents which spells problems when he finds himself living with two very liberal and touchyfeely Fockers.I'm in my thirties now and it probably is not very impressive that I can put words together in a basic sentence. Whereas for a two year old it might be a real surprise if they were to discuss their opinions on political matters as such with you. What is the difference? Well it is simply one of expectation. Coming to the subject of films expectation can often make or break a film with perhaps a poor Pauly Shore movie being better received by viewers than a poor Spielberg film partly because you expect that standard from the former but more from the latter. So it does help this film that with the very title you are informed that you are not about to witness the sharpest of comedies.With this in mind I went in with a forgiving eye just hoping for laughs but I was not really prepared for how most of the film is unimaginative and base. In the first film we had Greg contrast with stern father Jack and hilarity ensues here we have the same setup again but this time Greg is replaced as a device by his parents. What this means is that the film essentially aims at the same low targets as the first film and mostly hits them. To avoiding being too boorish on this subject I will admit that moments are funny and that the casting was a nice try but mostly I just found it obvious and dull. Toilet humour a retread of the CIA stuff and so on supposedly provide the comedy while the drama is the same superficial relationship stuff as before.The cast mostly do their best to try and lift it. Stiller mugs along well enough but the real fun such as it is comes from De Niro and Hoffman. The former more or less just does his stuff again but is enjoyable enough while the latter is at least having fun with a silly character. Streisand and Polo have lesser roles but still have a bit of fun while poor Danner is just a plot device to try and the give the film some sort of centre. Cameos from Wilson and Nelson don't add much to proceedings and don't even get me starting on the annoying Pickren twins who are not only irritating but made more irritating by the way the film overuses them apparently in the belief that Little Jack is funny andor cute when really he is neither. Roach's direction is nothing short of pedestrian  even the choice of theme music is obvious and easy.Overall then this is a film that people who really liked the first film will enjoy. Those that just liked it may find that they didn't like it enough to watch it twice which is what is happening here. The cast play it up as much as they can but really this is just an extension of the original idea done bigger but to lesser effect.".

The original was very funny and it had a great repeat value. However the reviews started coming in and they were all negative so I was a little discouraged. I still went to see it and it turned out to be very funny. The critics really need to lighten up since they turned away a fine comedy. Sure some of the gags are old and tired but they still work. They use a lot of Focker jokes and of male nurse jokes sob that kind of got annoying but it wasn't an overload either. The story is pretty much the same as the first one except now Greg's parents are thrown into the mix and nothing ever goes right. The writers came up with a bunch of different funny situations and some of them were recycled while others were new.The cast is great and they help move the film along nicely. The best was clearly Dustin Hoffman as Greg's dad. He was hilarious and fun to watch on screen. Ben Stiller was okay but his uptight character role is kind of getting annoying. Robert De Niro also gives a funny performance and he is now forgiven for appearing in Godsend. Barbara Streisand was surprisingly funny and bearable. I usually cannot stand her but she was alright in the movie. Blythe Danner gives a decent performance nothing really special. Teri Polo was the only miscast in the movie. She just didn't fit or look well next to Hoffman Stiller and De Niro. Owen Wilson makes a cameo and it was decent a little unnecessary though.Jay Roach directs and he does a good job with the movie though it was a little too long. 115 minutes is kind of long for a comedy and because of the long running time the film starts to bore around the end. They should have taken some things out to keep the film shorter and interesting. I also didn't like the character little Jack. He was the grandson of Jack De Niro and he was very annoying. The addition of the baby character was unnecessary and it kind of brought the film down. Compared to the original the first one is funnier and more enjoyable. The second one is still pretty funny but it doesn't have a good repeat value. However the film is still worth checking out in theaters. In the end please ignore the critics and check this film out in theaters. Rating 710".

	schema:headline " A different kind of comedy than Meet the Parents";
	schema:reviewBody "Series note As this is a direct continuation of Meet the Parents 2000 it is recommended that you watch that film first. It gives necessary background exposition and characterization for this film.Gaylord Greg Focker Ben Stiller and fiance Pam Byrnes' Teri Polo wedding is fast approaching and their parents still have not met each other. So Greg and Pam fly from Chicago to New York to meet her parents Jack Robert De Niro and Dina Blythe Danner before heading off with them to Miami to meet his parents Bernie Dustin Hoffman and Mother Focker Roz Barbara Streisand. The problem is that the Byrnes are staid conservative though slightly crazy types who would never think of showing public affection while the Fockers are still hippiesshe is a sex therapist for elderly couples and he's a lawyer who became Mr. Mom once Gaylord was born. Can Gaylord keep his parents reined in enough to not cause Jack blow his lid and try to stop the wedding? Although I didn't think Meet the Fockers was quite as funny or successful as Meet the Parents it's still funny and successful with a bit less of an emphasis on nonstop outrageous humor and a bit more of an emphasis on the often amusing complexities of extended family relationships.If you've seen Meet the Parents firstand you shouldsome of the material such as Gaylord's job jokes based on the Focker name and even Jack's background and disposition will have less of an impact which initially partially depends on novelty and surprise. Additionally director Jay Roach and the writing team of James Herzfeld Marc Hyman and John Hamburg telegraph quite a few of the punch lines. For just one example it's obvious that something is going to happen to Gaylord's rental car in New York as soon as we hear him opt out of purchasing insurance blowing it off as a scam to make money.On the other hand Roach and crew make it clear from the start that they're not exactly shooting for the same style of film as Meet the Parents. This is evident from the beginning which cleverly pokes fun at Meet the Parents' gradually going to hell in a handbasket style by having everything go exactly right.Roach aims for classic scenarios of families colliding that have surprisingly serious subtexts and in the real world these kinds of situations do have an attendant humor at least when we're not right in the midst of them. Every family tends to have its own customs and norms its own take on ethics etiquette politics religion and so on. Naturally when we try to merge families through marriages uncomfortable often embarrassing and frequently tense situations abound. Aside from the humor this is the crux of Meet the Fockers.Another important subtext that occurs in various guises through the film and for which the potential was there in Meet the Parents even if it wasn't capitalized on in quite the same way is opening up to free honest expression of one's thoughts feelings and desires versus showing a proper public face. This is particularly amusing and poignant in the case of Jack whose job involved obtaining honest expression but who is the strongest case of putting on a false public faceto an extent that he's bought into the persona himself. In a way Roach and crew are suggesting that if we can really reach that ideal selfexpression maybe those family mergers and even other kinds of cultural encounters such as the Fockers' runin with the police could proceed more smoothly.So it's not so important whether Meet the Fockers is as funny as Meet the Parents. Roach isn't just trying to make you laugh even though he does so frequently. Despite all the comments in others' reviews about sexoriented humor how could you not expect that in a film with a title like this? or general lowbrow humor the comic situations here are more sophisticated in many ways than a typical outrageous comedy. That means that you're not going to laugh out loud with tears streaming down your face as often as you're going to be sitting there with a big smile on your face watching scenarios such as Bernie trying and mostly succeeding to hold on to his hippie ideals no matter what the short term costs. This is more a humor of slightly exaggerated but realistic folly played fabulously by a stellar cast.".

For just one example it's obvious that something is going to happen to Gaylord's rental car in New York as soon as we hear him opt out of purchasing insurance blowing it off as a scam to make money.On the other hand Roach and crew make it clear from the start that they're not exactly shooting for the same style of film as Meet the Parents. This is evident from the beginning which cleverly pokes fun at Meet the Parents' gradually going to hell in a handbasket style by having everything go exactly right.Roach aims for classic scenarios of families colliding that have surprisingly serious subtexts and in the real world these kinds of situations do have an attendant humor at least when we're not right in the midst of them. Every family tends to have its own customs and norms its own take on ethics etiquette politics religion and so on. Naturally when we try to merge families through marriages uncomfortable often embarrassing and frequently tense situations abound. Aside from the humor this is the crux of Meet the Fockers.Another important subtext that occurs in various guises through the film and for which the potential was there in Meet the Parents even if it wasn't capitalized on in quite the same way is opening up to free honest expression of one's thoughts feelings and desires versus showing a proper public face. This is particularly amusing and poignant in the case of Jack whose job involved obtaining honest expression but who is the strongest case of putting on a false public faceto an extent that he's bought into the persona himself. In a way Roach and crew are suggesting that if we can really reach that ideal selfexpression maybe those family mergers and even other kinds of cultural encounters such as the Fockers' runin with the police could proceed more smoothly.So it's not so important whether Meet the Fockers is as funny as Meet the Parents. Roach isn't just trying to make you laugh even though he does so frequently. Despite all the comments in others' reviews about sexoriented humor how could you not expect that in a film with a title like this? or general lowbrow humor the comic situations here are more sophisticated in many ways than a typical outrageous comedy. That means that you're not going to laugh out loud with tears streaming down your face as often as you're going to be sitting there with a big smile on your face watching scenarios such as Bernie trying and mostly succeeding to hold on to his hippie ideals no matter what the short term costs. This is more a humor of slightly exaggerated but realistic folly played fabulously by a stellar cast.";

Jack wants to know if Greg came from a good gene pool. Jack discovers that the Fockers are very strange. The Dad Dustin Hoffman is a hippie and retired lawyer and the Mom Barbara Streisand is an open sex therapist. Jack begins to thinks this is not a good family for his daughter to marry into. Greg's parents are so proud of Greg that they have a wall of honor with Greg's ninth and tenth place sports awards. The two families try to become one family. This was one hilarious movie which I laughed from beginning to end. This is proof of the old adage that actors don't like to work with children and animals because they stole the movie. The child spoke with sign language and had some of the best comedy scenes of the movie. The toilet scene with the cat and dog was just so funny. Universal Run time 130 Rated PG13 810".

	onyx:emotionText "In this sequel to 'Meet the Parents' Gaylord Greg Focker Ben Stiller has finally invited his fiance's parents exCIA agent Jack Byrnes and his wife Robert DeNiro and Blythe Danner to meet his parents. Jack wants to know if Greg came from a good gene pool. Jack discovers that the Fockers are very strange. The Dad Dustin Hoffman is a hippie and retired lawyer and the Mom Barbara Streisand is an open sex therapist. Jack begins to thinks this is not a good family for his daughter to marry into. Greg's parents are so proud of Greg that they have a wall of honor with Greg's ninth and tenth place sports awards. The two families try to become one family. This was one hilarious movie which I laughed from beginning to end. This is proof of the old adage that actors don't like to work with children and animals because they stole the movie. The child spoke with sign language and had some of the best comedy scenes of the movie. The toilet scene with the cat and dog was just so funny. Universal Run time 130 Rated PG13 810";

Its cool how they took laid back people and matched them with pams parents who are strict and uptight makes for great comedy.

The lowest point of this film were the scenes that involved the baby Pam's sister son instead of spend so much time with him the writers should have developed more Owen Wilson's character. It may not be the best comedy ever made but Meet the Fockers is a very good and funny movie with excellent performances and a good script.My rating 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Like virtually all mainstream releases Meet the Fockers is of course really too awful to warrant an amateur review only the professionals should be forced to deal with the dreary task. But a movie whose cast includes Robert De Niro Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand would SEEM to invite discussion. Thirty years ago such a cast would have indicated a Major Motion Picture. In 2005 I'm sorry to report that these livinglegend actors have been inducted  however profitably to themselves  in the ongoing mission to Keep DreamWorks Afloat. The StillerDe Niro franchise has officially joined the Shrek series as an anomalous moneymaker for the studio. The creative bankruptcy of Messrs. Spielberg Geffen and Katzenberg resulted in the demise of both the TV and music units of the company and as for the moviewing of the operation that creative bankruptcy has never been more clearly demonstrated than with Meet the Fockers.But as I've said Fockers appears to be making a lot of boxoffice dough so the sheer awfulness is likely to continue. Expect Fockers 3 and maybe even a Fockers 4. Expect the same for Shrek too. In fact the sequels may go on and on until somebody over at DreamWorks finds a way to concoct a good movie. Or maybe Spielberg will occasionally drag himself into the director's chair and put the aging Toms  Hanks or Cruise  through the motions of the occasional spurious blockbuster.I realize I've not talked much about the movie itself but why bother? The first film of the series Meet the Parents at least had the chemistry between De Niro and Stiller and an overall funny premise the nice Jewish guy desperately trying to fit into the suburban milieu of a pathologically WASPish family. The Stiller character's alltoohuman propensity for telling whitelie upon whitelie complicated his troubles and increased the comedy. In Fockers Stiller and De Niro are curiously muted in their few scenes together. One wonders if they were getting along on the set. But on the other hand the movie isn't focused on their interpersonal dynamic anyway choosing instead to make De Niro the putupon character overwhelming him with the stereotypical earthiness i.e. Jewishness I suppose of the Focker parents. This diminishment of De Niro totally misses the point of what worked in the first movie which is that he was a largerthanlife maniac whose expectations were so high that nobody especially not Ben Stiller could hope to match them.As for Hoffman and Streisand they bring nothing unique to their stereotypical roles any pair of aging actors would have sufficed. The fact that they're introduced by way of an answering machine only cements their irrelevance. I even doubt that they've enhanced the boxoffice profits as most people under the age of 30 scarcely know who they are anyway  Hoffman and Streisand haven't been major screen presences for some time. Which brings me back to De Niro he had better play King Lear or its contemporary equivalent and do it fast. One tires of watching this great actor continue to trash his legacy with these godawful comedies. He needs to remind us that he was once considered the greatest screen actor since Brando. But then Brando ended up as a joke too. Curse of The Godfather perhaps?1 star out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gliding on the good graces of its predecessor this new installment has very little to showcase in the way of ground breaking comedy. Not that anyone would expect a sequel to 'Meet the Parents' as being a 'departure film' or a film that would ever titillate its audience with anything close to resembling an 'over the line' type of comedy. No this film is just a very safe and predictable sequel.This sequel force feeds us the chronic Ben Stiller humiliation angle scene after scene. Adding to the comedic clockwork the producer and or director or whatever moron in charge decided to work in the 'baby genius' sub plot into every 7th minute of the film. As if that wasn't enough dumbing down we're all supposed to be delighted by the dog and cat show that takes place inside DeNiro's 'home on wheels'. The fact that the punch line to this dog and cat chase joke is predicated on one of the animals landing inside the toilet seems an appropriate place the proper level if you will where this film seems most at home.Infants that are more intelligent than adults cats that are smarter than dogs how could this film succeed? Well it can't succeed. However I have to admit to one thing about this film being good. The performances of Barbara Streisand and Dustin Hoffman were good. I was surprised to see a return to comic form from Barbara Streisand. She really should have been making comedymusicals these past few years...er...decades. Comedy really suits her. Both her performance and Hoffman's are surprisingly good.Not to take anything away from DeNiro who is also likable but I was more interested in the 'wacky' hijinks between Streisand and Hoffman.Here's the thing. The movie is enjoyable but I rolled my eyes way too much for me to consider this a great comedy. It's a comedy that is very much by the numbers for the numbers.If you don't mind a comedy that works down to Mall level where you can see the jokes coming then watch it on DVD.I would have given this movie a 510 but Streisand and Hoffman were a pleasant enough surprise. I didn't hate this movie I just didn't like it all that much.".

The original classic Conan the Barbarian was a hit but the Hollywood bigwigs decided they could get xamount more money if they made a more familyfriendly sequel thereby opening the franchise to the lucrative kid's market never mind that for as long as there have been restrictive movie ratings kids have known how to get to see the movies they want.  Take out the sex tone down the violence crank up the humor and... out comes this movie.It's like Destroyer is stuck in a state of halfdevelopment.  The basic storyline would be okay but the script gives Conan a coterie of unneccessary sidekicks as if Conan were not a strong enough character to carry a movie by himself.  Grace Jones is interesting to look at but gets tiresome VERY fast the cowardly sidekick gets more irritating by the second Mako wears this expression like he's only in this one for the money. Olivia d'Abo is just plain miscast it's like she's a marker that should read Insert More Interesting Character in Second Draft.  Arnold Schwarzenegger does a competent job as Conan but we don't see the raw power and brute force of the first movie.  There is a thin line between competence and complacency between an actor and a star it took Roger Moore six years to get to that point in the James Bond series while Schwarzenegger reaches the same point with Conan in two.I think part of the problem is whether or not the Conan concept is flexible enough to become family fare and my answer is no.  Fans of Robert E. Howard's Conan work know his Cimmerian is a very roughedged hero a cunning harddrinking hardfighting man and the first Conan movie captured that essence.  To change him into the simpleminded dogooder of Conan the Destroyer is to destroy what Conan is all about and the movie suffers for it.Is Conan the Destroyer worth watching?  Yes.  For someone who knows absolutely nothing about Conan I suppose it can be a harmless swordandsorcery popcorn flick.  For Conan fans it's kind of like Legend of the Lone Ranger for Lone Ranger fans an irresistible example of just how badly Hollywood can treat your favorite character.I just hope that if there is ever another Conan movie not likely thanks to Destroyer the producers will concentrate on following the style of Conan the Barbarian and just ignore this one.".

While Milius had Arnold lose weight and study Oriental swordsmanship in an effort to tone down the bodybuilder look and make him more flexible and believable as an arenatrained warrior Fleischer ordered the actor to bulk up as much as possible hoping to recreate the impossiblymuscled giant painted by Frank Frazetta on the covers of the paperback CONAN novels. Instead of being a taciturn loner Conan would joke and 'care' about people with an idiot sidekick Tracey Walter to provide comic relief.

CONAN THE DESTROYER didn't achieve anywhere near the success of the original but Schwarzenegger had no reason to worry his next film would be a lowbudget SF thriller called THE TERMINATOR and he was about to become a superstar!A footnote to CONAN...in early 2003 Schwarzenegger and John Milius tentatively agreed to bring CONAN THE KING the final chapter of the saga to the screen...With the original director's vision and the improvements in FX that CGI has provided we may yet see the ULTIMATE Conan film reach the screen if Arnold's political career doesn't take precedence!".

A little bloodier than I had remembered but nowhere near as ultraviolent as Conan the Barbarian. Arnold Schwarzenegger was in fine form during this period but the movie doesn't demand him to flex in acting muscle just his pecks when he wields his sword at his adversaries. Most often chuckle at Chamberlain's performance but let's be honest we all know he was hired for his towering presence not his acting chops. Grace Jones goes all out as she normally does with a giant stick battling men with swords eyes bulging hyena screeching the works. The Mexico locations provide this film with the proper setting needed for warriors battling in caves deserts and under the hot sun. Far less serious approach is applied here compared to Conan the Barbarian which might be why it received less critical reception. Most of the graphic violence is shot away from the viewers' eyes certain to earn a PG rating but what did the filmmakers sacrifice in return?

	schema:headline " The destroyer of Arnold's sequel phobia";
	schema:reviewBody "When I was a little girl my parents were hooked on the Conan movies but The Destroyer always stood out to me more for some reason. But I haven't watched this movie for a very long time so the other night I was in a weird mood I decided to watch the Conan movies. So The Destroyer was more familiar to me. But the thing is this movie is a sort of break through for Arnold since this movie was a flop at the box office he doesn't like sequels The Terminator being his only exception. So I was curious as an adult if this movie really was as bad as it's made out to be I liked it a little bit when I was a kid but when you're a kid you're fascinated by anything. So watching this movie as cheesy as it was I still had a good time watching it. I understand why a lot of people have a distaste for it it's definitely not up to par with the first Conan it's more of a comedy vs. adventure. But I still enjoyed this movie it's a good bad film that entertained me.Conan and his partner Malek are brought before Queen Taramis who asks that Conan perform two tasks for her obtain a special gem and retrieve the magic horn that can awaken the god Dagoth. In exchange she offers to resurrect Conan's dead lover Valeria. Conan agrees. Conan Malak Jehnna the queen's niece and Bombaata set off on their journey. Along the way Conan enlists the aid of his old comrade Akiro and the group later encounters Zula who joins the party. They then set off after the magical horn which is kept inside of a mysterious fortress. Jehnna retrieves the horn. After some difficulty from the cult residing in the fortress they try to make their way back to Queen Taramis however Bombaata betrays Conan and takes Jehnna leaving the others to fight for their lives.The story is a bit much and it's not the same as the original but if you give it a fair enough chance I think you'll enjoy it too. It is a bit more comedic and steers away from the original story but I think the comedy still made it fun. I loved the addition of Grace Jones she was one tough chick and could stand proudly next to Conan even if she did have a silly Japanese anime type of look to her hair in the end. I loved the costumes and the special effects and of course Arnold. Conan is the part that he was meant to play and he carries the movie well with the other cast. Granted I know the direction isn't really good it does have a more cheesy vibe as this was the same director for our favorite barbarian box office flop that was Red Sonja. There are a lot of plot holes and a script that could us a more than a few touch up's but give the movie a fair enough chance don't compare it to the original on it's own I'm sure you'll have a good time watching it.710".

In fact I would say that this is excellent bubblegum sword and sorcery fodder except for a few minor but annoying quirks. For one thing the comedy sidekick Malak is phenomenally irritating badly acted and takes any tension interest etc out of any scene. Clearly they were going for a wider 'family' appeal with this film but this was also clearly a decision made some time down the filming process. Most obviously this hits home during the fight scenes with some very choppy cutting as some of the more gruesome bits have been removed. And Conan's second encounter with the camel suffers from this too! That aside the cast carry off their roles with aplomb Grace Jones in particular really getting across her character's zest for and love of combat. One of the better hack and slash films out there.".

And we have one of the other cast members from the first flick in the shape of Mako. But that's about where any good stuff ends.The first death knell for this movie is the casting. We have Tracey Walter as Malak a thief sidekick of Conan's whatever happened to Gerry Lopez's Subotai character? Tracey does a very good impression of Peter Lorre...throughout the whole film. Then there's Grace Jones perhaps the original singerturnedactor as some kind of demented shewarrior. All she is really good at is glaring at people and hissing like a snake and she does this......throughout the whole film. Sarah Douglas as the obligatory evil queen...the only thing she seems to be queen of is sequels Superman 2 Puppetmaster 3 Beastmaster 2 etc. and Olivia D'Abo who is just irritatingly helpless and annoying here.The plot is trivial and the dialogue poor and some of the effects are lamentably bad look for the island in the lake and the manape. Also did I mention that Grace Jones is just horrible and hisses a lot? I did? Oh well it bears repeating..All in all this is a cashin movie designed to rake in some easy money on the back of the original and not really caring much about a plot or good actors. Even Arnie the world's best actor at not saying many lines is hampered by having too much dialogue.Avoid it unless you want a laugh.".

Arnold never looked more mightier than here looking like the true Marvel Comics equivelent of the hero rather than Milius' or Robert Howards version.

But there is still Arnold the wonderfull sets the powerful Basil Poledouris theme and a cast of Grace Jones Sarah Douglas Tracey Walter Mako Wilt Chamberlain and Olivier D'Abo who some how manage to make this resemble an episode of the 60's Batman T.V Series than a piece of Robert Howard soaked fantasy.The fighting scenes a re good and there is a fantastic scene in wich Conan is trapped in a cave of mirrors terrorised by RedHooded monsters.

It's all bull though as the Queen intends to kill Conan and friends once their task is through and sacrifice virgin Jehnna to the god Dagoth.This sequel is OK but nowhere near as good as the first film. More comedy and watereddown violence don't do much to help it. Arnold seems to play this a little tongueincheek at times unlike the first one where he played it straight. I had a huge childhood crush on Olivia d'Abo from this movie. She's actually one of the better parts castwise. Basketball player Wilt Chamberlain plays her bodyguard Bombaata. As an actor he's a great basketball player. Mako returns from the first film and is fine. He should have been the only comic relief but alas we have the terrible Tracey Walter as Malak Arnold's moronic thief sidekick. Sarah Douglas always makes for a good villain. Lastly we have androgynous '80s curiosity Grace Jones as the animalistic Zula. She's amusing to watch though usually for the wrong reasons. Still entertaining is entertaining. Altogether it's a weak sequel but not without its merits and hard to hate. It's fun and enjoyable despite its faults.".

Altogether it's a weak sequel but not without its merits and hard to hate. It's fun and enjoyable despite its faults.";

Instead of Gerry Lopez we have Tracy Walter a fine actor but too comedic for this yeah he's the comic relief but Conan shouldn't have comic relief. Mako is good and Sarah Douglas sizzles as always.  Grace Jones well is Grace Jones.  If you are looking for subtlety look elsewhere. And speaking of subtlety there's Wilt the Stilt.  As an actor Wilt makes a great basketball player.  Olivia D'Abo is cute but little else.The movie has its moments and the finale is pretty good but there's a lot of junk in the middle.  The fight between Conan and TothAmon Pat Bomber Roach is fantastic but the campfire scenes after are just plain stupid. Tracy Walter's character gets annoying with the constant Shaggy and Scooby jokes you know I'll wait here.  Wait for me!.  The basic story is good and in keeping with Conan traditions but it descends into camp at the worst times.Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway were quite familiar with Conan having written the character for Marvel Comics.  How much of their story is in the final film is a puzzler.  The elements that work are straight out of Howard and Roy Thomas' comics.  The goofier stuff who knows?The first film was epic adventure.  This is more of a glorified Bmovie. It's fun when you have a group of friends together and can MST3K it but as cinema it's not 20000 Leagues Under the Sea.  Director Richard Fleischer has done better.  Still it's a great guilty pleasure film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a fan of Robert E. Howard's short stories I must say that funny and lighthearted are definitely NOT the words I would use to describe Conan. Destroyer loses the poetic melancholy of Barbarian but is more accessible it was the first of the Conan movies that I saw as a kid. The PG rating doesn't harm the tone of the film much it's still relatively bloody but apparently Richard Fleischer shot it as a hard R before the producers cut it down.The story this time has Conan go on a mission for the seductive Queen Taramis she can be my queen ANY day and look for a quick glimpse of her bush in the first Shadizar Castle scene. He must retrieve a gemstone which unlocks another treasure called the Horn of Dagoth. A treasure that will bring to life an Evil God. Conan doesn't care as Taramis who was NOT a villain in Howard's short stories her twin sister Salome however definitely was has promised to bring back his dead girlfriend from the first film. And so with his ragtag group of companions Malak a comedy sidekick but what happened to Subotai from the original? Zula Grace Jones wearing no more than a couple of inches of leather floss Akiro Mako the only returning cast member from the original Bombaata on a secret mission to kill Conan and the virgin Princess Jehnna Conan takes off on his mission.The first film was serious but this one plays more like Labyrinth than Barbarian. The effects and sets are very typical of early '80s fantasy movies. Conan talks a lot more too and has fun in a drunk scene. I don't have a problem with this as he is quite cunning and intelligent in Robert E. Howard's stories and they kinda sold him short in the first film by limiting his dialogue.Some scenes reek of cheapness. The TothAmonManApe scene is so ridiculously fake it makes you wonder how the filmmakers took it seriously. And the ending featuring the resurrected Dagoth reduced to a subGodzilla demon is just plain stupid. Not silly. Even a few more minutes of thought put into this would have made it much better. But it is all very entertaining it really does is add to the kitschy hokum of it all. And hokum and weirdness is what Howard's stories were all about.Basil Poledouris' music is the one part of the film that is totally up to scratch. It's not as heavy as his score to the first film but he does introduce new stronger themes and lighter takes on cues from the first. Brilliant stuff.It's a lot more formulaic and 'Hollywood' than the first. No new ground is broken and it's obviously a film made quickly to cash in on the success of Barbarian. Another way in which Conan has been sold short. You can tell with some gimmicks present in both films that they were trying to turn this into a longrunning series. A shame that never happened. It really should have been like Bond with a film coming out every 2 years.Conan the Destroyer is guiltless fun with goofier characters sillier dialogue clumsier action and loinier cloths. And honestly it's none the worse for it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The original Conan movie  Conan The Barbarian  came out in 1982 and was both a popular sword and sorcery film and a reasonably successful attempt to turn bodybuilder Arnold Scwarzenegger into a movie star. However the critics were somewhat unkind to John Milius's fantasy epic stating that it was far too long far too serious and far too humourless. On that occasion the critics were wrong  I and many others like Conan The Barbarian BECAUSE of its length and its seriousness. The story feels thorough and atmospheric and the pace is controlled not dull. It is very sad that this sequel addresses the very things that were falsely alleged to be wrong or flawed about the original. It's as if the makers of Conan The Destroyer sat down and listed all the criticisms ever levelled at Conan The Barbarian then tried to do something to rectify them. So this sequel is shorter more lightweight and more humorous than its predecessor. Does it work? Have these changes resulted in a massive improvement? No. In fact Conan The Destroyer is actually vastly inferior to the original and is little more than a juvenile romp aimed at bloodthirsty kids and slightly nerdy adults.Fearsome Cimmerian warrior Conan Arnold Schwarzenegger and his travelling companion Malak Tracey Walter in a bad comic characterisation are summoned to carry out a dangerous quest on behalf of the treacherous Queen Taramis Sarah Douglas. She promises that if the quest is a success she will reincarnate Conan's longdead lover so that he may be reunited with her. The mission requires Conan to take a beautiful virginal princess named Jehnna Olivia D'Abo on a journey to recover a magical crystal. The princess is the only person who can handle the crystal which when used correctly will unlock the gateway to an allpowerful horn. With this horn Taramis plans to awaken a deity and share Godlike power with it by sacrificing Jehnna. Along the way Conan picks up other travelling companions to aid him in his quest such as the female barbarian Zula Grace Jones and inexperienced magician Akiro Mako. However Taramis has lied to Conan in order to secure his services she not only has no intention of bringing his lover back to life but also plans to kill him once his usefulness is over.Conan The Destroyer is not a total loss  in fact in some departments it is actually quite good. Basil Poledouris again provides pulsating music not quite as good as his scoring of the earlier film but good enough all the same Jack Cardiff's photography brings the vast sets and varied locations colourfully to life there are even infrequent bursts of real excitement. But Conan The Destroyer is repeatedly dragged down by its numerous flaws  illsuited comedy listless performances obvious special effects and an episodic narrative. In particular this last criticism is a major disappointment. The story is episodic to the point of tedium. The characters ride around chat about love and magic then arrive at some kind of temple or castle where a little action ensues. Again and again with irritating repetition and boring monotony this same sequence recurs  ride chat action.... ride chat action.... ride chat action.... ride chat action.... Conan IS a destroyer  but unfortunately what he's destroying is his own genre!!".

Sword loincloth and not much else so it must have struck a visual chord at least.I'm glad they made this film it's a fun romp and a great way to spend an evening. People will judge it as the weaker film which it is but it's also the most fun out of the two.If only King Conan Crown Of Iron was made with Arnie as the old bearded king today it would make a nice little trilogy Or box set of you throw in Red Sonja which is basically a Conan film!

The result is a multimultimillion dollar debacle that leaves studios searching for answers and audiences shellshocked into seeking out their entertainment along the more audacious pathway of offHollywood independent filmmaking  the single positive outcome of these dull empty enterprises.Wild Wild West' like so many films before it looks to the relics of television's bygone era for inspiration  as sad a comment as any on the dismal state of current movie creativity.  As one not familiar with the original series I cannot say what justice or lack of justice this homage does to its source.  What is evident judging from the results on screen is that Wild Wild West' is as with most current blockbusters topheavy with special effects and as weak in the nether limbs as its legless villain. Straight Westerns being hopelessly out of fashion especially for a special effectsdriven summertime extravaganza the filmmakers obviously felt that what was needed was a tongueincheek approach to the material resulting in a bizarre but completely unfunny amalgam of fantasy and sciencefiction gilded onto a Western format.  The disparate styles simply fight against each other leaving no one in the audience  neither Western nor sciencefiction fans  satisfied.The alleged plot involves the attempts by James West Will Smith and Artemis Gordon Kevin Kline to foil an evil Confederate inventor's plan to kidnap all the world's most brilliant scientists and ultimately terrorize the  Union and President Grant into submission.  This he attempts to do by creating a giant mechanized spider which is obviously a last ditch desperate attempt on the part of the filmmakers to fulfill the seemingly insatiable demands of the modern audience to be dazzled by impressive special effects no matter how inappropriate they appear in context.  Here though the miscalculation is fatal because even the audience is wise enough to know when it is being had.  Kline and Smith never achieve a palpable rapport despite the usual abundance of lame wise cracks and sarcastic asides designed to make them hip' and trendy'   two qualities incongruous to the setting which again shows the lack of real commitment to the spirit of the project.  There is exactly one clever moment in the film  an astonishingly creative homage to the old RCA logo  that hints at what might have been had the moviemakers been willing to really let loose their anarchic imaginations and aimed for something truly sophisticated rather than simply pasting together a series of confused poorly written blackout sketches.Incidentally even some of the expensive special effects come across as surprisingly crude especially many of the shots utilizing rearscreen projection.  Hence this film strikes out even in the one ballpark in which it might have stood a chance of emerging victorious.".

	schema:reviewBody "I won't add more insults  others here have done that well enough. This movie is godawful. But I will point out two areas that seem to be staples of bad movie remakes of beloved old TV shows. First how about getting someone to writedirect that actually liked and understood the original? That person would understand that the WestGordon relationship was the core. In a sense West and Gordon complimented each other to make a slick functional crimefighting machine West handled the action and romance and Gordon took care of the thinking deception and humor disguises. This was a wellused TV convention  think the KirkSpockMcCoy triad in Star Trek or the great contrasty chemistry between Bill Cosby and Robert Culp in I Spy. Add a lovable villain to the mix not an offensive atrocity like the filmLoveless and you've got a crazy tongueincheek action classic. The filmmakers here seemingly did not know or care about the fundamentals of the original show. Not that this is necessarily a problem but then why bother resurrecting the premise in the first place? Why not just make Will Smith a different wild west troubleshooter? The Mission Impossible franchise has the same problem.Second why all the emphasis on showing the principals getting to know each other? I know  because it eats up 30 of the script and creates conflict. But the conflict should be between West and the villain. Jim and Artie should just BE. The TV show didn't bother explaining how West met and knew Gordon any more than Barney Miller Mission Impossible or 24 found it necessary to have all the main characters meet and learn to work together. They were a team with a job to do. Audiences understand this concept having a trumpedup plot about how the heroes meet and overcome their differences is a hackneyed device that only exposes the script weaknesses present. See the film version of Dragnet a better film though for another example of this unfortunate trend.Finally a comment on the race issue. Inserting content that justifies SmithWest's skin color is no more necessary than explaining Henry V's skin color when Laurence Fishburne or Andre Braugher play him on stage. Indeed ignoring Smith's race in a movie like this one would help us all look past such issues. If a blond actor had portrayed West nobody would have suggested a plot that explains his Norwegian background! He just would have been West and that would be that. But colorblind casting requires courage and could conceivably cut into the film's bottom line. So not in this spineless script.I seldom get mad at movies I don't like. Even The Avengers didn't anger me though it was possibly even worse than this one. This one ticked me off REAL good. Buy the original series on DVD instead and see how it's done right.".

A favorite of mine I've long enjoyed the show.  So naturally I was looking forward to the big screen adaption even though it did star Will Smith Sorry Will but you're no Robert Conrad.The movie had all the ingredients needed to make a good film An excellent cast Kevin Klein Ken Branaugh Selma Hayek even Smith an excellent proven director in Barry Sonnefeld and a proven genre...  Rather it had all the ingredients that it needed except one...  It had the worst script possible.  I've always been wary of any project that was written by committee and this film is one project that proves why.  The excellent cast crew and effects of this film were wasted on one of the worst screenplays I've ever seen. The clever if pulp inspired stories of the original series are replaced by tepid attempts at comedy which even Smith who normally is very funny can't pull off.  Kenneth Branaugh succeeds at nothing other than managing to eat the scenery unable to do anything else since his lines are so bad.  Klein is saddled with the role of Smith's straight man something that he's just too damn funny to be. As for the effects like I said they were spectacular but the problem is that they seem to be the 'be all and end all' of the movie instead of working for the story such as there was in this case.  The simple fact is that they overpower the film.I guess if you are a die hard Will Smith fan who has never seen the original series you might like this one.  But for fans of the old series avoid it and watch reruns or else one of the two other shows in the genre 'Legend' or 'The Adventures of Brisco County Junior.'".

	schema:reviewBody "It's that time of year.  The time when Hollywood trots out it's worst of the summer.  You know the drill.  There's a Godzilla every year somebody has to be it. Wild Wild West clenches the title hands down this summer and we still have eight weeks to go!The Will Smith phenomenon has now entered it's third phase overwhelming ego project. Teaming with his Men In Black director Barry Sonnenfeld Smith has finally teetered over the edge and released an outright mess.  A film that will hang in the halls of all time bad event flicks. Should we blame Smith?  I think so.  Men In Black and Independence Day were gigantic hits they even call the 4th of July Big Willie Weekend due to these successes. I submit that these films were hits due to the films themselves the writing acting directing and not just because of Smith.  West is finally the film that rests on Smith's comedic shoulders alone.  The truth shines through clearly.  Not everything Will Smith does is funny.Based in the television show running from 19651970  the simple plot tells the tale of a Civil War era federal marshal James West Smith who must team up with a weapons expert Kevin Kline at his most painfully unfunny to thwart the evil plans of the villain and legless Arliss Loveless Kenneth Branagh.  Along for the ride is a giant mechanical tarantula President Grant and the stunning gorgeous lovely and just plain old hot Salma Hayek.  The plot is just a simple excuse to push the characters through endless scenes that give birth to no laughs at all.  Scenes that make the audience gringe with fear as if something wrong is with them. Fear not my good people these are professionals up on screen and they blew it.The screenplay credited to FOUR writers has the damnedest time to make any of the jokes funny.  You would not believe just how far the cast goes to make this limp material work. It's embarrassing to watch and even more embarrassing for the actors. There is not one funny moment in the film not even a courtesy laugh for the attempt.  Dead silence. I also disapprove of the attempt to squeeze racial jokes into the mix.  Yes Will Smith is AfricanAmerican but do we need to call attention to it every five minutes?  The movie would've been better served had it left the race issue alone and just played up the potential fun of the concept.Will Smith is simply miscast as the hero. He's an amiable actor who's proven himself with stronger material.  This film clearly shows just how paper thin the Smith charm can be. While Kevin Kline tries but fails as well it's really Hayek's role that's a mystery.  She's barely in the film and when her character is explained you come to realize that she's not apart of the story at all.  Hayek has always been a fun performer with winning personality. All this movie asks of her is to be the butt literally of a few jokes and keep the cleavage coming.  A shameful waste of talent.Director Sonnenfeld has also been at the helm of better pictures Get Shorty but for some reason I have yet to see a truly great film directed by him. There always seems to be a spark missing from the action like a better funnier film was in there somewhere but he can't find it. Relying in great amounts on special effects and the considerable use of easytospot green screen shots the typical Sonnenfeld camera work is either buried under all the mayhem or just not inventive when the attempt is actually made.  This is a very topheavy production with little chance to breathe.  But Sonnenfeld made this choice he must be held accountable for it.The movie has been through many edits and this shows with wildly out of tune continuity and many unexplained plot twists.  Also grating on the brain is Elmer Bernstein's annoying and featherweight musical score.  While we have Warner Brothers shamefully trotting out it's We pray it's as big as the 'Men In Black' Will Smith rap tune Bernstein provides a flat score that serves no purpose to enliven the film.  The cinematography is also without color and the catering probably sucked too.Wild Wild West is the product of zero imagination.  A lifeless summer film that seems to stick out even more in this unusually good movie season.  I am always wary of comic westerns and this film seals that envelope.   If this is what 160 million buys you? I'll take the 3 million South Park any day. 0".

	schema:reviewBody "Buried in this godawful disaster of a movie is a germ of an inkling of an iota of a great idea. It is not the idea of making a big blockbuster out of the great old 1960s TV show The Wild Wild West an idea which can at best be described as tiresomely uninspired. Nor is there brilliance in transforming the image of the lead character just so that they could build the role around starofthemoment Will Smith. But out of that horribly perverse example of Hollywood commercial packaging there is an intriguing premise which naturally seems to have slipped past all involved without a second glance. What if the best brightest and most intrepid government agent working in postCivil War America was indeed a black man? Realistically how would an AfricanAmerican functioning in a repressive racist society where even the most liberal thinker would see him as a secondclass citizen indeed a second class human being be able to not only outsmart the bad guys but to impress even the skeptical good guys? It is an intriguing idea because on the one hand such an agent would not be suspected of being a threat and on the other hand he would have to overcome so many more barriers than a white man would ever face. He would be both invisible and yet stand out like the proverbial sore thumb just about anywhere he went. He'd be constantly fighting two battles. Such a film could be thrilling and funny yet something rare original.The Wild Wild West TV show itself was all those things it was highly derivative of both the traditional western and the thenfresh James Bondstyle spy movie  with more than a little bit of Batmanstyle comic book campiness kicked in  yet it was ingenious in the way it melded those mythic genres into a oneofakind series. There was never anything quite like The Wild Wild West and never anything since  including this disastrous 1997 movie.Everything about WILD WILD WEST the movie is just plain bad tacky special effects clumsy direction an embarrassing screenplay plus a fine bewildered cast wasted in totally unworkable roles. But as bad as everything else is the base rot of WWW goes directly to its reworked premise. No matter how open minded one might be or how much one prides oneself on being socially color blind there is just no way to honestly accept replacing Robert Conrad TV's James West with Will Smith. The time and the place dictate that James West be a white male  unless the filmmakers acknowledge and embrace the incongruity and use it for a real purpose.Yet the filmmakers want it both ways the audience is expected to be able to ignore Smith's skin color while at the same time the entire plot is based on his confrontation with a white racist trying to reestablish Confederate power and seize control of the U.S. government. How can you respect or believe in a film or filmmakers that get all preachy about the evils of racism while all along dealing with the issue with absolutely no respect for historical honesty? It is not clear if having Smith play James West as a cocky street smart John Shaftstyle character was intended to be a joke social commentary or just absurd politically correct pandering to black audiences but it is clear that it does not work. The most outrageously unbelievable thing about WILD WILD WEST is not the wildly improbable scifi inventions but that the Smith character actually makes it to the end of the film without being lynched. It's not that the anachronism of a cocksure 20th century black man confronting 19th century bigotry isn't workable because that very timewarp racial comedy had already been done with much greater success in the Mel Brooks classic BLAZING SADDLES. Unlike WWW Brooks and company realized the sheer idiocy of the premise yet used that to mock both the black and the white stereotypes with equal glee.Where BLAZING SADDLES is an honest farce WILD WILD WEST is dishonest and cowardly. All involved probably thought they were being pretty daring by flaunting convention and hiring Smith but they did not hire Will Smith the African American they hired Will Smith the action hero movie star. They built WILD WILD WEST around Smith's race but only to exploit his contemporary Hollywood image even to the point of letting him create and perform a totally inappropriate and totally bad rap song at the end. You can sense the film exploiting both Smith's star image and his race while not wishing to risk challenging either. The film tries to reinvent The Wild Wild West TV show but the changes are literally skin deep. To really explore and compare racism in America by blending the attitudes of two different American centuries would have been too wild wild of an idea for these timid timid filmmakers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Wild Wild West is about to come out on video tomorrow and unfortunately I can't recommend it. Somehow I got fooled into thinking that a cool trailer and an Alist cast should automatically equate to a good time at the movies. Should you see Wild Wild West you may be minimally entertained by it all but everything will seem worse when looking back in hindsight. Of course my expectations were fairly high for this movie but looking back even someone who craves mindless fun will be at least a little disappointed. There's a lot of easy flaws to spot and they ultimately cannot be forgiven. Here it goes....     First of all those expecting tightlypaced action will be shocked. The fight scenes seem tired and lifeless and the climax is ridiculous. The saloon brawls are pretty dull featuring nothing but people getting punched andor shot all without flair. Okay so this might be fine if the action was campy like in Sam Raimi's ARMY OF DARKNESS but the laugh product is unfortunately low. There are a few chuckleworthy moments but most of the humor is forced especially when looking back in hindsight. I suppose someone might find it funny when Will Smith repeatedly utters the line that is a man's head in several different tones but it's the most obvious kind of forced comedy. Actually Kenneth Branagh delivers more laughs than everyone else combined in a deliciously overthetop performance but it's still not enough. Finally the music is completely forgettable and repetitive.      Sad to say this is not one of Will Smith's finer moments. Given some ripe material such as in MEN IN BLACK or ENEMY OF THE STATE he can be a delight but he's all wrong here. He stretches his character's comic attributes over the action ones and much like the rest of the movie he comes out forced. Kevin Kline does a decent job but the whole mismatched partners trying to get along concept has been done SO many times that it's irritating.      Given my sheer volume of complaints here some may wonder if it's possible to enjoy Wild Wild West. The answer is yes but this is one of those movies that's so forced just take that word as a given from now on that it's strictly BRING YOUR OWN FUN. You won't find much entertainment here you have to force sorry yourself to have some if you want any. Oh and here's an afterthought I saw Will Smith's Wild Wild West music video and it's actually better than the movie. What are the odds of something like that?  MY RATING  12".

Now this was so out of place as to be just plain STUPID!! Knenneth Branagh on the other hand was fabulous. Kevin Kline was O.K. and Selma Hayak should've done what she does best taken off her clothes!! The special effects were kind of cool but the story line sucked and to top it all off the evershiteous Fresh Prince had to rap at the closing credits. There will never be a WWW II because it was so lousy. Remember in Jersey Girl when Ben Affleck's character torpedoed his career when he said Will Smith sucked and he would never be heard of again? OH how I wish that in this case art imitated life and Will Smith was a bad memory. Oh I forget Will Smith is a bad memory every year in about 4 lousy stinking' rotten movies!".

But this? This? Who ever thought that this was a good idea for a summer movie? There seems to be something fundamentally wrong with it like at the most basic level the idea is rotten like the first conception of the project was rooted in some bizarre temporary insanity the conclusion perhaps that Will Smith is all a movie needs to be a smash.This is the most cynical and contrived form of filmmaking the packaging of elements to excite a broad demographic the synergistic Burger King tieins music videos etc for maximum market coverage. But what is centrally lacking here is the movie itself. It is a dismal spiritless mess devoid of any chemistry between its leading characters an entirely unnecessary female character Salma Hayek in an awesomely thankless part and an utterly rubbishy villain Kenneth Branaugh not nearly as funny as he seems to think he is.Of course the actors cannot be blamed. They are only actors for Christ's sake. What really counts in a deal like this is the script and Wild Wild West simply did not appear to have one. The plot was utterly incidental a routine and tiresome paper chase across the old west to find a bad guy with a ridiculous bad guy world domination plan. This would be fine if the movie dispensed with plot and left Smith and Kline centre stage with a huge quantity of electrifying witty banter but it doesn't. Instead they are given swathes of plotrelated dialogue as though we were actually supposed to be interested. In the whole film I don't think I saw one decent line of dialogue not a single solitary spark of wit. No clever wordplay nothing in fact that could justifiably be called comedy writing. Not even any of Will Smith's patented verbal clowning. Just talk and pulling silly faces.An embarrassment for everybody concerned especially Kline who really aught to know better by now. The only person who comes out of this with dignity intact is director of photography Michael Ballhaus who makes the desert look like a surrealist painting as though John Ford and Rene Magritte had conceived a child in a crazy threesome with Alexandro Jodorowsky.Otherwise I want my money back. I feel cheated. I want to see something enchanting that makes me fall in love with movies all over again not this sorry self indulgence. Worse even than Star Wars.".

The trek was ill fated from the start with the officers stuck in their own rigid thinking. They thought they knew best and if the men weren't tough enough to survive a march through the woods they didn't deserve to serve the Emperor. And all those warnings from the locals? They were mere peasants not worth listening to. This film based on the documentary novel by Jiro Nitta has some powerful images. One that I'll never forget is the scene of several trying to climb up a steep icy slope. One loses his grip and slides down taking others along with him. A few go crazy and strip to their loincloths. Others just drop dead. There's no fire and very few provisions. Keeping them going are ironic visions of the area in the late spring and the beautiful guide they met.".

America was caught up in Olympic fever and was riding the mad patriotic wave extremely high with the release of ID4 and other huge action hits such as Twister and Mission Impossible. A sobering reality check of the grim forthcoming future instigated by a hypocritical government with a cynical outcast antihero was NOT what anyone wanted.I remember sitting in the foyer at the nowdemolished ABC cinema in Edinburgh on September 21st 1996 we had to wait a month after the US release waiting for the screen to open. A couple of young women exited the previous screening loudly proclaiming That was the worst film I have ever seen. Bad Boys II had not been made at this point.I don't think that Escape from LA is a bad film but it is a failure on many levels not the least of which are the shoddy CGI effects which look like they came from a mid90s CDROM.Since the massive spike in crime in America in the late 1980s and the subsequent transformation of Manhattan into a prison colony the United States Police Force and their religious lunatic Head of State has slowly but surely erased all liberty from the American people denying them the rights to swear have sex eat red meat smoke or drink alcohol all for their own safety of course while at the same time expanding their empire by pushing into foreign territories.Any of this sound familiar? In 2000 a massive earthquake strikes Los Angeles and the city is transformed into an island declared no longer part of the United States and becomes the new westcoast prison colony. Whether you're a murderer or an atheist you lose your citizenship and are dumped on LA Island. Unless you opt for a quick electrocution before deportation.It had been 15 years since his famous escape from the Big Apple but Snake had remained a strong cult character and had a big following. This time he's dropped into the Big Orange in 2013 with the promise that if he retrieves a doomsday device he will be able to walk free.Freedom? In America? asks Snake. It died a long time ago. This was 1996!Carpenter and Russell could clearly see the dark path their country was heading down. If only they conveyed their ideas and satire in a more cohesive intelligent fashion. Escape from LA has big ideas huge ideas even but a cheap 101 minutes is not the best way to fully explore and develop such satire. As with his previous movies Carpenter's vision is epic but the execution is implied. This may work with horror movies like Prince of Darkness but it fails here. It really really fails.When Snake shuts down the Earth at the end of the movie do we see the effects of such devastation on the planet? Do we see highways and cities go dark do we watch mankind revert to the stone age as the juice he has relied on to keep him warm runs dry? No. Instead we see a couple of lights go out in a drab police compound. Wow! That's so not freakin' exciting Carpenter! So much potential so much disappointment. At the very very least it works as a trashy action movie but it should have been so much more.".

	schema:reviewBody "Escape from LA follows almost exactly the same plotline as Escape from New York A city has become a colony for criminals something gets lost in the city the government don't have anyone but Snake Plissken that is able to get it back so he goes in has a few misadventures with the locals and eventually brings it back. This film very much lacks in originality mostly due to it completely ripping off its predecessor. In fact it could be said that this film is a remake of the first. However what it lacks in originality is made up for with a great cast of support characters which includes Steve Buscemi Pam Grier Peter Fonda and a great little turn from the god of BMovie Bruce Campbell himself. Kurt Russell returns of course as the film's antihero Snake Plissken complete with a very cool new look courtesy of a long black leather coat and leather trousers. Kurt Russell's performance in this film is pretty much the same as in the first movie whereby he is only required to look cool for the duration and that is something he does well. The support characters however are this film's main asset. Obviously Kurt Russell is the star of the show but it's the colourful characters around that really make the film interesting. The effects in Escape From LA considering it was made in 1996 are awful. Whether or not the effects are bad on purpose as a tribute Escape From New York I don't know but I really felt that they could have done more regarding the effects. Escape from LA is a very silly film that many people will find hard to take seriously however if all you want is to enjoy yourself for 100 minutes or so and not use your brain too much Escape From LA is your movie. Originality aside I would say that this film is on par with Escape From New York.".

	schema:reviewBody "Both Escape from New York and Escape from L.A. are decidedly antiestablishment films. They both have this cynical view of the government in these films the government is not to be trusted. There are terrorist attacks aimed at the government on both films. ESCAPE FROM L.A This second one is tongue in cheek every step of the way. Watching Escape from L.A. feels like watching a cheap Italian Rip Off like 2019 After the Fall of New York 1983 but with a bigger budget. Actually Escape from L.A. has a lot of similarities with 2019 After the Fall of New York so in a way this is Carpenter's pay back for all those cheap Escape from New York rip offs that the Italians made. Ultimately I love both Escape from New York and Escape from L.A. for different reasons. And for all the tonal differences between both films they still have many similarities. No matter where Snake Plissken will always be Snake Plissken you can tell Russell has lots of love for this character. Plissken is what kept me watching. The opening and closing segments of the films are extremely similar as well. And here's where we get to the best part of the film the ending. Not gonna spoil it don't worry but I will tell you that it is the best thing about the movie. Russell himself came up with it and I applaud him for it it encapsulates everything Snake Plissken is in terms of attitude. That idea that maybe the world would be better off if we simply started again from scratch screw the way things are let's try something new! Welcome to the human race my friends welcome to the human race.t does criticize fascist forms of government it also criticizes rebellious leaders who instigate their followers towards committing violent acts. So it doesn't side with anyone. On this film both sides are wrong. The film pleads for a new beginning it's asking governments to forget their old grudges and start from scratch. Snake himself says it in one scene I shut down the third world you win they loose. I shut down America they win you loose. The more things change the more they stay the same This is one of the ideas presented in the film that I truly liked. The idea that both sides should just call it quits and bring on the peace bring on the freedom. Again this last bit demonstrates how much of Kurt Russell's Libertarian views are on this film. After all he wrote a lot of it himself along with John Carpenter and Debra Hill. These are three life long buddies writing a movie they would find amusing which makes this film a labor of love. This is probably why the film has a more laid back 'were having fun here' vibe to it.".

This has some rather memorable occurrencesa couple of them for sheer weirdness and imagination and certainly puts several breathtaking visuals up on the screen. The effects vary though there are excellent ones herein. Dialog has quotable lines and is welldelivered. The music is cool. Cinematography and editing are marvelous. The acting holds good performances. While it does bear a striking resemblance to that of the original movie the script of this is interesting creative and welldone. It has a nice pace and you gotta admit that it's packed with action. Each sequence is exciting and intense and differs from the rest in some way. There is strong violence and language in this as well as disturbing content. This is bigger than the '81 film. Unfortunately it also cost a larger amount of money and only made about half back. It's too bad that Carpenter's work has a tendency to not be appreciated by the massesonly the fans andor cult following when it is initially released.

The amazing special effects were exhilarating and got my heart racing. When a friend told me about Escape From LA i was going crazy. I must have watched it 10 times in that one day and every time it got better. When Snake hits the three pointer hook shot from half court my jaw dropped. When he got shot in the leg stood up got on a surf board road the tsunami and jumped off the tsunami to catch someone it was as if my life was complete. WELCOME TO THE HUMAN RACE was the perfect end to a perfect movie. Thank you Kurt and everyone who was a part of insanely incredible movie.";

	schema:headline " Underrated ActionPacked Sequel! Snake is Back! One Of Carpenter's Best!";
	schema:reviewBody "Escape From L.A is great action sequel to Escape From New york and in my opinion one of John Carpenter's best films and is a film that deserves a second chance.Set in a futuristic Los Angeles in 2013 L.A has been turned into a prison for the entire country where you go in and don't come out. When a black box containing a doomsday device is stolen antihero Snake PlisskenKurt Russellhas been hired to bring back the device in 10 hours once again putting Plissken in another hellish adventure.I've always loved Escape From L.A since I first saw it and I don't understand the hatred this film has gotten over the years. Is Escape From L.A similar to the original? Yes. But L.A works so well if you don't take it seriously. Where as Escape From New York was a dark and grim vision of the futureEscape From L.A has a lightcampysatirical feel to it and Carpenter just rolls with it. One of the things I love about EFLA is how Carpenter takes the story and concept of the first film pushes takes it to new heights. Given a much bigger budget of 50 million dollars Carpenter is given much more to do with this film and you see a lot of locations in L.A that you'll see that have been destroyed or kept around like Beverly Hills or the iconic Los Angeles coliseum. Another thing I love about EFLA is the campy satire Carpenter injects in the film and the bizarre situations Snake gets into and the crazy characters Snake meets. Carpenter obviously loves L.A and takes time to make a satire of the city and flipping L.A on it's head whether it was earthquakesagentsgangs or sports and it's wild and funny. Snake's situations and the characters he meets are just weird and crazy like the original. Snake has to deal with crooked agentssurfersnutty plastic surgeons while getting into gunfights and trying to survive the mission at hand. Its seems like Carpenter and most viewers are in on the joke and Snake at times does not get the joke. Carpenter is pretty much making fun of the Action film genre and movie sequelsmocking the clichs with the shootouts and explosions and over the top villains that became associated with the Action genre during the 80s and 90s. But the Action scenes in the film are great and have a manic energy to it. One of the best Action scenes in the film is the Basketball scene where instead of winning a Basketball gameyou have to win to save your life or you die. Carpenter loves NBA Basketball and takes the sport of Basketball and turns it upside down and makes Basketball a dark and funny game of death. As a NBA fan myself I wonder how would NBA legends like Michael JordanMagic Johnson or Larry Bird do in a Basketball game of death. A great scene. Carpenter also mocks Hollywood for coming out with a countless number of sequels in the 80s and 90s and it's so true even now how movie franchise sequels repeating the same thing over and over again. Carpenter always wanted to make a Western and you can see a lot of the influence of the Western genre in this filmwith Snake being a futuristic of the Clint Eastwood Western movie gunslingerthe villains wearing black and brown dusters like the great Sergio Leone Westerns and the photography with a browndirty look of Sam Peckinpah's style came into the future. If you thought EFNY's ending was wild and boldEFLA's ending is even bolder and one of the best endings in movie history and one of the reasons for Escape From L.A's brilliance and excellence.Kurt Russell does a great job again as Snakealmost like Russell took the weekend off on Escape From New York and came into Escape From L.A on Monday. Russell plays Snake with the same toughness and grit like in the original and is brilliant and unforgettable. Stacy Keach is fun as Malloythe warden of the prison. Steve Buscemi is great and funny as a Hollywood agent Map To The Stars Eddie a weasel who will represent anyone. Cliff Robertson does a fine job as The President who's evil and a coward. Bruce Campbell is excellent and unrecognizable as the surgeon general of Beverly Hills who puts Snake in a dangerous position. George Corraface is great as villain Cuervo Jones. Pam Grier is wonderful as Hershe a former associate of Plisskin's who helps him out. Peter Fonda is memorable in his short role as surfer Pipeline who helps Snake out in a funny and bizarre scene. Valerina Golino is good as Taslima who helps Snake out for a short time. A.J Langer is good as Utopiathe President's daughter who rebels against him. Michelle Forbes gives a fine performance as BrazenMalloy's right hand help and assistant. This is a Bmovie lovers dream cast.John Carpenter's direction is wonderfulmoving the camera at all costs bringing a crazy energy to the film with the pace never slowing down. The action sequences in the film are well done with enough gunfights to satisfy any action viewerit's some of the best action scenes Carpenter's ever done. Great direction by Carpenter.The score by John Carpenter and Shirley Walker is great and well done mixing Carpenter's Western and Blues and Walker's big action score. I also loved the new version of the Escape From New York theme for this film. Great version. Also great songs on the soundtrack from White ZombieThe OneToolSweatand Sugar RayTen Seconds Down.In final word Escape From L.A is an underrated classic that gets better with repeating viewings and is a film that deserves more respect and is one of John Carpenter and Kurt Russell's best films. Highly Recommended. 1010.".

I thought Jean Claude van Damme punching a snake and knocking it unconscious in Hard Target was bad but watching Snake Pliskin ride a tsunami on a surfboard then jumping into the back of a speeding car may be worse.I'd advise watching this movie once just to enjoy just how simply bad it is.

Kurt Russell not only came up with but wrote the entire ending of the movie  in fact it was the first and only writing credit . Escape From LA was caught in development hell for over ten years . A script for the film was first commissioned in 1985 but John Carpenter thought it too light too campy .

The sequel Escape from L.A rating  average but entertaining . The movie will enjoy to noisy action fans but packs a rollercoaster thriller and wholesome amusement . The film will appeal to John Carpenter enthusiasts . A third sequel was going to be made titled Escape from Earth which would have had Snake escaping Earth after a dark matter experiment. However the negative reaction to this film prevented the sequel from being developed. As the movie was a notorious failure on release making around 25 million  just half its budget  at the US box office. Many reviews criticized the film for being too violent or for being too similar to the original film .".

It begins with Snake already in custody and about to be shipped off to LA like garbage when he's propositioned by the president to do a mission for a full pardon. It's a subversive satire within a very ridiculous action film. Whether in the moral US or decadent LA it's full of self important wack jobs that Snake doesn't take serious and could care less about which is the perfect character to follow in this type of film. After the theocratic president of America orders Snake on his mission Snake gives a snide but honest remark who are you? Perfectly sets the tone of the film and character. Once he reaches LA we are introduced to an assortment of characters who aren't so much quirky as they are absurd and fit in wonderfully to this nonsensical world Carpenter created. Even though this much maligned sequel has been marginalized as one of the bottom of Carpenter's films it's miles better than its reputation and consistently hilarious. It's also impossible not to notice or mention the truly awful visual effects. Effects this terrible are clearly the case of the studio pulling the money plug on a film they probably knew was too expensive to make back a fraction of its costs  not because of incompetence. There isn't a single effect that is polished or finished but the slapdash vfx don't detract from how much the film gets right.".

	schema:headline " Can't touch the original...";
	schema:reviewBody "Escape from New York is by no means a classic film but it's memorably dark seedy suspenseful and even funny. You might call it a worthy cult favorite. Alas Escape from L.A. is not nearly as memorable  in fact it plays out like a tired remake of its far more amusing predecessor.Both films have essentially the same premise corrupt government officials send criminal tough guy Snake Plissken to infiltrate the ruins of a oncegreat city and retrieve some MacGuffin for them. In both films Snake is reluctant to cooperate but the government secures his compliance by threatening his life. So Snake duly treks off to an urban wasteland wasting thugs and meeting a variety of wacky characters on his way to completing his desperate mission.Because the two films are so similar I find Escape from L.A. tedious  it simply doesn't break enough new ground. And to make matters worse this tepid sequel does everything worse than the original movie. The villain is inferior the president is inferior and even the special effects are inferior note the positively laughable CGI when Snake pilots his submarine to L.A. the approach to New York in the first film is infinitely classier. And though both films are comedies of a sort I find that the jokes in the first are simply better. In L.A. there are some attempts at social satire but by and large they don't work. For instance the muchpraised plastic surgery segment feels really isolated and pointless to me. It's a onejoke sequence that goes nowhere and contributes nothing to the plot. Ultimately I think the first film has the edge in the comedy department because it was cowritten by Nick Castle who reportedly lightened up the script and was quite a wit in general though Castle is credited on this movie I believe it's only because he wrote the original film. Perhaps the crowning aggravation of Escape from L.A. is its exceedingly preachy social commentary. Now I happen to be fairly liberal so I agree with some of this film's criticisms of the religious right  but I also find the presentation of these criticisms to be superficial condescending and obnoxious. To be perfectly blunt this movie is not literate enough to have serious political aims. It's just too silly and inyourface it doesn't have the subtlety to work as a satire and it certainly lacks balance. Suffice to say if you're conservative this movie will annoy you and even if you're an openminded liberal it will probably still annoy you by representing your views so poorly.Yeah this is basically a dud though I sort of enjoy the Ludditelike sentiments in the concluding scenes. It's got some good cameos a few decent scenes but in the end...it just ain't the original. What a waste of 50 million bucks!".

	schema:reviewBody "It truly is a travesty that this film was not appreciated for what it was but then again to appreciate it you'd have to UNDERSTAND it first which for many wasn't possible as sadly most tend to look for the external eye candy glimmer and glitz of HW today rather than for what a film's deeper meaning is and the message the director is trying to broadcast through the use of allegory and the proverbial 'peeling back of the onion layers.' Yes Escape from NY and LA will not 'wow' you with amazing special effects and action of Aliens T2 etc. But most of John Carpenter's films have never focused on any of this because that is not where is heart mind and soul are placed. You see you wont find Carpenter doing interviews for Time Esquire GQ or on your normal mainstream news show being interviewed by some generic movie pundit about his next movie or have the enormous marketing campaigns and fanfare that a Cameron or Spielberg movie would have. And there is a reason for that...Many of his films focus on political and societal issues and the schisms within our world the main one being freedom vs tyranny and those trying to break out of the current matrix or those awaking to it and understanding that all is NOT what it seems. People aren't what they seem government isn't what it seems laws aren't what they seem and mankind isn't fulfilling its rightful place as it was intended due to those who crave power and the corruption that comes with it. Carpenter made this film in 1996 which takes place in 2013 and to blatantly ignore or not even understand how our world is quickly becoming the world depicted in the film and its prequel well all i can say is you need to wake up and brush up on some history my friends.One of my favorite scenes in the movie and one that spoke to such great parallels of our world today is with Snake and Tamisla Valeria Golino some will remember her from Rainman. She tells Snake she was put there for being a Muslim which was criminalized after some time. Well its safe to say thats pretty much happening today everywhere in a sense pertaining to the demonization and attacks on Islam but on Christianity as well. Its no secret the antiMuslim approach has been overwhelming today with the ethnic profiling and illegal set ups of patsies that NYPD itself has been found guilty of as well as all the attacks on Christians today where advocacy groups working directly for the Pentagon want Chaplains in the Army to refrain from proselytizing to troops which of course is everything being Chaplain is all about. They are removing crosses from bases with all this politically correct garbage we see so much of. God or the word 'god' is removed from schools prayers the Pledge of Allegiance. We all remember the Tebow debacle and how grad students cant 'thank Jesus' at ceremonies anymore. The list just goes on and on. Yet the funny thing is that one of the police thugs in the beginning of the movie tells Snake how all the 'bad people unwanted and the ATHEISTS' are thrown into LA. Well see this is more hypocrisy we because all know who the real atheists truly were because if they were moral and real Christians including the lunatic President they wouldn't be doing what they were doing in the movie. But this here is a HUGE and i mean HUGE allusion to real life today.He then asks Tamisla why she wont just leave and go south to MX or something. She says 'Why should i? We are more free here than out there. Out there is the real prison.' Pure gold there. She is right. Just how free were they before? Just how many rights did they have before? Well now they can 'wear fur coats' as she says or practice whatever faith they like without any interference from the 'loving and benevolent government.' But you see Snake knows all of this. He knows how bad it is and he wants no part of it. This is why he said in the beginning of the movie when told he would be granted 'freedom' by the President if he completed his mission 'In American? Pfff...that died a long time ago.'Well its sad to admit but yes quite a bit of freedom has truly died in the America we live in today and that's a fact jack.In the first film you may remember how Snake always said 'Call me Snake' when the government agents would call him 'Plissken'. You see he didn't like them referring to him in a way that would show they are relating to him as his 'old self' or his 'citizen self'. He sees that as a way of relating to them which he doesn't like nor wants to be a part of. This is contrasted so well at the end when the great Lee Van Cleef says 'Snake i have a deal for you. A job you and i we'd make a great team'. Here Snake says 'Call me Plissken' and walks off. Here Snake is once again detaching himself from these state minions not wanting to be all 'buddy buddy' with them as he hates what they stand for and what they are allowing to be perpetuated day after day.But these things here is what Carpenter is touching on.Draw your own conclusions. Make sure your opinions are your own. Question everything. And most of all take pride in your freedom because it is the most precious thing all men and women need always to protect. ".

Snake Kurt Russell enters into the 9.6quaked Los Angeles of 2013 in order to retrieve a black box which is a sort of end of the world device. Snake has friends and foes Steve Buscemi Peter Fonda Stacy Keach Cliff Robertson and a good actress Pam Grier. There is also plenty of action where Snake divebombs a Happy Kingdom theme park. The ending of this film is perfect and I enjoyed this film as much as Escape from New York. John Carpenter  Kurt Russell did a great job in the production and directing. Enjoy".

Snake Kurt Russell enters into the 9.6quaked Los Angeles of 2013 in order to retrieve a black box which is a sort of end of the world device. Snake has friends and foes Steve Buscemi Peter Fonda Stacy Keach Cliff Robertson and a good actress Pam Grier. There is also plenty of action where Snake divebombs a Happy Kingdom theme park. The ending of this film is perfect and I enjoyed this film as much as Escape from New York. John Carpenter  Kurt Russell did a great job in the production and directing. Enjoy";

Simple the script. High school kids can't really act but when they perform 'Oklahoma' or 'Fiddler on the Roof' the presentation is usually passable. Why? good script.There is no camera work at a live presentation of one of Shakespeare's plays even using unknown but gifted performers  yet the final product is generally intriguing.

Forest Whitaker is always brilliant. Jody Foster has 'A'list talent. Jared Leto plays a good 'bizarrotype' try his understated performance in 'Switchback' with Danny Glover and Dwight Yoakam has the chops to 'weird you out' in bit roles made me shudder in 'Sling Blade'. How could such a roster produce this piece of junk? Bad script. A revealing clue that the writer tanked the screenplay is when the bad guys show up and start cursing for no particular reason. The 'script' probably reads 'the bad guys show up and start cursing for no particular reason'.The array of dumb things in this film listed here at IMDb seems endless but I'll add one more apologies if someone got it before Jody and daughter are using a flashlight to signal a sleeping neighbor for help100 yards away. He wakes up looks out his window and.... and.....and... they stop flashing the SOS and they begin to holler 'Help Help Help' through a rainstorm. He can't hear. He goes back to sleep.

Meg and Sarah waste no time in putting the claustrophobic area to use on their first night no less when a trio of burglars Forest Whitaker Jared Leto and Dwight Yoakam make their way into her building to retrieve a large sum of money.  The catch is that the burglars' stash is in the very room in which Meg and her daughter are hiding!  While 'Panic Room' is not exactly whiteknuckle suspense it definitely has its moments especially the heartpounding moment when Meg leaves the panic room to grab her cell phone and the the tensionbuilding scene when Whitaker and Yoakam enter the panic room when Foster leaves.  The only main plot hole is clear in the very beginning Why would a recently separated woman with one child want to purchase a fourstory brownstone? What does she need all of that space for?  Besides that 'Panic Room' is an intelligently written and directed thriller from director David Fincher Fight Club.  The only characters that don't make sense are Meg's friend in the opening scenes and her husband Ann Magnuson and Patrick Bauchau.  They both seem hopelessly unnecessary otherwise 'Panic Room' is a firstrate thriller with similarities to several shockers of the early 1990s 'Unlawful Entry' 1992 being one in particular.

So what in the Earth made her accept working in this piece of garbage called Panic Room? Forest Whitaker is a great actor too. I cannot believe both of them appear here! I would give no stars to this movie but these 2 great actors make me save their performance.Producers made a big mistake with the casting. Probably they spent all the money paying Jodie and Forest so they put only garbage actors to complete the group. This is not unusual. The masked criminal does not look menacing without his mask at all. And the little girl is cute and a good actress but she seems a boy. In fact when I watched the trailer I thought it was a boy! She not only seems a boy because of her haircut but because she has boys manners!spoilers aheadThe storyline is stupid from the very first minute. Anyway the movie was good at first specially because the camera amazing movements and CGI. After the bad guys break into the house everything is very predictable full of plot holes and it goes only to show the characters stupidity1 Why do they get a house so big while they are only 2 small people? This house is for about 5 people! Without livein help it is impossible to have that house clean!2 There are lots of noises when the guys first talk takes place they even shout in lower voice Meg cannot sleep she is wide awake but she does not hear ANYTHING.3 Why the guys do not leave the girls alone trapped inside the elevator if what they want is in the panic room?4 The 911 never put you on hold and if so I might think they are able to track your call and send an unit.5 The fire thing is no real. Gas does not remain in the ceiling and also the carafe outside should have exploited burning the 3 criminals and the explosion should be noisy enough to alert neighbors.6 It is incredible that both mom and daughter do not wonder what the criminals want from the room and try to negotiate.7 At first it is impossible to talk from outside to inside but later it is! Sounds strange that the big guy who built the room does not know about the intercom and this new owner does.8 At the end it is stupid that Burnham comes back to the house because he hears a shout the police sirens were sounded nearby already. Also it is stupid that Burnham let the bank bonds go with the wind because he could have raised his hands keeping the papers in his jacket.I will not continue with plot holes because it would be endless but I have to say that I am tired of Terminator skills at the end of all thrillers. How can I guy survive while he has a hand damaged he is hammered on the head and he fell one floor down? He still has a supernatural strength to fight 3 people! As I said all the movie is predictable from the start to the end. If you watch this movie with someone else I suggest a guessing game and probably you will guess everything! For example what do you think a neighbor will do if someone in front is bothering him with flashing lights? I understand the Morse code idea but face it... only a few among regular people get it.Another thing the finale is tasteless... I felt saying And where is the panic that appeared in the movie title?".

Gas does not remain in the ceiling and also the carafe outside should have exploited burning the 3 criminals and the explosion should be noisy enough to alert neighbors.6 It is incredible that both mom and daughter do not wonder what the criminals want from the room and try to negotiate.7 At first it is impossible to talk from outside to inside but later it is! Sounds strange that the big guy who built the room does not know about the intercom and this new owner does.8 At the end it is stupid that Burnham comes back to the house because he hears a shout the police sirens were sounded nearby already. Also it is stupid that Burnham let the bank bonds go with the wind because he could have raised his hands keeping the papers in his jacket.I will not continue with plot holes because it would be endless but I have to say that I am tired of Terminator skills at the end of all thrillers. How can I guy survive while he has a hand damaged he is hammered on the head and he fell one floor down? He still has a supernatural strength to fight 3 people! As I said all the movie is predictable from the start to the end. If you watch this movie with someone else I suggest a guessing game and probably you will guess everything! For example what do you think a neighbor will do if someone in front is bothering him with flashing lights? I understand the Morse code idea but face it... only a few among regular people get it.Another thing the finale is tasteless... I felt saying And where is the panic that appeared in the movie title?";

You do manage to stay at the edge of your seat without a lot of TENSE music added to force you there.  Really the movie is good but the plot stinks.SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!An example of how STUPID Jodie's character is.  In the trailers for the film they show this very creepy scene where the bad guys hold up a sign reading What we want is in that room.  Now does Jodie say what is it? or how about I put it outside the door you take it and then leave.  NOPE nothing....the film doesn't even address that fact.  Later it ends up being a stupid floor safe containing bonds.  That's another thing she is in this tiny tiny room making McGuyveresque use of everything and she doesn't notice a safe under the area rug????????".

Seven is the better one but still after you get over the magnificent photography you're left with a formula used and abused for years. Fight Club has a first hour that makes you think in you're in for a real treat. With superb performances by Norton Pitt and Bonham Carter and then a massive let down. The Game was mystical powerful mysterious and spine chilling for the whole first part but then... They all have that same common denominator opportunistic thoughtless and unimaginative writing. That alone alienates the bulk of their potential audiences. Now Panic Room the most blatant example of what I'm trying to convey. No matter how brilliant the camera work where are the characters? Where is the drama? What was with the husband? What about that semi visit by the police? Unforgivable. I should advice Mr. Fincher to look at films with less gadgetry even less ambition and take note. From William Wyler's Desperate Hours to David Miller's Midnight Lace or quite simply look at the sort of writers Alfred Hitchcock worked with without them Mr. Hitchcock would have been a director of the past not the legendary master for all seasons.".

But because of its silly plot full of holes and ridiculous dialog it turns out to be unintentionally funny.Forest Whitaker Dwight Yoakam and Jared Leto play a trio of robbers that makes the Three Stooges look smart. They resemble the hapless burglars Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in Home Alone. Only this time it's Jodie Foster and Kristen Stuart who are home alone when the three goofballs break into their home to steal the millions of dollars hidden in the Panic Room. That's a vault room that the previous owner had built into the house. It's so safe that no one can break into it. It has its own phone and electrical system its own air filtration system and surveillance cameras to see every room in the house. And guess who helped build it. Forest Whitaker one of the robbers. This movie is so dumb. Here are just a few of the many glaring errors1. Whitaker is able to pump propane gas into the room even though it has its own ventilation system. He does this simply by knocking a hole in the drywall. The room itself is encased in concrete and steel.2.He's also tries to tap into a phone cable which get this is sticking out of a jack in the wall and which get this Jodie Foster manages to in the nick of time yank out of the wall even though she is in the panic room. 3. The hapless robbers seal the house so that no one can get in or out. But who happens to appear? Foster's husband. That's right. He manages to just appear in the foyer even though they have locked up the house tight and sealed the doors with screws. 4. How about the fact that large tools appear from nowhere such as the drill press which Whitaker uses to drill into the safe. Why would anyone go to all the trouble to put a safe in a Panic Room yet the safe is so weak you can drill into it? Beats me. 5. Foster's daughter who it turns out goes into diabetic coma and needs an injection. This certainly came out of the blue.In short Panic Room is one of the stupidest movies in recent memory. It is not just stupid it's incredibly stupid. The dialog is absolutely so bad it's a hoot. The plot is so full of holes you'll be laughing your butt off.Too bad. I love Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker. They have an immense amount of talent. They should never have been in this total piece of rubbish.".

Further more it is my opinion that the visual aspects of the film Fincher's trademark were nothing to behold.  The lens choices were terrible extreme wide shots of intense drama on charcters made certain scenes come across phony the lack of depth of field and very wide lenses caused shot after shot to have so much 'dead space' in the frame it seemed painfully obvious the reason was for a claustrophobic mood. As a fan of Fincher it was a slap in the face to have the amount of product placement abundant the Cocca Cola scene in the beginning is cringe inducing when his previous 'Fight Club' basically negated his aesthetic choices in this film.  The screenplay was brain dead and gimmicky mood was so contrived it was shoved down your throat.  Maybe Fincher should calm down a bit understand the meaning of the term subtly and not be so in our face.

David Fincher does some dizzying things with the camera but the script by the very rich David Koepp is just plain amateurish. I was so frustrated by the waste of everything here. The characters seem a facsimile of characters from other better movies without being able to nail that extra dimension that could make them at least watchable. The husband the cops even the baddies are all laughable. Jodie Foster has a couple of moments and she's one of my heroes anyway but that's maybe why I felt so annoyed by this movie so much so that I decided to vent my frustration writing this comment. If you love Jodie Foster avoid this for her sake.".

David Fincher does some dizzying things with the camera but the script by the very rich David Koepp is just plain amateurish. I was so frustrated by the waste of everything here. The characters seem a facsimile of characters from other better movies without being able to nail that extra dimension that could make them at least watchable. The husband the cops even the baddies are all laughable. Jodie Foster has a couple of moments and she's one of my heroes anyway but that's maybe why I felt so annoyed by this movie so much so that I decided to vent my frustration writing this comment. If you love Jodie Foster avoid this for her sake.";

For me the very nature of this film as with say oceans eleven or the score which are somewhat similar is that it covers all angles in the clever plot so there are no loose ends. This was so loose and unbelievable that it unraveled before me and half way through just left me idiot spotting how crap the script was. Can I score this with a negative number it is total worthless garbage. I HATED IT WITH A PASSION. How did this get 7.410 on imdb? It must be fixed it got the same as 'naked' ? yer right.".

Then I realized this was the new David Fincher film and I was HOOKED! I loved Seven Fight Club and I even admired Alien3 simply because of Fincher. The movie is fantastic full of twists turns and jolts. The performance of Jared Leto was awesome. His character was funny and seemed to hold the action together. Jodie Foster is great as usual and Kristen Stewart was very good as the Sarah although from the trailers it was hard to tell if it was a boy or girl...and Dwight and Forrest were great as well.

This means that while one is watching it is possible to overlook a few questions that will be raised if one thinks about the situation for example would the ventilation system of a supposedly safe room be as vulnerable as it was here? The acting was pretty solid Jodie Foster was as good as one would expect from this fine actress and the young Kristen Stewart was excellent as Sarah it is of little surprise that she has gone on to become a star in her own right. Of the 'bad guys' Forrest Whitaker put in the best performance although I might think that because his character was the least unpleasant of the three! There are a surprising number of changes of situation throughout the film given that it all takes place within one house which helps keep things interesting.

This flaw was the injection scene.  Anyone who knows anything about diabetes knows that when someone is suffering from low blood sugar and verging on going into a coma the last thing you would do is inject them with insulin which would just cause them to go into a coma that much faster and very likely kill them. Even if the syringe contained a sugar solution the filmmakers should have known that to be the least bit effective this would have to have been injected directly into the blood stream not into stomach tissue.  Not only is it insulting to diabetics everywhere that the filmmakers couldn't even be bothered to get the facts right about this deadly disease but this depiction could conceivably result in a tragedy.  Anyone using this scene as a basic for trying to help someone who is suffering from low blood sugar could end up killing them.  Other minor flaws with the movie how could Forest Whitaker's character have know what Jodie Foster's character was doing when she was trying to ignite the gas how likely is it that Jodie Foster's character would know how to reconnect the phone pushing a light sofa in front of the door is not terribly effective in blocking the door which is made clear when Jodie Foster's character had no problem later in the movie in getting the front door open etc. etc. etc.  Very poorly thought out and executed.

	schema:reviewBody "PANIC ROOM is a suspense thriller quite different from what I was expecting since I thought it would be something in the Horror genre but no it isn't the plot is about a robbery that three guys try to do to a house with a panic room I think it was the this title which induced me in error because panic room is a protection room to the owners of the house. So it was different from what I was expecting but I liked it anyway because it's a great thriller very suspenseful and very well shot. The setting is always the house but it doesn't turn out boring because it has a good pace with very little slow moments. About the cinematography I enjoyed the camera work which is excellent especially in the first hour when they shot incredible details and the camera does a travelling effect and the light almost the entire film is shot with little illumination which makes it a suspenseful dark thriller which I use to appreciate!. The acting is also very good. I did enjoy it and I score it 710.".

	schema:headline " The review that is true";
	schema:reviewBody "Set in an era similar to Arthurian England The Court Jester features a questionable king Roderick I Cecil Parker who has taken over by killing off all of his opposition. He's working on building alliances between the most important powerful and aristocratic families in his kingdom including Sir Ravenhurst Basil Rathbone this will help build a trustworthy legitimizing base. His plans include trying to marry his off his daughter Princess Gwendolyn Angela Lansbury to the gruff Sir Griswold Robert Middletona scheme she firmly opposes. However Roderick's men overlooked an infant of the otherwise massacred competing royal family. The infant whom many in the kingdom would believe to be the rightful heir to the throne is being looked after by the Black Fox Edward Ashley. The Black Fox leads a motley crew they live in the forest and bear some similarity to Robin Hood and his merry men. One of the Black Fox's men is Hubert Hawkins Danny Kaye. After running into a court jester named Giacomo John Carradine Hawkins and Maid Jean Glynis Johns end up in a scheme to infiltrate Roderick's castle and give the Black Fox's men access for a coup.Although you cannot tell from my accounting of the premise above The Court Jester is a comedy and a very funny one at that. However it does have a fairly complex plot in its early stagesall of the above is relayed within the first 10  15 minutes. This is a slow burner but as such the last hour at least is a very solid 10. It's unfortunate that a few minor flaws in the earlier sections of the film including the complicated plot caused me to rate The Court Jester as a 9 instead. The last half is so incredible that I wanted to give the film a 10 instead perhaps on subsequent viewings this is only the second time I've seen the film the first was many years ago the opening sections will work better for me.As one of the earliest VistaVision films The Court Jester looks gorgeous. It is full of lush extremely saturated color. The few panoramic landscape shots are stunning and almost surreal. Most of the film is set within Roderick's castle however which is no less attractive visually. Producersdirectorswriters Melvin Frank and Norman Panama and their crew certainly got the period setting right. The Court Jester is just as authentic feeling as Knights of the Round Table 1953 or The Black Knight 1954 both part of a popular trend of the era of Arthurian and related films leading to this satire.The cast is excellent even if some members such severely underused such as Carradine and to an extent Rathbone. Of course The Court Jester is really a showcase for Kaye's considerable and diverse talents. Kaye was adept at quickly changing characters as in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty 1947 and gets to put that skill to great use here first in disguises then as the jester and most importantly as a hypnotized pawn in a number of games. Princess Gwendolyn's matron Griselda Mildred Natwick finds cause to put Hawkins under a spell to make him fall in love with the Princess making a finger snap the cue for his hypnotic transitions. This leads to a hilarious extended sequence where different characters are interacting with Hawkins for different covert endssome fueled by mistaken identityand continually snapping their fingers. Kaye as Hawkins as Giacomo has to keep toggling back and forth between two personalities neither of which knows about the other. Meanwhile complicated plans are being made which he is expected to follow. Even funnier is that despite himself he basically manages to follow the plans.It's a bit silly but the humor in The Court Jester is all about sillinessit's appropriate for the titular role and more importantly it's just plain funny. From the finger snapping sequence through the end of the film is one long build up with increasingly outrageous situations until we finally arrive at pandemonium complete with tens of acrobatic midgets battling a cadre of knights in a scene remarkably prescient of the anarchic screwball comedies of the latter half of the 1960s.Kaye's vocal talents are also put to considerable use both in songs and in rapidfire sometimes nonsensical alliterative rhymes. There are a number of very famousand rightfully soinstances of the latter throughout the film including the vessel with the pestlechalice from the palaceflagon with the dragonbrew that is true bit which has oddly taken on a life of its own outside of the film and which like all of the comedy throughout the film slowly builds up to a hilarious climax.Kaye also does a lot of physical comedy including my favorite bitthe superfast knighting ceremony and he even does a bit of mostly serious fencing with Rathbone. Watching The Court Jester can only make one lament that Kaye was not featured in even more films he was extremely talented and very unique.The Court Jester has influenced many later films including such diverse works as Monty Python and the Holy Grail 1975 and by extension Jabberwocky 1977 and A Kid in King Arthur's Court 1995. But influence or not this is a masterpiece despite its flaws and should be viewed at least once by any cinephile worth his or her weight in purple pimpernels.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yea verily yea in days of old when knights were bold and intrigue was a staple of the Royal Court there were Utopias usurped kings killed querulous queens knights knighted dukes daily doing whatever it is dukes do and ladies forever in waiting.  And in every court there was also a fool a merrymaker an entertainer one with access to the royal ear and often a doer of different kinds of deeds such as the one portrayed in The Court Jester' directed by Norman Panama and Melvin Frank.  Danny Kaye stars as Hubert Hawkins an entertainer by trade who due to circumstances within his control becomes jester to the court of King Roderick I Cecil Parker. Roderick however is a false king sitting upon the throne in the stead of the real heir to the throne still a baby who bears the undisputable truth of his birthright in a birthmark of a scarlet pimpernel upon his backside. And yea verily yea the intrigue mounts as Sir Ravenhurst Basil Rathbone jostles for position within the court while a rebel known as the Black Fox' Edward Ashley along with his beautiful daughter the Maid Jean Glynis Johns and his band of merry men attempt to install the true king to the throne.  While in the midst of it all there is Hawkins now known as Giacomo king of jesters and jester of kings' proving beyond the shadow of a doubt that in the end it is laughter that is indeed the Ruler of any court.Codirectors Frank and Panama deliver a real gem with this delightful comedy bringing the story to life with humor music and song and creating some truly memorable moments along the way.  From the Initiation of Knighthood' sequence to the famous tonguetwisting The vessel with the pestle has the pellet with the poison the chalice from the palace has the brew that is true' scene to Kaye crooning a lullaby to a baby this film is rich with humor and song that has an innocence and purity about it that makes it readily accessible to any audience.  This is humor that runs deep humor with a heart and soul you'll want to embrace.  Simply put this is terrific stuff the timing especially by Kaye is impeccable the delivery is perfect and the jokes work.  The real key to the success of this movie is of course the multitalented Danny Kaye who sings dances jokes and mugs his way through one of his best performances ever.  And what makes Kaye so good and so special is the spirit' of his performance the sense of joy he emanates while proffering his talents.  He gives so completely of himself so entirely and so honestly that he's just an absolute joy to watch.  You'll never find a false moment in his performance either and that's something that is discernible in his eyes it's that twinkle of laughter and love in his eyes that separates and elevates him from so many other performers in whom you will often find a pretentiousness upon close scrutiny.  That's something you will never find in Danny Kaye a consummate entertainer who obviously loved what he was doing and was able to successfully convey it to his audience. He was unquestionably unique a true oneofakind.The lovely Glynis Johns brings beauty and vitality to her role of Jean acquitting herself quite nicely alongside Kaye's abundant antics.  Though not a part that stretched the limits of her considerable talents she creates a credible character and most importantly she makes a nice fit with her costar and lends a beguiling presence to the film.  A nice bit of work by Johns who some eight years later would create one of her most memorable roles that of Mrs. Banks in Mary Poppins.'Basil Rathbone is a delight as well in a role that is essentially a parody of others he's played specifically his Sir Guy of Gisbourne in The Adventures of Robin Hood' opposite Errol Flynn.  The success of his Ravenhurst however lies in the fact that he plays him straight without a hint of the humor or parody inherent in the character as presented within the context of this story.  It goes without saying that he is perfectly cast here and his swashbuckling duel with a bewitched Giacomo is a lark.Also turning in a notable performance in a role that is minor yet integral to the story is Angela Lansbury as the king's daughter Princess Gwendolyn.  It's a part that demands little more of her than being beautiful and charming and she succeeds on both accounts.  Her screen time is fairly limited but it's enough to leave an impression and a good one at that.The supporting cast includes Mildred Natwick Griselda Robert Middleton Sir Griswold Michael Pate Sir Locksley Herbert Rudley Captain of the Guard Noel Drayton Fergus John Carradine Giacomo Alan Napier Sir Brockhurst Lewis Martin Sir Finsdale and Patrick Aherne Sir Pertwee. A fun feelgood film The Court Jester' is a virtual showcase for the versatile Danny Kaye and he responds with an unforgettable performance. This is true comedy at it's best and proves overwhelmingly that a movie doesn't have to be hip crude rude or vulgar to inspire real laughter. Most of the comedies' produced in the past decade or so wouldn't even make it to the bottom of the chart this one tops.  For some real laughs just call for a Kaye comedy  Completely conducive to contemporary conviviality. Get it?  Got it.  Good.  Yea verily yea.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 1010".

	schema:headline " More Than Classic Satire Perhaps Kaye's Best a Perennial Favorite";
	schema:reviewBody "If this satire of the Middle Ages and hereditary monarchs is not the most hilarious film ever made in most viewers' books it stands right next to their favorite. The inspired casting of Danny Kaye as a performer who wants to be a patriotic fighter gorgeous Glynis Johns as his stern captain Angela Lansbury as a loveprone princess Cecil Parker as her lascivious and bumbling evil father a usurper of course Basil Rathbone and Michael Pate as his coconspirators and Robert Middleton and Mildred Natwick as roadblocks to the restoring of a baby as the rightful king of the realm guaranteed a film filled with wellacted fun. The script and direction of this colorful vivid and sidesplitting film were delivered by Norman Panama and Melvin Frank. Mention should also be made of the gorgeous Edith Head costumes the art direction sets makeup hairstyling and blocking and the songs by Sylvia Fine Sammy Cahn and others. Other stalwarts in the cast who do very well also include Alan Napier Herbert Rudley Noel Drayton Edwin Astley as The Black Fox Kaye's boss John Carradine and more. Millions to this day are still laughing about the An Unemployed Jester song the switches from hypnotized bumbler to dashing superswordsman that afflict Kaye in the course of his penetration of the royal stronghold the classic duel Kaye fights with with the Gruesome Griswold Middleton the switching of poisoned drinks that occurs just before the duel with everyone repeating The poison is in the vessel with the pestle etc. and the highspeed knighting of Kaye that precedes both these scenes. The climax of the film features a battle between midgets and foresters doing combats against the usurper's misguided loyalists and Kaye's exhibiting the royal birthmark on the baby king's bottom to prove his right to lie on the throne. What ends with a song called Life Couldn't Possibly Better Be and begins with You'll Never Outfox the Fox has by that scene traversed areas of hilarity few have ever ventured upon or even dreamed to reach. A key to the film lies in the comedic use of Mildred Natwick as a spellcasting Svengali exercising power over the Princess lansbury who is besotted with the idea of romantic love half the goings on are due to her machinations that complicate an already astonishing situation. The rest is made possible by Kaye's impersonating the jester Giacomo Carradine who has been sent for by the bad men to do in the opposition. The colors are gorgeous in this film the acting far above average and Kaye is at his absolute best whether doing faked accents signing a lullaby to the boy king or proving that courage is not a matter of muscles at all. This is a movie to fetch out of the vault on any holiday or for any other excuse. With a bit more care at cutting down Sylvia Fine's vaudeville type material for Kaye the movie might have been as appreciated when it was first released as it is now.".

It also offers a great showcase for star Danny Kaye's many talents.  The story is a nicely done comic version of the Robin Hoodtype adventure tales.  Kaye is one of a band of rebels hiding out in a forest led by The Black Fox who are opposing an evil king who has usurped the throne.  Their secret plan to restore the rightful king involves having Kaye impersonate the evil king's new court jester so that he can gain the monarch's confidence.  But even as the rebels plot the king's own nobles are maneuvering for advantage amongst themselves some with murderous intent. The question of whom the king's daughter should marry also comes into play. The early part of the film moves somewhat slowly as all of this is established but then things get delightfully complicated and the laughs and adventure both start coming quickly.  There are several outstanding sequences and a fittingly wild sword fight finale.The cast is filled with outstanding actors  Glynis Johns Basil Rathbone Angela Lansbury and many others  who make their characters entertaining and memorable.  The dialogue is terrific and the cast does justice to it every time.  The story and the medieval setting also make a great showcase for Kaye's varied talents such as singing dancing roleplaying and his other comic gifts.All of this makes The Court Jester a wonderful and timeless film great comic entertainment done with exceptional skill and talent.

	schema:reviewBody "Not much goes wrong with this movie a delightful spoof of actioncostumer movies. Danny Kaye is an absolute delight as the young rebel impersonating a jester in the court of an evil king although in this film his evil is blunted but mistaken for a hit man. There have been few performers who could light up an entire scene by their mere presence and Kaye is one of them. Who in this day could do what he did? He could sing he could dance and he could make you laugh so hard you could only take liquids the next day. And in this movie he gets a chance to do all three plus do some swashbuckling! Also along for the ride are the elegant Glynis Johns who plays his superior in the slight rebel force trying to return the throne to its rightful owner and Basil Rathbone who could play the clever suave cad as good as anyone in movies. Film buffs may remember Rathbone's turn as the Sheriff of Nottingham in 1939's The Adventures of Robin Hood which starred the eminent Errol Flynn. In that movie Rathbone has a memorable swordfighting scene with Flynn here that scene is copied with Kaye a hilarious standin for Errol.  This movie is a true delight a mustsee for all ages.".

	schema:headline " The Second of my 5 favourite movies of ALL TIME. 1010";
	schema:reviewBody "The Court Jester 1956 is a superlative priceless treasure of the 20th Century. This classic tale combines several grand legends such as Robin Hood Giacomo and Dartagnan's Daughter with the more base nobility of the little baby's royal birthmark. Once seen it is impossible to forget the repetitive flipping scene used to obtain more converts.Everyone should by now know the plot once the hapless carnival entertainer Hubert Hawkins Danny Kaye assumes the identity of the new court jester Giacomo who happens to well deserve his reputation as a skillful assassin Hawkins is thrown into one court intrigue after another each beyond his control or understanding.As the socially powerless court jester Hawkins has to survive not only accidents and royal petulance but deliberate attempts at his execution as part of court intrigue.So I won't waste time recapping all that.Instead I'd like to mention the still potent generation gap politics and gender politics that routinely consumed the weakest of mediaeval society sometimes court jesters or often just women.King Roderick has a rather cynical and selfpossessed daughter in the Princess Gwendolyn a shockingly young and beautiful Angela Lansbury whom he nastily views as more a threat than a loved one and their war of wills is hilarious. But he needs her alive because he has no male heir so Gwendolyn regularly threatens suicide whenever she doesn't want to do something Harm one hair on her head and I throw myself from the highest turret she announces when her father tries to get rid of Gwendolyn's nanny.The king schemes to get his daughter out of the castle by marrying her off way up North to the grim and grizzly gruesome Griswold.Of course she has no intention of going. I am the King. If it pleases me you will marry Griswold he tries to command her. If it pleases you so much you marry Griswold! retorts his witty daughter.Gwendolyn has a nannypersonal confidant in Grizelda Mildred Natwick the witch actually a scientist they just didn't have a word for that yet who has raised the Princess to believe in more girlish romance partly to soften up Gwendolyn's belligerent cynicism. Unfortunately with such a brutal horsetrade as her proposed marriage to Sir Griswold of Macklewein girlish fancies of romance are starting to fly out the window of Gwendolyn's heart and she matteroffactly threatens Grizelda with a dirk a small dagger if the witch can't arrange a better alternative.Desperate to save both their lives Grizelda look she ain't no witch. She has pills and potions. That makes her a chemist alright?  pulls out every trick in her book. She first proffers the court jester as a romantic alternative to the princess and then mesmerizes him to make sure he courts the princess as ardently as the princess wants. Grizelda's hypnosis of Giacomo imbues him with superconfidence so he CAN fight for his life as well as Gwendolyn's hand. Mildred Natwick obviously had a terrific time pretendhypnotizing Danny Kaye. Master you can snap me in and snap me out he drools at her and later Kaye's impeccable talents at physical comedy have him jerking to every unconscious snap of everyone's fingers.However Hawkins is already in love with the only woman from their guerilla group back in the forest Capt. Jean aka Maid Jean Glynis Johns who is of course beautiful and smart and could whip his narrow butt in a heartbeat if only she didn't LIKE him so much. Before they both arrived through different routes at King Roderick's castle they had one romantic night together in an emergency hut as they sheltered the true heir to the throne. As they talk of politics in the hut and regret about the loss of the throne she ends up seducing herself and it's nice to see how that works as she reflects to him that my father made me everything I am. To his credit Hawkins reassures her that her father does beautiful work in a very satisfying gender role reversal for 1956. Sadly there is not enough chemistry between them and there SHOULD'VE been because the rest of the scene is very honest.The homage scenes to The Adventures of Robin Hood 1938 the Errol Flynn classic with the much younger Basil Rathbone are real gifts. They include the procession of robed monks secreting reinforcements and Rathbone doing himself in the earlier role.But my personal favourite is the spoof scene of Errol Flynn accidentally cutting through one humungous candle in the 1938 film. In The Court Jester 1956 Danny Kaye fencing FAR TOO WELL against Rathbone in his hypnosisfortified guise deliberately cuts a swath through an entire row of candles without any apparent effectuntil he breathes on the candles and they all drop off their candlesticks on cue. This Court Jester scene has stuck in my mind from childhood.The entire supporting cast is terrific. Cecil Parker's King Roderick eventually becomes quite personable as he relaxes into his regal position and quips with Giacomo and he's very funny with Maid Jean as a lecherous royal repelled by her clever claim to having an STD! WOW pretty contemporary for 1956 don't you think?I really love all the musical numbers as well. They are so well integrated that they provide a deeper understanding of the plot. Kaye's incredible onceinalifetimefind wordsmithwife Sylvia Fine crafted ALL his tonguetwisters including these songs. And Kaye just flips them off as if they were nothing.It's a shame we don't see more jester's hard knocks to establish the jester MILIEU. Nevertheless I always get blown away by the final lyrics of The Maladjusted Jester .For a jester's chief employment is to kill himself for your enjoyment And a jester unemployed is nobody's fool!There is a lot of political commentary in this alleged piece of fluff.Addictively quotable. No more quibbling 1010.".

Glynis Johns plays a member of Kaye's merry band with whom Kaye has fallen in love and Mildred Natwick plays the witch Griselda who at one point tries to help Kaye poison a rival by explaining that the pellet with the poison is in the vessel with the pestle while the chalice with the palace has the brew that is true.Grade A";

	schema:reviewBody "This film was Danny Kaye's biggest success as a musical comedy. Set in Medieval England it followed the career of wouldbe Robin Hood type Hubert Hawkins who is one of the peasants determined to overturn the tyrannical regime of King Roderick Cecil Parker and Lord Ravenhurst Basil Rathbone. Hubert is a master ? of disguise  witness his impersonation of Fotheringay the wine merchant who has an annoying catarrh. He replaces a visiting court jester from Italy named Giacomo John Carridine regretfully in a cameo performance only. Using this role he invades the castle of King Roderick not realizing that Giacomo is not only Italy's greatest jester but it's leading hired assassin  and that Ravenhurst has sent for him to get rid of his competition to solidify his political power and to aim at marrying the Princess Gwendolyn Angela Lansbury. Hubert's girlfriend Maid Jean Glynis Johns is on hand to try to assist only to watch as Princess Gwendolyn finds the jester attractive  and when Hubert is hypnotized by Gwendolyn's sorceress maid Griselda Mildred Natwick he becomes  well a dashing swordsman and adventurer like the real Giacomo...so long as he does not snap his fingers! Kaye had some delightful dialog particularly with Rathbone as straight man  such as the alliteration in the Summary Line between them and in their mad duel scene where a briefly arrogant Hubert calls Ravenhurst a Ratcatcher. Of course the best bits are the description of the apparently mutually fatal confrontation of the Doge of Venice the Duke and the Dutchess and the business of the pellet with the poison in the various goblet flagons and chalices which eventually Kaye shares with an equally tongue tied Sir Griswold Robert Middleton. Parker a usurper who seems ruthless like Richard III but is far more easily befuddled watch how Johns handles him when he makes a play for her is quite amusing. The film never flags a problem with some of Kaye's comedies at times and deserves it's position as his best work.".

The real king is an infant who can only be identified by the royal birthmark that is on all the royal family. It's the purple pimpernel and it's on a spot where the sun doesn't normally shine.His contribution is small as small as that group of traveling midget acrobats Kaye travels with. But the leader of the resistance the Black Fox played by Edward Ashley needs entertainment for the troops. Kaye and the small tumblers provide a kind of medieval USO show for them.But through a bizarre set of circumstances Kaye his true love Glynis Johns and the royal babe find themselves in Parker's well guarded palace.It'a a good thing there were a lot of conflicting agendas working at that time. Cecil Parker who likes being king especially for the perks it provides like Glynis Johns if he can seduce her. There's prime minister Basil Rathbone who's hired the real Giacomo the Jester more for his ability as an assassin. Giacomo played by John Carradine had the misfortune to be waylaid by Kaye and Johns on the way to the palace.And we can't forget Parker's daughter Angela Lansbury who does not want to marry roughneck knight Robert Middleton who really does want to marry her. And of course sorceress Mildred Natwick who keeps the bumbling Kaye alive with hypnotism at critical moments.With all that to consider The Court Jester turns into one of Danny Kaye's funniest comedies. It borrows from a lot of films The Adventures of Robin Hood being one A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court being another. And that famous Danny Kaye routine about the poisonous vessel with that elusive pestle was taken from Bob Hope's 1939 movie Never Say Die.Well no one claimed The Court Jester was original it's just very funny. As the song says it does end like a fairy tale though I do wonder just what became of Angela Lansbury. You might wonder that too when you see the film.".

He is in his element in this film with his rubbery face...his playfulness with accents but most of all his famous rapidfire recitation of lines full of alliteration and rhyme that would make lesser men spit and trip over their tongues.As an adult I continue to appreciate all of the elements that I grew up adoring but I have also come to understand the brilliance of the humor used throughout the script. A child might simply think it's all just fun which it is. But now I realize what an extraordinary effort the writers expended in producing such original and hilarious dialogue. The script is chockfull of oneliners...some of the most memorable quotes in movie history...and they weave wonderfully into a plausible storyline.With a cast as experienced and strong as Danny Kaye Basil Rathbone Angela Lansbury and Glynnis Johns such a terrific script and rich visuals you can't go wrong with this film whether you're 4 24 or 64!Now if we could just get more of Kaye's classics released on DVD!".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie when it was released in a large air conditioned movie theatrecinema house in India. I was about 15 years of age and was a big time Hollywood fan. When most of my class mates went to see dance and song numbers produced by Bollywood I would wait till Sunday to see one show presentations of Hollywood hits. The Court Jester was one of these and I rented it and viewed it with my wife last night after nearly 50 years. I remembered the extraordinary skill Danny Kaye showed as a swashbuckler and wanted to see it again. I have seen Basil Rathbone in the Adventures of Robin Hood and knew Basil was the best swordsman in cinema history but Danny made the fencing sequence more thrilling with his constant switch from a klutz to an adroit at the twinkling of an eye.I especially like the one minute sequence when Danny fences Basil while sipping wine with his left hand. What a delight. Those who like to see fencing skills of old Hollywood movie stars should see The Prisnoner of Zenda and Scaramouche where Stewart Granger did wonders with the foil fence. He was trained by an Olympic fencing champ and practiced so hard for these films he wore out several pairs of fencing shoes.".

	onyx:emotionText "I saw this movie when it was released in a large air conditioned movie theatrecinema house in India. I was about 15 years of age and was a big time Hollywood fan. When most of my class mates went to see dance and song numbers produced by Bollywood I would wait till Sunday to see one show presentations of Hollywood hits. The Court Jester was one of these and I rented it and viewed it with my wife last night after nearly 50 years. I remembered the extraordinary skill Danny Kaye showed as a swashbuckler and wanted to see it again. I have seen Basil Rathbone in the Adventures of Robin Hood and knew Basil was the best swordsman in cinema history but Danny made the fencing sequence more thrilling with his constant switch from a klutz to an adroit at the twinkling of an eye.I especially like the one minute sequence when Danny fences Basil while sipping wine with his left hand. What a delight. Those who like to see fencing skills of old Hollywood movie stars should see The Prisnoner of Zenda and Scaramouche where Stewart Granger did wonders with the foil fence. He was trained by an Olympic fencing champ and practiced so hard for these films he wore out several pairs of fencing shoes.";

It is one of the few films that can make people of all generations laugh through its ageless Robin Hood adventure story.Also take note of the beautiful Angela Landsbury in one of her earliest roles and Glynnis Johns who add the sparkle to this enjoyable film.

Danny Kaye is brilliant there is not a dull moment in the entire movie. It knows what it is and it blithely twists and turns through the dance of the plot which is a pretty complex thing in and of itself. Not to mention all of the great supporting actors and the great writing. It is a wholesome film it doesn't need to be malicious to be funny or to be naked and filled with sex. Modern film makers could learn quite a few lessons from this masterpiece.If you are into period however this ain't it it's interesting only as an idea of how the 1950s America saw the middle ages In gold polyester it seems.

He's the same here although the setting is now Medieval England and his character is mistaken for a court jester or at times for a Robin Hood figure called The Black Fox. The plot is too complicated and dumb to be detailed but the story is successful because of isolated almost incidental comic moments.The writers  Panama and Frank  must have had a good time dreaming up some of the gags. They don't stem organically from the plot or the characters. Let me put it this way. Some Like It Hot is a comedy from beginning to end. It has continuity. What's funny about it grows out of situations that seen in context look inevitable. The Court Jester has instead amusing scenes that aren't really anything much more than skits.There's no particular reason to introduce the hypnotic trance that transforms Kaye from a phony and a coward into a confidant warrior and passionate lover except that it's good for laughs. Ditto with the scenes of combat mortal. And WITHIN the combat scene Kaye's armor happens to be struck by lightning and magnetized leading to a few ludic incidents that are quickly thrown away when used up.That doesn't mean it's not a funny movie because it really is just about the equal of Kaye's best although it comes late in his oeuvre. He's ten years older than he was at his peak but it hasn't affected his playing or his appearance. There are several songs but no gibberish. Basil Rathbone as Lord Ravenhurst looks considerably more aged that he had when he played the same role with Errol Flynn on the other end of the swords. He's a less robust figure and a comic movie wouldn't suit him if he weren't the hammy heavy yet he's fit and dances around convincingly in his swordplay. Cecil Parker does well with his usual dithering persona. Glynnis Johns is magnificent a tiny buxom girl with the biggest blue eyes in the business. Angela Lansbury tosses off her part with panache as always. She's an extremely good actress.If there are any clichs in the genre of medieval movies you'll probably find them here. The battle between knights on horseback with mace and chain the good guys disguised as hooded monks the desperate struggle to lower the drawbridge the castle overrun by attacking midgets. Wait a minute. The castle overrun by attacking MIDGETS? Well okay  that's not exactly a perfect clich but if you've seen Robin Hood or The Flame and the Arrow you'll know what I mean.Some of the scenes are quite amusing. The hurried marching of Kaye through the ceremony in which he is knighted. The chalice with the palace is the brew that is true. The kids ought to get a kick out of it as mine did.".

Gunny Highway comes across as the exact fellow you would want covering your ass in any tough situation you could possibly imagine. And Eastwood plays him perfectly with steely resolve devotion humor and a healthy touch of irreverence. Its great to see the transformation of Highway's squad as well as the final moment of judgment for the totally hateful obnoxious and bureaucratic Maj. Powers. Oh if only such bds would get their deserved comeuppance in real life in such a manner what a beautiful world it would be!The only real fault is the attempt to compare a minor police action in Grenada with Vietnam and Korea I guess we're not 0 1 and 1 anymore. I mean give me a break Korea and Vietnam went on for years and killed millions! Grenada involved a couple of hundred casualties over a couple of days. Please! But I suppose in 1986 the American people were desperate for some kind of heroes. Its just that that kind of jingoism would have been much more appropriate after Desert Storm than Grenada.

	onyx:emotionText "Clint Eastwood is at his best in the role of Gunny Highway. This is mostly a really excellent flick about patriotic values military camaraderie and old grizzled military veterans. Gunny Highway comes across as the exact fellow you would want covering your ass in any tough situation you could possibly imagine. And Eastwood plays him perfectly with steely resolve devotion humor and a healthy touch of irreverence. Its great to see the transformation of Highway's squad as well as the final moment of judgment for the totally hateful obnoxious and bureaucratic Maj. Powers. Oh if only such bds would get their deserved comeuppance in real life in such a manner what a beautiful world it would be!The only real fault is the attempt to compare a minor police action in Grenada with Vietnam and Korea I guess we're not 0 1 and 1 anymore. I mean give me a break Korea and Vietnam went on for years and killed millions! Grenada involved a couple of hundred casualties over a couple of days. Please! But I suppose in 1986 the American people were desperate for some kind of heroes. Its just that that kind of jingoism would have been much more appropriate after Desert Storm than Grenada. That being said its still a very good movie with a fundamental message about values loyalty and comradeship that we could easily have more of these days besides Clint is just great!";

One must remember that the official pretext for invading Grenada back in the 1980s was the protection of American lives specifically 800 students at the US run St George's University of Medicine. In reality none of the students were in danger none wanted to leave and the invasion was actually designed to oust Maurice Bishop the people's revolutionary who rallied the islands few thousand inhabitants against Prime Minister Erich Gairy.

When all these rumours are debunked by journalists leading up to the invasion the major news chains refuse to air retractions. Meanwhile the CIA begins planting bombs at local rallies inadvertently kills several civilians and sets about trying to weaken the island's economy. This goes on for roughly 4 years.Prior to the invasion The CIA begins to sew discord in Bishop's Party. Bernard Coard Bishop's childhood friend and corevolutionary begins to break away from Bishop. Coard stages a coup and arrests Bishop but Bishop is set free by a crowd of some 10000 Grenadians all staunch supporters.

Obviously going into such dangerous ground means that all the invading soldiers are heroes. It is hard to drum up tension for such a mild finish. Did Clint Eastwood need to be such a tough drill sergeant to prepare his troops to do this? A few boy scouts with bad attitudes could handle this assignment. It is not necessary to have a war movie for every US conflict no matter how petty. Perhaps we need a scene where the soldiers debate bringing their bathing suits to use after the morning's fighting is done. Clint Eastwood did better working with monkeys.".

Obviously going into such dangerous ground means that all the invading soldiers are heroes. It is hard to drum up tension for such a mild finish. Did Clint Eastwood need to be such a tough drill sergeant to prepare his troops to do this? A few boy scouts with bad attitudes could handle this assignment. It is not necessary to have a war movie for every US conflict no matter how petty. Perhaps we need a scene where the soldiers debate bringing their bathing suits to use after the morning's fighting is done. Clint Eastwood did better working with monkeys.";

He would have been busted out of the Marine Corps if that happened. What he would have done is take his troops to a firing range and under controlled conditions fired the weapon down range. This is done often with units to familiarize them with the sound of enemy weapons.As for the accidental firing on the shooting range unlikely.

The script seems to be made up of a combination of terse smartass and cute oneliners all strung together. I'm not sure what Marine Corps is being depicted here but it sure isn't anything manufactured in the United States. I can't believe that the U.S. Marine Corps seriously considered using this movie as a promo for Toys for Tots until they heard the language. I suppose it's worth remembering that this was produced in 1986. The only thing that Mario Van Peebles was missing were the perfunctory warmup leggings when he was singing on stage.

A military movie based on a true short story of the conflict a 'Hostage' crisis in the faulklen Islands directed by the man himself Clint Eastwood. I remember thinking Eastwood's voice is at groundzero gravely and harsh but it sure fits the hell into this character Gunnery Sgt. Thomas ' Gunny ' Highway. I watched in amazement Clint is a dinosaur in this meanasnailsMarine film of hard driving male soldiers who live on the edge. They fight for their country beer women sports and of course the right to play rock  roll. As the over the top. 'Stitch Jones' Mario Van Peebles and his guitar is a cross between a rockstar and a used car salesman. It was just one of those poetic justice moments for me when Tom Highway runs into Stitch after being left behind on the gray hound Then there's Aponte a screwball and Profile a slacker with a desire to take it easy. Lance Corporal Fragatti a wiseguy with an attitude of wanting to do the army his way then Quinones a friend of all the above and maybe the biggest of the instigators! The irreverent Everett McGill as the adversary to Tom Highway Major Malcolm A Powers a regimented 'pain in the ass'. Thats right a regular government mule standing in the way of the working man's hero Highway. All together through rain mud hot 'LZ's' jungle fire fights  hostile terrorists and foreign lands to conquer in the desert heat no problem....it's Aggie that Tom cannot make surrender to him. With the Swede coming after him and the ever serious Moses Gunn as Staff sergeant Webster they all will have to bend their 'Will' to the Highway. He is a solid old warhorse that keeps on going till it's all done doing.The action was fun the cast of wilddogs and misfits is a perfect fit and this is another very well crafted Clintflick that works for me any day.

I'm a big fan of Clint Eastwood and I've seen all his movies. This is the only one I would label ROTTEN and sadly I give it 2 out of 10. Avoid at all costs.";

Instead of making good jokes and thoughtful humour the writers decided to just constantly send an endless stream of jokes at you and hoped one of them made you chuckle. This movie was truly atrocious. You would think after having their last two films be on the bottom 100 of this site the makers would say Lets try something different but no it is the exact same as Date Movie and Epic Movie Bad.".

	schema:reviewBody "The only reason I went to see this movie was because I knew it was going to be bad. That's obviously not a good reason but in retrospect some really bad movies are funny when thought about later. I've had chuckles about how bad Epic Movie was but this....this was different. Maybe it was the fact that half the audience was laughing at these awful jokes or the fact that this stupid monstrosity was even green lighted but after this ended I felt drained of my life. No movie has ever made me feel this way.Meet the Spartans has the sparse running time of 65 minutes not counting the lengthy end credits which was a blessing to the audience. The jokes all feel like ones that 9 year old boys would find hysterical where everyone else would just hate them. Other than spoof jokes every other joke is one involving pain. There were dozens of crotch hits and back breaks. There are also many gross out vomit sneezing and boil bursting jokes. There was one joke that had me mildly chuckling but then they killed the joke by over explaining it. It didn't need to be explained a monkey could understand it. Repetitiveness was the only word that comes to mind when watching this. King Leonidas knocks a messenger in the hole then his two men. Okay not funny but at least it's over....right? Nope. Then he knocks Sanjaya Brittany Spears Kevin Federline The American Idol judges and Ryan Seacrest in the hole. After the credits seem to be over deleted scenes are shown simply to make the movie more than 70 minutes. During the deleted scenes Dane Cook George W. Bush Tom Cruise and Ellen Degeneres are also knocked in the hole. The joke is done 10 times over.The two extremely untalented writers of this mess want to include every movie possible and mention every celebrity they can and include any show they can cram in. There are 3 instances of celebrity panels judging the Spartans in this and it's not like it was a running joke either. It was just lack of ideas. Much of the celebrity humor was just the celebrities pointing out their character traits. Paris Hilton who is in a few scenes but ultimately disappears with no point talks about her jail time. Brittany Spears acts crazy. Lindsey Lohan gets out of rehab. Tyra Banks shows her cellulite. And every other celebrity that is made fun of has the exact same role. Also there is a joke in poor taste. When Leonidas is going to be killed by a talking penguin it says Say hi to Anna Nicole Smith for me. These idiot writers are stooping as low as to make fun of people being dead? It's terrible. References to TV were thrown around usually making no sense and totally pointless. Ugly Betty is the oracle. Just plain stupid. The movies were also thrown about all over so people in the audience could say Duh I know what they're referencing. To give away a mild spoiler and one of the dumbest scenes in the movie Carmen Electra's character turns into Spiderman and she beats up the Sandman who is then pooped on by a cat. It made no sense why it was thrown in here. That's how I felt about pretty much every part of this movie though.Now back to myself. When the movie ended after just over an hour I had a headache and wondered how dumb some people truly are because nobody of any intelligence could've thought this was hilarious. But of course this is my opinion and warning don't see this movie! It will cause depression.My rating Possibly worst movie I've ever seen. 80 mins. PG13 for language sexual and crude humor.".

I was even more delighted when I saw the trailer. All too often comedy movie trailers contain all the best jokes leaving nothing funny for the actual movie. I knew this movie was going to be great when I saw the trailer and there wasn't ONE FUNNY BIT IN IT!!!!! Clearly these were film makers who did not need to advertise their greatness as they could rely on their genius to advertise itself. I knew we were going to experience a comedy masterpiece on par with Diff'rent Strokes Australia's Funniest Home Videos or Michael Jackson's cosmetic surgery.I set up camp outside the box office 2 days before tickets went on sale to be sure we got the first tickets accompanied after a sound thrashing by my wife and my little boy. For two days and nights we struggled on that lonely sidewalk against hunger and thirst and heat and exposure and towards the end we had to resort to drinking our own urine. But it was worth it because when Meet the Spartans finally opened we were the only people in the cinema.And what a movie it was! My own memories are a little hazy given the addled state I was in after two days in the street. For my own part I was laughing and hollering too much at the little purple animals floating around in the cinema to notice much of the movie. I do remember bits of the trailer getting repeated over and over again but that must have been the hallucinations as well. However I do remember my wife and my little boy found it so funny they were too astonished to laugh. After a while the exertions of the previous 2 days took their toll and they fell asleep with their precious heads lolling into my unwashed groin. But shoot I wasn't complaining  All in all it was probably the greatest day of my life and perhaps anyone's life.I was delighted to learn that there was a Meet the Spartans 2. If there was one film crying out for a sequel it must surely be this one. As with Weekend at Bernie's you just got the feeling that one movie was not enough to fully explore the vast richness of ideas on display. One can only hope it will produce more sequels than the Star Wars and the Police Academy series combined.".

I will not rule out possibilities of getting it on DVD though. It has some funny moments but not all that funny. Some parts that were supposed to be funny never got a laugh out of anyone in the theater while some made everyone giggle in the least.As far as acting is concerned It is unlikely that anyone would be expecting Oscarwinning acting off such a film. Suffice to say when asked for the actors deliver a fulfilling act. The problem is not with the actors. It is with the script. Every other scene I would go I could have made this soo much funnier. So yeah there we have it. But overall I would say I liked this better than Epic Movie and Date Movie. Nowhere near the scary movies though.So bottom line do not waste your time and money watching this in the theaters. Wait for it on DVD or Star Movies. On a plus side Mad TV fans like me will enjoy the antiques of Nicole Parker in the film.".

But I have to admit that when it had it's TV spots it was starting to look bad but my boyfriend and I still saw it last night just to see maybe if it still had some laughs. Now while I'm still disappointed in most of the movie there were a few good laughs I think. It was made pretty badly but I think most spoof movies are made that way since they don't have a sense of reality so I'll be kind on that subject. Plus the movie in general was weird they took on the movie 300 fully like reshot the entire film and just added their own jokes on TV movies pop culture and random things.Leonidas has just been made king of Sparta and his world is rocking with his bombshell wife Queen Margo and life couldn't be better. But when he is challenged by the Persians he must protect Sparta with well only 8 guys. But hoping that they will survive they go into a battle of stomping the yard talking smack and even having to deal with some transformers. Leonidas is getting more and more steamed though as he realizes that the blue screen Persians may be too much for he and his team can handle.Meet the Spartans had some really funny moments like I loved and nearly died laughing when the Spartans were leaving their country and they left hand in hand singing I will Survive it was so stupid I know but if you let go and have fun I'm sure you'll laugh too. But there were things I was disappointed in like the constant potty humor it would be nice if the writers grew past the second grade level humor. There was some jokes that were predictable and used too many times in other spoofs. But over all this was definitely better than Epic Movie or Date Movie. If you go to see this there are a few laughs but don't expect the best comedy of the year.410".

I would have walked out of the movie had it not been for my friend watching it with me.The movie itself is full scenes loosely strung together unfunny dialog and editing that makes me wonder if Windows Movie Maker was used. Just from the opening scene there was a vomit joke with magic vomit that disappeared the second the angle changed and lip syncing that made a Brittany Spears concert look impressive.Also included in the movie was Carmen Electra the walking eye candy for their 13 year old boy target demographic. Most of the scenes she was in involved the camera focusing on her breasts or her walking around in revealing clothing.After going to battle there was little direction to the movie and they seemed to just wander around trying to make as many references to pop culture with as little humor as possible.The remainder of the jokes involved either product placement or homosexuality. The product placement became so frequent throughout the movie that I began to wonder if they were even making fun of it anymore.Most of these attempts at comedy were poorly received by the audience save a few children who also had to scream out eww whenever the Spartans stood in a provocative position in their revealing clothing.The movie ended quite abruptly with all Leonidas and his Spartans killed and the blind incompetent spartan inadvertently running away. It ended with the cast singing I Will Survive for the second time on an American Idol stage and finally ending the torment of watching the movie.Overall I would not recommend anyone viewing this movie. The whole thing looked like it was quickly filmed and edited the month before it was released and contained barely any humor.".

The film produced by Arnon Milchan is awfully directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. The motion picture will appeal to vulgar humor enthusiasts and stupid comedy buffs. Rating  Bottom of barrel  a real turkey.";

There was really nothing else in the videostore so I decided to rent it. Boy am I glad I did. I really appreciated the movie and related to it after all I do go to a Catholic High School. 'The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' is actually a great comingofage tale set in the Catholic school setting of the 1970s. Just by reading the title I thought it was about pedophile Catholic priests or something but it's really about two friends who are the altar boys at their churchschool and their adventures as they discover what's life is all about... or their interpretation of it.The two boys in 'The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' are Francis Doyle Emile Hirsch  The Girl Next Door The Emperor's Club and Michael Sullivan Kieran Culkin  Igby Goes Down Home Alone. They are two fifteen year old rebels that have a passion for comics and writing and illustrating their own. They despise their toughasnails and strict onelegged Catholic nun school teacher Sister Assumpta played by Two Time Academy Award Winner Jodie Foster  The Accused The Silence of the Lambs. The two boys make themselves their own creative superheroes in their comic and have Sister Assumpta be the evil motorcycle peddling nun from hell that the two superheroes battle along with the boys' other two friends who provide superheroes for their comic too. The film switches from reallife to the creative comic book setting during conflicts in the story and I think that it's done very stylish and neat. The two boys rebel against their teacher and misbehave in front of her constantly especially Michael Culkin who drives her absolutely nuts. The boys rebel by doing other things that the nun doesn't know about like drink smoke pot and steal and damage church property. The film contains some funny moments and as the story unfolds Francis Hirsch becomes interested in the girl who lives next door to him Margie Jena Malone  Saved! Cold Mountain a cool nice beautiful and independent girl with a deep and dark secret that challenges Francis. I won't give it away though.There are many great aspects to this film. Most notably is the acting. Emile Hirsch is nothing short of incredible as the genuine misfit Francis and Jena Malone is equally as good as the sweet yet complex Margie. Jodie Foster is hysterical and always a pleasure to watch as the uptight Catholic school nun and 'Law  Order Criminal Intent's' Vincent D'Onofrio has a somewhat small role as an interesting Catholic school priest who smokes like a chimney. The standout of the film however is Kieran Culkin. He is definitely the most talented performer in his family and he gives an astounding performance as Michael Sullivan that puts him on the top of the list of the best child actors working in Hollywood currently. Culkin gave an equally amazing performance in Burr Steer's neurotic and darkly hilarious film debut 'Igby Goes Down' which was released the same year as 'The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys'. Peter Care does a fabulous job with this his feature film debut and the valley's Todd MacFarlane creator of Spawn provides the comic book illustration for the animated scenes. All in all this is a great comingofage movie with a lot of heart and intelligence. It has some flaws like dragging a little towards the beginning being a little unclear towards the end and having some freaky and unnecessary ghost sequence towards the middle of the film. I'd recommend this to anyone who attends Catholic High School because it is a great movie but it's also something you could relate to. Next time you are at the videostore and can't find anything to watch maybe pick up 'The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys'. Chances are you won't regret it. Grade BMADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT 245".

He and his pals Tim Wade and Joey cope with life under the oppressive rule of onelegged nun Sister Assumpta Jodie Foster at the Puritan Christian high school they're unfortunate enough to attend. One of their methods of escape is the 'The Atomic Trinity' comic book. Each of them have their own character with superpowers such as The Muscle Captain Asskicker and Skeleton Boy battling against the tyrannical regime of NunzillaPegleg a gross caricature of Sister Assumpta. These fantasy stories make up the terrific animated sequences of the film. The cool thing is that they are not so totally removed from the reality of Francis Tim Wade and Joey.The boys soon find their way into a lot of trouble though. After stealing the school's nun statue mascot the quartet plan to steal a cougar from the zoo and put in Sister Assumpta's office. A mad plan yes but their determination and invention behind it is very clever.Some scenes of the film are very emotional so if you have soft spot you'll find it tough to get through the scene where Tim finds a dying dog by the side of the road or Francis reading a poem at the funeral.Francis' relationship with Margie the very cute Jenna Malone also takes many curious and unique turns. The scene with the ghost watching them sleep was pleasingly weird. Taken from the one and only book posthumously by Chris Fuhrman a book I must get as soon as I see The Dangerous Lives of Alter Boys is attractively shot wonderfully acted and definitely worth getting.The DVD is in 1.851 widescreen strangely nonanamorphic though the region 2 version is with Dolby 5.1 sound and a mild bunch of extras.".

	schema:headline " Live Dangerously! spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys is based on the bildungsroman novel by Chris Furhman who unfortunately died of cancer during the revision of his novel which was later published by a friend. Judging by the last chapter although it is narrated from the first person point of view of Francis Doyle I assume that the novel is based on Fuhrman's own actual childhood experiences and developed into a comic book of the same title. Unfortunately while both the novel and the movie are quite good the movie lacks some of the structure as well as more significant yet controversial images than does the film for obvious reasons on this latter pointthey are catering to younger audiences and preteen sex doesn't go over well with your always alert conservative censors. Likewise the novel which is set in Savannah circa 1970 and deals with heated issues of racism and our characters recognition of the fallacies of generalization. It was risqu enough to develop a movie which contains among its characters a young school girl who has not only engaged in an incestial relationship but also attempted suicide. This is the story of four boys in at Blessed Heart a Catholic School for Boys. Francis Doyle Emile Hirsch and Tim Sullivan Kieran Culkin are figures that model Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn although Francis is ruled by considerably fewer rules than Tom's Aunt Polly reserved for her own boy. Tim Sullivan is the inspiration for the gang living the credo that danger and trouble is their only defense against boredom. Partly their only defense against the absurd rules of society and the meaningless ritual of adults our character Tim is of the Holden Caufield variety is a comic book The Atomic Trinity which the friends create which parallels their various comingofage experiences with pranks and first love and so forth. Part of the screen time is shared with animated scenes of our comic book heroes at work. Francis and Tim seem to differ on their goals however. For Tim his goal is the revolt against Sister Assumpta Jodi Foster who embodies most of the absurd rules as head of the Catholic School. For example she is the one who confiscates Tim's copy of a book by William Blake I think it was called 'The Creation' and as such is seen as an unruly censor. Tim is out to defy that absurdity. His character is the bildungsromane type more Francis. His character is much smarter much more aware of his surroundings. But sadly it is all he is focused on. As you see in the comic book scenes he is the hero who is only concerned with bringing down the flaming skull which is actually Sister Assumpta. Blessed Heart represents everything finds wrong with the world around him.Francis too may be disgusted with the hypocrisy of the Catholic teachings and Blessed Heart in general but his disgust with the world and likewise his concern is Margie Flynn Jena Malone his first true love. Flynn is an utterly sad character in a film where you might just expect boyhood pranks on unsuspecting authority. Flynn is a young quiet girl who attempted to kill herself because she thought she was going crazy and hated herself for an incestial relationship she carried on with her brother. Francis through his real actions and through his comic book hero image tries to rescue the frail Margie Flynn. She is the girl he is forever in love with and her frailty may in part be part of the oppression he sees like Tim. They don't tell much about her parents or brother in the movie but in the novel they are divorced and Donnie Flynn is a real sadistic creep at least towards Francis and the other boys. Margie Flynn is really a difficult character to endure particularly for younger audiences considering the circumstances. The story starts out like another 'Heaven Help Us' type only more intellectual and much funnier of Catholic School boys run amuck but the introduction of Margie's character puts a weird spin about things. I'm not sure that they developed her character enough for this movie although much of the focus within the FlynnDoyle relationship was on Francis and not really Margie. Maybe if Emile Hirsch didn't always act so spaced out all the time this aspect of the story might've been more effective. Meanwhile when the four boys's comic book is confiscated by Sister Assumpta the boys Tim in particular get the idea that they're going to get retaliation on Blessed Heart and in particular Sister Assumpta amongst all other things that they think need revolting against in that William Blake revolutionary sense that Tim abides by by releasing a panther in the novel it was just a bobcat into the school.

	onyx:emotionText "The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys is based on the bildungsroman novel by Chris Furhman who unfortunately died of cancer during the revision of his novel which was later published by a friend. Judging by the last chapter although it is narrated from the first person point of view of Francis Doyle I assume that the novel is based on Fuhrman's own actual childhood experiences and developed into a comic book of the same title. Unfortunately while both the novel and the movie are quite good the movie lacks some of the structure as well as more significant yet controversial images than does the film for obvious reasons on this latter pointthey are catering to younger audiences and preteen sex doesn't go over well with your always alert conservative censors. Likewise the novel which is set in Savannah circa 1970 and deals with heated issues of racism and our characters recognition of the fallacies of generalization. It was risqu enough to develop a movie which contains among its characters a young school girl who has not only engaged in an incestial relationship but also attempted suicide. This is the story of four boys in at Blessed Heart a Catholic School for Boys. Francis Doyle Emile Hirsch and Tim Sullivan Kieran Culkin are figures that model Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn although Francis is ruled by considerably fewer rules than Tom's Aunt Polly reserved for her own boy. Tim Sullivan is the inspiration for the gang living the credo that danger and trouble is their only defense against boredom. Partly their only defense against the absurd rules of society and the meaningless ritual of adults our character Tim is of the Holden Caufield variety is a comic book The Atomic Trinity which the friends create which parallels their various comingofage experiences with pranks and first love and so forth. Part of the screen time is shared with animated scenes of our comic book heroes at work. Francis and Tim seem to differ on their goals however. For Tim his goal is the revolt against Sister Assumpta Jodi Foster who embodies most of the absurd rules as head of the Catholic School. For example she is the one who confiscates Tim's copy of a book by William Blake I think it was called 'The Creation' and as such is seen as an unruly censor. Tim is out to defy that absurdity. His character is the bildungsromane type more Francis. His character is much smarter much more aware of his surroundings. But sadly it is all he is focused on. As you see in the comic book scenes he is the hero who is only concerned with bringing down the flaming skull which is actually Sister Assumpta. Blessed Heart represents everything finds wrong with the world around him.Francis too may be disgusted with the hypocrisy of the Catholic teachings and Blessed Heart in general but his disgust with the world and likewise his concern is Margie Flynn Jena Malone his first true love. Flynn is an utterly sad character in a film where you might just expect boyhood pranks on unsuspecting authority. Flynn is a young quiet girl who attempted to kill herself because she thought she was going crazy and hated herself for an incestial relationship she carried on with her brother. Francis through his real actions and through his comic book hero image tries to rescue the frail Margie Flynn. She is the girl he is forever in love with and her frailty may in part be part of the oppression he sees like Tim. They don't tell much about her parents or brother in the movie but in the novel they are divorced and Donnie Flynn is a real sadistic creep at least towards Francis and the other boys. Margie Flynn is really a difficult character to endure particularly for younger audiences considering the circumstances. The story starts out like another 'Heaven Help Us' type only more intellectual and much funnier of Catholic School boys run amuck but the introduction of Margie's character puts a weird spin about things. I'm not sure that they developed her character enough for this movie although much of the focus within the FlynnDoyle relationship was on Francis and not really Margie. Maybe if Emile Hirsch didn't always act so spaced out all the time this aspect of the story might've been more effective. Meanwhile when the four boys's comic book is confiscated by Sister Assumpta the boys Tim in particular get the idea that they're going to get retaliation on Blessed Heart and in particular Sister Assumpta amongst all other things that they think need revolting against in that William Blake revolutionary sense that Tim abides by by releasing a panther in the novel it was just a bobcat into the school. By doing so they would be declared the local legends of danger. This is going to be their mark of importance. This is when each of the boys start questioning their loyalty to this unofficial pact of a crusade for danger. Francis and Tim the closet of the four friends too start questioning just how far they're willing to go because their idea of importance changes. For Tim it's all or nothing. For Francis he's second guessing just how easy and necessary such a prank would be and also is meanwhile wrapped up in his own little world with Margie Flynn.This is one of those comingofage films with young characters who have a heightened sense of selfawareness and such in the style of 'Stand by Me' and hell even 'Fandango' and so forth.

	schema:reviewBody "Young boys growing up and experiencing life while going to a Catholic school is a fairly familiar story and when it ends I asked myself if this film had anything new to offer. It doesn't but there are some effective moments and performances that keep this from being a total disappointment. Story takes place in the 1970's at a Catholic school called St. Agatha's and four young boys are the central characters. Francis Doyle Emile Hirsch and Tim Sullivan Kieran Culkin are best friends along with Wade Jake Richardson and Joey Tyler Long and the four of them pull preposterous pranks against their school and also collaborate on a comic book story that is called The Atomic Trinity. At school they are constantly being criticized by Sister Assumpta Jodie Foster who is a very strict nun and one night they decide to steal a statue from the school and instantly they are suspected of the crime. Francis starts to date Margie Flynn Jena Malone and they get along very well until she confides in him a very dark secret.SPOILER ALERTMargie tells Francis that she had an incestuous relationship with her brother and now he is unsure about how to continue dating her. He asks Father Casey Vincent D'Onofrio for some advice but doesn't get the answer that he is seeking. Meanwhile Tim has devised a plan on tranquilizing a cougar and putting into Sister Assumpta's room but during this prank something horrible occurs.This film is directed by Peter Care who has directed many music video's but this is his first effort with anything resembling a budget. Care does an adequate job of telling this story but the script lacks conviction in both plot and character development. Culkin is the king of all pranks and clearly doesn't take what is taught to him in school seriously but in one scene while carrying a dying dog he starts to yell about this animal not being cared for. This reveals a dark part of his persona but the script never dwells into it and we are left wondering about this part of him. The part of the plot about Malone and her brother seems a bit overwrought for the mood and tone and I never had a sense of what this film was trying to say. A film like American Graffiti could balance both comedy and drama but one of the flaws here is that this film does not do that well at all. Both Hirsch and Culkin are solid and Malone continues to show great promise but the script lacks focus with their roles in correlation with the rest of the film. Foster for the most part plays her part one dimensionally and uninspired and seems to just go along with what was written for her without developing the character for her own. The only originality comes from the film balancing both the live action and the animated sequences and it does a fairly good job of reflecting their inner most fantasies through their comic book stories. The films comedy isn't as humorous as Heaven Help Us and it also doesn't possess the dark tone and edge of The Devil's Playground. This film attempts an emotional ending but with the lack of focus and conviction in the story it doesn't occur.".

The good news is this comingofage tale revolving around the themes of first love and adolescent mischief remains faithful to its source while expanding successfully I think upon what was written in the book.  This worked very well in Terry Zwigoff's Ghost World but there are times in The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys where the tone threatens to go from comedydrama to flatout drama to flatout comedy.  It always manages to regain its balance though.  The story revolves around Francis Doyle Emile Hirsch and Tim Sullivan Kieran Culkin who's very good altar boys with a comicbook fixation and a resentment of authority represented here by Jodie Foster's peglegged Mother Superior also on hand is Francis' love interest Margie Jena Malone who reveals herself to be a complicated tragic figure.As far as revisiting adolescence is concerned The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys is accurate funny and even sad.  However it suffers from an overemphasis on closeups during key dramatic scenes and the lead performance of Emile Hirsch is surprisingly weak when he emotes it looks exaggerated and fake.  Overall though this is pretty good.  3.5 stars out of 5.".

This was without a doubt the most disappointing moviegoing experience of my life. Kiernan Culkin and Malone both turned in good performances but the movie was lacking in too many areas to mention them all. Bottom line read the book or rent this movie in a few months if you can find it only to admire Jena Malone and the fairly interesting animation from that guy who did Spawn. The character interaction was horrible the story was muddled and unrealistic and what was an amazing novel is now a pointless movie...I've been wanting to make a film out of this book for years and now its been done and destroyed. It's a damn travesty if I've ever seen one.".

For the guy who wondered in his review about Tim and Francis' home lives let's just say that Francis' parents are WAY more disfunctional in the book than in the movie.

The casting was uneven especially in casting Foster herself in the role of the villian.  Having played too many protagonists or victimheroes to ever be believable as an antagonist this fact really pulled me out of the story each time Foster appeared.  I couldn't quite reconcile seeing her in a nun's wimple and playing a stereotypical bad nun.  On the other hand the casting of Emile Hirsch as Francis Kieran Culkin as his best friend Tim and the unrecognizable Vincent D'Onofrio as Father Casey was brilliant.  The interspersed segments of animation were disruptive rather than helpful to the story and the plot itself seemed to meander too much without ever coming to a conclusive whole.  While I admire that this novel was made into a film it could've been done much much better.  Some books are better left as books.".

The plan of course goes awry. What is interesting in this film besides watching Culkin Hirsch and Foster working their usual magic is the complexity of theme going on behind the adolescent antics. The film looks at the purpose of fantasy the meaning of faith the dangers of testing boundaries the unpleasantness of unfinished business the nature of God and the question of how one interprets His authority. The question of original sin never clumsily and straightforwardly stated permeates the film from Margie's awful revelations to Tim's mischief. The film's real genius is its ability to play with obviously religious ideas without really doing any preaching.Behind all this of course is the Viet Nam war. As America loses its postWWII innocence at the end of the 1960s and as the flowerpower generation realises that breaking the boundaries that authority sets ultimately breaks much more so the boys learn what happens when people want to take God's power. When Tim Sullivan tells his teacher that William Blake's poetry is written simply enough for a child she responds with so are the instructions for a handgun.".

The highlight of the movie is the outstanding performances delivered by youngsters Emile Hirsch Kieran Culkin and Jena Malone whom you might remember as the young Jodie Foster in Contact.'  In fact Foster herself appears in this film in addition to coproducing it as the uptight nun Sister Assumpta.  Unfortunately her character is probably the least well developed one in the film a fact that seems more obvious than it otherwise might if an actress of Foster's caliber were not playing the part.The film also displays a nice feeling for its early70's setting and does a good job capturing the way young people actually speak and communicate the cast members have their nonverbal expressions and gestures down beautifully as well.  Working from the novel by Chris Fuhrman screenwriters Jeff Stockwell and Michael Petroni along with director Peter Care interrupt the live action at regular intervals to provide animated sequences that are ostensibly derived from the anarchic superhero comic book on which the gifted boys are collaborating.  We know that these sequences are intended to provide a kind of fantasy alternate universe for these troubled kids who seem to find no meaning in the restricted world of religion and rules in which they find themselves but the fact is that these sections of the film not very creative in themselves merely serve to thrust us out of the story at crucial moments.The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' is an odd and somewhat misleading title for this film since most of the danger' these boys face is primarily a product of their own stupidity and not of their religious upbringing. Indeed the religious figures in the film are mainly cranky andor ineffectual not really dangerous.  The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' is an uneven film but the superb performances by its youthful cast members make it ultimately worth seeing.".

Unfortunately her character is probably the least well developed one in the film a fact that seems more obvious than it otherwise might if an actress of Foster's caliber were not playing the part.The film also displays a nice feeling for its early70's setting and does a good job capturing the way young people actually speak and communicate the cast members have their nonverbal expressions and gestures down beautifully as well.  Working from the novel by Chris Fuhrman screenwriters Jeff Stockwell and Michael Petroni along with director Peter Care interrupt the live action at regular intervals to provide animated sequences that are ostensibly derived from the anarchic superhero comic book on which the gifted boys are collaborating.  We know that these sequences are intended to provide a kind of fantasy alternate universe for these troubled kids who seem to find no meaning in the restricted world of religion and rules in which they find themselves but the fact is that these sections of the film not very creative in themselves merely serve to thrust us out of the story at crucial moments.The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' is an odd and somewhat misleading title for this film since most of the danger' these boys face is primarily a product of their own stupidity and not of their religious upbringing. Indeed the religious figures in the film are mainly cranky andor ineffectual not really dangerous.  The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' is an uneven film but the superb performances by its youthful cast members make it ultimately worth seeing.";

Also there is Francis's best friend TimKieran Culkin who is always by his side and with them two together it's double trouble. I really enjoyed this movie i think it potrayed adolescence well and the acting was very great by the young actors. Also there is a very great performance by Jodie Foster who plays Sister Assumpta. I would give Dangerous Lives Of Altar Boys 910".

Since this was the kind of life Sinatra really had it sure isn't an acting stretch for him. Still Sinatra plays this thing very well. Of course everyone has beauties like Celeste Holm Lola Albright Jarma Lewis and Carolyn Jones around. They all got a piece of old Blue Eyes.In steps new client Debbie Reynolds the 1950s all time good girl and she's not tolerating Frank's wolfish ways. She's got marriage on the mind.It's an interesting commentary on the times that back in the 1950s the ultimate goal for a woman was the house with the white picket fence husband and three kids. Even for one as obviously talented as Debbie Reynolds.Sinatra's also got a male guest in the house childhood friend David Wayne who blew in from Indiana and has announced his intention of getting in on Sinatra's action. He's left his wife home and three kids and is having an early midlife crisis. I think you can figure the rest of the plot from here.One thing the play on Broadway didn't have was that wonderful title tune that James Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn wrote. Sinatra opens the film with that song before the title credits and Reynolds later sings it in the film. I remember what a megahit it was for Frank back in the day. So perfectly suited for him and his style. All I can say is Ringading ding ding.Frank and Debbie do well together too bad they never made another film together. The following year she made one with her husband Eddie Fisher and the demand for the team was underwhelming.Everyone but especially Sinatra aficionados should love this one.".

Wrong this is one of the most disappointing misfires of the 1950s due largely to the lack of chemistry between Frank Sinatra and Debbie Reynolds. The problem is largely due to the Reynold's character which is so poorly written.  Even the perky Reynolds can do nothing with this part. Fortunately she is off camera for most of the film. Unfortunately that means there is no payoff for the film. If you must watch it you will enjoy David Wayne and Celeste Holm. Otherwise don't expect much.".

Instead of playing the eternally naive heartthrob that the bobbysoxers supposedly enjoyed but is actually quite annoying in films like ANCHORS AWEIGH he found that his sophistication could carry a better style of comedy. Ahead of him was HIGH SOCIETY OCEAN'S ELEVEN COME BLOW YOUR HORN ROBIN AND THE SEVEN HOODS where he was usually in control of the situations rather than pulled about by mechanical plot twists based on his stupidity. And THE TENDER TRAP is an early example of this switch.Sinatra's Charlie Reader is a successful talent agent and his success is mirrored in his apartment facing the 59th Street Bridge in Manhattan and his colorful lifestyle of a different date with a different woman Celeste Holms Lola Albright Caroline Jones and Jarma Lewis every night. His trade comment of A ringadingding is not voiced here but it could easily be said. Like his character of the older brother in COME BLOW YOUR HORN he is inviting an old childhood pal like his younger brother in the later film named Joe McCall David Wayne. But the younger brother in the later film is intoxicated by the glamor of Sinatra's lifestyle. Eventually the younger brother actually makes Sinatra ashamed of his own lifestyle as the younger brother takes it to extremes. Here Wayne is in the middle of a midlife crisis and he's actually hoping to enjoy Sinatra's lifestyle but as the film progresses gradually realizes that Sinatra's habits mistreat many women. Sinatra may be a great swinger but he is something of a sexual pig.But Frank's lifestyle is beginning to show cracks. In COME BLOW YOUR HOME it was a matter of his aging Lee J. Cobb fuming that he's a bum because he's unmarried and approaching 40. Here it is his meeting a young actress named Julie Gillis Debbie Reynolds that he starts dating. Sinatra looks at Julie at least at first as just another lady on his weekly list. But he slowly finds he does not want her to consider his other girlfriends and he also wants her to be available to him. But his interest is tempered when he discovers she is only interested in him dating her and only her...with the intention of only marrying her.Sinatra goes crazy here  not babbling but losing his cool thoroughly. He tries to forget her quickly by picking up one of the other regular girls only to find that Jones has met a fellow who is going to marry her and Albright has another regular date. Holms as Sylvia Crewes shows up. Oddly enough she is willing to accept the one sided dating system that Sinatra has chosen because she is aware that she is now 33 and the chances of getting a fellow to marry her are quite rare. She lists the types to Wayne and none are very appetizing. Sinatra proposes marriage to a shocked Holms who somewhat shakily agrees. Sinatra decides to throw a huge party even inviting his other occasional date Lewis to it. But in the middle of getting the party under way he runs downstairs and smack into Reynolds. She decides she loves him despite his selfishness but he announces that he loves her as well...and proposes to her. She heads home promising to see her fianc in the morning and he proceeds to wonder what to do now that he's affianced to two women.It turns out to be a disaster but it is deserved. I won't go into the rest of the plot but things do work out. It is nice to see Tom Hellmore soon to be the notorious Elstin Draper in VERTIGO in a far nicer role her. Also the conclusion of the film with the now standard Jimmy Van Husen theme song being sung by Sinatra Reynolds Holms and Wayne with a sorrowful chorus of Albright Lewis and Jones bears comparison to the singing by Cameron Diaz and her three bridesmaids at the start of MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING for being so fresh and unexpected. It was a top notch comedy and another step upward for Sinatra in the rebuilding and expansion of his film career.".

The message of the movie is that people cannot avoid their biological destiny...that they are happily doomed to meet and mate. Fair enough. That's been the premise of many a great screwball comedy and many great movie romances. The problem here is that everything is so predictable! There are no pleasant surprises in the characters here. All of the performers seem willing and able but the script and direction are uninspired. The character played by Debbie is meant to be as cute as a button but is only annoying and Frank never appears genuinely smitten. Even Franks's rendition of the title tune seems careful and sedate. Our couple here seemed destined for a very dull life in the suburbs. Of course this may have been an image of love and marriage that American popular entertainment was trying to sell really hard in the fifties. Safe and yawn inducing.".

The other is actress Celeste Holm who plays Sylvia Crewes a beautiful and mature woman of the same age as her good friend Charlie. Who will Charlie decide to marry?

Joe also seems to be going through a midlife crisis and so he starts falling for one of Charlie's love interests. The many confusing relationships will periodically be broken up by a song and dance number simply to remind the audience to not take these many relationships too seriously and I didn't.

	schema:reviewBody "'The Tender Trap' had a lot going for it namely with the casting of Frank Sinatra Debbie Reynolds my main reason in seeing the film in tribute to her David Wayne and Celeste Holm. Charles Walters has also had his share of solid films.And that is what 'The Tender Trap' is a solid film. This said it is not going to appeal to everybody and considering the high calibre of talent it could easily have been great. It's pleasant it's charming it's wellperformed and it's well made it just needed more spice and tenderness with it feeling a little bland in places.It is lacking in the romantic department and is uneven in the comedy. There is a lack of chemistry between Sinatra and Reynolds their chemistry is clinical and not particularly warm and one never gets the sense that they are in love partly because of the character and writing that Reynolds has to work with but it was like she and Sinatra didn't get on.Reynolds' role and material don't play to her strengths an example of a normally adorable and very bubbly screen presence that captivates in charm made to look stiff and annoying. The script is uneven it sparkles with the supporting cast especially with Celeste Holm but falls flat with Reynolds the wittier moments not always being sharp enough.However Walters does do a competent job directing and 'The Tender Trap' is filmed with real elegance with the production values in general being sumptuous and charmingly 50s for someone who really likes 50s production values the look of the film was in no way a flaw. One of 'The Tender Trap's' biggest pleasures is the timeless title song beautifully and intimately staged and after hearing Sinatra sing it with such impeccable control and phrasing and his unmistakable timbre one cannot imagine the song sung by anybody else other than him. The music overall fits beautifully.While the writing is uneven there are parts that do sparkle in a witty way there are a few poignant moments and while some of what it has to say does not hold up now and may not be in the best of taste for some for me those parts illuminated still. The story charms a good deal and doesn't bore.Sinatra is perfectly cast and has endearing charisma. The supporting cast are even better especially incandescently classy Celeste Holm and hilarious David Wayne the morningafter scene is an absolute joy. A preMorticia Addams Carolyn Jones is also notable.On the whole charming and pleasant but could have been better. 710 Bethany Cox".

Reader Frank Sinatra is a theatrical agent and confirmed bachelor who lives in an elegant Manhattan penthouse complete with hot and cold running women parading in and out of the place 247 much to the shock and jealousy of Charlie's best friend Joe David Wayne who has come to New York from Indianapolis after leaving his wife. Joe finds himself attracted to Sylvia Celeste Holm who only has eyes for Charlie.Enter Julie Gillis Debbie Reyolds a young wannabe actress who gets cast in a show that Charlie is involved in but acting is just a timefiller for Julie. Julie wants to be a wife and a mother and knows exactly what kind of man she wants how many children she wants and where they will all live and won't even sign a run of the play contract for the show because she's afraid show business might interfere with her plan but that's nothing compared to the fight she has to put up to keep Charlie at arm's length who stands for everything that Julie is against.Adapted from a stage play by Max Schulman and Robert Paul Smith Julius J. Epstein's screenplay does contain some dated elements but the screenplay does offer some surprising adult touches I really didn't see coming...the fact that Joe falls in love with Sylvia and actually proposes to her even though he technically is still married had to be a bit of an eyeopener in 55 not to mention the fact that Charlie actually proposes to two different women in a 24 hour period. We see from the opening frames that Charlie is a player and in the beginning he claims to hate it even though it's clear that he doesn't. Charlie does slimy things during the course of the story but one thing I noticed is that he never actually lies to anyone which I found refreshing for a romantic comedy.Charlie is not in this alone though...none of these characters had time to polish their halos they all make wrong moves at one point or another causing some very tangled relationships which has been the genesis for classic romantic comedy forever and though the characters do wrong we see where it's coming from and we forgive.Sinatra has rarely been as charming and sexy as he was here and Reynolds proved to be a surprisingly solid leading lady for him despite their difference in age which is addressed in the screenplay and they get brilliant support from Holm and Wayne in the second leads. Carolyn Jones and Lola Albreight are decorative as members of Charlie's harem and the film features a fantastic title song by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Husen that received an Oscar nomination for Best Song. Lovers of classic romantic comedy don't have to look any further than here for some silly sexy fun.".

	schema:headline " On the Boundary between Gothic Horror and Swashbuckling Adventure";
	schema:reviewBody "It is a long time since I read J Meade Falkner's novel but I remember enough of it to realise that this film bears little resemblance to it. Around the middle of the eighteenth century John Mohune the young son of a oncewealthy but now ruined aristocratic family is sent after the death of his parents to stay with Jeremy Fox the squire of the Dorset village of Moonfleet. Before her marriage to a cousin Fox was the lover of John's mother but they were prevented from marrying by the opposition of her family who thought he was neither wealthy nor wellborn enough for her. As the fortunes of the Mohunes have declined however so those of Fox have risen and he is now the wealthiest man in the village living in their ancestral mansion.Fox takes a liking to the boy and a friendship grows up between them. Unknown to John however Fox is not the respectable country gentleman he appears. His main source of wealth is his involvement in the lucrative but highly illegal smuggling trade and he has plans to go into partnership with Lord Ashwood a local nobleman in a venture which involves plundering foreign ships and which effectively falls little short of piracy. The debonair Fox is also something of a ladies man with at least two mistresses one of whom denounces him to the authorities when he tires of her. The main plot concerns Fox and John's search for a longlost diamond which had once belonged to one of the Mohune family.Moonfleet has similarities to Treasure Island although it is set in Britain rather than on a remote tropical island. The relationship between the likable rogue Fox a name presumably chosen because of its connotations of cunning and young John parallels that between Long John Silver and Jim Hawkins. The film has been aptly described as situated on the boundary between a traditional cape and sword adventure and a Gothic horror movie. The style of acting is more that of the swashbuckling adventure. Stewart Granger taking over where Errol Flynn left off made something of a speciality of dashing heroes in historical costume dramas Blanche Fury Saraband for Dead Lovers Scaramouche and Beau Brummell are other examples and he makes an attractive hero here. The other contribution that stands out is from George Sanders always a good villain as the corrupt aristocrat Ashwood.Director Fritz Lang however brings a very Gothic look to the film. Moonfleet may be situated on one of the most scenic counties in England but it is no picturesque village. The atmosphere is often a dark gloomy one with numerous shots of the shabby alehouse or the mistshrouded churchyard. Fox may be a likable rogue but the smugglers are for the most part dangerous ones who would have no compunction about murdering a child. There is a fine duel between Fox and one of their number fought to decide whether John should live or die after he inadvertently overhears their plans. This is not a great film but is nevertheless a wellmade watchable adventure. 610".

The film turns out quite nicely. It's a fairly conventional story of smuggler's on the English coast features a fine cast of veteran players many of whom had appeared in pictures of this sort before.That the story is presented in large part through the eyes of a small boy lends it a measure of distinction. We see Granger's character much as the boy does as a hero despite considerable evidence to the contrary. Granger is excellent in the lead. Despite what appears to be a modest budget this is a handsome film in the grand manner. That it's a backlot picture thus not a real spectacle is more than made up for by Lang's manner of dealing with his material. The movie feels like a fairy tale. The ending is unexpectedly moving surprised me and is still vivid in my memory.While not a masterpiece Moonfleet should satisfy admirers of its director and costume picture fans as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Young John Mohune comes to Dorset to meet a man called Jeremy Fox who he believes was a friend of his late mother and will help look after him. Expecting a friend in Fox John is upset to find an uncaring man who has no interest in John. He persists though in trying to gain the friendship and attention of Fox even in the face of great dissuasion. All Fox's acquaintances are rather desperate men which fly in the face of his rather proper appearance. John doesn't suspect anything being a child but the area is famous for smugglers and Fox may be connected and perhaps be more dangerous than anyone realises  not least the innocent John Mohune.I watched this film simply because I was a bit taken aback by the fact that it was a Fritz Lang film. Not being a name I would have associated with a period film I decided to take a look and see what he did with it. In fairness Falkner's source material does give him something to work with and there are interesting themes and ideas running through it. It takes a little bit to get going but after a while the smuggling story and the relationships make for a good adventure that is brisk enough for children while also having a bit of meat for the adults. I quite enjoyed the sweeping adventure feel it had but I was more interested in the character of Fox who is never a good man and is all the better for it in terms of the narrative. Lang appears to be interested in this as well and he does make Fox the biggest part of the film.Granger rises to this by turning in a solid performance where he is a rough character but not to the point where he loses the audience. The problem with the film is not with him  unfortunately it is with Jon Whiteley. He is too cute and very much a child actor  and I don't mean that in a good way. He isn't really able to emote and apologies for the lack of intelligent criticism but he just got on my nerves. I'm sure this film didn't want to go too deep but I would be happy to see a remake of this with a stronger and more natural child actor in the role that may allow the relationship to be developed a bit further. Sanders is always a welcome presence but he is given very little to do. The rest of the support cast are all solid enough but the film is pretty much Granger's and he works it well even if Whiteley isn't up to much.Overall though this is a solid little adventure tale that makes for solid family viewing. It is brisk and swashbuckling enough to entertain children while the solid yarn will engage adults. The cast mostly give a good account of themselves and while I didn't hate him I must admit that Whiteley was annoying to me personally and his performance here suggested a good education but a limited ability.".

	schema:headline " MGM Movie That Is Not As Good As It Could Have Been";
	schema:reviewBody "I like the movie Moonfleet but in watching Moonfleet you are also watching the demise of a great studio still trying to turn out quality pictures as the Hollywood studio system is collapsing and movie budgets are shrinking. Moonfleet is only 87 minutes long there are no expensive exterior action scenes and dimly lit interior scenes are the norm. Even though shot in Cinemascope Moonfleet is a budget movie using cheaper Eastmancolor not Technicolor. Stewart Granger was still under contract and the other starring roles are handled by European actors who worked for less. MGM modified existing sets cleaned off old costumes and started the camera rolling. For all of that the picture is interesting as it deals with 18th century English smugglers and the story of young John Mohune. MGM executives must have decided that even with Fritz Lang Moonfleet was not going to be a hit which could explain the truncated story line and the always gloomy cheaply processed photography. On the TCM broadcast I saw Moonfleet was in widescreen and had closed captioning. Looking as good as it ever will until the movie has a full restoration Moonfleet is just too slow paced without real kinetic energy. The talent is there but probably for reduced budget reasons Moonfleet can't grab your attention and keep it for even 87 minutes.Addendum I just watched parts of Moonfleet again from a download of a bittorrent file made from the French Time Warner DVD of this movie An AOL Company was still part of the logo then only two years ago. In a lot of ways this movie is a reflection of the decline of Hollywood and the importance of movie studios in general. Director Fritz Lang worked for the UFA movie studios in the 20s making silents made talkies in the 30s first in Europe then in Hollywood and was running out the string in Hollywood when he made Moonfleet. At the end of the movie when young Mohune leaves open the gate of Mohune manor the gesture does not really change things. The MGM logo included a gate in it the entrance to a great movie studio. There is a silent 1926 documentary made by MGM showing the different departments in the dream factory from warehouses full of period furniture to group shots of directors and cameramen and even a garage where wind machines and power trucks were kept. MGM was a giant movie company from the start when it combined Goldwyn's studio with Metro. Less than 30 years after that silent the MGM studio was like the desolate Mohune family manor its contract players and staff released its Loew's theaters sold on the cheap its Hollywood studio barely holding on as its New York board of directors decided to fire production head Dore Schary and cut movie production placing the studio's survival on big pictures like Raintree County BenHur and How The West Was Won.Moonfleet is still with us but MGM is now completely gone its name tagged onto a film releasing company but the last of its small studio staff given their walking papers about two years ago. The fatalistic atmosphere that permeates many scenes in Moonfleet may be Fritz Lang's doing but it could just as well be that it was hard for MGM staffers to think about happy endings as their studio was going under. And MGM's decline mirrored what was happening in the rest of Hollywood.Under the conditions then it was an accomplishment for the studio to make Moonfleet hiring the talent not on payroll preparing the sound stages for production and shooting the movie using the cheap Eastmancolor film. But to me the picture is too much of a downer the photography too dim and the storyline incomplete. Moonfleet is worth watching it has a great cast but the movie needed a bigger budget to pay for better production values and scenes showing what Stewart Granger's character did after leaving Mohune manor. By 1954 MGM wasn't going to gamble on spending a lot of money on Moonfleet.20 Oct 2012 Just looked at the review ratings here. Someone in 2006 probably another reviewer seems to have decided to hand out multiple negative ratings to almost all the earlier reviews. I couldn't care less about the number of not helpful marks I got. Still why hand out more than one negative to the same review? Nobody really cares. Maybe the guy thought giving out negatives would get his or her review posted on the front page. If so a pathetic commentary on one useless human being who visited the Moonfleet IMDb page.".

And why did they make the boy so young?  Not to mention the many other plot deviations i.e. devious woman which detracted from the tale. This could have been another 'Treasure Island' had the producers been a little less prone to taking liberties with literature.Now this movie is still very watchable mind you.

	schema:headline " Portrayal Of Innocence";
	schema:reviewBody "Although Treasure Island and Moonfleet are set at the same time in Hanoverian Great Britain with a child protagonist no two stories could be more different. Jim Hawkins in Treasure Island by becoming custodian of a treasure map with the help of some friendly adult companions battles pirates to gain the treasure and has a great old adventure out of it.Young John Mohune played by Jon Whiteley is an orphan lad alone in the world who is sent by his dying mother to seek out a man named Jeremy Fox in the coastal town of Moonfleet for protection and guidance against the cruel world. Fox is played by Stewart Granger who is in one of his least heroic roles on the screen. Granger is the Long John Silver of the story the leader of a band of pirate smugglers who operate out of that town. Granger gets plenty of protection because he's got the local squire George Sanders and his pleasure driven wife Joan Greenwood on his payroll so to speak. But that's an alliance of convenience.Having young Whiteley dropped on him is certainly cramping his style but the innocent young man in his explorations has found what could be clues to a big Hope Diamond like diamond that was the foundation of his family fortune but has been lost for generations. Naturally everybody wants a piece of what that bauble will bring.Fritz Lang returns to a familiar theme of a doomed man who cannot escape what the fates have in store. It's a theme Lang's used over and over in such films as You Only Live Once Scarlett Street The Woman In The Window Human Desire and others. His best work however in this film is reserved for young Jon Whiteley. I've rarely seen pure innocence better portrayed on the screen than with Whiteley. The young man's scenes with Stewart Granger are some of that actor's best work as well.In fact Stewart Granger was often quoted as saying that he regarded Moonfleet as one of his best films. I think Granger was absolutely right. The film hasn't aged one iota since its release in 1955 it's still great viewing for people of all ages.".

	onyx:emotionText "Although Treasure Island and Moonfleet are set at the same time in Hanoverian Great Britain with a child protagonist no two stories could be more different. Jim Hawkins in Treasure Island by becoming custodian of a treasure map with the help of some friendly adult companions battles pirates to gain the treasure and has a great old adventure out of it.Young John Mohune played by Jon Whiteley is an orphan lad alone in the world who is sent by his dying mother to seek out a man named Jeremy Fox in the coastal town of Moonfleet for protection and guidance against the cruel world. Fox is played by Stewart Granger who is in one of his least heroic roles on the screen. Granger is the Long John Silver of the story the leader of a band of pirate smugglers who operate out of that town. Granger gets plenty of protection because he's got the local squire George Sanders and his pleasure driven wife Joan Greenwood on his payroll so to speak. But that's an alliance of convenience.Having young Whiteley dropped on him is certainly cramping his style but the innocent young man in his explorations has found what could be clues to a big Hope Diamond like diamond that was the foundation of his family fortune but has been lost for generations. Naturally everybody wants a piece of what that bauble will bring.Fritz Lang returns to a familiar theme of a doomed man who cannot escape what the fates have in store.

	schema:headline " Routine swashbuckler could have been better considering the quality of the source novel.";
	schema:reviewBody "The book Moonfleet by John Meade Falkner belongs in that category of boyish swashbucklers occupied by other titles such as Treasure Island The Prisoner Of Zenda and Kidnapped. In fact I'd probably rate the book as one of my alltime favourites. It's definitely for me the best of the four I have just mentioned. I approached the film version in a positive and excited frame of mind firstly because I was such a fan of the book and secondly because the film's cast and crew bore much promise. Seasoned actors like Stewart Granger George Sanders and Joan Greenwood are always a pleasure to watch and director Fritz Lang's work is usually very good. Alas the film version of Moonfleet remains stuck in mediocrity for its entire 87 minute duration. Never so bad that it becomes unwatchable yet conversely never quite good enough to wholly grab the viewer's attention.John Mohune Jon Whiteley a young boy is sent by his dying mother to the coastal village of Moonfleet to find her former lover a man named Jeremy Fox Stewart Granger. She promises the boy that Fox will take care of him once she has passed away. Young John does as he is instructed but soon discovers that Fox is not particularly the nice man he was expecting to find. Initially Fox is very unwelcoming and uncaring towards young John and spends much of his time either flirting outrageously with the female villagers or conspiring with various shiftylooking characters. Gradually young John comes to realise that Fox is in charge of a gang of smugglers and is planning  with the aid of roguish local nobleman Lord Ashwood George Sanders  to step up into piracy. After a while a seed of friendship develops between John and Fox and when the youngster reveals what he knows about a priceless diamond that once belonged to the Mohune family they pair together to find the precious stone.Some aspects of the film work decently enough. Like so many films of this era the photography Robert Planck captures the colours of the period beautifully and the music Miklos Rosza is typically rousing. Granger is a dab hand at these likable villain roles and he provides yet another thoroughly enjoyable characterisation. On the flip side the sets are distractingly studiobound the narrative is rather muddled and the film tries unsuccessfully to improve upon the original source story even though the original was fine as it was. I think movies adapted from books should remain at least partially faithful to the source  otherwise what's the point? Wouldn't it be as well to promote the film as an original story and not claim it to be an adaptation? In the case of Moonfleet the bare bones of the novel remain in place but an awful lot has been altered and not really for the better. Perhaps if I hadn't read the book first I might have enjoyed the film more. On the whole Moonfleet is a routine swashbuckler  it doesn't shine brightly as a leading title within its own genre nor is it up to the high standards often attained by its director. Yet at the same time it doesn't fail so miserably that it is unworthy of a look.".

	schema:reviewBody "Moonfleet 1955A Fritz Lang oddity. If you are an admirer of this director's best movies there are several knockouts then you might want to plod through this one just to see his range. But it's basically aimed at young people with some adult threads a variation on a Treasure Island or Kidnapped theme Robert Louis Stevenson that is and it's fairly limited in its emotional range and in its plot.It's not that it's poorly made. In fact for an early leap into widescreen color it has a lot of very dark night shooting that works well and basically does what it intends. The problem is that it doesn't seem to intend to engage an adult with much intensity and I'd have to guess it also lacks the magic and adventure a child needs too. There's almost a pirate version of Bronte going on herethe old family mystery the conversations between outcast members of a storied family and so on.It doesn't help that the child star is stiff and unsympathetic at times even when he gets in deep trouble. He's not so cute or so lively or so daring as a child star ought to be. This reminds me of the lead in Shane who also deadens that film. There are a couple of actors I usually appreciate a lot like the great George Saunders who is fine here but rather by the book and Viveca Lindfors who is the little known import who I often really like beyond her small reputation and who here is also playing it straight. Too straight.Suspense? Absent. Even mystery about the plot the missing diamond is a bit unmysterious. Why? Why all the restraint and routine playing out of fairly common conflicts?All in all a strange entry in Lang's canon. If you have other options I'd skip this one. Or see a few minutes if you are curious and then be assured it doesn't get much different or better as it goes. And start to ask what it is about the business of moviemaking that leads directors with the intensity and originality of Fritz Lang into this kind of vehicle. Which by the way lost money on its substantial budget.".

And when finally the credits roll you say Oh that's been it.I feel like someone withheld a really good movie from me and only showed me a 90 mins teaser.";

	schema:reviewBody "Little Bpictures like this don't tend to have a lot going for them. There is much about Moonfleet to indicate it comes from the lower end of studio output  a nowobscure adventure novel as its source text minimal sets outdoor scenes on the backlot garish costume design and Fritz Lang in the director's chair. Not that Lang was a bad director  far from it  but he was never allowed to get his hands on anything prestigious during his Hollywood years and his name in the credits is as good as sign of cheap and cheerful as any. However the great thing about moviemaking is that inventiveness and flair cost nothing and these are things Lang had by the bucketful.The daunting and adventuresome spirit of the novel really seems to have inspired Lang and from the offset he fills the screen with the kind of disturbing imagery that he always did so well  a nightmarish stone angel hands appearing out of the earth a hanged criminal creaking in the breeze all shot with a painterly precision that heightens their macabre impact. Also integral to Lang's approach is the way he utilises the barren sets to create stark empty spaces in his shots. A great example is when Stewart Granger first appears. Lang has the camera track back gradually opening out the space which is all the more effective because the shots leading up to that moment had very close tight compositions. Many of the compositions have some conspicuous empty space or distant vanishing point and the whole picture acquires this desolate feel as if we are a long way from law safety and normal civilization. So what has this to do with the story? Well it's very simple for feelings of fear and unease to flip over into ones of excitement. It's that fine line between the creepy and the thrilling that really brings the adventure plot to life. Lang even places us squarely inside the sense of danger with pointofview shots in the scene where young Jon Whitely is hiding from the smugglers in the crypt.One of the biggest holes in these lowbudget productions was often the cast but while none of the performances in Moonfleet is exactly outstanding there is a good balancing out of adequate ones. Whitely Granger and the ubiquitous George Sanders give restrained and naturalistic turns each convincing and never too exuberant. Granger in particular keeps things at a steady pace and succinctly shows his character's conflicting emotions through subtle changes in his face. On the other hand we have some gloriously expressive and theatrical performances from various bit players keeping up that slight unworldly tone but only in roles which are small enough that they do not threaten to unbalance the picture. The standout among these latter players is Alan Napier as the fireandbrimstone pastor who gets one brief yet riveting appearance.Moonfleet also happens to be one of a number of pictures from the 1950s which it appears would later be reference points in the Indiana Jones movies of the 1980s. Specifically the aforementioned crypt scene reminds me of the opening of Last Crusade in which the teenage Indy spies on a gang of treasurehungry hoodlums. The underground burial chamber is also reminiscent of the Venetian catacombs from later in the same movie. Although these similarities could be coincidental it is perfectly believable that Moonfleet would fire the imagination of a nineyearold Steven Spielberg and sear itself into his brain all testament to the powerful imagery and keen sense of adventure that transcends its lowbudget roots.".

	schema:headline " The Aniston  Butler Show";
	schema:reviewBody "It is a well known fact that American comedies generally suffer from lackluster scripts usually employed as vehicles for rising or established stars. The Bounty Hunter is no exception as its charm lies solely in the joint presence of Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston rather than in the fact that Andy Tennant Hitch is directing. Of course even two fine actors such as those in this film are no good if the material is beneath their talent.The story goes like this Butler is an excop who currently works as a bounty hunter. One day he is given the opportunity to bring in his exwife Aniston who is wanted by the police after jumping bail. As he tracks her down and embarks on a hellish journey to take her back home the two find themselves in the middle of a murky murder case not to mention a series of situations that put their hatred for each other to the test.On paper there's plenty of potential for a moderately entertaining action comedy think Midnight Run with a romcom twist. Unfortunately the film is an uneven mess jumping from cringeworthy romantic moments to OTT action scenes complete with clichd hotel roomstrip club bits that have been out of fashion for quite some time. The tonal inconsistencies are reflected in the acting as well supporting performances range from passably straight Jeff Garlin to borderline ridiculous Christine Baranski whereas the leading duo does generally fine when they're together less so separately with Aniston being clearly more at ease with the less physically demanding stuff while the opposite is true for Butler.In short The Bounty Hunter is an inconsistent picture that doesn't have enough laughs for a comedy nor the appropriate direction for an action flick. The best option would be to ignore it altogether.".

	onyx:emotionText "It is a well known fact that American comedies generally suffer from lackluster scripts usually employed as vehicles for rising or established stars. The Bounty Hunter is no exception as its charm lies solely in the joint presence of Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston rather than in the fact that Andy Tennant Hitch is directing. Of course even two fine actors such as those in this film are no good if the material is beneath their talent.The story goes like this Butler is an excop who currently works as a bounty hunter. One day he is given the opportunity to bring in his exwife Aniston who is wanted by the police after jumping bail. As he tracks her down and embarks on a hellish journey to take her back home the two find themselves in the middle of a murky murder case not to mention a series of situations that put their hatred for each other to the test.On paper there's plenty of potential for a moderately entertaining action comedy think Midnight Run with a romcom twist. Unfortunately the film is an uneven mess jumping from cringeworthy romantic moments to OTT action scenes complete with clichd hotel roomstrip club bits that have been out of fashion for quite some time. The tonal inconsistencies are reflected in the acting as well supporting performances range from passably straight Jeff Garlin to borderline ridiculous Christine Baranski whereas the leading duo does generally fine when they're together less so separately with Aniston being clearly more at ease with the less physically demanding stuff while the opposite is true for Butler.In short The Bounty Hunter is an inconsistent picture that doesn't have enough laughs for a comedy nor the appropriate direction for an action flick. The best option would be to ignore it altogether.";

	schema:reviewBody "12 out of The Bounty Hunter looked like a decent film with a surprisingly fresh concept and spiced in with some fun performances. Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler looked like they would make a good duo and this movie looked promising in the fun factor. Unfortunately The bounty hunter is energy drained shallow and the word style is put over substance. The most disappointing drawback is that this film actually started out pretty decent and unique but once the film took the paintbythenumbers route that's when the film took a downward spiral. Before seeing these movies I don't expect The Godfather of the genre but I do expect a pretty decent film. Alas I didn't get that. Well I guess it could have been a lot worse. But if you have a film with a fresh concept two major stars and a pretty lengthy running time just enough for slick action and chemistry how could you mess it up?The Bounty Hunter revolves around Milo who's a bounty hunter that is taking his exwife to jail. Milo is pretty ecstatic as he gets to take the woman he loathed to prison and he gets five thousand dollars for it. Although Milo has some more problems up his sleeve and apparently his exwife has caused some of them.First of all this movie has an uneven pace. The first half of this film moves pretty swiftly and while it's not terribly interesting it has it at least decent. Then the second half of the movie starts to move slower loses steam and eventually becomes a chore to sit through. Furthermore the plot has so many inconsistencies that it's nearly improbable to focus on the film. I know that films do have their mistakes and we should just accept them and go along with the ride but when the ride isn't even halffun what else is there to focus on? Moreover this movie ran too long. Had twenty minutes been excluded this might have been passable. Unfortunately we have to sit through a dull subplot that is just heavily redundant. Also this movie really doesn't go anywhere. With a running time of an hour and fifty minutes there is no excuse why this movie lacked chemistry and the big explosions. It is advertised as an action comedy.While the negatives outweigh the positives there are still some redemptions. First of all the cinematography is pretty nifty. Moreover this film did start off pretty enjoyable. Furthermore the concept is pretty unique for once. Additionally the performances aren't abysmal. While nothing plausible they aren't bad.Overall The bounty hunter is a disposable action comedy that lacks momentum the requirements of a good movie and a good script. It is just forgettable and even in the moment it isn't anything special. If there's nothing else available at Redbox at this moment but this film then yeah I'd say it's worth. But chances are if there's a film not marked A Michael Bay film or an Uwe Boll film that you have slight interest in it may be safe to say that film is better than this one. Gerard Butler arrests people that don't show up to court? He should have arrested this movie because it didn't show up in the editing room since this movie runs a mere one hour and fifty minutes and gets as uninteresting as the word uninteresting gets.".

	schema:reviewBody "Remember when Hollywood couples who were actually together in real life made decent films i.e. Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn Laurence Olivier and Vivian Leigh Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall Ronald Reagan and Nancy Davis  whoops omit that last one? Now we get couples who are together for a few months but manage to get a movie in most of which last longer than the relationship i.e. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow Ben Affleck and Jennifer Gardner Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn etc. etc. etc.. And currently we get Jennifer Aniston with her latest Gerard Butler Phantom of the Opera Nim's Island 300 in what is basically nothing more than a remake of a bad episode okay EVERY episode of Dog The Bounty Hunter mixed with Mr. and Mrs. Smith starring another reallife couple and Midnight Run the classic comedy from 1988 with Charles Grodin and Robert DeNiro.If this film were a slightly interesting b somewhat novel andor c remotely funny then I might have enjoyed it  a tad. Since it did not fulfill even one of the above specifications however I have to trudge into my office and write yet another negative review for a Jennifer Aniston picture  it isn't something I necessarily enjoy either.And if these two are really romantically linked then judging by their chemistry on screen I'd get into counseling posthaste.Here Aniston plays reporter Nicole Hurley not for one second did I believe she came anywhere NEAR that profession by the way who is working a story about murder crooked cops and stolen drugs. She fails to appear in court as ordered. She's arrested for assault on a New York City police officer but skips bail causing a plot convenience device the size of the planet Pluto to be put into action.That device is having her downonhisluck ex husband a former cop now a bounty hunter hence the title Milo Boyd Butler go after her. He tracks her down and while on his way to deliver her he's a gambler so he takes the scenic route back to NYC through Atlantic City goons try to kill both of them. Now on the lam the couple bickers fights argues and comes as close to sexual tension as Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt might have at one time in history.They escape but both are marked by various hoods for death. This frightful prospect does not keep the two from engaging in silly sexual highjinx and stilted wordplay that would embarrass a 14yearold on his first date. Every situation in this movie has been tried and usually fallen flat dozens of times.I always try to find a few good things to say about any production only because I know a little bit about the blood sweat and tears it takes to bring something  ANYTHING  to the screen and except for a few minor characters who appear and then quickly exit there is absolutely nothing noteworthy about The Bounty Hunter. I even tried to give some kudos to director Andy Tennant who was responsible for the quirky Ever After and the semisweet Hitch. But then again I realized he also directed Sweet Home Alabama Fool's Gold and now this. I therefore can no longer come up with anything positive to write about Mr. Tennant.Plus if 2009 set the lofty standard as the single worst year for comedies in motion picture history then 2010 already featuring Our Family Wedding Cop Out and this bowl of slop may just  as unbelievable as it may seem  lower that bar even further. This wasn't a movie where the trailer exhibited ALL of the good lines this was a film where the trailer itself exhibited NO good lines.The only reason I even saw this turkey was because I HAD to. Those readers who have NO such obligation please  for the love of all that is holy  avoid this like the plague or at least like Love Happens.".

I have researched online and in libraries to learn the truth of these events and I would say that my outlook on those matters has changed substantially. But underneath that and the controversy that developed from it there is one universal and almost indisputable truth regarding the film JFK is simply an excellent movie. And no difference of opinion can refute this.I have seen my fair share of films over the years I'm not a cinema maniac by any means. But I think I can judge a quality product when I see one and that's simply what this picture presents. It is as Tom Wicker of the New York Times said at it's release propaganda but the same can be said for every film by Michael Moore... of whom I'm NOT a fan... but they are still strong pictures. JFK runs the difficult task of presenting fact fiction conjecture and opinion twisting them all to present the increasingly difficult to dispute conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act alone and according to director Oliver Stone did not act in the assassination of President Kennedy. The films accomplishments though past this controversial thesis are many 1. Kevin Costner turns in one of the greatest performances of his career. While his accent is stronger than Garrison and the physical resemblance not astonishing Costner three dimensionalizes a character and lives in it throughout the film. 2. An impressive and versatile cast is used superbly. The film is loaded with quality stars such as Kevin Bacon Tommy Lee Jones in an Oscar nominated role Gary Oldman and Joe Pesci who share an intense and crucial scene as well as character actors and actresses such as Michael Rooker Sissy Spacek and Jay Saunders. Stone even navigates a dramatic turn from the late comedy great John Candy and utilizes Hollywood legends Ed Asner Jack Lemmon Walter Matthau and Donald Sutherland superbly.3. With the possible exception of the lone gunman theory every possibility of truth is explored at least in dialogue. Because the case has never been fully elaborated on no one can say for certain what the truth is Stone presents all views while advancing his theory.4. The film is a masterwork of editing. It won the Oscar for film editing in 1991 and deserved it. I once read in Entertainment Weekly that a normal film has roughly 200 cuts in it there are more than sixty in the opening minutes alone here. Even more impressive when you consider the variety of film used. JFK is not absolute fact it does not truly pretend to be. By Stone's own admission Laurie Metcalf Michael Rooker and Kevin Bacon play composites or dramatized characters not the real thing. But standing alone as a movie JFK is untouchably excellent. And if it does force you to question as Costner's Garrison asks in the closing moments of what is our government made? then it's all for the better.".

It should have been named the Best Picture of 1991 instead of The Silence of the Lambs.Everything about this film is perfect and it shows that when an intriguing story comes together with all other elements of filmmaking that are executed brilliantly the film works on so many levels.First off Stone's direction is as good as it gets.  He has an incredible passion for the subject knowledge of the art and relationship with the camera.  All of his footage goes together seamlessly and makes the 3 h 08 min running time blow by.  He gets a strong performance out of the entire ensemble cast especially Costner Jones Oldman and Pesci.Scalia and Hutsching's editing is a work of art and tells the complicated story with incredible precision.  Richardson's cinematography lights up the screen in both colour and black and white.  Both of these technical aspects of filmmaking are molded into sheer artistry by these three men who have all deserved their Oscars for this film.John Williams' score is one of his best right up there with his Indiana Jones and Star Wars.  The script is intelligent thoughtprovoking mesmorizing and heartwrenching.  Costner's closing speech to the Jury is finer that Nicholson's in A Few Good Men McConaughey's in A Time to Kill and Jackson's in Pulp Fiction.  It is Stone and Sklar's best work.The subject matter is incredibly controverial and subjective but Stone's delivers it with such emotion and raw power that his alternate myth to the Warren Report seems factual.  The film is an investigation into the human spirit and how the vigour and dedication of one man and his team of associates can rise above the highest powers of the world and encode a message into the minds and hearts of millions.  John F. Kennedy has countless achievements and qualities as a president which makes his life and term one of the most incredible and worthy of deep study.Oliver Stone's JFK should go down in film history as one of the most important American films ever produced.  Watch it with an open mind free of prejudice and predisposition and you will find yourself wanting to go to the library and learn more about this global tragedy.".

The film is an investigation into the human spirit and how the vigour and dedication of one man and his team of associates can rise above the highest powers of the world and encode a message into the minds and hearts of millions.  John F. Kennedy has countless achievements and qualities as a president which makes his life and term one of the most incredible and worthy of deep study.Oliver Stone's JFK should go down in film history as one of the most important American films ever produced.  Watch it with an open mind free of prejudice and predisposition and you will find yourself wanting to go to the library and learn more about this global tragedy.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have stated many times that Oliver Stone is an incredible film maker whose films sizzle with excellent cinematography good acting and original storyline. He makes controversial films that are sometimes unappreciated by the public and the critics. I said and believed all this even before I watched JFK.JFK is a film that stars many Alist actors in major and minor roles but they give deep imprints nonetheless. Tommy Lee Jones the Oscar nominated actor of the film gives a performance that I almost missed due to my not recognizing him. Jones plays Clay Shaw a powerful figure in New Orleans and a secret homosexual who knew about the plot to kill the president. Gary Oldman is fantastic as the widely publicized murderer Lee Harvey Oswald. Joe Pesci fresh from his Oscar in Goodfellas as Dave Ferrie a man who is struggling to cope with the heavy accusations and mysteries of the JFK murder. Donald Sutherland in an Oscarworthy performance as an informant that talks to Jim Garrison played wonderfully by Kevin Costner. Other great appearances include Kevin Bacon Sissy Spacek Michael Rooker and even Walter Matthau in a bit appearance.Many of these fine performances were worthy of Oscars but if there is one man that deserved an Oscar more than anyone else it would have to be Oliver Stone who did not win Best Director OR Best Picture. Who did he lose to? Silence of the Lambs. While I do consider the film to be an excellent thriller featuring one of Anthony Hopkins' greatest performances I must say that in terms of scope and daring JFK was a far superior film. The cinematography was far more varied and ambitious as well as the subject matter itself. I can understand why JFK was passed over but the reasons are not fair to the extraordinary film given to us.The appearance of JFK is astounding. You are taken to a time of much distrust horror confusion corruption and coverup. The murders of JFK Martin Luther King and RFK all influenced the time periods and the peoples. Many people tried not to think about it or else they were scared into silence. Some like Jim Garrison tried to present the truth of JFK and their efforts are being felt even now.Before I saw this film I had seen Oliver comment that JFK was a movie in which he got all the crazy theories and presented them. He was not implying that everything was true and some of it isn't true. But after seeing this film I am convinced there was definitely more to the story than was originally told as I believed even before I saw JFK. This gave me a knowledge of the period and awareness of the people participating in the drama of the time.The point of the film is not entirely based on the story of the JFK assassination. It is an outcry from Oliver Stone to remind us that truth is never simple nor is it always presented by the government. People must struggle to find the truth sometimes and if it is covered up it could be lost forever. The film is an attempt to show us that the murder of President Kennedy was a time of much confusion and mixup. So what was true and what was not? Many eyewitnesses gave conflicted views while other circumstances were strange in their origins and happening. And while he gave us this Oliver Stone also presented us with the best film that he has yet made and his resume is incredible as it is.I have seen the films Platoon and Born on the Fourth of July films that Oliver Stone won Best Director for. Why did he not win for JFK? Why did it only win 2 Oscars? For me it is another example of how disappointing the Oscar results can be. I urge all to see this epic film of mystery and deceit of truth and lies the work of a master film director known as Oliver Stone.".

Yet it owes more to Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon which presented one reality from as many angles as levels of subjectivity. It's interesting that these films all oneword titled were made in the same intervals of time and like Rashomon and Z JFK is less a name than a code that encapsulates behind the mystery and the patriotic mask a more universal truth about humanity.Still patriotism is seriously involved and it's very significant that Oliver Stone one of America's most prolific political filmmakers much more a Vietnam vet handled the subject of Kennedy's assassination. As a man who practiced America's ideals on a muddy battlefield Stone is entitled to question these values he fought for and the integrity of the leaders that sent him out there indeed why would America send soldiers to fight foreigners in Vietnam? Why so far when Cuba is so close? Money is the key. There are no warmongers but businessmen who generate money out of all the steel the guns the helicopters the machines that are blown to pieces in Asia. In fact Stone didn't make a Vietnam and a President trilogy but a colossal oeuvre about Politics and War. And to a certain extent Kennedy can be regarded as one of the Vietnam War's victims as a collateral damage he was against the conflict and got killed before putting an end to it. It doesn't point an accusing finger on the Army but it highlights at least one serious motive for Kennedy's assassination.And that's the essence of the investigation lead by District Attorney Garrison Kevin Costner at the peak of his bankability. Garrison isn't satisfied with the conclusions of the Warren Commission that validated the isolated killer theory incarnated by Lee Harvey Oswald a remarkable Gary Oldman who conveniently died before his trial. What was his motive anyway? The Commission closed the case leaving a bunch of altered testimonies witnesses silenced before exposing their truth and so many unanswered questions. Garrison smells something fishy and who wouldn't? And the compass to guide his investigation is the elementary question who benefits from the crime? And this is where Kennedy's assassination takes a sort of legendary aura playing as a modern version of Julius Caesar. Kennedy could have made a lot of enemies everywhere CIA Russia Cubans although I wouldn't regard it as an omission the film didn't even mention the possibility of an involvement from the Federal Reserve Bank since Kennedy always defended the sovereignty of the dollar. But as the film progresses it gets clearer that Kennedy was a man to eliminate and one of JFK's highlights which is saying a lot is carried by the revelations delivered by Donald Sutherland as Mr. X in Washington.There are two levels in JFK the mystery surrounding the murder and the investigation what happened and what is known. And both interact in a masterstroke of editing probably one of the most complicated intricate and brilliant ever committed to screen certainly a schoolcase for wannabe editors. Literally JFK is served like a salad of documents flashbacks excerpts from the Zapruder film archive footage memories truths and lies shot in every possible way sepia 16mm amateur black and white and as Roger Ebert pointed out the film would have been harder to follow with an unchanging shooting. The salad is rich but digestible.And like a 1000piece puzzle JFK is an assemblage of different portions of reality that tend to get Garrison if not closer to the 'final image' further from the Warren's conclusions. On that level the film provides an extraordinary cast of supporting characters from Jack Lemmon to Joe Pesci from Kevin Bacon to John Candy each one leading to one certainty there was a conspiracy. The analysis of the Zapruder film revealed the timing between the first and last shot making implausible the 'onekiller' hypothesis even if he's a sharpshooter. And this very implausibility implies the presence of a second person which is enough to validate the idea of a conspiracy.And last but not least there's the excitability of some interrogated people who know that they put their lives at stakes if they talk. The film is driven by a sense of paranoia that conveys its greatest thrills. What can be more emotionally engaging than a quest for truth anyway especially when it undermines the deepest beliefs of any good citizen? One of Garrison's employees played by Michael Rooker can't accept the possibility of Johnson's involvement even Garrison's wife Sissy Spacek represent this side of America that wants to turn the page. Garrison has detractors and it starts in his own private circle before he becomes a target for the media.Garrison embodies the struggle of a man who wants to reconcile with America's ideals he doesn't fight the government because he's against it but because the government acts against the people. He feels like owing this to Kennedy to his vision of America to his sons and as his investigation goes on he witnesses the deaths of Martin Luther King of Bobby Kennedy and realizes that the system that killed Kennedy still prevails. Garrison's struggle is magnificently conveyed by the sort of inspirational score that only John Williams could have performed.JFK works on every cinematic level it's one of the best political films and best conspiracy movies ever made because it doesn't try to tell its own truth but to belie a fallacious version. It starts with an axiom there was a conspiracy and as long as it won't be solved there's an emotional wound in America's heart that would never be healed.".

	schema:headline " A Stunningly Well Planned and Articulated Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Oliver Stone is undoubtedly one of the most controversial directors of all time his work has included horrifyingly real stories of Vietnam stories of the corruption of politics and a muchdespised account of Jim Morrison's life. No matter the subject matter Stone always gives it his all and sometimes the world's response is positive and sometimes it's negative. With JFK we are faced with one of his films that was probably one of his most successful next to Platoon of 1986. This is a rare instance in which the public loved the concept of conspiracy in their own country and took special interest in the debates that it caused amongst the government upon release. The best thing about this film is that it is and was treated as so much more than a film. My honest opinion is that this response was created not because of a more plausible theory but because of Stone's fantastic and unique job putting the story together.The film opens on a surprisingly suspenseful scene of the murder of John F. Kennedy. The chopped style of the scene lets you know that something is not right dramatic black and white shots spliced with the blurry grain shots of the home video taken by a witness it won Academy Awards for Best Film Editing and Best Cinematography. This accompanied by John Williams' excellent original score helped do an excellent job of creating a mood just for this very first scene. Often times a director will stop after this give it his all for style and then stop after the first scene but Stone doesn't do this. He makes the film so much more than a boring investigation he takes you in to each of the puzzle pieces  indeed it feels like you're with Kevin Costner digging through hundreds of events. For 90 of these clips that lace the film's concepts together the camera is not kept steady it is indeed like you are there witnessing it. The human eye doesn't only look at what is important and a situation of trauma can make everything seem broken confused. Oliver Stone doesn't try to make sure you understand what's going on. Some frown upon this but it's realistic and that's what counts.Kevin Costner plays Jim Garrison the district attorney of New Orleans who investigates the murder of John Kennedy. Sometimes you are expected to disagree at first with some of Garrison's presumptuous statements and when you do there is always at least one character around who will agree with you. Stone realizes most viewers aren't devoted enough to believe everything Garrison says no matter what it is throughout the film. Stone has said that he wants people to rethink history and that this film is not guaranteed fact but an alternate myth to the myth that has been presented before. The story is not solid because very few ideas or people or events in life are. What I mean to say is that Garrison's comments are not necessarily ridiculous it's just a matter of how hard he tries to support them. The focus constantly changes  yes Costner will smile a bit when he makes a ridiculous remark that everyone rolls their eyes at yes even at the end of the film some clips will be left unchecked and yes you will see that there is no way that the question who killed JFK is answered as simply solidly and dare I say it Hollywoodesquely as a one man killing. If you watch this movie looking for real life without dramatization and without guaranteed entertainment and fun you will be impressed. This is not a popcorn movie.And finally a word should be said about the actors' enhancement of the realism of the film. Most notable are Joe Pesci as the frantic David Ferrie who pretends to be a victim but truly we see had much more to do with it than he pretends although convincingly was not an assassin  he blows the whole thing out of proportion this is too fcking big for you you know that? and Tommy Lee Jones as the wry ring leader Claw Shaw who seems to be a pompous upscale member of society that has been doing the dark business of conspiracy behind closed doors. The fact that these characters can appear real to us and not just appear as familiar actors taking on a role as you might feel in Ocean's Eleven truly does the film justice in driving it forward.This is in fact one of my top three favorite movies but I tend to refrain from mentioning it as just this to my friends I'm sooner to mention Memento or Fight Club. The reason for this is that the movie is almost an acquired taste and certainly not normal entertainment for a teenager. It's honestly written for a generation above me but everything that makes it up to and including the kings are killed and other political themes are intriguing to me and for me anything intriguing grows to be a favorite. Even if the subject is not something that ever really impacted me I take themes to heart and I always love a good enigma wrapped in a riddle.NOTES Maybe a point off for being inconsistent in goal. Though as admirable in a movie as any other characteristic I found this to be the most restricting on ability to follow along. Also notable is the fact that it's very release sparked opening of sealed governmental records on the subject.OVERALL A".

	schema:reviewBody "JFK was and remains so controversial that any positive reviews not to say they were characteristic it received were dwarfed by the trashing to which it was subjected in the official press which started well before it was released.  This was disturbing for what is the big need  it is just a movie.  But to so many JFK was not it was somehow threatening.Ultimately it does not matter whether JFK's conclusion is correct and I am even willing to give a little more license than I normally would to moresubstantive as well as lessimportant inaccuracies although I have my limits here too.   But this movie's significance is just that it was made.  For although other films had chronicled the events surrounding the assassination none had in any substantial way sought to discredit the Warren Commission as was so absolutely merited.Regardless of your opinion on what really happened it is my view that everyone should be critical of the media which were so obsequious to the Warren Commission.  The New York Times from the start referred to Oswald as the assassin not the suspect.    Life Magazine altered photos strongly suggesting a shot had been fired from the grassy knoll.   Many years later when being interviewed by Dan Rather about his film Oliver Stone said to his face referring to the event  Where were you Dan?Indeed in a documentary he made Rather said in the absence of any CREDIBLE evidence we can only...  This fallacy is a betrayal of the legal definition of evidence with Rather's poor characterization of the word credible.  There is enormous indeed endless evidence contradicting the Warren Commission's view and much of it is certainly credible including all the evidence of the Commission's own efforts to conduct a dishonest and incomplete investigation and intimidate witnesses into changing their testimony to support the version it wanted.  In fact I consider it Gerald Ford's greatest character flaw that he served on it and backed its conduct and conclusion a far more disturbing matter than his pardon of Nixon.

If any programming is called for it is to program people against the Commission's version not as its defenders would wish against Stone.  For no one can be programmed to accept Stone's alternate view.OK some inaccuracies of Stone can be criticized such as his portrayal of Garrison AllAmerican Kevin Costner natch as a wholesome hero and the timebetweenshots issue it is now generally conceded that there was enough time based on all the evidence for Oswald to have done it for those who believe he did.  Perhaps the speech by David Ferrie never occurred but it still reflects the widely held view that the CIA and Mafia worked together in this matter.  Certainly many people in the government despised Kennedy and there were substantially more elements of this hostility than portrayed in the film.  Anyway we can go on and on.  The Warren Commission tried to cover up overwhelming evidence that Ruby knew Oswald that a shot was fired from the grassy knoll that a darkskinned man fired shots from the Dallas School Book Depository and that Officer Tippit was killed by someone other than Oswald actually two people.  Well at least some members resisted the single bullet theory I guess that passes Rather's definition of credible although they ultimately signed the report.I do not agree with Oliver Stone's specific ultimate conclusion about the central moving force of the assassination.   But he has the right to suggest the U.S. government was involved and many including myself think it was involved somehow but that what is debatable is merely to what extent and how far up.

	onyx:emotionText "JFK was and remains so controversial that any positive reviews not to say they were characteristic it received were dwarfed by the trashing to which it was subjected in the official press which started well before it was released.  This was disturbing for what is the big need  it is just a movie.  But to so many JFK was not it was somehow threatening.Ultimately it does not matter whether JFK's conclusion is correct and I am even willing to give a little more license than I normally would to moresubstantive as well as lessimportant inaccuracies although I have my limits here too.   But this movie's significance is just that it was made.  For although other films had chronicled the events surrounding the assassination none had in any substantial way sought to discredit the Warren Commission as was so absolutely merited.Regardless of your opinion on what really happened it is my view that everyone should be critical of the media which were so obsequious to the Warren Commission.  The New York Times from the start referred to Oswald as the assassin not the suspect.    Life Magazine altered photos strongly suggesting a shot had been fired from the grassy knoll.   Many years later when being interviewed by Dan Rather about his film Oliver Stone said to his face referring to the event  Where were you Dan?Indeed in a documentary he made Rather said in the absence of any CREDIBLE evidence we can only...  This fallacy is a betrayal of the legal definition of evidence with Rather's poor characterization of the word credible.  There is enormous indeed endless evidence contradicting the Warren Commission's view and much of it is certainly credible including all the evidence of the Commission's own efforts to conduct a dishonest and incomplete investigation and intimidate witnesses into changing their testimony to support the version it wanted.  In fact I consider it Gerald Ford's greatest character flaw that he served on it and backed its conduct and conclusion a far more disturbing matter than his pardon of Nixon. Whether the evidence to which Rather referred is CONCLUSIVE is another story that is up to us the jury.  The sort of smugness Rather shows has been characteristic of much of the media and I do not know all the reasons they behaved as they did.

	schema:reviewBody "The first film in Oliver Stone's films about the American presidency JFK is a historical drama exploring a popular conspiracy theory regarding John F. Kennedy's assassination adapted from the books On the Trail of the Assassins by Jim Garrison and Crossfire The Plot That Killed Kennedy by Jim Marrs. On November 22 1963 President John F. Kennedy was shot and killed in Dallas Texas allegedly by Lee Harvey Oswald Gary Oldman. The inciting incident occurs when New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison notices several inaccuracies in the Warren Report the official investigation of the assassination and decides to reexamine the case of Kennedy's death. Garrison and his team pursue the truth at all costs and eventually take Kennedy's death to court to ask who really is responsible for killing the President?Clocking in at more than three hours the film has a definite focus on its story with every element of the film being used to further the plot. Garrison is a modern hero in the film a city DA that rises to the enormous challenge of investigating the President's assassination. Kevin Costner seems to perfectly capture this type of character also achieving a thick charming southern accent and connecting with the viewers. He is surrounded by an allstar supporting cast all of which truly become the real life figures they portray. Stone writes believable and engaging dialogue but since the film focuses so heavily on story he spends little time developing the characters. Oliver Stone is a controversial director and his style can be very polarizing but personally I enjoyed his strange method of storytelling. The costumes seemed appropriate for the setting and the set designs were extraordinary particularly the recreations of 1960s city streets such as Dallas and New Orleans.John Williams was responsible for writing the film's score and was nominated for an Oscar for his efforts. Williams was busy writing the score for Hook around the same time so he actually wrote themes for the film before the film was shot. This resulted in Stone cutting and editing the film to the music instead of the typical method of fitting the music to the film. Williams gives JFK a tragic but heroic theme but also incorporates pulsing synthesizers for the investigative scenes an unusual tactic for the composer. This resulted in an effective score and a seamless integration with the film. The cinematography was unusual but played a very important role in the story. The film opens with a montage of newsreel clips from JFK's presidency. It slowly intersperses Stone's own clips but the lighting and coloring blackandwhite and grainy film make the clips all seem genuine. Much of the film is shot in this manner giving a very real sense to the story very similar to a documentary. I can honestly say this film would not have been the same had it not been for this unique approach to cinematography.JFK rated R contains strong language throughout and the assassination scenes may be too graphic for young viewers. The 3hour runtime will bore some however any lover of historical dramas or investigative thrillers will finish the film asking for more. The film is an emotional journey and viewers will always find themselves rooting for Garrison and his seemingly impossible quest. I give this film a B finding it guilty of keeping me on the edge of my seat.".

	schema:reviewBody "The assassination of American President John Kennedy is one of the most talked about events in American history so making a film about such a talked over event was going to be no easy task but Oliver Stone pulled it of perfectly and may just be the best film he's ever given us next to Platoon. This film has an extremely long runtime and there's nothing wrong with that as long as they use it to the films advantage and they do the first 30 minutes of this film takes the time to explore the effects of the assassination the reasons why it effected To so many people and sets up the main character and his motivations played perfectly by Kevin Costner. I truly think that this is the greatest performance Kevin Costner has ever given because he perfectly strikes a balance between his obsession with solving the assassination and his commitments to his family the character is just so well written you understood why he was so obsessed and was an easy person to get behind. Tommy Lee Jones gives a performance like we've never seen from him before he was fantastic in this film he was such a despicable character and was the perfect foil for the plot of this film. A very young Gary Oldman was also great in this film as Lee Harvey Oswald he leaves a really big impression for the rest of the film to follow and when we start to learn more about Oswalds character Oldmans performance remains consistent. This film could have been extremely boring because of the amount of information that it has to give out but it never is. The film takes entire sequences to add emotional weight to the assassination and the masterful editing in this film allowed us to take in the information better. I really liked the fact that Stone didn't paint the assassination as just an act of pure evil we begin to understand why JFK was killed and while you never support them you understand why the assassins chose to kill him and made the film much more interesting. Another thing I loved about this movie was the sub plot of Garrisons family it added to Costners character as we begin to see that his obsession with this case is becoming unhealthy yet through conversations with his children we begin to further understand his motives and was really heartwarming at times. JFK is a masterpiece it's engaging never boring and extremely intriguing. While I'm not entirely sure if this film is completely accurate it's probably somewhat close to the truth. It has fantastic performances particularly that of Kevin Costner and may just be Stones best film. 100A".

This movie stirred up a lot of controversy for inaccuracies and what not but I don't know much about the case and I don't care about digging deep. What Oliver Stone brings to the screen is an astonishing and exhilarating plot about the mystery and conspiracy behind Kennedy's death as well everything that could make a film as fantastic as could possibly be.The assassination of president John F. Kennedy in 1963 remains one of the most infamous and debating mysteries in American history. JFK is based on two books that dig deep into the case and uncover varies wild schemes about the assassins that connect to the FBI CIA mafia and others. I have never seen the theatrical cut only the 205 minute director's cut. Absolutely not one single solitary minute was wasted. By no means was the movie stretched. It is rare that a movie as long as this can keep your eyes glued to the screen for that long. No other epic movie I've ever seen has gone by faster than JFK. Protagonist Kevin Costner investigates everything about the assassination for the whole movie where truths secrets and lies constantly unfold and twist throughout the movie. Kevin Costner plays real life district attorney Jim Garrison who is shocked just as everyone else to hear about the president's assassination. He has his suspicions but trusts everybody that handled Lee Harvey Oswald Gary Oldman as the patsy. Three years later Senator Long Walter Mathau reawakens Garrison's interest in the case and Garrison's eyes open and he does all he can to seek the truth. Over the next few years Garrison buries himself in the case where he makes many enemies and isolates himself from his wife Sissy Spacek and children. Absolutely nothing stands in the way between Jim Garrison and the truth.Costner gives the performance of his career as a paranoid lawyer who is obsessed with something he will never achieve. A really cool aspect of this is the starstudded cast that follow Costner in supporting roles. Sissy Spacek Gary Oldman Joe Pesci Jack Lemmon Ed Asner John Candy Sally Kirkland Walter Mathau Tommy Lee Jones Kevin Bacon Wayne Night Michael Rooker Frank Whaley Laurie Metcalfe Vincent D'Onofrio Brian DoyleMurray Donlad Sutherland Bob Gunton and Jay O. Sanders are all the familiar faces I saw. With a cast of this talent even the littlest scenes are awesome as heck. I officially believe what this movie says about the Kennedy murder. The killers must've had ties with the government. The records will no be available for circulation until another decade from now. If it wasn't an inside job how come they have tried so hard for so many decades to keep in under wraps? Then there's the magic bullet theory one bullet could have hit 6 I think that's the amount different places at different angles that went through parts of the body. The way Kevin Costner describes this theory is just genius. And Lee Harvey Oswlad was not the only killer. There's no way he could have used a rifle and fire six rounds in three seconds. Cosnter goes framebyframe and shows which angles the bullets come from. Eyewitnesses even say they heard gunshots from different areas. Then there's Oswald's murder either hours or a day after the Kennedy murder. There's so many pieces of evidence that prove Oswald was not the only killer. And I was sold on the president's death being an inside job.The way Oliver Stone makes this movie is incredible. In some of his movies it is evident that he is interested in style for style's sake. But the way Stone edits the movie and does all the cool camera tricks is merely a reflection on the story and characters. This is purely a phenomenal movie.".

I've generally accepted the idea that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone but if the story here of District Attorney Jim Garrison's obsession with the facts is even remotely accurate then there's probably some room for doubt. I'm not saying I'm convinced but what I am saying is that director Oliver Stone pieced together an intriguing and compelling film here even if one were to hold fast to any prior opinions. What struck me as interesting was when Garrison Kevin Costner stated to his legal team that even if his prosecution of Clay Shaw Tommy Lee Jones failed his long term goal was to give the American people ample opportunity to weigh all the conflicting evidence and eventually force the government to reveal the classified information on the assassination. Of course with the film made in 1991 it's already coming upon the twenty five to thirty year time span referenced by Garrison and we're no closer to finding the truth. I kind of doubt that we ever will know what really happened on that tragic day in Dallas.For true devotees studying the Kennedy assassination an excellent companion piece for this movie would be the 1998 documentary Image of an Assassination A New Look at the Zapruder Film. It won't put to rest any of the vast conspiracy theories nor does it try to. What it does is present an intriguing story of how the Zapruder film came about and how it captured a defining moment in the history of America tragic as it was. Not for the queasy or ill at ease it's a serious piece of film making that will affect you almost as much as the actual event did for those who were alive during the era to witness the tragedy as it unfolded on television.".

	schema:reviewBody "Few events in American history stand out quite so heavily as the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22 1963. Besides the shocking nature of the event with the American president being gunned down in broad daylight in a major city came the psychic scars caused by unanswered questions due to an alleged assassin gunned down before he could ever be tried and an official investigation that was at best botched and at worst a whitewash. Perhaps no single film or work of fiction has done more to raise questions about the event than Oliver Stone's 1991 JFK with its exploration of events through the perspective of Jim Garrison the New Orleans District Attorney who brought to trial of the one alleged conspirators.Stone along with his coscreenwriter Zachary Sklar craft a peculiar film around the biggest unsolved mystery in American history. Indeed JFK as a film owes much both to political thriller films such as Z which also focuses on the assassination of a government official with multiple versions of the same events seen from the perspective of witnesses brought forth by a determined investigator and the murder mystery genre. The only difference is that this is a murder with far more scope far more suspects and far more consequences than your garden variety murder mystery. It's a tale that takes in a large portion of still recent history and an era in time before distrust in government would reach its zenith and perhaps has never truly subsided and when terrible things very likely lurked in the shadows. Incidentally anyone convinced that Stone's vision is overly paranoid should seek out the published script book for the film with dozens if not hundreds of annotations. The film's vision while leaning perhaps a bit far in cases turns out to be far plausible a vision than it's often given credit for. The result is at nightmarish with its implications so perhaps it's no surprise that the film led to an act of Congress to release more of the classified files related to the assassination which is still being released even as I type these words.To bring the story to life Stone assembled a firstrate team both in front of and behind the camera. Borrowing another trope from some of the betterfilmed murder mysteries the film has an allstar cast of actors in roles both big and small. Leading it is Kevin Costner as Jim Garrison the New Orleans District Attorney who becomes both investigator and the audience's guide into the twisty world surrounding the assassination. Costner though quite different from the real Garrison who was taller and more built was nevertheless a perfect piece of casting as the intelligent everyman armed with a large amount of dignity and a determination to get to the truth no matter where it leads. Costner's performance plays up all of these elements and even the dark side of Garrison's obsession while also creating someone the audience is willing to follow for the threeplus hours the film runs for. The rest of the film's cast is equally as strong. The Garrison investigation turns up a number of fascinating characters any of whom could very well the protagonist of their own film ranging from Tommy Lee Jones' quietly menace as Clay Shaw Joe Pesci's eccentric David Ferrie John Candy as the evershifting lawyer Dean Andrews and Kevin Bacon as Willie O'Keefe a composite character one of several the film uses among many others. There is also Gary Oldman's Lee Harvey Oswald is not only uncanny in his resemblance but a fascinating portrait in its own right presenting many different versions of one of modern history's most enigmatic figures. The film also has its fair share of strong female performances from Laurie Metcalf as an assistant DA to Sissy Spacek as Garrison's wife torn between supporting her husband and being drawn into the world he's uncovering. That's without mentioning the effective cameo appearances from the likes of Edward Asner Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau or the scenestealing monologue delivered by Donald Sutherland as the mysterious insider known as X. Few films can claim to have perfect casts but for my money JFK is one of them. Those behind the camera are the other half of the equation. Stone's team includes superb costume and set designs from Marlene Stewart and Victor Kempster which gives the film its sense of time and place. Yet as cerebral as the film is a thinking person's thriller in many ways it's also an immensely visual work with Stone often relying on the editing of Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia as well as the stunning cinematography of Robert Richardson. The three of them together weave in footage both archive and newly shot together into a tapestry that captures the viewer's eye as well as their brain. Underpinning it all is John Williams' score perhaps one of his most underrated that plays up not only the sense of unease but also the sense of what was lost all in the space of the film's opening titles and haunting themes elsewhere in the film. It's a remarkable tapestry all around.Indeed that is a nice summary of the film as a whole. Stone's JFK is in essence a murder mystery. One whose stakes have a firm basis in reality and based on a crime whose particulars are still hotly debated decades after the fact. With his cast and crew he created a fascinating piece of filmmaking that crosses genres and time presenting an incredible and paranoid vision of an earthshattering event. Except that if what's in the film is even half true has deeply disturbing implications. That thought and the fact that the film led to documents being released speaks to the power of filmmaking and JFK as a film in particular.".

	schema:headline " One true fact this is a great movie";
	schema:reviewBody "How much of what Oliver Stone presents in JFK is actually true? Certainly not all of it. Certainly not none of it. There's definitely some truth in there but Stone obviously takes some liberties as well. It's quite a challenge to make a film that purports to be a true story when nobody actually knows the true story. You end up interpreting history rather than documenting it. Stone obviously believes there was a conspiracy in the JFK assassination so of course that is the story his film will tell. The conspiracy is presented as fact. And Stone certainly makes a compelling case. He hasn't solved the JFK case. But after watching his film you may well think he came much closer to doing so than our government ever has. Stone made a great film. And perhaps more importantly he made a convincing film. You're buying what he's selling.Stone uses New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison to make his case. Garrison was in fact the only man to ever bring anyone to trial in connection with the JFK assassination. It is Garrison's dogged investigation which drives Stone's film. There are so many obstacles in Garrison's way but he is determined to get to the truth. But in this case truth is almost impossible to find. Tales of shadowy conspiracy emerge but no matter how much Garrison digs it becomes evident he's never going to get to the bottom of this. He makes the best possible case he can given the circumstances. But the real truth the scary truth always remains elusive. Kevin Costner turns in an excellent performance as Garrison. He makes you believe in Garrison makes you believe that this man is doing the right thing. Costner is the strong center around which the film builds. Everything swirls around him. And in this film there is always something often many things swirling. There's an awful lot going on. Stone's film careens past three hours and you get the sense it probably could have gone on for three hours more.The film does go on for quite a long time and it throws so much information at you. There is a lot for the audience to process here. But the film never really gets bogged down. It is entertaining compelling and thoughtprovoking throughout. Costner is the standout performer but the rest of the cast is stellar as well. Gary Oldman makes for an eerily convincing Lee Harvey Oswald. Tommy Lee Jones and Joe Pesci bring unique personalities to the roles of two possible conspirators. Jones is calm and suave as Clay Shaw Pesci nervous and manic as David Ferrie. Donald Sutherland Kevin Bacon Sissy Spacek and a host of others play their parts well. Familiar faces pop up in even bit parts the likes of Jack Lemmon Walter Matthau and John Candy helping to move the story along. No part no performance is wasted. Stone weaves his web expertly. It is a very tangled story there is the sense that in the end maybe all the strands of the story didn't quite come together. But how could they? This film is a true story in which nobody actually knows the truth. Ultimately Garrison through a powerful performance from Costner lays out his version of the truth. Through this character Stone tries to convince us. How much of what Stone presents you choose to accept as truth is up to you. You can question Stone's version of history. But there is no question that in JFK he made an excellent film. It may not be a perfect history. But it's a nearperfect film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reviewed April 2012The movie might have exaggerated dramatized or manipulated certain real events but what a stunning presentation featuring one of the best ensemble performances and intense screenplay that holds the audience attention for well over 3 hours. Though it reminds a bit of 'All the presidents men' it doesn't have its subtlety. It all starts after the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the conspiracies surrounding the investigation. Jim Garrison Kevin Costner a DA of New Orleans is convinced that there is a lot more to what the officials are willing to share and after finding a lot of loop holes in the Warren Commissions report starts an unauthorized investigation with a small team from his office. He starts putting together facts speculates certain conspiracy theories and the case starts consuming him. The fear humiliation object of losing his family doesn't stop him from going further. The amount of information fact or fiction fed to the audience in extraordinary and since it is a little speculative and involves one of the most popular conspiracy theories there is a better chance the audience gets sucked into it. Screenplay doesn't allow a single dull moment and every actor gives a one up performance scene after scene. The look of the period and a clever mix of real and shot footage helps too. One problem here is that it does not just present the important facts and let the viewer decide it thinks for the viewer too. Thus dumbing down and ending up one dimensional. Knowing the runtime beforehand might be a daunting task for you to attempt to watch this trust me time flies is an idiom never more appropriate while watching this movie.".

Though it reminds a bit of 'All the presidents men' it doesn't have its subtlety. It all starts after the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the conspiracies surrounding the investigation. Jim Garrison Kevin Costner a DA of New Orleans is convinced that there is a lot more to what the officials are willing to share and after finding a lot of loop holes in the Warren Commissions report starts an unauthorized investigation with a small team from his office. He starts putting together facts speculates certain conspiracy theories and the case starts consuming him. The fear humiliation object of losing his family doesn't stop him from going further. The amount of information fact or fiction fed to the audience in extraordinary and since it is a little speculative and involves one of the most popular conspiracy theories there is a better chance the audience gets sucked into it. Screenplay doesn't allow a single dull moment and every actor gives a one up performance scene after scene. The look of the period and a clever mix of real and shot footage helps too. One problem here is that it does not just present the important facts and let the viewer decide it thinks for the viewer too. Thus dumbing down and ending up one dimensional. Knowing the runtime beforehand might be a daunting task for you to attempt to watch this trust me time flies is an idiom never more appropriate while watching this movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "In the end this is a fundamentally dishonest film. Oliver Stone makes up facts twists testimony and fabricates much of the evidence in this film. Some have argued that this is okay because Stone is after a larger truth or because he is only creating a work of fiction and we should grant him some artistic license. Artistic license is fine up to a point but artistic license is not without its limits. This is a film about truth. In the closing quote over the end credits Stone tells us how we need to seek after the truth. Yet Stone who meticulously researched so many aspects of this story must have known that the facts he was presented were false and deliberately false.A talented director can make a great propaganda film but in the end it is still propaganda. For Stone then to get on his soapbox and imply that he is the one seeking after the truth while he drags the truth through the gutter only cheapens this film. Like sausages you may enjoy this film as long as you don't look too closely into how it was made.410".

Its what they do with their talent that is disgraceful.JFK is a propaganda piece.  This genre however expertly crafted always suffers from its roots in advocacy.  This is why  some wartime flicks seem agonizingly corny.What separates JFK from most of its fellow propaganda films is the views and interests which it wishes to advance.Namely JFK advances the idea that Lyndon Johnson aided by the  Central Intelligence Agency the Federal Bureau of Investigation the Dallas Police Department the Pentagon Bethesda Naval Hospital Parkland Hospital the City of Dallas the John Birch Society communists fascists cuban left wingers cuban right wingers  mobsters of various political and personal bents nightclub owners topless dancers reporters both national and local and various others sought to snuff out President Kennedy and cover it up for infinity.The vehicle for advancing this claptrap comes in the form of the intrepid and dogmatic District Attorney for New Orleans Mr. Jim Garrison played by Kevin Costner.  Costner's portrayal of Mr. Garrison may be right on the money.  He spends most of the film completely absorbed with the idea of a conspiracy.  In addition he makes very lengthy pronouncements throughout the film consisting mostly of bombast and grandiose theories from the fringe.  Mr. Garrison's staff are played up as yes men dupes until the end when we see some rebellion.  I thought it quite amusing that one of the deputy D.A.'s is played by the comedian Wayne Knight better known as Newman on Seinfeld.  Now  that is apropos.Normally this film should be considered simply trash.  However  JFK has become some sort of an educational tool.  It shows up  in high schools around the country every year to teach our kids.  Of course it also shows up in our living rooms so the intellectually lazy can take a three hour course on President Kennedy's assassination.  Despite the outrage of traditional historians whom I suppose are part of the plot themselves the majority of viewers still buy the preposterous premise hook line and sinker.  This moves JFK beyond the category of trash and places it within the company of Triumph des Willens  for its evil.".

	schema:headline " The Fifties Are Over!";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an Oliver Stone film which delves into the tumultuous intricacies of the entire JFK assassination issue! Kennedy was a controversial president from the offset primarily for the reason that he was stigmatized by many Americans because of his religion. Besides the problem which many voters perceived about Kennedy's Catholicism a great deal of Americans were skeptical regarding Kennedy's election campaign tactics. Many citizens felt as though he orchestrated some scandalous chicanery in Chicago in the process of winning the 1960 election. All throughout his presidency Kennedy was subjected to a ubiquitous and disdainful criticism from all sides of the political arena! Kennedy's nefarious presidency included alleged sexual indiscretions with many women including prominent stars such as Marilyn Monroe and Gene Tierney! The most intriguing angle which director Oliver Stone focused on was the aspect of the depraved culture dissemination which prevailed in the United States during the Kennedy administration's reign. Kennedy's assassination led people to believe that our government was motivated by hate and fear and not egalitarian democracy. Kevin Costner played a district attorney from New Orleans Jim Garrison someone who became ideologically wounded when he heard about Kennedy's assassination! His wife Sissy Spacek perpetually misunderstood Garrison Kevin Costner concerning his vehement pursuit to unravel a conspiracy theory relating to the whole gruesome Kennedy assassination incident! Conjecture which arose from the Warren Report particularly with regards to the Magic Bullet Theory became a cumbersome and ambiguous documented fiasco which invoked a hasty dismissal to this entire affair. Dallas was fast and furiously becoming a city which embraced a bevy of secret service men who were in quest of evidence which pointed to potential political espionage that could be linked to the assassination of John F. Kennedy! The invidious aura to Dallas back in 1963 made the city precariously conducive to being a venue that would get involved in a malignant nationwide political scandal! What the film JFK ultimately purported was not just that the assassination of a United States' President was a conspiracy rather this film wished to reiterate how deep rooted this covertly heinous conspiracy actually was! The CIA was now a corrupt arm of the law that became responsible for an egregious subornation by appointed officials to catalyst a nationally unprecedented form of deceit and collusion! The diatribes which Jim Garrison elaborated on established a callous dichotomy between political temerity with the CIA and an ideologically emblematic badge of justice with the American people. The scapegoat who expedited the JFK assassination Lee Harvey Oswald was believed to be a spawn of Fidel Castro's Communist insurgency. When Jack Ruby murdered Lee Harvey Oswald this merely fortified the concept that a politically volatile conspiracy was the culprit to this infamous string of murders. Rumination of this entire matter allowed director Oliver Stone to engage in an acute portrayal of the disconcerting vindictiveness which was prevalent in America's boll weevil culture. All three movies Natural Born Killers Talk Radio as well as JFK were Oliver Stone films which depicted the numerous demented mannerisms that are indicative of many reprobates in the Dixie region of this country. This is not to say that the South is any worse than any other area of the United States. It is simply to point out that they possess a certain style of belligerence which correlates to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. JFK did not win for best picture in 1991. The year 1991 was a year in which Silence of the Lambs swept everything at the Academy Awards Oscars Ceremony! JFK was an intellectual film which possessed an alert articulation with the American people that their nation witnessed a pejorative yet mandatory transformation in their social pattern of behavior when John F. Kennedy was shot! This necessitated a revolutionary counter culture mindset that erupted virtually overnight! In 1963 much of the United States bore a solid resemblance to the 1950's. JFK's assassination evoked a concise revelation to the emerging and indelible culture of the 1960's almost instantaneously and with a very intrepid disposition as well. The whole Kennedy assassination affair brought on a neon accented metamorphosis to the American people that U.S. public officials were indeed extremely sordid and that they were anything but squeaky clean paragons of virtue! The acting ability in this film is amazing! The list goes on Kevin Costner Sissy Spacek Kevin Bacon Donald Sutherland Tommie Lee Jones Joe Pesci Jack Lemmon Walter Mathau Ed Asner and so many others! JFK is a lengthy film because it is filled with poignantly detailed dialog not because it is hindered with a tedium of verbosity! This movie is one of Oliver Stone's greatest and the wry authenticity to this film makes it one of the finest in the history of the silver screen! Without question it is a 1990's classic! THUMBS UP!! PERFECT TEN!!".

As always I was not bored for a single second of this high octane virtually paranoia driven dialog. And I got reminded again why it is one of my favorite movies. I've always been a fan of the political thrillers with espionage thrown in and JFK is undoubtedly one of the best if not the best of these. This is Oliver Stone at his best which is telling because there have been a lot of instances especially in recent times when it seems he has lost it. His Vietnam trilogy not withstanding.Based on the true life memoirs of Jim Garrison who was as per the movie the only person to bring a trial in the Kennedy assassination this movie holds you from the first scene till the end. Unless of course you're the kind who rates a movie's greatness based on the special effects. In which case I would suggest you go for the Transformers sequel as most of the world seems to be.Kevin Costner plays Jim Garrison the New Orleans DA who after 3 years discovers that things were just not right with the investigation and findings of the Warren commission regarding the murder of John F. Kennedy. Together with his office a small yet dedicated bunch he sets out to investigate. Against all odds and a labyrinth of characters threats murders and political intrigue he manages to bring forth the case to trial. Regardless of the outcome of the trial the final monologue by Costner has to be seen to be believed. And felt. No matter how many times I see this it always brings a lump to my throat as Costner elaborates on just why this is so important. Reminds you that Costner is capable of being there with the very best despite some of the crap he dishes out at times.As for the actual case was there conspiracy involving the CIA the govt the FBI and the antiCuban and anticommunist forces? Or is Oliver Stone just a paranoid genius as many say? Well I don't know but the power of the movie can be gaged from the fact that it turned me a completely disinterested person into a believer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Good Morning Vietnam 1987A lighthearted but deadly serious antiwar film actually. This is of course a Robin Williams movie so that it is his schtick brilliant and inspired that makes it soar. The best of it including the famous riff when he first gets on the air as the new Saigon DJ is hilarious and breathtaking. There is a plot sort of as he goes through a rise and fall at the military radio station but it's more about his shining moments behind the microphone than anything else.The else in this movie is however most of the movie. That is Williams has a serious role as an offbeat renegade in a chaotic world surrounded by a range of sensible and very insensible officers and colleagues. At the most extreme when we see a Vietnamese village firebombed while Louis Armstrong sings It's a Wonderful World the sentiment is so cloying it makes you cry and you're not sure why because you know it's just over the top manipulation. Likewise when Williams is caught in a traffic jam with other military vehicles and he warms up the soldiers by humanizing everyone and making them feel like they really should be back home. Which they should be as we know in retrospect.So the movie has another side that's kind of sentimental and simplistic whatever its good pacifist intentions. Williams is a decent actorI'm not one of those who thinks he's brilliant outside of his funny rolesand so it holds up pretty well. But the plot line keeps the movie from really finding pathos or comedy or warmth or tragedy of a dramatic kind in the scenes outside the radio station. And I think that's what it intended.For those who don't know it's worth adding that the main character Adrian Cronauer was a real person and still ishe's a staunch Republican Williams was not to be sure and an innovator in radio in Vietnam. He also cowrote the screenplay I assume working on the scenes that he would know best rather than the larger saccharine plot aspects. A great story and the real Cronauer deserves credit for inspiring it and helping it along. He was along with most of us Godsmacked when he heard the news of Williams's death.".

I mostly got what I expected from this movie... but I found that it also contained some truths about the Vietnam war. The movie has plenty to offer on both fronts. Any fan of Williams' comedy will definitely enjoy it and I think most warmovie buffs will too... if they can keep an open mind and accept a slightly different approach to the genre. The way the seriousness of war is underplayed for most of the film really works to enhance the effect of it when it is shoved right in our faces when we are forced to acknowledge it. We forget how serious and allconsuming war is just like Adrian hadnot necessarily the real one I know nothing of him except of what the film told me and as far as I understand that's not that accurate a portrayal of him only to be confronted with it. More effective than several big war movies. The plot is very good. The pacing is great the movie keeps moving pretty much all through the film. The characters are wellwritten and credible. The acting is good pretty much allround and Williams proves once again that he can do drama just as well as comedy. The humor is typical Robin Williams. A very good film and an unusual war movie. I recommend this to fans of Robin Williams and war movies. 710".

It was the famous Preston Sturges classic Sullivan's Travels which coincidentally as it turns out is one of my favorite films.Both the real life Adrian Cronauer and Joel McCrea's fictional John L. Sullivan have to come to the same realization that what they do matters a great deal. In Sullivan's Travels it's to the movie going public in general in the case of Cronauer it's to the GIs in Vietnam stuck in a war where no one could ever know who the enemy was. A few laughs from a comic genius was necessary to get them through the day in their very cockeyed world.Adrian Cronauer was a real life person but if he didn't bear a resemblance to Robin Williams he should have. One of the great comic masters of any era in entertainment Robin Williams is given full range for his zany sense of humor to work its magic with Cronauer. He's ably abetted and assisted by the other staff members of Armed Forces Radio Forest Whitaker and Robert Wuhl. Bruno Kirby is great as the clueless lieutenant in charge and so is J.T. Walsh who represents the limits of the military mind as the sergeant major out to get Williams by hook or very dirty crook.Williams himself doesn't understand the complexities of the Vietnam situation. That fact is brought home to him graphically when he's betrayed by his own innate decency.Next to Williams my favorite in the cast is Noble Willingham who plays the general who has overall charge of Armed Forces Radio there. He's a tough but compassionate military man the exact opposite of J.T. Walsh whom he has to reign in.Good Morning Vietnam is a frank portrayal of a war experience told with humor and irony through the eyes of Robin Williams.Preston Sturges would have absolutely adored this film.".

Most amazing is that he adlibbed the whole thing but hey that's Robin Williams. Maybe Cronauer wasn't that wacky in real life but every one of Williams' comments makes the movie worthwhile.

	schema:headline " Really smart and somewhat humbling film that entertains and amuses.";
	schema:reviewBody "Made at a time when films on the Vietnam war were being produced by America at a healthy rate Good Morning Vietnam comes across as the sort that falls into both 'types' that were being produced at the time. Platoon got under the skin of Vietnam telling the events from an individual's perspective through voiceovers without relying on a lot of causality rather the everyday tasks and events that occur. Full Metal Jacket was an interesting beast in the sense most of its more intense scenes didn't actually happen in Vietnam but rather at home on the training ground. But both were in a sensible tradition and took attention away from the Reaganism inspired 'action' films that were Rambo First Blood Part II and the like.Good Morning Vietnam falls into both these sorts of Vietnam war films. On one hand it is a serious film about the war and deals with serious issues such as morale and how dangerous conflict with the enemy actually is without doing what Rambo did by turning the war genre into a subdivision of the action genre. At one point in the film DJ and lead character of the film Adrian Cronauer Williams finds himself in a hostile area out in the jungle and you do feel the shift in atmosphere the film briefly moves into in the sense this guy is not a soldier but he is in a dangerous position and he isn't equipped with how to get through it. There is another scene in which a street side bomb goes off and Adrian is caught up in the middle of it further reminding us of the war zone and cleverly shifting the aura.But the film does fall into the genre of comedy and while it does so it never distracts us from the fact this is taking place during a war unlike First Blood Part II which could really have been an action film set amongst any backdrop. Good Morning Vietnam does not ignore its comedy roots either and gives us genuinely entertaining disc jockey rants from Williams who shines with his animation and adlibbing further reminding us of a later film of his Aladdin and how he really was the star of that piece.The best parts of Good Morning Vietnam actually raise issues to do with oppositional reading. As a character Adrian is one of those charismatic individuals who is perhaps more focused on entertaining his audience first but when repercussions to do with that want to entertain arise it is an oppositional reading to something that seems innocent enough. There are a couple of scenes and incidences that deal with this theme of oppositional reading. One that springs to mind takes place in a bar in which Adrian has brought a Vietnamese friend whom he teaches in an English class. The trouble is it's a G.I. bar and certain soldiers have an issue with the Vietnamese person being there. It is Adrian's carefree and relaxed attitude to letting the individual come with him to the bar that has upset certain others around him resulting in an oppositional opinion on whether the Vietnamese person should be allowed there. One says he can others say he can't and conflict erupts.This battle is constantly going on within the boundaries of the radio studio and exists between Adrian and the censors who blank out all the bad news such as deaths and bombings failing to deliver the real news and instead keep morale from going below a certain point. Adrian's style of giving the people what they should hear in a charismatic style also rubs off spawning a substory revolving around a small school that teaches Vietnamese people the English language. Before hand they were learning very basic words and phrases but after Adrian takes over New York City slang or 'jargon' is the name of the game and while you wouldn't find English as a foreign language classes doing this sort of thing Adrian brings his charismatic style to a class turning it from formal to informal.The theme here is that he's giving them exactly what he feels they need to know not what the curriculum demand they know. It is the same with the radio station and the news censorship giving people what they have a right to know vs. what a higher power say they should know. The principal foil for Adrian is Lt. Steven Hauk Kirby who is against Adrian's style of parody and constant joking but when he is put on air the best he can do is adopt the voice and role of a Frenchman as he mocks and plods his way through airtime. It is a battle that the oppositional readers loose since morale falls drastically after Adrian is taken off and he is forced to be reinstated because of this.Good Morning Vietnam carries a pumping soundtrack which is what you'd expect for a film about a DJ and an emphasis on radio and its constant referencing to popular culture gliding from The Wizard of Oz to Eleanor Roosevelt makes Williams' scenes consistently fun to watch. But other than this it gives some political stances without ever feeling forced with the 'Wonderful World' montage over wartime action and juxtaposes James Brown's music over other scenes of wartime action. The film is a success in comedy and drama a rarity of sorts given Dr. Strangelove supposedly set the standards.".

From his outgoing sense of humor to his aggressive personality and dozens of vocal effects he portrays his character with interactive zest. Who can resist the awakening voice of Williams on the radio yelling Good Morning Vietnam. This is a film that conquers the test of time.Good Morning Vietnam tells the story of a lively disc jockey who gets a job on Armed Forced Radio during the Vietnam War. Robin Williams is the fasttalking Adrian Cronauer and who better to play the part than he. Although this character is onedimensional we are never informed on his background marital status where he comes from what he did before we meet as the movie continues he gradually begins to change into a deeper more meaningful person.The story moves along smoothly the narrative throughline is consistent as each scene relates to the next. Although little momentum or suspense can be noticed the film does have several underlining themes often viewed upon in a Stanley Kubrick style sarcastic and uncompromising. We see how much a little humor and jazz can greatly enlighten the hardcore atmosphere of the military during Vietnam and how it can thoroughly confuse the bleeding heart officials. The film hangs by the skin of its teeth for active conflict tension. Beyond people objecting to the actions of Williams' character there is just not a lot of tension within the story and at some points my interest wandered. Good Morning Vietnam is merely a portrait of Robin Williams releasing his perennial comedy and unfortunately that does happen to get old quite quickly the majority of an audience can only watch the humor for so long until it becomes old and somewhat stale.Good Morning Vietnam is definitely not a flawless film but we do empathize for the main character the scenes effectively capture the attitude and mood during the war and the dialogue and writing feel accurate and involving. Barry Levinson has directed a marvelous comedy one that is not all about making us laugh but also makes us think.".

	schema:headline " A perfect showcase for Robin Williams' unique improv";
	schema:reviewBody "Good Morning Vietnam is undoubtedly the film that propelled Robin Williams to the Alist. Beforehand he was only known as Mork from Ork and the films he'd been asked to appear in except perhaps Moscow on the Hudson were ones not really giving him an opportunity to flex his true muscles as an actor.But GMV changed all that because it was the first time Williams had been given a character that finally allowed him to showcase his unique brand of improv. In this case a DJ.Its what Williams does with the part that makes GMV so compelling. His livewire performance transforms the entire movie. Without Williams GMV would be a considerably lesser film than it is.Barry Levinson's film is rather unique because it was the first and only one to add a bit of comedy into the Vietnam War. Taking a leaf out of MASH's book it uses the conflict in Saigon as a backdrop for William's barnstorming impressions and impersonations. And for the most part its a sweet package.Williams plays Adrian Cronauer a funny man shipped to Saigon to be the new host of a morning radio show. Adrian's irreverent antics in front of the mike raises a few eyebrows among the straightarrow US military but the troops love him!All the while Adrian gets to know Vietnamese culture up close and personal. Something that leads to romance friendship and eventually a betrayal that changes Adrian's life forever.It was the decision to put Robin Williams at the centre that makes Good Morning Vietnam such a great movie. Williams is a master of improvisation. He can slip from one impersonation to the next effortlessly. And the best part is none of it is scripted. Williams improvises routines right out of thin air. You know he's just making this up as he's going along and its a remarkable thing to see.Levinson knows Williams needs no script or cue cards to work from. All he does is position the camera in front of Williams behind the mike give him the line Good Morning Vietnam and then go from there. And its like watching a comic whirlwind. Any scene with him on his radio show provides nonstop laughs. He has seldom been better in anything else.What I also liked about GMV is its humorous approach to the misguided Vietnam conflict. Its when it tries to be a little more serious and dramatic that the film falls down. Yes the war in Vietnam was a terrible tragedy. Especially because it represented the American's sabrerattling mentality at its narrowest. But the dramatic elements offer nothing particularly enlightening about the war. The comedy elements however do.When Good Morning Vietnam is funny its very funny. But when it tries to make serious points it slows the film right down. Its Williams irreverent commentaries on the conflict that give the film its life. Even when he's doing impressions of Richard Nixon and even Elmer Fudd there's a thinly disguised veil of contempt against the US military's participation in the Vietnam War. They're wrapped up in sharply satirical comic material but they make more of an impact than the film's outright heavyhanded approach. Subtlety makes all the difference.Robin Williams is the heart and soul of the entire picture of course. Whether he's delivering manic rapidfire monologues on the air to teaching native Vietnamese the hip aspects of the English language he holds the attention whenever he's around. He was deservedly nominated for an Oscar. An Oscar he should have won really.Levinson surrounds Williams with talented character actors. The most engaging are Forest Whitaker and Noble Willingham. Whitaker plays Edward a timid young man who learns to loosen up after spending time in Adrian's company. And Willingham plays Gen. Taylor the only one among the top brass who takes a shine to Adrian's unorthodox methods. He brings depth to what could have been an easily clichd character.On the downside JT Walsh plays exactly the type of character Willingham is so skillful at avoiding. A pompous selfimportant bureaucrat who takes an instant dislike to Adrian's freethinking spirit. I have to admit I found it a bit hard to swallow that Walsh's character Sgt Major Dickerson teehee! would actually try to get Adrian killed in VC territory. No matter how much he hated him. His is an unnecessary character really. The film could have done just as well and arguably better without him.Nethertheless the ending is still quite sad when Adrian winds up being shipped back to the US because one of his Vietnamese friends is a terrorist. Williams performance is so faultless that even when you can see the mechanicals of the plot clicking into place you still feel sadness for him. His closing message is the perfect blend of cutting humour and acute pathos.Good Morning Vietnam would have been better if it had stayed true to the comic route. But despite a few bumps in the screenplay Robin Williams' quite excellent even virtuoso performance keeps things remarkably on course. He made a questionable detour into sentimental schmaltz in the following 90s but this film shows you what Robin Williams can be capable of when given the right material to work with.".

	onyx:emotionText "Good Morning Vietnam is undoubtedly the film that propelled Robin Williams to the Alist. Beforehand he was only known as Mork from Ork and the films he'd been asked to appear in except perhaps Moscow on the Hudson were ones not really giving him an opportunity to flex his true muscles as an actor.But GMV changed all that because it was the first time Williams had been given a character that finally allowed him to showcase his unique brand of improv. In this case a DJ.Its what Williams does with the part that makes GMV so compelling. His livewire performance transforms the entire movie. Without Williams GMV would be a considerably lesser film than it is.Barry Levinson's film is rather unique because it was the first and only one to add a bit of comedy into the Vietnam War. Taking a leaf out of MASH's book it uses the conflict in Saigon as a backdrop for William's barnstorming impressions and impersonations.

Kirby plays the uptight Hauck who can't wait to get his hands on the microphone in way that brings many of the laughs and sets Robin Williams up for more. I continue to use his line and if you doooooo... when someone e.g. my wife or children do not seem to be listening to me intently enough.

After a little while however he starts using jokes that the Sergeants do not approve of e.g. using Presidential voice footage. All the scenes with Robin Williams doing his excellent impressions of famous people are extraordinary. But the funniest scene for me is him talking to voice footage from the President to help with his jokes about his private life. Also starring Forest Whitaker as Pfc.

	schema:reviewBody "Robin Williams stars as Adrian Cronauer an Air Force Deejay who has been brought to Vietnam to be on the airwaves there ostensibly because he was funny when he was a Deejay in Crete. There is a real Adrian Cronauer and this story is based on him but the marketers never advertise this as based on a true story so you know this must be mostly Hollywood at work.Cronauer's style is unique wild wacky crazy with tons of voice impressions and just offthewall stories and personalities streaming out of the head of WilliamsCronhauer into the ears of the troops. It's a huge departure from the typically monotone boring and heavily censored radio entertainment and the troops love it!Forrest Whitaker also stars as Ed Garlick a fellow radio Deejay and kind of the mentor to Cronauer. Once Cronauer gets settled the story centers around two themes 1 his battle against the uptight stations owners played beautifully by J.T. Walsh See Breakdown  great bad guy as the Sgt Major and Bruno Kirby as Lt. Haulk who desperately wants to be funny and believes he is but no he's just not. And 2 his attraction to a young Vietnamese woman he sees passing on the street Trinh played by Chintara Sukapatana who went on to become an actress with some credits. Cronauer develops a friendship with Trinh's brother Tranh and Cronauer slowly realizes that the cultural division between him and Tranh is wide and probably insurmountable. Barry Levinson directs this masterpiece with excellent taut movement from scene to scene  not much wasted moments here. See Rainman and The Natural from some of his other gems.In the end what happens is pretty much what you might expect but it doesn't make it less heartfelt an emotional pull for the viewer. I wouldn't describe this as an antiwar film but more so as a film that encourages you to question the status quo as you go through life which is certainly what Cronauer did in spades.

The troops in the field love him with all his hilarious antics and with him playing the greats in music. But the brass can't stand him and are willing to do anything to get him thrown out of the job. The humor is real enjoyable for everyone young and old. Robin brings in yet another great performance that pleased me my friends and my whole family. 7.210";

	schema:headline " A dull predictable film that's merely a vehicle for Williams's tediously overbearing comedy.";
	schema:reviewBody "There's a great Family Guy cutaway gag in which Peter Griffin and Robin Williams sit on a sofa as Peter names topics such as religion and politics for Williams to comment on. Williams does so with his trademark brand of insufferable overbearing comedy which is filling any amount of time with frenetically incessant rambling. Peter responds simply with an exasperated sigh before leaving for a five minute break which prompts Williams to start yet another barrage of supposedly funny noises. I felt much like Peter Griffin whilst watching Good Morning Vietnam. It reaffirmed my opinion that Williams was not the 'tragicomic genius' that so many purported him to be.Read a short synopsis of Vietnam and you'll know exactly what it's all about the lovable family favourite Robin Williams being kooky charming the troops but clashing with straightlaced humourless authority figures. It's completely predictable and completely trite. They also throw in a love interest for good measure in the form of Trinh Chintara Sukapatana a wholly lifeless woman whom Williams refuses to stop pestering.Williams is never funny during his radio broadcasts however the film repeatedly tells us otherwise showing us scores of characters struggling to hold back their tears of laughter. So many of the supporting actors whether they're random troops or studio operators were just diegetic canned laughter rather than proper characters.Make no mistake Robin Williams isn't playing Adrian Cronauer he's playing Robin Williams at his most loud and rambling. Williams is repeatedly characterised as the lovable clown who brings the people together it's rather nauseating no matter how hard the film tries it cannot convince me that he's either funny or charming only very irritating. Despite this there are some moments that raised a smile such as the language class scenes in which he focuses on New York City street talk rather than the artificial staid sentences of the textbooks.Williams's flatly developed adversaries Lt. Steven Hauk Bruno Kirby and Sgt. Major Dickinson J.T. Walsh are the typical officious military men they develop a resentment towards him that's so instantaneous that it's contrived and unbelievable they're just narrative functions that try and make you feel sorry for Williams the lovable crazy cookie. Both characters aggressively impose their superior ranks on Williams and the other men reminding me of the great Machiavelli quote  'It is not titles that make men illustrious but men who make titles illustrious.' Quite frankly the quote is wasted on a trivial little film like this.It sometimes attempts to be a drama or 'dramedy' with moments of perfunctory war moralising but ultimately Good Morning Vietnam is preoccupied with indulging Williams's penchant for shouting incessantly rather than achieving anything approaching credible commentary or pathos. 45www.hawkensian.com".

In all honesty it would probably turn off many and draw in others. It's full of typical Japanese ecchi humor which isn't bad if you're not a prude a bit of a harem theme going but not in your face about it and an overall feelgood story. It borders on scifi and fantasy although that part of the story isn't fully explained. The focus of the series seems to be on the characters' interactions with the main character. There doesn't seem to be much background plot or direction to the story beyond these interactions. One thing I didn't like was that these interactions became a bit repetitive with each subsequent addition of a new character. The series only has 2 seasons so it didn't get too drawn out like how extremely long series sometimes constantly reuse the same formula.I would recommend this series if you want some laughs and aren't looking for something serious. You would like it even more if you are into fan service or are male. If you hate harem and ecchi themes then you may want to avoid it. The series seemed to be made just for me so I am giving it 9 stars.".

Seriously that's more or less his entire character he is a shameless lecherous pervert who goes to excessive lengths to sneak peeks at girls' bosoms and panties occasionally grabbing them and causing the girls much distress. He always preaches about how he Just wants peace and quiet and yet it's pretty obvious from his interactions with his smokinghot neighbor that he's been like this forever peeking at her and getting karatechopped as a result. He is ALWAYS the one getting in the way of the peace and quiet he so desires and never makes any effort to get his life under control.Look I get that teenagers are notoriously horny but nowhere NEAR Tomoki's hormone levels.

The story follows Tomoki Sakurai and various 'angeloids' angellike androids from world known as The Synapse. While there is a story involving the angeloids that live with Tomoki battling to protect him from those working for Synapse most episodes are intended to be comic rather than dramatic. These comic situations almost entirely revolve around Tomoki trying to see women undressed or trying to grab their breasts his initial success is usually followed up by swift retribution though.While there isn't actual nudity on show this is clearly a fan service show no opportunity to show jiggling cleavage is missed and some of the costumes worn by the angeloids don't cover very much. This led to the series feeling a bit sleazy at times however some of the situations were genuinely amusing the animation looked good and I liked the character designs. Talking of character designs they are frequently shown in 'chibi' form in fact I think Tomoki is shown in this form more than his regular form! If you are looking for something deep give this a miss but if you just want a basic plot and a few laughs then you could do worse. These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.".

These comic situations almost entirely revolve around Tomoki trying to see women undressed or trying to grab their breasts his initial success is usually followed up by swift retribution though.While there isn't actual nudity on show this is clearly a fan service show no opportunity to show jiggling cleavage is missed and some of the costumes worn by the angeloids don't cover very much. This led to the series feeling a bit sleazy at times however some of the situations were genuinely amusing the animation looked good and I liked the character designs. Talking of character designs they are frequently shown in 'chibi' form in fact I think Tomoki is shown in this form more than his regular form! If you are looking for something deep give this a miss but if you just want a basic plot and a few laughs then you could do worse. These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.";

Tony Curtis plays a very funny straight man to Debbie Reynolds and while she may have been attractive for the time the outdated values and generation gap haven't exactly endeared this movie to a whole new generation. While still more enjoyable than it's recent remake Switch with Ellen Barkin and Jimmy Smits the movie almost immediately drags after the opening sequences and sets up a premise that really goes nowhere. Pat Boone's role is seemingly tagged on as is Roger C. Carmel's but Walter Matthau is nearly unrecognizable as a worldly skirtchaser giving Reynolds something to run from.

He is caught by her husband who shoots Charlie who falls overboard into the ocean. Charlie's body is not immediately located but a memorial service is held attended by his best friend George Tony Curtis and dozens of women Charlie romanced over the years. A couple of days later a woman Debbie Reynolds is found naked on the beach outside of Charlie's apartment where George is sorting out Charlie's things. We soon learn that this woman is a female reincarnation of Charlie Sorel apparently God's ironic way of punishing Charlie for the dreadful way he treated women all his life. Charlie initially freaks out at the idea of being a woman but soon shows he hasn't learned a thing and reverts to the old Charlie even though he is a woman now. I was just a kid when this film first hit theaters but I still thought it was pretty funny. Reynolds and Curtis are energetic in the lead roles and are wellsupported by Walter Matthau as the guy who shot Charlie Pat Boone as a schnook who found and falls in love with the reincarnated Charlie and Joanna Barnes and Ellen MacRae as two of the women in old Charlie's life. BTW Ellen MacRae later changed her name to Ellen Burstyn. It's no cinematic masterpiece but it will make you laugh. Remade many years later as SWITCH.".

Bacall's voice in the lower registers as it were probably added a dimension to the performance on stage that could never be appreciated by the screen audience.Charlie was a real cad in life and now coming back as a the beautiful Debbie Reynolds is truly some bad karma coming home to roost. The only one who knows the secret is best friend and fellow writer Tony Curtis who flew in from Biarritz to both be executor of an estate in debt and to preside over a sparsely attended memorial service.In her recent memoir Debbie Reynolds who had worked with Tony Curtis in The Rat Race and had no problems said that Curtis had now taken the side of buddy Eddie Fisher in the breakup of the FisherReynolds wedding. He quoted Eddie and said that she was obviously a lesbian as Fisher's manly charms she eventually found resistible. That set the tone for their relationship off screen.On the other hand Curtis in his memoirs talked about director Vincente Minnelli whom he found super meticulous in his work. Sad to say that Goodbye Charlie though it has some good moments will never be ranked as one of the great films for Curtis Reynolds or Minnelli.".

Hot young folks are dancing while stuffy old agent Martin Gabel looks on with pepticulcer angst. Some handsome matrons Ellen Macrae soon Burstyn Joanna Barnes try to swing with the Playmate but to no avail.

Matthau snoops around in the kitchen of the yacht and gets a gun when the maid isn't lookingthis part of the sequence is like the opening murder sequence in the same December's Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte  Matthau then bursts in on his wife and Charlie starts shooting.Charlie jumps out a porthole into the ocean but Walter's bullets kill him before he hits the drink.The party guests rush to the side of the boat and look down into the ocean where Charlie fell. Credits fly out of the water as a raucous malefemale chorus sings the swinging fun title song Goodbye Charlie! Hate to see you go... What follows is a regulation 1964 animation sequence of deep sea creatures in the deep blue sea where Charlie has gone to rest soon to return as Debbie Reynolds and that infectious title tune about a lothario getting his just desserts. This song got a lot of radio play in '64'65. Vincente Minnelli was a pro and this opening sequence is a lot of fun as the old studio production values in costumes and yacht interior fights with the new handheld camera Playmate of the Year boobs in a raucous singalong opening that bids farewell to Hollywood's studio era and plants the genre as dead as Charlie with the counterculture years ahead.Goodbye Charlie! indeed...hate to see you go.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am going to give this lousy movie a 6 mostly due to the acting of Debbie Reynolds Tony Curtis and best of all Walter Matthau in trying to lift the idiotic plot. Also it's a nod to Vincent Minelli a director who when good is indeed good  but not here.I have nothing against sex in comedy they go hand in hand ever since Aristophanes wrote LYSISTRATA. George Axelrod was no Aristophanes he would barely touch that master's knees. However he could construct plays of interest THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH and he had a hand in the screenplays of a number of first rate film Wilder's version of THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE 1962 version. But this film is crap. The story should be more promising Charlie is the friend of fellow writer George Tony Curtis and both are ladies men. While on the yacht of Hollywood producer Sir Leopold Sartori Matthau he makes a play for Lady Rusty Sartori Laura Devon and is caught by the husband. What follows may be based on the popular idea of the fate of film producer Thomas Ince in 1924 on William Randolph Hearst's yacht. Charlie is shot dead jumping overboard. His body is not recovered. Friend George is supposed to handle the funeral. Only a few people show up  Charlie's sex escapades and his debts left him with few friends. George finds he has been left executor of a bankrupt and debt encrusted estate and he can't do anything to fix it.Shortly after all the mourners leave and after George falls asleep his doorbell is knocked on. He finds a young man named Bruce Minton III Pat Boone with a woman who seems to be in shock. The woman is Debbie Reynolds whom Minton found wondering around the highway naked and dazed. Minton does put her into his coat but deposits her out of necessity  for want of any sensible explanation with an outraged George. George allows her to spend the night but the next day she suddenly reveals that she is the dead Charlie cruelly reincarnated as a woman albeit an attractive woman. When George finally realizes this he tries to help Charlie get back to normal. But Charlie has other ideas. Like blackmailing old girlfriends and romancing every man in Hollywood  starting with Sir Leopold whom heshe owes a favor to.That is the foundation of this story. There have been attempts to do justice to reincarnation stories but this is hardly the best attempt. Axelrod basically gets his best jabs when the female Charlie keeps acting too masculine heshe slaps the rear of a female employee of the beauty parlor heshe is attending. That Charlie and George inevitably start falling for each other despite their mutual realization of how sick the situation is is inevitable but it too is not funny.Still as I said the leads and some of the supporting actors including an upandcoming Ellen Burstyn give a good try for it. Best is Matthau who despite a poor Hungarian accent does well as Sir Leopold a film clone of the real English movie producermogul Sir Alexander Korda who was married to the gorgeous Merle Oberon for many years. He is childish monstrous and inept in trying to be smooth at the same time. But this material is lousy and it is a monument to Matthau's ability that he pushes it as far as he can. Reynolds is too shrill at times at the transformation she has suffered and is best as the poisonous blackmaileruser. Curtis is fine but has few moments to rise in the material given him. Boone does well but he has little to do but look like a lovesick puppy dog towards Reynolds.See it once for the cast and Minelli and then never watch it again if you can avoid it.".

Debbie Reynolds was beigehaired Tony Curtis getting on. Overlymounted pastelcolored movies bored me  hitless and this was another endofanera whitebread piece of rubbish. Doris Day and Sandra Dee were what the Sixties had degenerated into broad trite and forced. Besides there were wellknown rumors about Debbie's pinchhitting proclivities. The premise of Goodbye Charlie was awkward and perverse. I suspected that Hollywood was presenting it as an inside joke. So 35 years later I tried it again on TMC. ...And I LOVED it. Well much of it. I loved gorgeous Ellen Burstyn and Joanna Barnes  indeed the scene at The Bistro Restaurant with these latter two and Reynolds had me pg myself if you'll forgive the vulgarity. Ms. Barnes can do no wrong as a character playing straight when someone is putting the screws to her. Her slanteyed cool demeanor is pure joy. The fact that Vincent Minnelli directed it and that George Axelrod wrote the script was an important revelation. What's more I thought that the ladies' dresses were magnificent. How well they dressed back then! And when Walter Matthau said If I weren't Hungarian I'd be speechless! is a classic retort. I loved his character also  and he's a man who's garnered so much praise over the years that I usually just roll my eyes when I see him. He looked smart as paint in his black tie and toupee  and the way he worked the room when he's sprung from jail was utterly delicious. In the final quarter hour when I saw where the film was headed I switched stations unwilling to have my favorable impressions destroyed. Axlerod is a master and I'm sorry to have given him short shrift for so many years. Those who want to see a quintessential Sixties movie along with some ribtickling oneliners want to go with this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "When the film begins a notorious womanizer Charlie is caught with another man's wife and is shot to death. Soon there's a funeral and his friend George Tony Curtis arrives to do the eulogy. However almost no one shows up...because Charlie spent his life using people not paying debts and bedding any woman who fell for his spiel. Good riddance seems to be the mood of the day.Soon there's a knock on the door to Charlie's home and since George is the executor he answers. A young man Pat Boone is there with a naked woman in a blanket. He isn't sure who she is but she gave this address but was otherwise delirious. When she later awakens it becomes obvious that this IS Charliereincarnated as a woman Debbie Reynolds. At first it's pretty obvious that Charlie had nothing but contempt for women and hates his new body. However soon an interesting change comes over him. Perhaps he can use and take advantage of people BETTER as a woman and Charlie begins using her wiles to get ahead in life. She shamelessly flirts and blackmails some of the rich married women Charlie used to sleep with in his male days. Why George hangs out with Charlie throughout much of the film is odd as George doesn't seem like a total jerk. Charlie on the other hand is goshdarn awful both as a man and as a woman.So what you have is a racy 60s sex comedy...minus the sex. The idea is pretty cute original and I generally enjoyed the movie. However I did think the film went on a bit too long and the picture lost a bit of its momentum as a result. For the first half I'd give this one a 7 or 8...for the final half a 4 or 5.By the way Walter Matthau's accent was just awful and I assume he must have been really embarrassed by this performance.".

Charlie on the other hand is goshdarn awful both as a man and as a woman.So what you have is a racy 60s sex comedy...minus the sex. The idea is pretty cute original and I generally enjoyed the movie. However I did think the film went on a bit too long and the picture lost a bit of its momentum as a result. For the first half I'd give this one a 7 or 8...for the final half a 4 or 5.By the way Walter Matthau's accent was just awful and I assume he must have been really embarrassed by this performance.";

Namely that it was directed by the very capable Vincente Minnelli who was very very good when at his best. It is hard to resist actors of such likeability in Tony Curtis and Debbie Reynolds and Walter Matthau is also always well worth the while. The idea did intrigue somewhat.Yet somehow 'Goodbye Charlie' really didn't do an awful lot for me. Not a complete misfire of a film by all means but considering the huge potential and how much talent there was involved it was disappointing by quite a big degree. It's not terrible and certainly not a must avoid it's also not particularly good either and has its faults for me 'Goodbye Charlie' was a mixed bag sort of film that's difficult to rate and review.'Goodbye Charlie' looks good there is an elegant glossy sheen to the cinematography and the settings and especially the costumes are beautiful to watch. The music is dynamic and easy on the ears. Minnelli directs stylishly.Curtis has a tricky role that makes him less likeable than his usual persona he brings charm and grit to it. Reynolds tries too hard at times but acts with enthusiasm and commitment. Pat Boone makes the most of his rather thankless role. The best performance even with the questionable Hungarian accent comes from Matthau having a whale of a time. There is some nice wit in the script the best line from the whole film coming from Mattheau concerning him being left speechless if he wasn't Hungarian and Curtis and Reynolds's chemistry sparkles. Interesting seeing an early appearance from Ellen Burstyn and the opening is a delight.However the wit is very largely variable sometimes it is there but at others and too frequently so it's not. There is a fair bit of smut here and it's not done in a snappy or sophisticated way and is not particularly funny. Instead it's not always in good taste much of it actually vulgar and likely to make one feel uncomfortable it doesn't hold up particularly well. The story does have issues with pacing with some aimless dragging going on and the film doesn't really go very far as an overall whole. It does run out of steam and ideas too early and the initially good concept wears thin and gets silly and overstretched the story too thin for the overlong running time. The supporting cast generally are wasted Boone deserved better and some of the characters felt incidental completely to the story and like they were there for padding reasons. The ending does betray the running out of ideas it felt very tacked on and anticlimactic almost like a copout.Overall good production values and cast but the script and story needed a lot of work. 510 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "I liked Debbie Reynolds who nonetheless looked as if she could be as bland as the movie's main quirk a trope met from Topper and Capra to movies with Pitt or Bridges always lacking eeriness but here she wasn't she gives some kind of a Method acting playing a man being a woman she made a good role I liked Curtis' talk with Carmel about felonies and the 'Psycho' spoof with the cellar and the inspector in the street.The script showcases a guy's strong wish to know that his deceased friend has been redeemed saved. From exhaustion alcohol and hunger he sleeps and in his dream his demised pal shows up as a girl this way George mourns him by expressing his asexual love for his friend and also gets a 2nd chance to behave better . It has all been a dream. And in his dream the writer saw his friend redeemed. Charlie has been dead all along since the opening scene. And instead of Charlie returning from his ocean rest a dog will guard George's newfound love. Let us distinguish idea quirk look style the idea is of the dream and redemption with mourning and longing the quirk is the mentioned trope the look is astonishing the style is a '60s salad.I enjoyed the '60s glamor. There are parties with nice statuesque shapely women. Joanna Barnes Laura Devon Myrna Hansen are so goodlooking and so is the movie itself which I expected from so reputed a director but in fact this is a modest glam comedy a few scenes were good once the spoof begins not very inspired or funny averagely amusing certainly not always in the best taste.I have read somewhere an obviously wrong plot summary 1st all could have been George's dream from drunkenness and hunger and in fact it has all been a dream since the blonde who shows up at the denouement and her dog have previous lives a past they don't just show up mysteriously claiming to be another beings and 2nd Charlie isn't punished again but released redeemed for her unwillingness to take advantage of the inexperienced guy who proposed her Charlie behaved better as a woman ceased manipulating others. The idea being that in George's dream Charlie did 'change his ways' became better. But the director wished to save the twist for the denouement instead of allowing it to permeate the plot to shine from inside the plot.The screwball and the satire were mediocre the spoof worked. It didn't seem to me like a good movie though it has exciting or very satisfying scenes because of the lousy script which was however a hit there's an American infatuation with this kind of bland fantasy about the dead being given more time on Earth and its soullessness its glamorizing of shallow beings not entirely but almost devoid of humane reactions though the idea of the script certainly has charm which as a matter of fact in retrospect subverts the soullessness as it has all been George's longing his search for a redemptive solution so I rank it as a charming movie as a '60s salad of glamor. There's a Protestant tale of retribution expectably devoid of dramatic force and a glam comedy. One's not supposed to be awed by the director or the fame. I mostly dislike the quirk of the script the avatars of a dead person the idea of justice because of its defining blandness seen in countless other movies it has a Protestant flavor but it's something that apparently the American audiences enjoy. Otherwise the comedy made in a glam style seems a bit heartless a bit soulless though the twist might change this as it has been George's way of dreaming a generous resolution of seeing his friend redeemed saved changed albeit posthumously and its satire and social world uninspiring.".

The idea being that in George's dream Charlie did 'change his ways' became better. But the director wished to save the twist for the denouement instead of allowing it to permeate the plot to shine from inside the plot.The screwball and the satire were mediocre the spoof worked. It didn't seem to me like a good movie though it has exciting or very satisfying scenes because of the lousy script which was however a hit there's an American infatuation with this kind of bland fantasy about the dead being given more time on Earth and its soullessness its glamorizing of shallow beings not entirely but almost devoid of humane reactions though the idea of the script certainly has charm which as a matter of fact in retrospect subverts the soullessness as it has all been George's longing his search for a redemptive solution so I rank it as a charming movie as a '60s salad of glamor. There's a Protestant tale of retribution expectably devoid of dramatic force and a glam comedy. One's not supposed to be awed by the director or the fame. I mostly dislike the quirk of the script the avatars of a dead person the idea of justice because of its defining blandness seen in countless other movies it has a Protestant flavor but it's something that apparently the American audiences enjoy. Otherwise the comedy made in a glam style seems a bit heartless a bit soulless though the twist might change this as it has been George's way of dreaming a generous resolution of seeing his friend redeemed saved changed albeit posthumously and its satire and social world uninspiring.";

I think the greatest problem I have with the film is the way it seems purposely gay then at the last minute chickens out. The copout ending is truly problematic and undermines everything that came earlier in the story.I have not seen the stage play or read it. But my guess is the play did not end the way the movie did. I am thinking Fox decided to tack on the phony ending to ensure its commercial success and make it seem less gay by the final fadeout. Spoilers ahead for those who have not seen it yet.This story based on George Axelrod's play seems inspired by Thorne Smith's gender switching comedy TURNABOUT which was already filmed in 1940. In GOODBYE CHARLIE the leading man Tony Curtis has realized he's developed feelings for the girl Debbie Reynolds who is his old skirtchasing pal Charlie now reincarnated. At one point in the story Reynolds' character realizes this is a karmic justice of sorts and Curtis says she's gone from being a pitcher to a catcher. Clearly a reference to the versatility of gay sex.However in order to give the audience a more mainstream happy ending Charlene as she's now called falls to her death again then Tony's character says it is probably for the best. A short time later another woman out for a stroll along the beach comes up to the house and she's also played by Debbie Reynolds. She looks exactly like CharlieCharlene and when it's discovered she's single we're led to believe these two will wind up together. A point in the dialogue is made that the new woman at the end has always been a girl never a boy. Nothing has properly foreshadowed the tacked on resolution. It totally comes out of left field. A silly compromise is even included where the woman has a Great Dane that is named Charlie.Overall I think this is a disappointing film that until the last five minutes had a lot going for it. There's even a nice subplot with a rich mama's boy Pat Boone who falls for Charlene and proposes marriage. She turns him down but that can be read as the young man being really attracted to another man which is just dropped when the engagement falls through. Given all Axelrod's humor about the sexes and clever use of reverse psychology the story hashad great potential to show that love comes in all forms. But such a wonderful lesson is abruptly discarded so that the film can have a completely heterosexual finale. I can't help but think it would have been made more correctly in Europe. It truly deserved an ambiguous ending that made us think about the real nature of bonding friendship and love.".

The owner of the club and criminal to boot Raymond Blossom takes an interest in Eugene and begins using him and his doctor.  However the FBI are after Raymond and make moves to use Eugene to trap him.Coming off as a slightly upmarket video thriller this film could have been much better but ultimately fails to engage or rise to it's potential.  The plot is OK but the script doesn't manage to lift the story up into something that is really strong and engaging.  The delivery is a big part of the problem  it isn't that well directed nothing very wrong but certainly the feel of a video film as opposed to a big screen thriller.  The decision to have a voice over narrator is always a gamble sometimes it works but sometimes it really doesn't.Here the narration doesn't work for two reasons. First of all the narrator has to explain or develop so much because the film fails to do it as part of the story being told.  To make matters worse Duchovny delivery is so flat that it really sucks any energy out of the film.  His actual performance is not as bad as his voiceover but he doesn't exactly manage to lead the film. This leaves the way open for Hutton's villain but he struggles with a lack of character and eventually gives into overacting.  Jolie is good but again suffers from having no character.  Regardless of performances not having any buy in with the main people meant that I wasn't into the story as I needed to be.  Support from Massee Stormare and Dourdan doesn't so much add quality as add familiarity.Overall this was very much a workmanlike thriller.  It is passable but really it is difficult to overlook the fact that the film has major weaknesses in most areas.  The plot is good but the script can't do anything with it the narration is rubbish and the acting is only reasonable on the whole.  Worth watching once but it's hard not to feel let down by it.".

How could the monotoned actor possibly compete with Jolie's natural power on the screen?  But surprisingly the two had the kind of chemistry that showed intense caring without a kiss.  Even David's humor matched up to Jolie's spark and fire.  As for Hutton he played the psycho very well contrasting with David's calm delivery of life threatening situations.  Overall I was very impressed with the writing and character development.  I gave it 8 stars.".

The premise is interesting and the script although at times uneven has moments of poetic lyricism and some nice touches. So . . . what happened? The finger must be pointed at the performances which fail to capture the essence of the screenplay. David Duchovny is cast against type as a drugaddled exphysician and Timothy Hutton's portrayal of gangster Raymond Blossom borders on the plane of villainy and its cariacture. Duchovny whose deadpan delivery and solemn glances work fine in the XFiles must realize that the role he's playing here is NOT Fox Mulder but a much more unsympathetic character. Grade C".

I wasn't even aware that Angelina Jolie was in this. I'm not a great fan of David Duchovny. Timothy Hutton I expected to play his usual 'charming criminal role' and not do much more. That said I was truly pleasantly surprised. The film had a nice even pace lots of bloodspattering gun play and very little sex. In fact I don't recall Angelina Jolie planting those huge lips of hers on anybody. Hmmm.David Duchovny played his part to perfection. Next to Angelina Jolie his slouching casual self muted by his dope habit could have easily been a drooling fool captivated by her 'loose woman' persona. Instead befitting an ultracool guy with years of education and socialization behind him he turned it way down and was the cool hipster dealing with really evil hipsters who like himself always had some drugs in a pocket or the glove compartment. And like a cool hipster he naturally kept encountering more and more cool hipsters. Like the bikers on the road who turn out to be allies when he is on the run.He had great lines as did Timothy Hutton. He showed a mastery of timing as did Timothy Hutton. Angelina kind of passed from man to man looking beautiful but NOT having great lines and not having much of a history. I am glad I ordered this film from Amazon and finally got to see it. It was satisfying if you like any of the aforementioned actors. I liked Angelina Jolie in this film and I usually don't. She just looked good  good enough to make men want her but not interesting enough for anyone to want to get to know her.".

He overplays his character he overspeaks his lines and he's just outplayed in all ways by Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie who are each in a class above him in terms of acting skill. Timothy Hutton was as always really good. There was a spotty moment or two where he overdramatized his role but you could tell he was having fun with it. He looked the part and he became the character both physically and atmospherically. Angelina Jolie was also really good. She didn't have much of a role in fact I though she could have used a much stronger one...her character wasn't nearly developed enough though she did remarkably well with what she had. And the chemistry between her and Hutton was apparent gee maybe that's why Uma left him... All in all it was rough around the edges but a solid effort by a good cast and great supporting roles.

Instead of trying to save his shattered career he chose to take the easy road to addiction. As the movie opens he is trying to buy heroine in a bar when a man is shot in argument. Quick thinking Dr. Sands becomes McGyver and fashions a breathing apparatus out of a coke bottle.His quick thinking saves the man's life and captures the attention of Claire Angelina Jolie. She is so impressed that the next thing he knows he is being invited to the home of millionaire Raymond Blossom Timothy Hutton. Blossom offers the good doctor a job in which he will be paid to take care of some of his friends who run into let's just say some unfortunate gunshot wounds of which hospitals would ask too many questions.The story is of course completely stupid and so is Duchovny's quicksilver surgical methods. But it didn't bother me because the realm of this kind of hardboiled story allows it some freedom. It's helped by Duchovny who is a good looking guy but doesn't seem to be standing around posing all the time. He isn't afraid to look foolish a quality the most actor's shy away from.Hutton is never a slouch he goes into even the most tedious screenplay and acts his heart out. Playing the villain is easy when all you have to do is look mean kill people and issue threats. But Hutton as Blossom allows us to see what seduced him to his life of crime in the first place. He is an amazing presence in this film because watching him I'm drawn into his character so that I more easily identify with him.Angelina Jolie is a rare case of a gorgeous young woman who doesn't just stand around behind the actors. There is an intelligent person beneath her looks and her screen presence is as welcome as her looks. She could step into the window dressing in this film and simply be the object of lust but we sense a smart woman who is a sucker for a stray dog like Sands.We know that what we are watching is preposterous but with these three wonderful actors they are able to break away from the confines of the screenplay and absorb us.".

I cannot even explain why he is a fair actor but probably his moment of fame cast him in a eternal role that takes big talent to break from.At the same time Angelina Jolie was much less known and she was really lucky that a film like 'Playing God' did not led her career into a deadend. Fortunately for her 'The Bone Collector' and 'Girl Interrupted' were waiting beyond the corner and when Lara Croft came her career was launched.There is not too much to be told about this film. It's the only big screen film of Andy Wilson and there must be a reason. All is banal and most of what happens on the screen expected in this story of an exdoctor who saves the life of a shooting victim in a bar only to find himself working for the mob. The offscreen voice is especially bad with a moralistic text that kills any shade of cinematographic experience from the film. You probably will not meet the film but in DVD rental stores or on TV.

The story begins as a police detective although devoted to his wife and young son has entered into an affair with a society girl also married and while they are parked out in the boonies on a lonely road they witness a murder. The detective because of the circumstances of being where he is for the reason he is there does not attempt to catch the killer and does not report the crime. He is later assigned the case and soon realizes that an innocent man is about to take the blame and the only way he can clear him is to arrest the killer and become a witness against him.

She is really something. What a pity she did not achieve the status in films which she clearly deserved. Here she plays a hyperglamorous psychotic maneater. Poor bumbling homicide detective Gargan is no match for her. He succumbs and succumbs and succumbs. Well one evening things get complicated. One has to remember that he is happily married to sweetie Martha played with big loving eyes and a warm smile by 'Jeff' Donnell she was born Jean Marie but was always called by the nickname of Jeff see her also as Sylvia Nicolai in IN A LONELY PLACE 1950 and adores his son. But there he is sitting in a car in a lover's retreat off the road with Miss Glamourpuss doing his usual succumbing when another car pulls up and does not see them. The man proceeds to bash in the skull of the girl and then runs off but not before they see his face very clearly in the headlights. It later transpires that Janis knows the man very well but she says nothing at the time. Gargan starts to give chase but then realizes that he dare not do so because his involvement with Janis will come to light and his wife might leave him. So he endures an enforced silence and is then a member of the homicide team which investigates that very crime. A wrong man is accused and is about to 'get the chair'. Tension mounts. Should he do the right thing and stop the execution at the risk of his career and his marriage? He wants to but Janis is going crazier and crazier. She is so nuts that she makes statements like 'I don't know why I do these things' as she tries to stab a man to death. Just the kind of girlfriend one wants! She is a rich socialite and highly sophisticated thus intimidating the humble Gargan further. As he bitterly says to her at one point 'You and I both add up to zero.' Every time he tries to leave her she kisses him which all goes to show just how dangerous kissing can be. After they have seen the murder Janis gets a wild look in her eye and in the midst of a seizure of psychotic excitement says she wants to go and look at the girl's bashedin skull and all the brains spattered all over the car because it excites her and Gargan restrains her only with great difficulty. Janis really is very convincing in all of these scenes and it is all pretty hairraising. And so the story progresses. I must not reveal the ending. The next year Janis went on to scare people further in FRAMED 1947.".

You can tell this is true because the film has no real stars in itjust career supporting actors like William Gargan. It just so happens that I watched another Gargan Bfilm a few days ago Behind Green Lights and thought he was great in the filmas he usually is. But I must admit Night Editor is not one of Gargan's best performances. The reason I say this is that his character behaves too distracted through much of the film and he comes off as almost like a zombie cop! I assume the director told him to emote that wayand it was a shame as apart from that it was an exceptional film.The movie begins with some old time reporters telling a young guy the story of a cop who stayed away from home too oftenand its consequences. It seems that the cop Gargan was working many late nightsmostly because he was cheating on his wife. The 'other woman' it turns out is among the very worst and most evil of all the film noir dames I've ever seen. It's almost as if she isn't quite human because of her strange and unnatural nature.One night when he is parked in a lonely place with this platinum blonde dame a very brutal murder occurs right before their eyes. The cop sadly freezes. He COULD have possibly apprehended the murderer but frozeworried about how he could explain his being there with another woman. As for the woman instead of being shocked she actually is turned on by it and wants to see the corpse!! She calls out to her shocked lover to stop so they can take a peekbut he speeds off instead.The next day the victim is found and he among others is sent to investigate. He saw the murder and murderer but must pretend to know nothing about it or risk ruining his life. But when an innocent man is later arrested and sentenced to death for the killing his conscience gets the best of himhe must prove who really did the killingeven if it ruins his life. However now his lover is his ex and she is in a very sick twist dating the murderershe finds him very exciting!!! This sick fascination with violence of the dame combined with the brutality of the killing with a tire ironand they show some of this and the use of rough noir phrases like meat wagon make this an unusually gritty and realistic cop film. This is by far the best aspect of this simple little film. In addition by the end of the film you've got a great conclusion that leaves you impressed. All in all a very effective film and a great film for the money spent making it.Worth seeingand a mustsee for fans of the genre.".

	schema:reviewBody "minor spoilers but not really Looks like this film was made into a TV series aboot 8 years later... film  TV show both written by Hal Burdick. In the film a police detective Tony Cochrane William Gargan is assigned to a murder case where he has a personal connection and could be implicated even though he did NOT commit the moidah. Gargan often played the police officer or detective. VERY similar to 1987 movie No Way Out with Kevin Costner where he also has a connection to the murder and may be implicated.

In the film a police detective Tony Cochrane William Gargan is assigned to a murder case where he has a personal connection and could be implicated even though he did NOT commit the moidah. Gargan often played the police officer or detective. VERY similar to 1987 movie No Way Out with Kevin Costner where he also has a connection to the murder and may be implicated.

It is the tale of policeman William Gargan Tony who is playing away from home with Janis Carter Jill. One night they witness a murder but Gargan hesitates in pursuing the culprit for the sake of revealing his affair and bringing shame upon himself. The murder is investigated by his homicide team but things don't sit comfortably with him when an innocent man is sentenced to death for the crime. He holds the key to a stay of execution but will he reveal his hand? The film gets off to a slow start  the first fifteen minutes are actually quite annoying as we have to suffer some crass dialogue from a boy eg I get lonesome sometimes. It's unrealistic dialogue and makes the boy seem like a drip. You can actually see why Gargan is having an affair when we are also introduced to the sickly nice Jeff Donnell Martha who plays his wife. If you can get past the rather sentimentally awful beginning then you will be rewarded as scheming Janis Carter makes an appearance.As regards the cast everyone has good and bad moments Janis Carter is unintentionally hilarious when she loses control of her emotions and begs to see the dead body of the murdered woman Paul E Burns Strom puts on an awful foreign accent from nowhere but succeeds in being likable as Gargan's police buddy while Gargan himself is a bit too zombielike on occasion.Despite the cast being slightly off the film still works and the story keeps you watching.

There's nothing like viewing a mangled dead body to get some spider women off and Jill's some kind of coldhearted 40's temptress. Too bad cop Cochrane Gargan doesn't run for the hills or maybe even his loving wife after viewing this little perverse episode. Instead he covers up the murder he and Jill just eyeballed. After all neither wives nor city fathers reward philandering husbands. So how is Cochrane going to clear his conscience once an innocent man is about to get fried for a murder the two illicit lovers know he didn't commit.My guess is Night Editor was hoping to repeat the success of the noirish Whistler series also adapted from radio. It didn't happen but not because of a failure in this 60minutes. Sure it wraps up in conventional fashion even if imaginatively done. After all there was a stultifying Production Code in effect. Still the other 55minutes amounts to a nailbiting trip down black shadow lane. Actor Gargan may not show much emotion as the conflicted cop. But then he's got to keep his real feelings inside. Otherwise he might give it all away which includes not just his job but wife and family as well. So how did he get mixed up with the blonde maneater in the first place. Apparently it was from working on a prior case that involved Jill and her ritzy clueless husband. It appears she sets a mean trap for about every guy crossing her predatory path including bank presidents.No doubt about it Jill's on the very edge of 40's perversity. Carter really looks the part of blonde icequeen even if nuance is not her strong point. I was hoping for some bigeye closeups that made her similar role in Framed 1947 so memorable but director Levin's camera stays mainly at a neutral distance. On the whole it's the script and dark material that carry events.Anyway this early noir is a neglected mustsee. I'm not going to say gem since it doesn't quite rise to that level. Still for sheer 1940's daring Harold Smith's crafty little screenplay remains an eyeopener.".

Yes it has many trappings of the noir narrative the detective in a moral quandary a femme fatale heroic figures giving in to temptations smokefilled nighttime offices and cars parked in lonely ditches. But this story is told via flashback by a seemingly unrelated night editor of a newspaper playing cards and attempting to enlighten an employee who's been giving in to temptations himself. It turns into a plodding oversimplified morality play like one of those original stage productions about depression or quitting drugs in nonprofit houses performed by nonactors reading their scripts in hand in front of an audience purely comprised of friends and family. Its ending is painfully trite and manipulated and the only reason it's considered a noir is because it's a B film from the 1950s with the trappings listed above not because any fatalistic themes or challenging drama comes organically from the material.Though the majority of the movie is a prolonged flashback set in the early 1930s absolutely nothing would have seemed out of place in a contemporary story set in the mid1940s from music to dcor to hairstyles to wardrobe. I guess it doesn't matter. I don't think we're supposed to feel the time is important so no attention is really paid to its details. There's a different though between playing with narrative time and ignoring it. The difference is not absolute. Nothing is in my opinion when it comes to making a good movie. Sometimes we love certain movies for the same reasons that other ones disappoint us so here the issue could easily lie more squarely in the realm of the drama's believability than technical points.The clich portrayed in so many impressions of oldmovie acting seem epitomized in Night Editor. The characters so frequently come off as if they've prepared to change their minds prepared to feel a new emotion prepared to experience a big realization act in response comprehend when if the actors and filmmakers want us to be with them on those feelings they need to be completely instinctive natural things particularly in a lifeordeath state of affairs involving murder or the outing of devastating secrets. The acting feels so affected and put on indicating changes instead of allowing them. Janis Carter is intriguing regardless because she perfectly befits the calculating society dame who gets her thrill by being exceedingly cold and injurious. She's devious hardhearted and knows how to employ sex to get what she wants.Based on a radio series it was designed to launch a film series that never materialized. My guess is that the aim was to create a string of hourlong B films like this one each a different story our eponymous editor would impart. But what of this editor? What does this outer story have to do with the inner one? William Gargan is the noir protagonist who has everything he wants and is not happy in spite of it all until he tumbles and sees what he'll lose. That's interesting but having his story surrounded by a moral presenttense waters it all down and all the dark austerity of the night scenes and the dimension of cheap tawdry lives is all rendered insignificant because by the end it's as if we've played the parts of children being told an old wives' tale about what naughty things not to do or else.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me see her! the extremely kinky Janis Carter demands after witnessing a brutal murder of a young woman with her married lover William Gargan who happens to be one of the officers involved in the investigation. Carter and Gargan saw who the killer was but can't reveal their identity because it would expose the affair and hurt Gargan's somewhat clingy wife Jeff Donnell. Carter too has something to loose being married to a very powerful man and not wanting to give that up. Wht is a supposedly honest police officer to do?Told in flashback this B noir is a neat sleeper and while far from perfect it is quite daring considering that the Hays code was still in effect and this came to breaking a few major rules. Janis Carter is a vixen with claws sharper than any Jurassic Park clone and obviously a bit kinky in her need for physical love. She rivals Stanwyck Joan Bennett Ann Savage and Jane Greer in ferocity. Even if this vixen isn't a killer here you know she has that capability.The theme is retribution how the cheating husband learns the truth about his selfish lover and has to be nearly destroyed to come to his senses and truly atone. While there are certainly better examples of true film noir this one is an interesting entry with different elements in plot style and execution.".

	onyx:emotionText "Let me see her! the extremely kinky Janis Carter demands after witnessing a brutal murder of a young woman with her married lover William Gargan who happens to be one of the officers involved in the investigation. Carter and Gargan saw who the killer was but can't reveal their identity because it would expose the affair and hurt Gargan's somewhat clingy wife Jeff Donnell. Carter too has something to loose being married to a very powerful man and not wanting to give that up. Wht is a supposedly honest police officer to do?Told in flashback this B noir is a neat sleeper and while far from perfect it is quite daring considering that the Hays code was still in effect and this came to breaking a few major rules. Janis Carter is a vixen with claws sharper than any Jurassic Park clone and obviously a bit kinky in her need for physical love. She rivals Stanwyck Joan Bennett Ann Savage and Jane Greer in ferocity. Even if this vixen isn't a killer here you know she has that capability.The theme is retribution how the cheating husband learns the truth about his selfish lover and has to be nearly destroyed to come to his senses and truly atone. While there are certainly better examples of true film noir this one is an interesting entry with different elements in plot style and execution.";

	schema:reviewBody "A legendary flop and a legendarily bad movie this mess is part three in a careerkilling trilogy of Travolta's that also includes Staying Alive and Two of a Kind.  It took him a long time to bounce back.  It also stalled Curtis's career for a while until A Fish Called Wanda rescued her.  The story such as it is concerns Travolta a Rolling Stone magazine reporter looking for a story angle within a huge gymnasium at the height of the aerobics and fitness craze.  He's already working on another more important story but wants this as a backup in case an allimportant interview falls through.  He zeroes in on highprofile aerobics instructor Curtis who has a huge following which often kisses her on the mouth following one of her workouts!  Unfortunately she's had a major disaster with a reporter in the past and resists being interviewed for his story.  In order for there to be a movie he must wear her down and get her assistance even though there are 90 other instructors at this megagym.  The film is very unfocused and disjointed throughout.  It tries to be too many things  a reflection of investigative journalism an ethics drama an examination of selfesteem issues a music video crashcourse in Jazzercise and most obviously a jiggle movie with emphasis on lycraclad spread legs and tight behinds.  The script is so crass and stupid with ludicrous lines like You're a sphincter muscle... this one is repeated often! and unnecessary subplots which lead nowhere.  Travolta is awful.  He speaks his lines with his mouth almost open stares blankly with no skill at conveying what's on his mind and in the films most celebratedly horrendous scene gyrates his bulging crotch at the camera ad nauseam while sweat trickles down his pale clammy face and body.  Curtis looks very fresh and attractive most of the film if a bit sexually ambiguous eschewing the huge hair and heavy makeup of the times. Her character is a little too selfrighteous but her acting is better than anyone else around.  Wenner a nonactor provides a jarring presence whenever he appears because he along with several other real people cast in the film hasn't got the polish to really sell his role even though it reflects his position in real life as the founder of Rolling Stone!  Most of the other actors in the film either overact horrendously or flatline. More importantly the audience does not care about anyone in the film and so does not care when various events and revelations come about.  There is some inherent camp value in revisiting the hilarious workout clothes of the 80's and in hearing the bouncy tacky music of the era but the movie is way too long for it's subject matter and the music montages wear out their welcome very quickly.  And for all the sweating and gyration there are no sex scenes in the film.  Look out for pansexual Burt Reynolds lookalike and alleged Travolta bed partner Barresi in the cast as a gym rat eager to show off his body.".

But after persevering with the movie a couple of times more I enjoyed it. I even changed my mind on Travolta's performance and realised what he actually tried to doa mixture of anger frustration fatigue mild charmall of which are attributed to a workaholic Rolling Stone journalist such as his character Adam. The music has a pulsating beat although I do admit some songs on the film's soundtrack are better than others but the music does seem to carry this film along. Curtis is dazzling in her role as the 'Aerobics Pied Piper.'Her sexy body and amazing legs are a plus for this movie. Jann Wenner deserves special mention even though he's probably playing himself considering he was then the editor and now owner of Rolling Stone Magazine. This is a real 80s movie and a strange theme involving both journalism and aerobics somehow merging together. Travolta and Curtis both do a great job in their roles bringing a contrast of characters in their relationship. I didn't however like the beginning or ending credits at all. The beginning was just basic and statica list of credits against a plain background. The ending wasn't great eitherBerlin's 'Masquerade' song which is in my opinion a weak link in the film's soundtrack plays on while ALL of the key characters do aerobics...Is that realistic? Bizarre. I rather liked it when Curtis meets Travolta at the end and they drive off. There is when it should have ended. But I guess all in all an entertaining mid80s movie.".

	schema:headline " Perfect? It's anything but!";
	schema:reviewBody "My Goodness what a bomb! We didn't drop anything this big on Iraq!Perfect is the story of a Rolling Stone reporter Travolta who trips over his ethics or lack there of while writing two big stories. His first story deals with a computer tycoon in hot water with the U.S. government for selling his products to an EasternBloc country. This angle is played way up considering the lack of details we are told about the situation. No matter the story you will remember deals with a swanky health club in L.A.. Travolta wishes to write a piece about how health clubs in the 1980s are replacing the singles bars of the 1970s as the 1 place for people to meet. Take that premise and see how long you can stretch it. Director Bridges apparently thought he could drag it out for nearly two hours and still keep our attention.This film suffers from a severe lack of focus. There are too many location changes to count. There is also too much running around and too much time wasted on insignificant little things. For example what was up with Travolta's sudden trip to Morocco near the end of the film. It had no purpose what so ever! Another problem this film has is its tendency to drag out every scene to last as long as whatever cheesy 80s dance song is playing in the background. That gets old pretty darn quick.This film is also hopelessly dated in terms of fashion. If any guy came into my health club wearing tights or a fishnet tank top he'd probably get beaten up. Bridges  CO also try to recycle a gag that worked in Urban Cowboy. In that film there was a scene featuring numerous women dressed up for a Dolly Parton lookalike contest. In this film we get about a hundred people dressed up as Boy George in a scene at a hotel. In Urban Cowboy it worked since there was a legitimate reason for all the people to dress that way. They were at least trying to win a contest. The scene in Perfect is useless and it only serves to date the film even further. This film was by no means Travolta's worst. Has anyone seen The Experts or Shout? This film did however have his most embarrassing scene. In it he's sweating away in Jamie Lee Curtis's aerobics class and doing a neverending series of pelvic thrusts to the dance beat. His crotch has obviously been stuffed with a sock or perhaps the thing Hammer used in his Pumps in a Bump video. Truly hilarious!Travolta is a talented actor but he has nothing to work with here. Jamie Lee Curtis is also a great talent but she is wasted as well. She looks absolutely gorgeous but her character is so moody and abrasive that we can hardly stand her. The supporting cast of mostly unknowns fills out their respective stereotypical roles as well as they can.In all this is a poor film on all levels. It tries to be an insightful look at journalistic ethics and falls flat on its face. It comes off as being little more than a two hour plug for Rolling Stone Magazine. Too Bad.3 of 10 starsSo sayeth the Hound.".

	onyx:emotionText "My Goodness what a bomb! We didn't drop anything this big on Iraq!Perfect is the story of a Rolling Stone reporter Travolta who trips over his ethics or lack there of while writing two big stories. His first story deals with a computer tycoon in hot water with the U.S. government for selling his products to an EasternBloc country. This angle is played way up considering the lack of details we are told about the situation. No matter the story you will remember deals with a swanky health club in L.A.. Travolta wishes to write a piece about how health clubs in the 1980s are replacing the singles bars of the 1970s as the 1 place for people to meet.

But in 1983 Flashdance maybe the quintessential high concept picture came out a movie with no plot to speak of which was set to an uptempo chic pop soundtrack and contained a lot of images with a dancing Jennifer Beals double that were easily marketable to a big audience.

But Flashdance didn't pretend to be much more than what it is namely a cheap piece of fluff. Perfect on the other hand strives for something a little more worthwhile but fails on those accounts. Bridges put in some ethical comments on the profession of journalism. And he also tried to put in a potentially interesting thrillerstoryline around the McKenzie character. But these are soon discarded for the romantic storyline between Curtis and Travolta that starts out in a playful way but soon turns tiresome due to bad plotting and characterization. That's not to say that Curtis and Travolta are bad in this. Curtis who seems incapable to give an unlikeable performance especially does her best and nearly lifts the movie with her enthusiasm.What's left of Perfect are a couple of hilariously great aerobics scenes in which Curtis gives her all a hilariously great male stripper scene and some really bad hair moments. So bad movie aficionado's like me and Curtis fans like me will find something to like in this. Therefore my rating is 6 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Strangely underrated";
	schema:reviewBody "While promoting Pulp Fiction back in the 1990's Tarantino while explaining his casting of John Travolta in what would be one of his most iconic roles resurrecting his career and taking to a new status the writer and director didn't mention Grease or Saturday Night Fever as why he thought Travolta was a good actor. He quoted loving him in movies such as Blow Out Carrie and this little gem called Perfect. Such opinions are quite surprising since most of those films except Carrie weren't boxoffice hits neither well criticized some gaining cult status in the following years of its release. However even with Quentin's approval Perfect still finds a great deal of unexplainable resistance among film buffs currently giving to this one of the most absurd low ratings ever given to a quite decent movie. A short way to explain the story is thinking of an Absence of Malice made for the masses it deals with ethics in journalism with Travolta playing a biased Rolling Stone reporter while unsatisfied with the running of a controversial article involving political officials dealing with corruption charges decides to write a new and apparently harmless article on health clubs and their new function as being a cool dating place replacing the decadent singles bars. Yeah why bothering going in places where everybody is so down when you go to a happier place make lots of exercise and meet guys and girls with perfect bodies? There's something worth writing he thinks. Working as an obstacle to this story is a gym instructor played by Jamie Lee Curtis who doesn't trust reporters after a career damaging event when a reporter distorted facts while publishing a story involving her. While Travolta's story goes under false pretensions with a bit of truth in it as well he can't escape resisting some affection he has by the main character of his article who each day goes by starts to like this guy believing he's about to write a good report on the gym and its attendees. The stone in the way of this movie is that its lack of seriousness while the events are being unfolded often deeply concerned about the romance between the main characters. At times you think something really dangerous is about to happen he's being followed by someone due to the other inflammable article where Travolta is torn in between telling about what his source said to him on an exclusive interview or go to jail to protect his source but no the film doesn't take off much from this scenario except towards its conclusion to be used as a closure to the gym instructor situation a predictable and not very believable device. But Perfect manages to keep you hold to your seat due to the reliable and impressive performances of Curtis Travolta Laraine Newman Marilu Henner and small appearances from Kenneth Welsh and David Paymer. It drags down a bit when it stays for too long in the work out exercises fun for the actors jumping up and down to the coolest and energic 1980's soundtrack but tiring for us viewers seeing an unimaginative lack of camera angles and poor editing which shifts from two different angles instead of being more acrobatic.Story delivered some valid points although it can look ridiculously dated now since gym's are also definitely places for dating and no one questions those things anymore might not be perfect no pun intended it was well balanced and easy to follow and feel interested. So why viewers think this is one of the worst movies ever? Makes me wonder what some of you are watching these days. There's plenty of quality in Perfect you just need to open your eyes to see it. 910".

The main drawback back in '85 was that everyone had high expectations for this movie since it was directed by the same guy that gave us The China Syndrome.  The main plot of a Rolling Stone reporter Travolta trying to get the inside scoop of the fitness boom of the '80s from Curtis is the most enjoyable.  The sub plot of white collar crime is a little on the boring side and doesn't really mesh with the fitness plot.  It's interesting to see all of the aerobic exercises in total '80s style but by today's standards are outdated.  Everything from the neck rolls Jaime Lee Curtis does to the high impact aerobics which looks like it's done on a minimally padded floor really makes this movie dated but funny in a way. One thing to remember is that Perfect was made during a time when going for the burn and no pain no gain were the buzz words throughout the fitness industry.  Little did people know that trying to be a hardbody could land you in the hospital!  If you are looking for some light entertainment and you are a fan of John Travolta Jaime Lee Curtis Marilu Henner etc then you will definitely enjoy this enjoyable taste of '80s nostalgia legwarmers  all!".

The word Carly actually used is prohibited by IMDb's Dirty Word Filter.For this Carly deserves an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress and Travolta deserved to be cast with talking babies and dogs the latter of which actually happened. By the way this scene along with the one that preceded it where Travolta was writing obits for the Jersey Journal in Jersey City have zero relevance to the rest of the story which is about the astounding revelation that gyms um health clubs are good pickup spots especially the massage tables. There's also some blather about journalistic ethics.BTW Carly's a lefty. She's holding the glass in her right hand leave it to me to pick up on such details. Too bad she's not ambidextrous so she could have thrown another drink at Wenner for keeping her out of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame which is just another building in Cleveland until she's enshrined in it.I recommend that after you watch the Carly Simon cameo you turn off the DVD player and go back to watching Jerry Springer or Jersey Shore both of which are far more entertaining than this turkey.".

The story and 'visuals' though not fantastic was I think good enough to hold the shortest of attention spans. Mine included.  The film is set in a health club in Los Angeles with John Travolta starring as an ace investigative reporter for reallife mag Rolling Stone.  It also features a brilliant funkedup disco soundtrack featuring long forgotten artists like Jermaine Jackson Jermaine Stewart and Carol Lynn Towns and follows Travolta's charchter as he writes a piece about the health club scene and courts one of the fitness instructors there played by Jaimie Lee Curtis.  Unbeknownst to her he's using her and some of her patrons in order to write a sleazy story for his voracious boss played by the real Rolling Stone editor.  It's not hard to guess what happens next as Travolta and Curtis fall for each other Curtis finds a copy of his article on his computer which causes conflict between them and we get to see some fine acting from Jaimie Lee during those scenes. Travolta decides to kill the story but his angered boss enlists the help of photographer played by Anne DeSalvo in order to rewrite it without Travolta's knowledge.But the best parts of the film has to be scenes set during Curtis' classes the visuals I mentioned earlier.  Along with the pumping disco soundtrack these scenes are excillerating to watch  and not just for the sexy hard bodies.  When this film appeared again on TV recently I just had to record it and watch it all over again.  Not because I'm perverted you understand but because it's so...kitsch and seems to be indicative of the silly hedonistic LA scene of the early 1980s.  It has some truly funny moments also. Watch for the scene where Travolta searches for Jaimie Lee in a hotel holding a convention which features Boy George lookalikes. It's hilarious!!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film was only recently brought to my attention I've so far watched it five times. Why? Because I'm a writer who loves to study effective character work in effective screenplays. The fact that this film received a Razzie nomination for worst screenplay only serves to invalidate the Razzies for me rather than changing my opinion of this film.The way some reviews even mention the fact that the film was a flop as though that validates their opinion that it was awful. So The Thing 1982 was awful then? Or Blade Runner the same year. There are many reasons for films to flop marketing for instance or how about the fact that it was competing with Rambo II The Goonies Brewster's Millions hell even Beverly Hills Cop released six months earlier was still doing good business then.The summer of 1985 was saturated with hits and here they threw this little character driven narrative into that environment I don't understand how they thought it could have been a hit frankly. Kids wouldn't get it frankly adults who just wanted to see Jamie Lee Curtis in a leotard probably wouldn't get it.It's a story about a reporter Travolta who at the start of the film has the gumption to use women to get a story a man who had no conscience about that behaviour. Until that is he falls in love with a woman Curtis he is trying to use for a story. His love for her challenges his self perception and forces him to rethink his ways as he tries to save himself from a broken heart.The film centres around a health club where he finds women obsessed with the pursuit of physical perfection at least by their perception. Women who believe it is the only way they will ever be loved. Thematically it's quite tragic and I was a little underwhelmed by the writer's lack of any real insight into that cultural problem but figured that was symptomatic of what was understood about mental health in the 1980s compared to today so I forgive him that.If you're not afraid of character driven narratives like most people who only watch mainstream films then you should find this film enjoyable. The pacing is a little slow and they linger for far too long on the aerobics sessions although not if you're watching for pervy reasons but if you can get past that and get behind the character's story then you should enjoy it.".

Thematically it's quite tragic and I was a little underwhelmed by the writer's lack of any real insight into that cultural problem but figured that was symptomatic of what was understood about mental health in the 1980s compared to today so I forgive him that.If you're not afraid of character driven narratives like most people who only watch mainstream films then you should find this film enjoyable. The pacing is a little slow and they linger for far too long on the aerobics sessions although not if you're watching for pervy reasons but if you can get past that and get behind the character's story then you should enjoy it.";

	schema:reviewBody "The word originality has been overused especially by me so much that it has almost been beaten to a pulp.  After all how can one really tell if something in a film hasn't been done before?  Well I can confidently say that Steven Shainberg's Secretary may be the most inventive and yes even original film this year.  I can confidently say that in all of my time of watching and reviewing films I have never seen anything like it.Lee Holloway Maggie Gyllenhaal has just been released from a mental institution due to the fact that she constantly would cut herself when tension started to build up around the household.  After she is released it is clear that the habit has not been broken but cuts or no cuts she needs a job.  She goes to typing school and gets some of the highest grades in her class making her perfect for the position of secretary at a nearby lawyer's office.  She goes for the interview and after seeing the previous secretary run out in tears and hearing the questions in the interview it is apparent that the lawyer E. Edward Grey James Spader is a bit of a creep.Soon enough Lee begins to cut herself at work and needless to say Grey catches her in the act.  He doesn't take any sort of disciplinary action towards her.  Instead it seems that he can relate.  He tells Lee very inspiringly that she will never cut herself again.  Lee is uplifted but has no real inclination as to just why he said what he did.  However she still continues to make mistakes in her writing and after a while it simply drives Grey nuts.  He invites her into her office and tells her to Lean over put your elbows on the table and read the letter outloud. She does as he asks but in a strange turn he spanks her every other word. She runs into the bathroom hurt and embarrassed but interestingly enough she loved it.I'm a bit surprised that even by this time there has been little controversy over Secretary.  I had images in my head of feminist groups rallying for the film never to reach the screens or possibly screams of NC17 from everyone's favorite censors the Motion Picture Association of America MPAA.  Thankfully though it's gotten this far unscathed.  Maybe that is because audiences at preview screenings and film festivals are realizing that although loaded with thick layers of kooky but not that kinky SM the situation is a deeply and fundamentally human one.Basically if SM was ever shown in a film before it would usually be in the context of a villain torturing a hero against their will and usually such scenes weren't in anything that wasn't some cheap exploitation film. Secretary is a brave endeavor but it knows where it's going.  This isn't a gimmick SM sequences in the film are not the least bit perverted the same can't be said about some segments in several Larry Clark films. These scenes are essential to understanding the characters.What is so great about Secretary goes beyond its offering insight as to why anyone would find being tied to a pole and spanked while holding a carrot between their teeth even remotely attractive.  Despite pretty morbid subject matter Secretary flies off the screen with energy and wit offering some of the funniest most surprising dark comedy I have seen since Fargo.  Several scenes in the film have already become classics in my repertoire of movie moments that will stay with me forever including one hilarious incident involving a worm.Even with all of this there is no way that Secretary would have pulled it off without Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader.  Spader is creepy and oddly pathetic his performance is such that at one moment we are sympathetic the next we are booing him then we're intrigued again.  Maggie Gyllenhaal is equally brilliant she gives us complete access into the mind of Lee Holloway and it's close to impossible not to feel for her.  Also take into account how courageous she is you try and find me another actress her age who would be willing to do half of the things she does in the film.Spader and Gyllenhaal have such chemistry that everything clicks. Director Steven Shainberg lets us truly understand the complexities of their relationship without letting the energy lag or any of the subtle comedy fly past the audience.  Secretary is invigorating touching hilarious and often all at the same time.  With too many romantic comedies trying too hard to try something new when they are in fact only going backwards Secretary is a truly unique specimen.".

Then begins the sexual part so we parry and thrust take signals from each other and over time we feel each other up together.  But what about the path to love through the back door so to speak?  What about a love story where she's a young neurotic woman just out of a mental hospital back to a family where Dad's a serious drunk and Mom's a serious nervous fruitcake.  And what about a man an attorney who's emotionally closed off and can only get in touch with orchids inserting long stainlesssteel tools into their waiting organs.  Yes these two find each other in one of the most bizarre cinematic love stories ever. I loved this movie.  I pilgrim around searching through books and movies for secret pathways to and circumstances of the human heart.  This movie transcends its gentle SM to reveal yet another way to love. Our heroine the freshfaced and magnificently moonlike Maggie Gyllenhaal is brilliant as the new secretary to a lawyer who goes through so many secretaries he has a secretary vacancy sign he lights up outside his office.  As our heroine tries to reenter the world by getting her first job with this man it becomes apparent that the boss is anything but normal.  He is demanding yet insistent that his new charge break away from her stifling past and be herself.  But what or who is she?  And who in the hell is he?The movie is sexy.  There's no denying it.  Gyllenhaal is radiant and sinuous and we feel that she's truly experiencing the wonder of it all for the first time.  Spader is typecast a bit but his worldweary sexiness fits well with Gyllenhaal's naivet.  And let's face it Gyllenhaal is grippingly sexy and we see her in hose panties tight skirts and in the nude.  And as far as I'm concerned she's fabulous darling.  And in one of the movie's sexiest most endearing scenes we see Spader carry her off in her urinesoaked wedding dress as he finally assumes his responsibilities as her loving dom.  She is totally tired subservient and radiant in total surrender rescued from a voyeurizing world.  What a hunk of sexy cinema that was with her arm languidly draped around Spader's neck as he carried the bride over the threshold to love and dominance.  Wow.This movie explores and explodes sexual myths.  The director has successfully created a dark comedy layered with nuance in a stew of social commentary.  This movie is not for everyone.  Stay away if you're conventionally wrapped conservative or lacking in a certain joy of exploration.  But if you're ready for a most untraditionaltraditional love story Spader and Gyllenhaal give Oscar worthy performances... but of course the subject matter nixed that.".

	schema:headline " Not Your Typical Office Romance";
	schema:reviewBody "Maggie Gyllenhaal deserves an Oscar nomination for her brilliant portrayal of borderline psychotic selfmutilating Lee Holloway a former mental institution patient seeking to sustain herself  vocationally and emotionally  in a challenging world where she has few safe harbors.  She comes from a messy family background although that alone can't explain her illness.Learning typing she gets a secretary's job with lawyer E. Edward Grey James Spader who also turns in a firstrate nuanced performance.  Grey refuses to have any computers in his very smart expensive law office. Like many lawyers he's a perfectionist who abhors typographical errors but his obsession with perfection reflects more than an anal personality hitched to a law degree.  His solo practice seems to thrive better than his selfcontrol of a suppressed sexuality awakened by Maggie at first unknowingly.This is a film about what many consider to be deviant behavior sadomasochism and bondagediscipline not your usual Hollywood romantic fun and games that most will concur is uncommon in the workplace.  Director Steven Shainberg and his cast  and Gyllenhaal and Spader carry the film forget the supporting actors  show Lee and Grey's rocky and developing relationship with candor without condemnation and without exploitation. The lawyer and his secretary are sexualized in a way few have experienced and those who have don't talk to folks outside their circle.This is a black comedya black drama.

	onyx:emotionText "Maggie Gyllenhaal deserves an Oscar nomination for her brilliant portrayal of borderline psychotic selfmutilating Lee Holloway a former mental institution patient seeking to sustain herself  vocationally and emotionally  in a challenging world where she has few safe harbors.  She comes from a messy family background although that alone can't explain her illness.Learning typing she gets a secretary's job with lawyer E. Edward Grey James Spader who also turns in a firstrate nuanced performance.  Grey refuses to have any computers in his very smart expensive law office. Like many lawyers he's a perfectionist who abhors typographical errors but his obsession with perfection reflects more than an anal personality hitched to a law degree.  His solo practice seems to thrive better than his selfcontrol of a suppressed sexuality awakened by Maggie at first unknowingly.This is a film about what many consider to be deviant behavior sadomasochism and bondagediscipline not your usual Hollywood romantic fun and games that most will concur is uncommon in the workplace.  Director Steven Shainberg and his cast  and Gyllenhaal and Spader carry the film forget the supporting actors  show Lee and Grey's rocky and developing relationship with candor without condemnation and without exploitation. The lawyer and his secretary are sexualized in a way few have experienced and those who have don't talk to folks outside their circle.This is a black comedya black drama.  It either grabs or repels the viewer there's no inbetween.  The resolution?  Is it realistic or a copout?  I'd love to hear from those able to comment from experience on IMDb's discussion board.  But I have a feeling few will post reactions.A very different film that I rate 810 on a personal scale where I value the deep and tortured acting projecting the absorbing conflict of this sexualized working initially relationship.";

	schema:reviewBody "Those Gyllenhalls they sure can act.  Maggie like her brother Jake turns in great performances like they're routine  she makes it look easy.  In 'Secretary' she delivers a layered complex performance as Lee Holloway a disturbed young lady who deals with stress by cutting herself  the pain pushes away everything else that's bothering her.As she's released from an institution back into the world she takes her first job as secretary to lawyer E. Edward Grey played by James Spader. From then on the movie explores their relationship and how it affects Lee taking her from the quiet selfdamaging wallflower into the determined and strong woman she becomes.  The film's use of SM in the relationship between Lee and Mr. Grey makes it a bit controversial but it's not really the focus here.  The idea of Lee as the submissive and Mr. Grey as the dominant have little to do with their sexuality and everything to do with their personality issues.Lee can't handle extreme emotion without resorting to pain because she can't take control of her own life.  What she sees in Mr. Grey is love  absolute love the likes of which she can't find with her fiance Peter Jeremy Davies.   That love allows her to give him the power of her pain  by doing that she's finding something worthy to focus on instead of the nothingness of her sewing kit and iodine.  Mr. Grey for his part is a man who can't deal with anything except in his own ordered regimented way.  He cares for his orchids but little else and the steps he takes with Lee open up his wary heart.  He's slower to develop than she is and to take the final steps towards a real lasting relationship he has to be dragged there by the force of Lee's own will.The key to this film  and SM relationships in general  is that Lee the submissive has all the power not Mr. Grey the dominant.  She sets the terms by which the relationship will be conducted seemingly for the first time in her entire life including the relationships with her family.  Lee finds love and desire in Mr. Grey and pursues it while healing her own shattered psyche in the process.Maggie Gyllenhall is luminous here.  She can say more with a facial expression than most can in a Shakespearean soliloquy.  She gives herself completely over to the part without a wink or a nudge that she's just kidding or thinks any part of this is silly.  She becomes Lee Holloway which is the best compliment you can give an actor.  Spader for his part follows in a long string of oddballs but doesn't go over the top as he could have been tempted to do.  This is Maggie's movie and he supports it and plays off it well.Rating 810 based on the strong performance of Maggie Gyllenhall and the character of Lee Holloway but nocked down due to a poorlyconstructed finale that just doesn't fit with the rest of the film.  Highly recommended.".

This is the most original romantic comedy very black mind you I've seen in YEARS! And for something which deals with a lifestyle alien to me dominance and submission it's surprisingly touching and even managed to get me to shed a tear or two. I had previously enjoyed Maggie Gyllenhaal's supporting roles in 'Donnie Darko' and John Waters' 'Cecil B. Demented' she played Raven the make up artist  Pain is pleasure! Slavery is freedom! Suicide for Satan!' remember? but her performance here is first class and is guaranteed to turn her into a major cult figure if not an actual genuine STAR. I confess that I now have a major crush on her to boot I'm sure I'm not alone!. James Spader is also very very good. While I admired him appearing in Cronenberg's 'Crash' a few years ago most of his other film choices have been safe ones and to be honest I'd pretty much given up on him as an actor. But it just goes to show what an actor is capable of with an innovative script and a supportive director. It's really difficult imagining any other two actors playing these roles any better. In the supporting cast Jeremy Davies also surprised me. I'd been getting a bit tired of his crazy shtick in previous roles especially his extremely irritating performance in 'The Million Dollar Hotel' but he did a much more subtle job in this movie and it really worked for me. This is my first experience with director Steven Shainberg but I was impressed. I now want to try and see his previous movie the Jim Thompson adaptation 'Hit Me'. I also look forward to his next movie because if 'Secretary' is any indication of his talent then he's sure to come up with something very special. Highly recommend.".

Lee copes with her severely dysfunctional family  her father is an alcoholic who beats his wife while her mother is a passive victim of abuse who overprotects her daughter  by cutting gashing and burning herself regularly.  Now back on the outside Lee finds employment as secretary to a paralegal E. Edward Grey an equally neurotic man who turns out to be a fullblown dominator' behind closed doors.  Together the two forge a bizarre sexual alliance so allconsuming in its nature that one wonders how this small office ever gets any work done at all.Writer Erin Cressida Wilson and director Steven Shainberg have fun with the many ironies and paradoxes inherent in the offbeat world they are exploring. For instance Grey by restricting Lee's freedom of choice is actually liberating her by getting her to channel her selfabusive tendencies and desire for pain into a healthier' more productive' direction.   Lee also discovers that men with unconventional sexual tastes may be no more willing to settle down' and commit' with a likeminded partner than many a man with more traditional sexual proclivities.In many ways Secretary' turns out to be almost a recruiting poster for the sadomasochistic lifestyle.

Their performances go a long way towards purging the material of the kind of sleaziness and smarminess one might expect to find here.The early scenes in the film may be a bit disturbing for some in the audience mainly because we feel a bit like voyeurs peering in on the couple almost as if they were zoo animals or subjects in some sort of psychosexual experiment.  But then as we get to know the characters and come to like them we become absorbed in their story and find ourselves actually cheering them on and wanting them to find some measure of meaning and happiness in their relationship and lives.   The makers of Secretary' have taken a potentially touchy' subject and injected it with warmth humanity and insight.  It's hard not to feel uplifted by this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING this review contains SPOILERSThis film is beautiful in so many ways Maggie's portrayal of a submissive was just pure delight. She did SUCH an incredible job in every scene involving her and James Spader. I mean the part where he first starts spanking her...her eyes...they were just so expressive! Even though she didn't really talk you could totally understand everything that was going on in her head through her eyes. Just beautiful!And James Spader! wow...I've always been impressed by his acting and have always found him incredibly attractive and sexy but after viewing this film...I fell completely in love with him all over again.Even though the movie really centers around Maggie's character and her battle with sexuality and cutting and what not...I found James' character's battle to be more intriguing and actually bigger. He's become completely intimate with her and every time he even looks at her he wants to bang the sht out of her. So his way of dealing with that is through exercising. And his whole obsessive complusiveness was well to me kind of funny.Some of my most favorite scenes in this film was when James fires Maggie yet she doesn't want to leave. He sits down in a chair and she comes up to the side of him and starts running her fingers through his hair. The expression on his face while she does that is just so enthrawling! I mean just the touch of her makes him go into an orgasmic bliss! I also love the scene where She is lying naked on the grass and he is rubbing his hand over her stomach touching every cut and scar. And you hear her voice over talking about how she used to be shy about having sex because she didn't want anyone to see her cuts she was so ashamed of herself yet he didn't care at all about them and loved her for everything she is. She felt beautiful when with him and wasn't ashamed anymore. It was just fantastik! And my 3rd favorite scene was when James starts kissing maggie and works his way down her body and while he's doing this she starts asking him questions like I wanna know when your first love was when you had your first kiss what your favorite color is where you were born... and he had worked his way back up and stops right above her face and answers her question about where he was born. She then gets this big smile on her face right before he leans closer and kisses her deeply. I don't care what anyone else says but that scene had my heart racing a mile a minute it was so sweet.Despite all of the things that had happened in the past these 2 found acceptance in each other and because of that will love one another forever. I HIGHLY recommend seeing this film. You will become so attached to it I swear! my rating is 910.".

The incredible chemistry between an amazing Maggie Gyllenhaal and a repressed yet fierce James Spader is what makes this movie work so well and the tender depths to which their relationship is portrayed makes it so much more than just a film about sadomasochism. I felt that the main theme of the film was to show that people have pain and it is only when you accept that pain that you are able to feel your emotions fully therefore making your life much more livable. This movie was a bit quirky and might not be for everyone. However I would recommend it to anyone with an open mind. Secretary is by far my favorite film of the year.".

I was amazed when I realized that this movie wasn't ALL about SubDom but in fact it was a love story. I wasn't disappointed. I recommend seeing this film if you haven't already  even if you have. I am a very big fan of James Spader  he was so amazing in this film. He was beautiful funny complex  sexy. I'll be his secretary any day.I was also surprised by the fact that I liked Maggie Gyllenhaal. She is a very good actress  alot more attractive than in any of the pictures I have ever seen of her. Everyones acting is Superb the directing superb  the story !!!!!! My raves don't even do this movie justice. Just go see it!M".

	schema:reviewBody "In this romantic black comedy Maggie Gyllenhaal stars as Lee Holloway the lady worker of the title. As you probably already know this secretary doesn't just push pens and use paper clips she has another more exciting capacity as her boss's love object. The film actually isn't quite as naughty as many people think it thinks it is but the truth is that the sadomasochistic area of the film isn't really all that important. The film isn't really about obscure sexual preferences it's about finding someone whom you are comfortable with and the SM is just a means to an end. The sex aspect of the film does serve a purpose however in that it's that which makes the film a social satire of this culture of flirting in the office a very over the top one that is and one that gives the film it's shock value but to be honest you don't really get to see that much bondage. The film is very original in it's portrayal of SM however as it's a very taboo subject and for it to be portrayed in a sweet and upbeat manner like this is welcome and very different.As mentioned Maggie Gyllenhaal takes the title role and starring opposite her is James Spader as her boss. Gyllenhaal's character is sweet inexperienced and bashful. She's very easy to like but she can also be annoying at times. Spader's character is the complete opposite despite being insecure he comes across as being cold calm and collected. He keeps his emotions hidden inside and reveals very little about himself unlike Maggie's character who is happy to wear her emotions on her sleeve and doesn't seem to mind what other people think. Observe the way that the boss continues to tell her to put her shoes on because her feet stink etc not exactly the most conscientious person to ever walk the earth. Despite being chalk and cheese however the two characters blend together in a way that is both believable and interesting and this makes for some great chemistry between the two leads that is hard not to enjoy. The fact that they are chalk and cheese is a help and not a hindrance to the film as it serves in making it all the more interesting. My only quibble with the characterization is the ending which although it brings the message out seems tacked on and rather unrealisticbut it's not enough to spoil the film.Overall Secretary is not a masterpiece but it is a very good portrayal love and one that is far superior to dull and dreary films such as 'Lost in Translation'. It's entertaining for it's duration there are several funny moments and the central message which states that it's worth going to extremes for the one you love is a worthwhile one for any movie even if it is someone lost under the premise of the movie. Recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Please indulge me while I gushingly discuss this little gem of a movie I saw last night called Secretary.  Yes I know it was released a while ago but since my wallet has been bereft of its pecuniary innards of late I had to wait for the rental.Is Secretary as creepy a psychosexual office thriller as its trailer might lead us to believe?  Yes and no.  Chances are however if the director has cast James Spader as the male lead the viewer knows they're in for an unnerving cinematic journey. That said there is a strong psychosexual current running through this story but it's far from creepy if you're occasionally inclined to use film as a means of accessing your emotions and promoting selfawareness this might be the movie for you.The story is that triedbuttrue formula selfmutilating girl gets out of a mental institution returns to her dysfunctional family life gets a job as a secretary for an analretentive emotionally repressed attorney and finds redemption and herself in the context of a sadomasochistic relationship. Yawn. How banal! This is a stunning existential comingofage black comedy and along with Happy Accidents one of the best unorthodox love stories I've seen this year.Relative newcomer Maggie Gylenhaal plays Lee Holloway our emotionally unstable protagonist. Her performance is revealing and revelatory a brave portrayal of inner turmoil played with grace and complexity.  The aforementioned Spader plays Lee's equally disturbed employer E. Edward Gray delivering yet another of his trademark plaguedbyinnerdemons characters.  I am consistently astounded by Spader's ability to infuse potentially deplorable characters with such intricate humanity that he is able to elicit sympathy and understanding.  James Spader is one of our best underutilized character actors and thankfully has never allowed himself to be coopted by the Hollywood mainstream. Cheers James.The sadomasochistic element of this film could have easily drifted into selfparody instead director Steven Shainberg uses it subtly and without shame as a means of exhibiting deliverance and liberation.  In some ways this film is also a meditation on power and sex roles.  Lee's initial willingness to acquiesce to her boss' punitive ministerings could have easily made her a victim i.e. of an employer a man and an elder. Instead this is her gateway into adulthood allowing her to develop the inner resources to be a selfdetermined woman relentless in the pursuit of what and whom she wants.Anyone involved in a longterm relationship knows that an essential ingredient is variable power balance it's inevitable despite some people's claims that they have a completely equal' affiliation.  These power shifts help keep romance vibrant and equally as important instruct us how to navigate life's rocky travails resulting in wisdom and selfacceptance. What men often think as strengthstoicism aloofness obstinacyare more often than not actually weaknesses leading to ignorance avoidance and ultimate demise.  Paradoxically it's in complete vulnerability where we actually discover what we're capable of being able to develop emotional resilience and learning to express desire sexual or otherwise. Gylenhaal's Lee Holloway crystallizes this vulnerabilityasstrength concept beautifully making an appealing case for growth by any means necessary. Shame is often selfimposed and convention can serve as prison. Ultimately each of us must choose our own path to selfactualization and it's legitimate if it works for you.Conversely Spader's growth stems from actually succumbing to Lee's powerful will.  His apparent dominance' in the end leads to his submission to her insistence that they be together.  Ultimately both benefit from the relationship as an audience can benefit from viewing this unusual luminous film.910".

	schema:headline " So much is admirable and gripping yet alas given away.";
	schema:reviewBody "Ah at long last a return to procrastinating ruminating and insinuating my views on film via a IMDb User Comment...! It seems a while though is maybe only four months. This viewing was an alltoorare trip to the cinema for me of late and it was indeed a Late Show piping up with its typewriterattended credits at as late as 11pm in Cinema 2 at the Cambridge Arts Picturehouse.Now Secretary... indeed these matters make very daring subject matter for relatively mainstream Hollywood to be taking on. I think I can say that Shainberg and company managed to avoid putting fatal feet wrong. It is not an exceptional film overall but at least for the first threequarters is disarmingly entertaining and edgeoftheseat. It is a true boon for the film that I really didn't know how this was going to resolve itself at 23 of the way in the superb lead performances and a very astute script strike just the right uncertain curious tone. The events we are shown are not held up as any general example  it is key to remember that  and yet it gets one thinking interestingly of realworld relations between the sexes at work and in amorous affairs particularly.I loved Maggie Gyllenhaal here a really thoughtful show of acting. Putting herself at the picture's centre and imbuing the whole construct with human frailties and mannerisms. I adored Gyllenhaal's deft sleights of hand in conveying Lee's development of character from the doeeyed vacancy of an utter misfit girl to a burgeoning rather mischievous woman who comes to terms with her intense sexuality and the way to relate to others. Others... well to a certain Messr. E. Edward Gray Spader plays this oddball lawyer with a delightfully lilting serpentine quality. He refuses to be pinned down or stared in the face by the audience until the facade becomes entirely impossible. Unquestionably the character takes advantage but as the film's last act attests only good eventually seems to come from this. Lee's family scenes amuse at the very first and then do reveal themselves as essentially cardboard we get little sense of depth or real dynamics going on allegedly much was cut from this portion of things. And as the parts we do have are nowhere near as well handled and interesting as the sparky thoughtful GyllenhaalSpader scenes maybe it was quite right that they were minimised.The ending is sadly a misguided doddering drawing of the veil over proceedings. Any degree of edginess or sinewy uncertainty that had been stirred in the spectator is shunned bolted away from indeed by a very unsatisfying conclusion. A kind of Happy Ending on Happy Endinghallucinogens it frankly jars with and dismantles the thoughtful spellbinding atmosphere hitherto sustained and answers none of the tantalising questions that were forming themselves in my mind while watching the main body of the film. It is manifestly an avoidance of drama and real engagement with the scenario as it is set up one expected some form of revelation about Gray's problematic life yet what do we get? An entire recantation and a wondrously Changed Man in essential characteristics. I will insist that it ought not to have been as simple as that it impoverishes an intriguing character.Disappointingly we miss any reflection on the sublime Peter's fate after 'his Lee' so very touching is the actor playing an awkward romantic MiddleAmerican young man. See for example his teary bemused quality of haplessness when he imitates Lee's hands on the table gesture as means of questioning what on earth she was doing on their wedding day in Gray's office. A shame that this character wasn't delved into further I'm sure an ambivalence might have emerged. Furthermore the lingering wouldbe ambiguous final shots are appalling what are these supposed to denote?

	onyx:emotionText "Ah at long last a return to procrastinating ruminating and insinuating my views on film via a IMDb User Comment...! It seems a while though is maybe only four months. This viewing was an alltoorare trip to the cinema for me of late and it was indeed a Late Show piping up with its typewriterattended credits at as late as 11pm in Cinema 2 at the Cambridge Arts Picturehouse.Now Secretary... indeed these matters make very daring subject matter for relatively mainstream Hollywood to be taking on. I think I can say that Shainberg and company managed to avoid putting fatal feet wrong. It is not an exceptional film overall but at least for the first threequarters is disarmingly entertaining and edgeoftheseat. It is a true boon for the film that I really didn't know how this was going to resolve itself at 23 of the way in the superb lead performances and a very astute script strike just the right uncertain curious tone. The events we are shown are not held up as any general example  it is key to remember that  and yet it gets one thinking interestingly of realworld relations between the sexes at work and in amorous affairs particularly.I loved Maggie Gyllenhaal here a really thoughtful show of acting. Putting herself at the picture's centre and imbuing the whole construct with human frailties and mannerisms. I adored Gyllenhaal's deft sleights of hand in conveying Lee's development of character from the doeeyed vacancy of an utter misfit girl to a burgeoning rather mischievous woman who comes to terms with her intense sexuality and the way to relate to others. Others... well to a certain Messr. E. Edward Gray Spader plays this oddball lawyer with a delightfully lilting serpentine quality. He refuses to be pinned down or stared in the face by the audience until the facade becomes entirely impossible. Unquestionably the character takes advantage but as the film's last act attests only good eventually seems to come from this. Lee's family scenes amuse at the very first and then do reveal themselves as essentially cardboard we get little sense of depth or real dynamics going on allegedly much was cut from this portion of things. And as the parts we do have are nowhere near as well handled and interesting as the sparky thoughtful GyllenhaalSpader scenes maybe it was quite right that they were minimised.The ending is sadly a misguided doddering drawing of the veil over proceedings. Any degree of edginess or sinewy uncertainty that had been stirred in the spectator is shunned bolted away from indeed by a very unsatisfying conclusion. A kind of Happy Ending on Happy Endinghallucinogens it frankly jars with and dismantles the thoughtful spellbinding atmosphere hitherto sustained and answers none of the tantalising questions that were forming themselves in my mind while watching the main body of the film. It is manifestly an avoidance of drama and real engagement with the scenario as it is set up one expected some form of revelation about Gray's problematic life yet what do we get? An entire recantation and a wondrously Changed Man in essential characteristics. I will insist that it ought not to have been as simple as that it impoverishes an intriguing character.Disappointingly we miss any reflection on the sublime Peter's fate after 'his Lee' so very touching is the actor playing an awkward romantic MiddleAmerican young man. See for example his teary bemused quality of haplessness when he imitates Lee's hands on the table gesture as means of questioning what on earth she was doing on their wedding day in Gray's office. A shame that this character wasn't delved into further I'm sure an ambivalence might have emerged. Furthermore the lingering wouldbe ambiguous final shots are appalling what are these supposed to denote? It would have been more honest to the rest of the conclusion to have had the couple cuddling lasciviously. These final shots merely lend an ever more doubtful throwntogether impression artistically. I won't go into the sham of the media coverage of Lee's 'vigil' hook line and sinker it was the main offender in this film's downfall.

	schema:headline " Memorable MGM Melodrama.";
	schema:reviewBody "MADAME BOVARY is something of an underrated Hollywood classic! Produced by Pandro S. Berman for MGM in 1949 it was one of the last movies of Hollywood's Golden Age! Directed with a positive flair by the ubiquitous Vincente Minnelli it was stylishly written for the screen by Robert Ardrey from the outragious novel by Gustav Flaubert and crisply photographed in gorgeous black  white by Robert Planck.Jennifer Jones gives a superb performance as Emma Bovary the beautiful young vivacious woman in 19th century France who pursues her insatiable appetite for love and romance with reckless abandon resulting in her total moral decay the neglect and alienation of her husband and young child and her eventual suicide. The actress applied herself assiduously to the role almost eclipsing her Acadamy Award winning portrayal in Song Of Bernadette six years earlier. Excellent also is Van Heflin as her long suffering mild mannered doctor husband and Louis Jordan as Rudolphe  one of her lovers. Also making a striking appearance at the start of the picture is James Mason in an effective cameo as the novelist Flaubert himself who is in court on a charge of corrupting public morals with the publication of his shameful novel Madame Bovary.

This was the great composer's first score for MGM. This would be the beginning of Rozsa's most lavish and most prestigious productive period! Here at MGM he would create among others such outstanding works as Quo Vadis Ivanhoe Plymouth Adventure All The Brothers Were Valiant Valley Of The Kings Knights Of The Round Table Green Fire and culminating in 1959 with his masterpiece Ben Hur. His score for Madame Bovary abounds with exquisite character themes such as those for the lovers Rudolphe Jordan and Leon Christopher Kent. But his most appealing theme is reserved for the husband Dr. Bovary Heflin which has an engaging lyrical wistfulness to it. And the theme for the main protagonist  first heard in the Main Title  is troubled and turgid perfectly reflecting the character of Emma Bovary. Of course the highlight and showpiece of the score is the swirling and dizzying waltz he composed for the elaborate ballroom sequence  the film's most memorable scene!The DVD transfer is exceptional with well defined Monochrome images. But the extras aren't up to very much! There is a good trailer but there is no commentary and quite dispensable is a Droopy cartoon and a tired Pete Smith Specialty. However a movie like this that is well written well played and beautifully shot and scored is well worth having in any collection!".

	onyx:emotionText "MADAME BOVARY is something of an underrated Hollywood classic! Produced by Pandro S. Berman for MGM in 1949 it was one of the last movies of Hollywood's Golden Age! Directed with a positive flair by the ubiquitous Vincente Minnelli it was stylishly written for the screen by Robert Ardrey from the outragious novel by Gustav Flaubert and crisply photographed in gorgeous black  white by Robert Planck.Jennifer Jones gives a superb performance as Emma Bovary the beautiful young vivacious woman in 19th century France who pursues her insatiable appetite for love and romance with reckless abandon resulting in her total moral decay the neglect and alienation of her husband and young child and her eventual suicide. The actress applied herself assiduously to the role almost eclipsing her Acadamy Award winning portrayal in Song Of Bernadette six years earlier. Excellent also is Van Heflin as her long suffering mild mannered doctor husband and Louis Jordan as Rudolphe  one of her lovers. Also making a striking appearance at the start of the picture is James Mason in an effective cameo as the novelist Flaubert himself who is in court on a charge of corrupting public morals with the publication of his shameful novel Madame Bovary. Then from the dock Flaubert Mason begins to narrate the story of his infamous heroine as the film unfolds.Underlining this heated melodrama is the wonderful music of Miklos Rozsa.

This version from 1949 and directed by Hollywood legend Vincente Minnelli however takes the crown for the most faithful most unique and interesting adaptation of the book. No it's not perfect and it is by far the most Hollywood of the film versions and it's but one of many films adapted from 19th century novels released at the end of the 1940's Anna Karenina with Vivien Leigh and Ralph Richardson and The Heiress with Olivia De Havilland are others. The cinematography is grand the sets and costumes are beautiful perhaps too beautiful and even so this is a supreme work of cinema and those who have read and enjoyed Madame Bovary will be sure to appreciate this film. Jennifer Jones stars as the eponymous Madame the doomed fallen woman who seeks escape from her dull provincial life and marriage. Gorgeous Jennifer Jones was once an unknown actress in 30's Hollywood until her marriage to David O. Selznick rocketed her to fame. This is possibly her best performance on film for compared to the vixenishinnocent characters she portrayed in other films this particular performance is developed and more challenging for her. Rather than portraying Mme. Bovary as victim of fate we are forced to sympathize with she goes all out in making her appear spoiled selfcentered and careless. Her addictions ? Living luxuriously as if she were a member of French aristocracy. But the truth is far less glamorous. She married a country doctor Charles Van Heflin and was initially happy. But boredom quickly sets in. Charles is constantly away on housecalls often in distant locales and housefrau Emma feels trapped. Seeking to live a rich and exciting life such as the lives of women she has read about in countless romance novels she makes friends with prominent Parisians when she sets up a salon in her home. She goes to a ball where she meets Rodolphe Boulanger Louis Jourdan who becomes her lover. She gives birth to a girl when she had wanted a boy to live vicariously through on account of males being free and women having less rights. She neglects her home and pursues her passions with Rodolphe. Ultimately Rodolphe has used her and tires of the affair abandoning her after promising an elopement. Things begin to go downhill from there. She takes up another lover her husband's friend Leon Dupuis Alf Kjellin. Because she has furnished the home with expensive furniture wears costly imported gowns from Paris debts mount and soon there is no money left to pay the house with. In despair she drinks arsenic and dies. This is not a pretty story. The addition of Gustav Flaubert's court trial his book was banned in France is a superb touch. Flaubert James Mason defends himself by stating that Mme. Bovary is a figure straight out of reality and that he was only mirroring reality. Madame Bovary's drowns in her own excesses. Paris too could die the same way. Minnelli's film is a winner in many respects. The music by Miklos Rozsa is both touching and dramatic. The cinematography by Robert Planck has the feel of old Hollywood costume epic. The costumes are from veteran Hollywood costume designer Walter Plunkett of Gone With The Wind. The best touches are found within the film's structure. For instance at the ball Emma becomes the center of attention and guests go as far as to break windows when she gasps for air after a dizzying waltz. Louis Jourdan as Rodolphe is perfectly cast and here he is at the beginning of his long career in film. He may not be doing anything particularly good but he fits the character's shallowness and selfishness like Madame Bovary's quite well. Van Helfin as the longsuffering betrayed husband is terrific. This film unfortunately is one that time has forgot and what a shame. There's so many reasons to preserve it Vincente Minelli who would marry Judy Garland and father Liza Minnelli felt this was one of his early masterpieces and would later go on to make other hit films like Gigi working again with Jourdan. If you must watch one Mme. Bovary film make it this one. It's also highly recommended for viewing in college English classes reading the book.".

The film starts with Flaubert on trial for indecency. As he defends the book he tells the story of Emma Bovary a delusional young woman living on a farm who from romantic novels has unrealistic ideas about love and happiness. She nabs a simple country doctor Van Heflin and proceeds to buy herself an incredible wardrobe and live as a rich woman even though she and her husband are not wealthy. She has a little girl whom she ignores leaving her to the nurse Corby. Emma soon becomes bored and attempts to seduce a young man Kjellin but his mother Gladys Cooper catches on and sends him to Paris. Then she meets Boulanger Jourdan at a party becomes his lover and plans to run away with him to Italy  but he sees what high maintenance she is and takes off without her. In an attempt to make her husband more prominent she attempts to talk him into performing a new surgery but he refuses in the book however he's ambitious as well and does the surgery which is a failure. Meanwhile unbeknownst to her husband she owes a fortune and if she doesn't find a way out the family is due to lose their home and furnishings.Madame Bovary is one of the most stunning films ever made with a captivating performance by Jones who makes Emma pathetic desperate frantic and sympathetic. As one of the comments on the board pointed out it's easy to make Emma unlikable. With Jones' natural charm making her likable and somewhat sweet we can see ourselves in Emma. She has great backup from Heflin as her cowed husband. Jourdan is handsome and arrogant  he sees his future with Emma and he doesn't like it.Minnelli handles every detail beautifully in this film. Not enough can be said about the waltz at the party its dizzying effects making it one of the most thrilling scenes on film.

The gowns  well there have been beautiful gowns in films  the 1938 Marie Antoinette comes to mind  and as in that film these gowns are works of art particularly the white ball gown. When Boulanger returns from Italy and Emma goes to see him she actually looks different  tired and older  the subtlety of the makeup is spectacular.Though set in France in the mid1800s Madame Bovary is a classic because it deals with an ordinary person so dazzled by illusion that she cannot accept anything about her life as it exists.

Flaubert wrote a story of passion and love but from the standpoint of a female bourgeoisie in the countryside.

But Emma Bovary is doomed by that imagination and the unscrupulous reactions to it by the men who dominated that same provincial world.

But it's appearance met with public disbelief and anger. Flaubert was put on trial for publishing an immoral book. The censors and hypocrites felt that he had besmirched the pious middle classes of the France of the 1840s and 1850s. Flaubert was acquitted and the scandal of the trial improved the sales of the novel.Vincent Minnelli's 1949 movie can't reach the effect of the full novel  and I say this thinking that I could only read it in English so that I can imagine what it must be in French! He does peel the skin of the provincial society with it's social leaders money lenders like Lhereux  Frank Allenby here who are all business and no sentiment aristocrats Rodolphe is Louis Jourdan and attempts to push themselves into the greater world outside. Just as Emma sees herself the object of desire by aristocrats at the ball Rodolphe throws the village sees itself made into a household name if Charles can perform the great foot operation that will restore one of the rustics feet to normal.

The scene where Emma finally is the center of attention looks shows her surrounded by handsome beaus in a mirror  it looks like an idea from the midcentury painter Winterhalter although he was Austrian. The backwoods provincial background is caught perfectly. When debts starts swooping around a frightened Emma she goes to a man she respects and finds he's ready to make a financial arrangement if she'll sleep with him!Minnelli surrounds the telling of the story by showing the trial of Flaubert. James Mason plays the writer eloquently forgiving his heroine for flaunting the conventions of a hypocritical society. Jennifer Jones possibly had her best performance in this film  not her Oscar winner SONG OF BERNADETTE. The climatic moment when she decides to destroy herself makes her behave like an animal  and she is a trapped animal at that point. Van Heflin plays the goodnatured but boring Charles quite well. Actually the cast was up to snuff regarding their parts and somewhat surprising. George Zuuco for example is the lawyer Dubocage whose clerk Leon Alf Kjelin was Emma's second lover. He does not appear frequently but appears reading the papers of a lawsuit that Emma is trying to use to raise money on her fatherinlaw's prospective estate. Zucco is appalled by it and angrily confronts Leon about this waste of time for their busy office. But a moment afterward Zucco suddenly realizes why Leon is doing this. Actually for a Zucco character he softens and says Do yourself a favor and forget her my boy. Not helpful for poor Emma but actually sensible for Leon who has a future in law.".

	schema:headline " Masterful adaptation if not entirely faithful";
	schema:reviewBody "Madame Bovary is a difficult piece to translate to film. It is very easy for the heroine to become either dislikable either willfull the PBS version with Francesca Annis or peevish the Isabelle Hubert french version.What Minnelli so masterfully and ironically captures here is the dream machine that drives Madame Bovary and society to be dissatisfied with their daily lives to want and need more and therefore to be perpetually unhappy with what they have. Of course Minnelli was part of that machine for Hollywood which is the irony. Here he uses the periodcorrect analogy of romance novels and magazine ads and to a lesser extent operas and plays as vehicles that feed and drive Bovary's dissonance with her reality. James Mason as Flaubert too!The irony that Flaubert was faulted for denegrating the french woman is fully captured here as well. This version still doesn't get to a real meaty statement of realization that men were not considered immoral or corrupt it they have affairs and forget about their children but women were. Personally I think that may have been one of Flaubert's real points  this same behavior would have been tolerated and venerated in a male.Where this production succeeds so brilliantly over the others I mentioned is in the writing and performance of Emma. She is clearly delineated as being a victim of the commercials of her time  the ultimate consumer and therefore very identifiable. Jone's own personal charm also factors in here. Her fresh innocence and desire to be liked and to entertain come through the role and make her sweeter. Annis is often a bit self satisfied and Hubbert ice cold making their Emmas less likable although perfectly valid and well performed roles just the difference that writing production and acting bring to the role.Minnelli liked women and identified with foibles. He gives a very nice slant to Dr. Bovary too. Gives him a little more self knowledge and honor than Flaubert did which also colors the relationship and the film. Louis Jordan as her dream man is also colored very nicely here as being sincerely in love with her and very conflicted. Something he does very well and this all creates a marvelously satisfying production and package. When you add the great score you have a very fine film indeed.".

	onyx:emotionText "Madame Bovary is a difficult piece to translate to film. It is very easy for the heroine to become either dislikable either willfull the PBS version with Francesca Annis or peevish the Isabelle Hubert french version.What Minnelli so masterfully and ironically captures here is the dream machine that drives Madame Bovary and society to be dissatisfied with their daily lives to want and need more and therefore to be perpetually unhappy with what they have. Of course Minnelli was part of that machine for Hollywood which is the irony. Here he uses the periodcorrect analogy of romance novels and magazine ads and to a lesser extent operas and plays as vehicles that feed and drive Bovary's dissonance with her reality. James Mason as Flaubert too!The irony that Flaubert was faulted for denegrating the french woman is fully captured here as well. This version still doesn't get to a real meaty statement of realization that men were not considered immoral or corrupt it they have affairs and forget about their children but women were. Personally I think that may have been one of Flaubert's real points  this same behavior would have been tolerated and venerated in a male.Where this production succeeds so brilliantly over the others I mentioned is in the writing and performance of Emma. She is clearly delineated as being a victim of the commercials of her time  the ultimate consumer and therefore very identifiable. Jone's own personal charm also factors in here. Her fresh innocence and desire to be liked and to entertain come through the role and make her sweeter. Annis is often a bit self satisfied and Hubbert ice cold making their Emmas less likable although perfectly valid and well performed roles just the difference that writing production and acting bring to the role.Minnelli liked women and identified with foibles.

Jennifer Jones Van Heflin Louis Jourdan and James Mason were unfortunately hampered by the Code in this version.MGM's version incorporates the author right into his story. James Mason plays Gustave Flaubert and the film opens with him on trial for authoring indecent material as the French censors of the day saw Madame Bovary. While on the witness stand defending his work he tells the story of his creation Emma Bovary a girl with silly romantic notions who brings tragedy all around because of them.Jennifer Jones is Emma and imagine Bernadette Soubirous who instead of having a divine experience has the misfortune to have other things peak her interest as an adolescent. She reads a whole lot of romantic novels who give her exaggerated notions about the nature of love.She lives in a pretty dull town in Normandy which was also where Flaubert himself hailed from and which he satirizes in acid in this work. She marries solid dependable Van Heflin who's a doctor and who she hopes will give her a better life.It's in Heflin's character that the Code watered down what Flaubert was trying to say. Here he's an upright guy a lot on the dull side but dependable. In the novel he's as much desiring of social climbing as Jones is. In fact in the film he refuses to perform an operation that might gain him fame and success because he knows he's not qualified to do it. In the novel he does the operation and it ends in disaster all around.Jones takes lovers Louis Jourdan and Alf Kjellin and runs up bills that put Heflin into financial disaster. All the while refusing to face the truth about life and herself.Given the Code restrictions director Vincente Minnelli does as best as he can with his cast. James Mason makes a brilliant and erudite Flaubert on the stand. But considering he was on trial for indecency by not showing the alleged indecency to the fullest the Code defeated what could have been a classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Films of great novels are usually light years away in terms of quality from their originals.  There are of course a few exceptions the David Lean Dickens adaptations for instance and recently a Neil Jordan version of Graham Greene's The End of the Affair that I much admired.  Generally it is second rate literature Gone WIth the Wind a prime example that fares so much better.  Flaubert's Madame Bovary has continued through the history and development of cinema and TV to exert its fascination on wouldbe translators although it has to be admitted that it has generally proved elusive.  One would have thought that it would have fared particularly well in the hands of outstanding French directors such as Renoir and Chabrol but their efforts to come to grips with Flaubert's masterpiece have ultimately to be judged as among their lesser works.  There is quite a lot going for Jean Renoir's early 1933 version not least the authentic Normandy exteriors shot with great affection but technically the film shows its age.  It is rather like a series of tableaux some in themselves quite well done but ultimately lacking a strong narrative thrust and sense of cohesion.  Nevertheless I remember being more impressed with it than with Claude Chabrol's 1991 version which I found surprisingly cold and passionless.  I admit I have only seen this once and my memory of it is far from clear perhaps because it grabbed me so little at the time.  It may seem rather preposterous to award the accolade for the best Bovary to Vincente Minnelli's Americanised 1949 MGM version with its studio mockup of a French village that seems more of a Flanders lookalike and some location work clearly done in Californian woodland but in the absence of so little competition I would have to plump for it as being certainly the most enjoyable.  After all it has that quite exquisite beauty Jennifer Jones as the eponymous heroine suffering and eventually dying as tenderly as only she can.  My favourite memory from the film is her first appearance on the farm where Doctor Bovary is calling to tend to her sick father.  There she is in a setting of all too believable rural squalor decked out in the most unbelievably opulent dress imaginable.  If nothing else it makes Bovary's initial besottedness with her absolutely credible.  Minnelli's is a rather sanitised adaptation.  Okay to have the heroine die beautifully once the initial agony of taking poison has been established but the inevitable outcome of a botched operation on a villager's clubfoot  amputation  is unlike in the novel and other versions evaded by the doctor's refusal to take on the medical challenge.  It makes for rather more comfortable boxoffice.  There are some beautifully done scenes including the almost obligatory inclusion in a Hollywood period piece of a ballroom sequence. The one here has the hedonistic movement that is everything we had come to expect from The Great Waltz onwards.  There is also the heroine's wait her bags fully packed in a windswept street after dark for the lover that never comes.  Wyler did it rather better in The Heiress but Minnelli's has plenty of atmosphere.  His version may be even further than its competitors from Flaubert's Madame Bovary but he invests it with enough passion and commitment to ensure it a small place in Hollywood history.".

Every scene is beautifully crafted and the highlight of course is the ballroom sequence which seems to be the only part of the film ever thought highly of. All the way through the camera movement design pacing the understanding of the complexities of Emma Bovary's situation are perfect. Even without the performances of the cast all this would make it very very admirable. Add to that Jennifer Jones' excellent performance in the tile role alternately childlike and passionate giddy and neurotic and you have a great film. Jourdan is also fine as Emma's dream lover and the criticisms of Heflin's performance as stiff and boring are unjust. He is very subtle and plays it well. I never thought I would say this because I'm crazy about the guy but Mason's intro and concluding trial scenes as author Gustave Flaubert just don't gel with the rest of the film. Mason gives his usual intelligence and consideration to the role but somehow his voiceover doesn't work? I still liked the Flaubert scenes though incorporating the author.

It stars Jennifer Jones Van Heflin Louis Jourdan Alf Kjellin Gene Lockhart and James Mason. Music is by Mikls Rzsa and cinematography by Robert H. Planck.It's most interesting now watching Minnelli's picture and being able to place it in the time it was made. Also of major interest is reading up on what the critics of the time had to say about it. This version is an undoubted lesson in the technical crafts of film making the visuals the sound art design costuming and a literary pumped screenplay that allows the cast to play it classical. It's also black hearted perfectly in keeping with the gathering storm of the era that was film noir.Here is the monster.Some of the complaints about the film to me anyway just don't add up. Why do we need to care about anyone in this story? It's a dark tale of illicit passions greed betrayals bad parenting and etc. Is this frowned upon in some circles because of love for the classic novel? Or because there's some esteem held for other versions? The criticism of Jones is also very suspect given it's a classic femme fatale performance Emma is cold and driven and shallow to others feelings Jones works it perfectly.As Rzsa's beautiful lush and poignant musical arrangements drift and hover over the various story instalments Minnelli brings the film making guile. His camera work is sublime like a ghost moving about the characters for the more vibrant scenes tracking and roving dizzyingly beautiful. At others it's close and personal imbuing Emma's claustrophobia with the black and white contrasts superbly photographed by Planck.So it doesn't capture the essence of Flaubert's intent then? Emma Bovary a figure of hate instead of sympathy the lack of a caustic aside on a society of double standards? So what! Outstanding film making is just that especially when it can tune into a style of film making prevalent at its birth. Madame Bovary  maybe the most film noir movie not actually considered a film noir.

	schema:reviewBody "Vincente Minelli's Madame Bovary does whatever a studio film can do of the period to make a book like Flaubert's into a more than competent production. And it does work out for Minelli as one of his better films that his Madame Bovary is a tale that tries to get us to understand though likely not to sympathize with its anti heroine who cheats on her loving husband and sells out his home from under his nose only to do himself in in the end. It's pretty bleak stuff but there's an air of exhilaration to it like a fresh Lifetime TV movie that hasn't yet been overdampened with the conventions that plague it and has a grace and daring to it as well. It might strike some as a little much that Minelli bookends the picture with the trial of Flaubert as it should have nothing to do with the story itself. But there is that attempt that try at getting the readers of its time to get a grasp on disillusionment in marriage which is something that is instantly recognizable and to make compelling literature and to never have it silenced. It's even adiramble in post WW2 America to make a point via a French novel how marriages can go wrong. That's not all there is of course as countless English classes have taught us with the book.It goes without saying the book is far richer and with more emotional depth in the descriptions that go into Flaubert's writing. But it should be said that Jennifer Jones is also the best Bovary that has yet been brought to the screen a woman who is very very hard to like at all for what she does particularly to an everyman. Albeit arguably a very plain and average guy like her husband doctor who doesn't want anything more than to do his duty and go through the daily grind. Jones makes her in a small way sympathetic something to her presence has her poised as a tragic figure hard to pinpoint but not easy to grasp either. You want to hate her as the film rolls along through its second half as she becomes more desperate and more and more indebted to a world of men who have come to hate her too. But her desperation in a way makes her all the more human less entranced by the ultimately foolish ideals of her storybook romances and grounded to a halt with reality.Flaubert doesn't give us the easy route of making it a statement of blame which might set it apart from what would be a Lifetime movie of the present. Jones is terrific in the part wavering between being a bad mother the baby always cries in her presence a neflectful wife when is she home? and a sour of a mistress keeps that Italian waiting for years what the hell? And it's pulled off quite nicely from her. Credit where it's due to to Minelli who constructs that ballroom sequence that spins and spins like the perpetual loop from that superimposed shot from Shadow of a Doubt it's one of his true virtuoso sequences a highwire act done all for the sake of enlivening and critically molding the mood of Emma Bovary a woman who can be taken away by the exuberance of escapism ignorant of what she's really getting into in the midst of a plastic sort of world. There's a lot to be read into the source itself just see the arguments thrown around in the book club scene in Little Children. The movie however is an exquisite time capsule where it's given an intro like with a new book edition but with its own space and freedom to succeed on its own terms.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hollywood's record on film adaptations of classic literature is fairly respectable keeping in mind the ever present eye on the box office. What pleased me most about this 1949 version of Madame Bovary is in fact its modesty. This probably has more to do with budget constraints than anything but there is something small scale and decidedly unpretentious about it. While Jennifer Jones and Van Heflin may not be quite B movie actors they were secondary level stars. Jones did not have the classical beauty of many of her contemporaries which is in keeping with Flaubert's description of Emma Bovary and Heflin's lack of charisma certainly suits Charles Bovary well.Jones' performance is fairly good with only occasional lapses into excessive Hollywood emoting. Despite Selznick's grooming she never quite became the star he intended for her. Her best performance remains in the surprisingly comic role of Lubitch's Cluny Brown. All in all she captures much of Emma's desperation but there is a distinct lacking in depth.Heflin has the easier role and pulls it off well. Although this version sticks closely to the novel one small change does however alter things significantly. Charles Bovary was clearly what we would call a loser. Emma comes to this realization early on. She encourages him to perform an innovative operation to cure a young man's club foot hoping this act will finally win him fame and status. In the novel Charles remains unaware of his obvious limitations. Not only is he a loser his has little understanding of himself and his professional abilities. He botches the operation which further drives Emma apart. While this isn't meant to justify Emma's behaviour in the eyes of the reader it certainly helps to explain her basic rejection of her husband. In the film however at the very second he is about to perform the operation Bovary realizes that it in fact a bad idea and stops the proceedings. He is thus endowed with qualities that Flaubert did not intend.Minnelli plays it safe. As can be expected his direction is solid and professional. As many have pointed out the ballroom scene is handled superbly. However ultimately the film does not leave a lasting impression despite its well intentioned and well executed efforts.".

	schema:headline " Lacks the complexity and depth of the book but still beautiful cinema...";
	schema:reviewBody "Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary is beautiful and shocking one of the European literary greats. While it is not the most faithful adaptation around Vincente Minnelli's Madame Bovary does stand on its own two feet and is a beautiful film in its own right. It does suffer from what made the book so complex and shocking not being fully allowed to come out due to the limitations of the Production Code at the time of it being made and releasedmaybe the film's length too. So you do miss the stuffiness and hypocrisy of French provincial life which I always took as a crucial part to Emma's character while the script could have done with more of a dark edge and Minnelli's direction is often dazzling and technically skilledthe ballroom sequence has to be a highlight in his directorial career but also a little too relaxed in places so the drama has occasional stodginess. But it is unfair to dismiss Madame Bovary due to these because its positives are a great many. That it is one of the most visually beautiful films of the 40s is one the costumes are evocative and astonishingly elegant Emma's dresses are a wow factor while the sets are the very meaning of grand with a BaroqueRoccocco influence.

	onyx:emotionText "Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary is beautiful and shocking one of the European literary greats. While it is not the most faithful adaptation around Vincente Minnelli's Madame Bovary does stand on its own two feet and is a beautiful film in its own right. It does suffer from what made the book so complex and shocking not being fully allowed to come out due to the limitations of the Production Code at the time of it being made and releasedmaybe the film's length too. So you do miss the stuffiness and hypocrisy of French provincial life which I always took as a crucial part to Emma's character while the script could have done with more of a dark edge and Minnelli's direction is often dazzling and technically skilledthe ballroom sequence has to be a highlight in his directorial career but also a little too relaxed in places so the drama has occasional stodginess. But it is unfair to dismiss Madame Bovary due to these because its positives are a great many. That it is one of the most visually beautiful films of the 40s is one the costumes are evocative and astonishingly elegant Emma's dresses are a wow factor while the sets are the very meaning of grand with a BaroqueRoccocco influence.

Producer Pandro S. Berman knew what he was doing when he hired Minnelli to shoot this adaptation of Gustave Flaubert's classic novel. Classicera Hollywood was saturated with stories of apparently selfish women who ruin the men in their life but Madame Bovary differs in that it gets us to understand and sympathise with its tragic heroine even drawing parallels to our own desire for escapism through literature or cinema. And in the 1940s few pictures were as escapist as those of Minnelli.When you look at a Minnelli picture his visual style is all about framing and defining beauty be it Judy Garland singing at her window a spectacular Ziegfeld stage set or recreations of findesiecle artworks. For him exquisite imagery was not simply a gloss  it was an aesthetic ideal that was at the heart of cinema. Yet for this picture he frames beauty within the dreariness of reality for example showing Jennifer Jones gazing out of the window of her dingy attic room on a glorious summer's day. But what is significant is that no matter how desperate the circumstances get no matter how dark or cramped the interiors become Jones is always magnificently dressed and there is always somewhere a window onto a better world. In other words he doesn't allow us to lose respect for the character or her romantic idealism. The real world may let us down Minnelli seems to be saying but he won't allow the concept of beauty itself to be dragged through the mud.The trouble with this version of Madame Bovary  and this is something common to many booktofilm adaptations  is that it is extremely bitty and repetitive. Novels are after all intended to be picked up and put down whereas motion pictures must be swallowed in a sitting. Minnelli's flowing style may be designed to keep the audience constantly engaged on a visual level but storywise it is less likely to hold our interest. The acting performances are not exceptional  at least not by the standards of Jones and Heflin and in any case we are not really able to focus on them within Minnelli's technical sweep.What we have here then is an adaptation that fails to assemble coherently the bones of the plot but captures the essence of Flaubert's work and exhorts us to sympathise with the protagonist. The picture opens with a historical scene in which the author played by James Mason defends his creation by defending its heroine. This introduction as much as states that it is not enough to read what Emma did we must understand why she did it. In this respect Minnelli's Madame Bovary is a success on its own terms.".

Now your typical sensation type lecturer points to portrait of Madame Bovary lives for the moment switches allegiances on impulse luxuriates in the indulgence of her sensory apparatus cannot be depended upon and is insensitive to the feelings of others except as they affect her. We may forgive a sensation type but are we really supposed to like her? Says who? That's kind of how I felt about this story. I'd heard as a youngster that this was supposed to be a sexy novel. It was known as Madame Ovary. So I struggled through it but it seemed boring. Maybe in French there were grace notes in the prose absent from the English translation. But I really don't know how anything could have saved this from being a weeper.The viewer gets the general idea quickly enough because the narrator James Mason gives it to us right off the bat. The young poor Emma Bovary Jennifer Jonesis suffering an acute case of Bovarism. She lives in a world of romantic fantasy a kind of Ruritania of the mind with dashing knights and love in Swiss chalets. Her walls are plastered with illustrations from fairy tales. And she never outgrows this world of makebelieve.She doesn't have enough insight to know that marrying the devoted but dull village doctor Van Heflin in a good bumbling performanceis not the answer. She attributes her dissatisfaction to her need for a child a boy. She eventually has her child but it's a girl and the girl rejects her in favor of her husband and her housekeeper. And who wouldn't reject Emma? Half the time she's hysterical and the other half she's about to become hysterical. Anyway the next thing you know Emma has taken up with the local clerk and when he's booted over to Rouen by his domineering mother she takes up with the handsome dashing narcissistic rich Rodolphe Boulanger Louis Jordan. She decorates poor Doctor Bovary's house in expensive fabrics and furniture borrowing secretly from a stonefaced usurer who will in the end bring her and her family down by selling the notes which means bankruptcy for the Bovarys. She throws herself at the feet of an erstwhile lover and begs for money. I haven't got it he says and throws her out. In an excess of selfpity I didn't notice much in the way of guilt she eats some arsenic and is called away to answer to a higher collection agency.The movie has one or two neat set pieces directed by Vincent Minelli. There's the scene at the first ball to which the Bovarys are invited the ball at which Emma first dances with Rodolphe and the awkward anxious husband gets drunk. I'm not much for balls. Everybody gets dressed up and dances in circles. I don't know how to waltz Emma tells Rodolphe. Well Emma neither does anyone else now. In a college class I was trying to get across the notion of dialectics and asked for a volunteer from the audience to help me demonstrate the waltz step. No volunteers because nobody knew how to waltz  or what a waltz was for that matter. Minelli sets up this ball though so that it's not nearly as boring as most. The guys are boozing it up the women look gorgeous in their elaborate Walter Plunkett gowns and when one of the ladies feels dizzy from dancing the host orders attendants to bash out the windows. There is also a wild wedding scene that might have come from Pieter Bruegel or maybe Sam Pekinpah's Ride the High Country.Jennifer Jones is Emma with a breathless lisp. Van Heflin is nearly perfect as the humble inarticulate doctor. Doctors in the 1850s weren't as high in the statussphere as they are today. If they had been Emma would have been not only foolish to betray her husband but downright loco. This role must have stereotyped Louis Jordan because he seemed to play little but the same pavonine French lover in film after film.However although I may not have gotten very much out of it others might. I haven't looked at the user's ratings but I'd be mildly surprised if women didn't give it a higher score than men. Sensation types of either gender are likely to switch channels before it's over.".

It's a great moment but unfortunately most of the film's remaining scenes seem to pale by comparison with that stunning triumph of music and photography.JENNIFER JONES is unable to make her Madame Bovary appear anything more than vain and foolish and as usual there's something alienating about her personalitywhich should have suited the role but keeps her from becoming the victim she's supposed to be.The JAMES MASON courtroom prologue with the actor as Flaubert seems to be operating from a different film and doesn't blend well into the actual story. Perhaps a different approach would have worked better.Still this is a better than average melodrama of a woman scorned who turns out to be her own worst enemy. While all the performances around her are more than adequate none of them really stand out the way they should in an adaptation of a classic story.Fans of Jones Jourdan or Heflin will no doubt find the film fascinating despite its flaws and the Miklos Rozsa score is worth hearing for the ballroom sequence alone.".

But I can't say it's a personal favorite of mine basically because it was too much undermined by Hollywood sensibilities. Still it is an interesting link in the chain of Minnelli's films and reveals a lot about him as an artist. It bears interesting comparison with some of his other films which provides my main interest in the film as opposed to what it is in and of itself.This version of Bovary starts with a rather intrusive framing device wherein the author Flaubert played by Englishman James Mason takes the stand in defense of his novel's decency. What he ultimately provides by way of defense is rather insulting to one's intelligence  simply the idea that art depicts realism of some kind and that therefore the morality of the art itself cannot be drawn into question. All of this just might have some kind of impact if it weren't for the fact that the film itself avoids a lot of the nastier aspects of Flaubert's work and replaces them with a relatively standard misogynistic fallen woman tale whitewashing the character of Charles Bovary Van Heflin and cleaning up the ending. So while we have James Mason eloquently defending artistic freedom we have at the same time a compromised film that hypocritically censors Flaubert's work in order to make it more palatable to Christian sensibilities.However in someone other than Minnnelli's hands this script could have turned into fullon misogyny. Instead he and Jennifer Jones in the title role created a reasonably nuanced portrait of the woman. And what really puts it over is Minnelli's unparalleled sense of how to use the environments to enhance the characterization from Emma's little farm room with tackedup depictions of noble knights and ladies to the bricabrac luxury apartment she constructs for her adult life. One of the things about Minnelli which is fascinating and has been studied by various authors is the way that Minnelli uses decor not just as a way of describing his characters but also as a way of actually conditioning them. Not only do the settings show the influence of the characters and thus describe them but they also have a direct impact on the characters. Minnelli has great sympathy with Emma Bovary's desire for escape and transcendence through fantasy and he makes us feel it too with the great technique in the ballroom dance sequence. In all cases Madame Bovary's surroundings dictate her behavior while she consciously believes that by purchasing all kinds of luxury items to surround herself with she will thereby be able to control her own destiny through interior design.Minnelli's film is about a woman who is afraid of the ordinary for whom childish romantic notions of escape become a suffocating influence on her entire life. The Charles Bovary character is played as a very downtoearth type perhaps in order to elicit the audience's pathos but also to provide a contrast to Emma. Minnelli is conscious of the fact that film itself is often guilty of feeding these very same notions of escape and fantasy and he uses this film as a way of subverting that process.".

	schema:reviewBody "I could never like Gustave Flaubert for his merciless realism completely void of any idealism but as a realist he was one of the sharpest in France wherefore a novel like Madame Bovary is perhaps best seen as a clinical and perfect documentary. As Gustave Flaubert said himself there are thousands of Emma Bovarys all over France. At the same time he confessed Emma Bovary to be himself. Here is a paradox and mystery worth investigating.Jennifer Jones as Emma even better than Vivien Leigh as Anna Karenina is the extreme opposite of Bernadette of Lourdes 6 years earlier for which she was awarded an Oscar. Jennifer as Emma is the extreme idealist who lives only for her dreams and commits the mistake of trying to make reality her dreams. This is a very human and common mistake. Gustave Flaubert's own tragedy was perhaps that he could not indulge in committing that mistake himself. Instead he indulged the more in giving Emma free reins to go to any length in that indulgence in which he is very thorough in tearing her apart piece by piece. Is this cruelty or realism? It is perhaps cruelty excused by realism but it's definitely realism and unassailable as such.Van Heflin is reliably honest in his part as usual and makes a thoroughly impeccable impersonation of a perfectly normal and honestly boring man. As in the novel he is impossible not to put horns on. He is too honest for his own good.Her case starts when she gradually more and more find her ideals incompatible with the reality she is confined to and finds more and more like a prison. Her only cure is escapism into her dreams trying obsessively to drown the unbearable pettiness of her naked reality in luxury  and the first lover the handsome Leon played by the handsome Swede Alf Kjellin perfect for that part like almost another Axel von Fersen.To all this comes Vincente Minnelli's amazing direction. He had almost only made show films before and here suddenly he is as psychologically brilliant and poignant as another Hitchcock. The great ball scene when she first meets Louis Jourdan is Vincente Minnelli in full bloom combining splendid festivity with dark undercurrents of impending tragedy impressively illustrated by the crushing of windows and glasses as poor Van Heflin drunk searches for his wife as if he unconsciously already knew he had lost her....The music Miklos Rosza is also perfect as everything else in this film Frank Allenby is terrible in his handsome ruthlessness as her creditor and Gladys Cooper comes sailing in as the perfect mother spoiling everything almost compelling Emma to adultery by her puritan insistence and then comes Louis Jourdan opening the abyss with his insolent superiority...James Mason introduces and ends the film as Gustave Flaubert himself defending himself and Emma at court with as eloquent a brilliance as everything else in this film. You certainly should see it again sometime.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cedric the Entertainer is a fascinating man. I first saw him on the Steve Harvey show and those two have been playing off of each others' comedy bits for a good amount of time. They were both in the Original Kings of Comedy with Bernie Mack and D.L. Hughley and they are back together in this cutesypie family flick about going to a family reunion and encountering obstacles in every manner along the way. Picture National Lampoon's Vacation minus the funny main character Chevy Chase and throw in plenty of urban over saturation.This is interesting how Cedric plays such a straight character with hardly any humor as an insurance salesman his career before acting...a stretch for Cedric sarcastically speaking other than an occasional giggle at his manner of helping his family get along on this trip. Right off the bat the movie starts heading straight to hell. Bow Wow who was probably offered this role after his CDs stopped selling plays a kid who seems like he's nine who keeps talking in izzle terms and stereotyping right away. A quick and pointless cameo by Kurupt the rapper leads the audience down the wrong path entirely. Shannon Elizabeth was in the film briefly as a stonerwitchhitchhiker who also wields an alligator which was actually pretty great animating for the alligator...very creepy.There were funny moments like the hanging of a flatscreen TV between JFK and a picture of Jesus...pretty symbolic and funny. Also I liked the costar Vanessa Williams' comment on tricked out SUVs It looks like a purse on wheels. Also at the end Steve Harvey plays the brother of Cedric who wins the family reunioncompetition and when his trophy is crushed by a truck his performance at that point was pretty funny. But that's all...Most of the movie is based around sketch comedy and pieced together to seem like a movie. You can tell where they were trying to come up with filler for the film. There are pointless farturine jokes that have been overdone a terrible CHP sequence with a jail moment and all that and a family reunion that they know that they're going to hate but they go anyways...FUN!  Overall I gave it a 410. It was a lighthearted movie that probably shouldn't be looked at this closely but it does when the movie loses the audience's interest halfway through it. Don't even bother renting it get National Lampoon's Vacation or European Vacation instead. This movie will appeal to your 10 or 11yearold only so beware.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is an annual event in the wider Johnson clan to get together for a reunion of food song and competition  a competition that is always won by Mack Johnson. Despite being separated from his wife Nate Johnson gets his family together to attend as usual and keep up appearances. With a brand new Navigator truck and a tight time scale the family of five set out on their road trip only to find themselves having to deal with cement police alligators and hitchhikers  and that's all before they get to the reunion.I generally avoid allblack comedies not because I am racist but because the opposite is true  and I find that many of these modern blaxploitation comedies are full of racist stereotypes and broad ethnic caricatures. With this film screening on a flight I was on I decided to watch it as I find it very difficult to sleep on planes. I was pleased to find that the film didn't base itself on racist stereotypes and the like and instead went for the more raceneutral approach of road movie broad gags a la Vacation. This is not to say that it is funnier  only easier to watch because it is less offensive to me personally. The plot is very simple but it makes the mistake of not staying simple  instead it adds subplots of separation and treats them seriously. This is a problem because it rounds them off in glib unconvincing ways that make a joke out of ever having them in the first place  the whole issue of Nate and Dorothy working things out is a perfect example the supposed focal point of the family contest is another one  it feels tacked on.The film is not anywhere near as funny as it needed to be to be a good comedy. It has the odd laugh but generally the humour is so very broad and uninspired that it is hard to do anything but raise the occasional smile. Part of the reason it is even slightly funny is due to the good work from Cedric the Entertainer. He isn't great here but he does manage to get laughs from the poor material he is given to deliver. Bow Wow is hardly much of a draw but aside from being an annoying rapper clich in the making he does do well alongside Cedric. Williams is an OK actress but here she has nothing to do  she has no laughs and she is betrayed by the script when it comes to the serious side of the film. Knowles looks sexy but that's it  nothing more than that likewise Soleil is a 'cute kid' and nothing more. Harvey is so poor that I actually wondered if he was the reason that the whole 'family contest' thing was pushed into such a small part of the film.Overall this is a very average film at best. The plot is terrible at points and just annoyed me in the way that it seemed to just writeoff the entire affair in the final section. The laughs come mainly from Cedric who does OK considering the very broad material he has to work with and with little support from his costars. It's good that it more or less avoid the lazy racist stereotyping inherent in the 'black comedy' genre but it would have been nice if they'd replaced it with something worthwhile.".

	schema:headline " National Lampoon's African American Vacation.";
	schema:reviewBody "Recently estranged parents Cedric the Entertainer and Vanessa L. Williams come back together to go to Cedric's family reunion. Along for the ride are their three kids supercool Lil' Bow Wow superhot Solange Knowles and supercute Gabby Soleil and a wide variety of mishaps and misadventures as they hit the road together in a new SUV that Cedric has borrowed from a dealership. Naturally their trip from Los Angeles to Missouri will have hilarious consequences along the way. Cedric has ulterior motives to win a Family of the Year prize at the reunion getting it away from older brother Steve Harvey in a welltimed role. He also has to contend with his mother Aloma Wright when he reaches his destination but first he and his family must overcome ultrasexy hitchhiker Shannon Elizabeth who happens to be a black magic priestess and even an unseen 18wheeler driver who continues to push Cedric's buttons. Johnson Family Vacation is basically an African American version of the National Lampoon's Vacation series. Cedric and Williams have the same comedic timing and relationship that Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo shared during their long run. The kids though here are quite better than any throughout the aforementioned series. But the similarities between this movie and those from the previous series are amazing as we have an erotic stranger a rented vehicle a road trip a family gettogether and even a take on a Wayne Newton song. In many ways Johnson Family Vacation is old hat but I still liked the film because Cedric is just such a hilarious screen presence. The others all feed off his intensity and Williams is the ultimate straight lady in the mix as she just seems out of place with her great looks and outstanding manners this is a compliment to her by the way. Eventually the movie loses its way as the trip nears a close but Johnson Family Vacation is still a very funny experience at the movies. Does that make it a good production? Certainly not but it is still a legitimate rest from reality. 2.5 out of 5 stars.".

	onyx:emotionText "Recently estranged parents Cedric the Entertainer and Vanessa L. Williams come back together to go to Cedric's family reunion. Along for the ride are their three kids supercool Lil' Bow Wow superhot Solange Knowles and supercute Gabby Soleil and a wide variety of mishaps and misadventures as they hit the road together in a new SUV that Cedric has borrowed from a dealership. Naturally their trip from Los Angeles to Missouri will have hilarious consequences along the way. Cedric has ulterior motives to win a Family of the Year prize at the reunion getting it away from older brother Steve Harvey in a welltimed role. He also has to contend with his mother Aloma Wright when he reaches his destination but first he and his family must overcome ultrasexy hitchhiker Shannon Elizabeth who happens to be a black magic priestess and even an unseen 18wheeler driver who continues to push Cedric's buttons.

	schema:reviewBody "Johnson Family Vacation is a very stupid comedy that's really not worth watching. Cedric the Entertainer plays Nate Johnson a family man who agrees to take his brood across country to Missouri for the annual family reunion. Can his dysfunctional family survive the trip without killing each other? The plot is very generic and the execution is nothing new. The movie is so bland that there's no reason to actually go out and see it. The cast makes this film a bit better but they don't seem to be really be trying. Cedric the Entertainer and Vanessa L. Williams both play their roles decently. Solange Knowles and Bow Wow play their kids and both don't really give memorable performances. Shannon Elizabeth was probably the best part about the film too bad she's in it for about ten minutes. Steve Harvey has a small role as Nate's brother. Every second he is on screen though makes the film very hard to watch as he is not funny at all. Christopher Erskin directs his first film and he can hopefully improve if he decides to make another one. The writers got very lazy in this film as most of the jokes fall flat. There may be a funny one here or there but that's not enough. This wouldn't had been problem if the running time wasn't 110 minutes. Since it is so long there aren't enough jokes to sustain its running time. Also this film feels a lot longer then 110 minutes. When compared to other films its better then The Cookout and Soul Plane. The National Lampoons road trip movies are a lot better and you should stick with those. In the end this a very generic film that's not worth watching though its pretty inoffensive. Rating 410 skip this unless your a diehard fan of any of the stars involved.".

A film for everyone who loves long journeys and Solange Knowles I know i do. The film is alike a 'My Wife and Kids' episode and coninscidently features Jennifer Freeman. A great family film with an excellent ending".

I really hate to say it that people like crap movies like van helsing and alamo but think that this movie is bad. JFV was simply hilarious and it is a very neat and clean comedy with neat and clean humor mostly. Everyone must watch this movie with an open mind. This is for the first time black people have been treated so well on screen and I really loved it because the kind of role they are normally seen in are crackheads or drug dealers. In this movie the black family is shown as a very normal and civilized family and I really liked it. Good Job Cedric the entertainer.My Rating 1010".

Along the way of course the family meets with a series of comic misadventures that threaten to prevent them from reaching their destination.Despite the derivative storyline the early scenes in the film exhibit a kind of playful spirit that bodes well for the rest of the movie. This is due in no small measure to Cedric the Entertainer who unlike so many of the comics who appear in these types of movies doesn't feel the need to stand apart from the material in order to draw attention to himself. Indeed it is the laidback unfussy way in which he delivers his lines that makes them so funny. He is also blessed with an attractive supporting cast that includes Vanessa Williams as his longsuffering wife and Bow Wow as his mouthy but generally goodhearted teenage son. The movie even includes some clever little satirical jabs at the accoutrements and symbols of modernday black culture as Nate the traditionalist who listens to '70's soul on his wornout 8tracks goes toetotoe with his adolescent gansta' rap adolescents.But as the Johnsons tootle their way across country in their soupedup SUV we begin to notice that the film itself has stalled out. About halfway through it dawns on us that the movie isn't really going anywhere that it is merely playing out variations on incidents we've seen earlier in the film and that the set pieces and situations aren't nearly as interesting or outrageous as they should be. This is truly a pity because given the attractive cast we really want to like Johnson Family Vacation more than we ultimately do.Still all things considered this makes for a reasonable diverting mindless time at the movies and Cedric the Entertainer's moniker has rarely seemed so apt.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the best movies I have seen this year. Michael Winterbottom proves to be a truly versatile director with this film about love loneliness sorrow and obsession in an English coastal town. The use of Elvis Costello's song I want you as a theme throughout the film is superb. It leaves you with a strange and yearning sensation that will last for days. The cinematography is so very good thanks to Kieslowskis photographer Zlavomir Idziak who also filmed Gattaca creating a similar visual style. Wonderful yellow green and blue renders a supernatural poetic feel to the characters as well as the town. You watch with the feeling that anything can happen and it does.The casting of this movie is almost perfect. Rachel Weisz is equally true as the both innocent and dangerous Helen as she was in The Mummy playing a librarian with vigour looks and brains. I predict hers to be a great career. Make way Kate Winslet and Helena BonhamCarter! Alessandro Nivola as Martin is just as persuasive. He is scary touching pathetic and assertive all at the same time consumed by an obsession with Helen fuelled by eight years in jail.The only thing that bothers me about this movie is the way it abandons the mute boy and his sister's story to concentrate on Helen and Martin. However this is a minor detail in a movie that often bears visual reminders of Derek Jarman at his very best. The very selfconscious references to Romeo is bleeding and Red rock west will probably ensure a similar cultfollowing before long.".

It is for the open minded and analytical.  Why? Because this movie is virtually left blank for the audience to fill in. The acting is superb Rachel Weisz and Alessandro Nivola are very talented and are justly fit for the role.  About 70 of the dialogue was improvised so that should tell you something.  Although there are sometimes too many holes in the plot and not enough information given the movie i believe is pulled off wonderfully.  It is a very open movie and there are no reassurances.  The audience will probably find themselves playing psychologist to the deep rich characters that develop as the short movie progresses.  The characters and the whole openness of the movie is what appealed to me.  I Want You is very underrated and people should give this movie a second try.  Yeah there is some explicit sex and voyeurism going on but that is one of the movie's great central themes.  The focus is very apparent from the beginning and the beautiful thing that sets it off is mood.  The color tones used in mellow bluish and yellowish color the melancholy and often creepy music... and the locale add to it.  The movie is almost like The Virgin Suicides in mood except much much darker with a darker creepier story as well.  It seems throughout the entire movie that the characters are sort of lost in this sort of moody limbo that Michael Winterbottom creates... and you get lost as well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Michael Winterbottom doesn't make conventional British films. His work has the austere demeanour and unrestrictive sense of experimentation that we normally associate with the European aesthetic of filmmakers like Herzog Kieslowski Bergman et al. This ideology is further illustrated by the film in question with the director employing the esteemed cinematographer of Kieslowski's A Short Film About Killing 1987 Slavomir Idziak to create the dark noirlike underworld of disintegrating coastal beach huts and seedy promenades where these mysterious characters come to congregate. It's one of those films that puts atmosphere before everything else a film in which the long pauses between dialog and the odd sideways glance of a character says more than an explanatory line of dialog ever could. If you have a problem with films of this nature  the kind that leaves questions and images lingering in the viewer's mind for weeks to follow  then this probably won't be the film for you.The plot is on first glance a simple one relying on a series of emotional triggers whilst also playing with the usual cinematic chronology to go backwards and forwards into an event from the past. However as we further explore the films subtextual ideologies and the shadowy morals of the central quartet of characters we discover hidden depths that have more to do with perception memory and perspective. Winterbottom sets up an idea that each character sees a particular event in a certain way so that we end up with multiple viewpoints all jostling for our attention. The resulting plot becomes much more of a puzzle as we are further immersed within the shocking incident that bookends the narrative. Added to this we are also given a narrator who cannot be trusted which in turn leads us into a series of twists which expose the characters true intentions. The ultimate pay off comes right out of nowhere and knocks us off our feet as the director subverts everything that we've previously seen and turns it into an almost epiphany. It's one of the most satisfying pay offs to a crime thriller that I've seen in some time.The photography of Idziak takes us into further labyrinthine realms that perfectly complement the seedy atmosphere and perpetual drive of lust and obsession with the entire film relying on various colour filters that not only highlight the mood but also act as a visual anchor to the characters and the emotional context of the moment. The music too is detailed and significant with Winterbottom using a series of musical motifs to expressionistically represent the emotional underlining of the characters. In a film that relies on sound as such an integral component of the script this is expertly handled. The inclusion of Elvis Costello's eponymous anthem from which the film takes its title is totally relevant and certainly adds a muchneeded sense of abstract fragmented reality to the selfcontained world of the plot. The central performances only help to give the film an even greater sense of added depth with the two youngsters Luka Petrusic and Lubina Mitevska complementing the more seasoned members of the cast perfectly. In the lead role of Helen Rachel Weisz exudes a provocative sexual energy whilst Alesandro Nivola is a revelation as the brokendown Martin.I Want You 1998 is for me one of the most striking and evocative cinematic works of the last decade. An example of British cinema pushed beyond the realms of kitchensink and ably demonstrating a sense of visual imagination rare for this kind of genre. This is an exception film for those who enjoy their thrillers with a dark underlining and a distinctly multidimensional edge.".

Right under the surface of this apparently mundane coastal community lies passion obsession and terrible misfortune. Around the edge is inequity and injustice.Winterbottom achieves a highly erotic mood and the film is punctuated with frank and realistic sexuality which on it's own may be labeled pornographic especially in the MPAA circuits. The director effectively addresses the dilemmas of human sexuality and hammers home the cruelty of the human condition.All of the acting is great and the cinematography accurately delivers the location to your imagination. Rachel Weisz can be seen here in her element. Younger and somewhat thicker set than she has become she seethes with sexuality whilst remaining demure. She is the the enigma of this film and if you've ever known a young woman to whom all men are hopelessly somewhat inexplicably attracted you'll see her in Weisz's Helen.I recommend this film to anyone who likes intelligent erotica and tragedy. Also anyone who's grown up around rural coastal Britain or wants insight into it will love this.".

But the contempt He perceives as a Muslim immigrant to the UK causes him to break up with She offering little in the way of explanation and return to his homeland. She drags his reasons out of him little by little and tries to sympathize. Keenly feeling the loss of his love She flies to Havana to sort things out on the beach and in the cabarets. She sends him a ticket but harbors no illusions that He will join her in this Carribean melting pot...";

I am so grateful to have been present at this extraordinary event the film is still in negotiations for distribution. Yes is a love story between She Joan Allen stunning in the role of a lifetime and He Simon Akbarian. She is married to Sam Neill who manages to play both boorish and sympathetic a scientist and IrishAmerican living in London  a city Potter loves to photograph and whose different colliding cultures she conveys superbly. He is Lebanese working as a chef in London. She meets He. Love ensues.It sounds so simple and in a sense it is. The film is luminous elegant ravishingly beautiful subtly erotic. The love scenes feel so natural. And yet  all the dialogue is spoken in rhymed iambic pentameter. Scenes are shot from canted angles through glass or water sometimes from CCTV cameras. Jumpcuts motion blur internal monologue an unsettling score  all these elements challenge the simplicity of the idea of love. He and She are unnamed but they have backgrounds political and religious beliefs that take the narrative so far beyond the usual romantic pap of Hollywood cinema. Every frame and every gesture invites multiple viewings and multiple readings partly for the precision and lush beauty each city has its own colour scheme and because so many other films and paintings are evoked including an audacious nod to Orlando early on! And because this is a Sally Potter film the passion and the politics have a strain of humour. Or in this case a frame provided by Shirley Henderson as She's cleaning woman. Her opening and closing monologues in the whiteness of She's London house are immediately engaged and totally unlike anything else you'll see or hear in film at least Englishlanguage film. In fact that's a good summary Yes is totally unlike anything you've seen before.".

There are no explosions chase scenes or guns in this movie.Instead we have a film with metaphors themes and relationships. There are few movies I have seen recently that attack such large and serious topics.The major themes in this movie are God love and politics. During the course of the movie racism and war terrorism and the Middle East infidelity atheism and Marxism are all brought on stage.As if that weren't enough the majority of the dialog is in rhymed verse with perhaps occasional interjections of free verse. In fact the entire very contemporary script has a vaguely Shakespearean feel to it though there is no shortage of four letter words.The entire cast of the movie is wonderful but the centerpiece of the entire film is Joan Allen who gives an almost supernaturally wonderful performance. The heart of the movie is a moving love story but this is a serious romance with strong deeply emotional scenes designed to reflect adult rather than teenage themes.There are also major metaphors in the movie such as the role of cleaning which usually stands for an attempt to wipe out guilt or corruption and the use of glass and particularly glasses of water to show the way different viewpoints distort a particular perception of reality.If you are prepared to see a very serious beautiful made and extremely arty film then this is an excellent way to spend your time. I simply loved the movie and would probably enjoy seeing it again sometime soon. But please don't bother to go if you are looking for something else.

Expectations more often than not ruin our perceptions of a film and that would be my advice for anyone seeing this film for the first time do not expect to know what you are getting into. With that said I believe this was a marvelous film because it was able to balance the seriousness of its subject matter with a nice touch of humor. This definitely was not a film for everybody and I say this because it does require one to think when viewing it and as we all know a lot of people go to the movies to escape not to think. Right away the viewer will realize this is not your normal film simply by the dialogue it was written in iambic pentameter and rhyming couplets. The rhyming of the dialogue might be a turn off for some but I found it to be quite pleasing and very humorous almost in a mature Dr. Seuss sort of way. Anyone that is a writer will appreciate the time and care and difficulty that went into writing this script. Regarding the content of this film I will only say that everything is not always as it appears and we interpret what we see...if you can appreciate this kind of thought then see this film. If I had to compare it to another film which I shouldn't do I'd say American Beauty or Donnie Darko. On a technical note I had the chance to talk to Mrs. Potter and her producer Mr. Sheppard afterwards and they informed me that it cost less than 4 million to make this film which makes it all the more magnificent.".

At times it becomes quite didactic as He asserts the Muslim philosophical position and She replies for the secular West. The dying Ulster communist Aunt's story is also an unusual ingredient. Even the more conventional elements  the alienated husband Sam Neil the empty affluence the troubled teenager Stephanie Leonidas are deftly handled. I say romantic comedy because the film ends like one but it could have equally ended as tragedy. He and She are both missing something and find it in each other only to discover that love does not always conquer all. One could blow one's brains out. But then one can always hightail it to Cuba instead.This is a very artful piece of filmmaking with some very clever camerawork and adroit use of music but we still have a very ordinary story. Joan Allen as she does manage to transcend the material and make us care about her character which is quite an achievement as the character is a beautiful middleclass IrishAmerican ice princess scientist stuck in a dead marriage whose only real passion is in what's at the other end of her microscope. It's interesting how she manages to appear so radiant 10 years younger in fact after her first roll in the hay with He.He the FrenchArmenian actor Simon Abkarian comes across to start with as a bit of a clich the handsome charming feckless foreigner. He is not helped by the aforesaid iambic pentameter which was not designed for foreigners speaking English. He has to utter one of the most insinceresounding pickup lines I have ever heard If I was your husband I would be so jealous of your beauty I would not leave your side. As we see more of him a serious side emerges an educated Muslim who sees a lot wrong with the West and not much with his own society despite its inability to live in peace. This he blames on the West. However the dialectic is sidelined by the plot line which as suggested above winds up on a Cuban beach.The novel Orlando by Virginia Woolf was a pretty weird property and Sally Potter produced a weird and wonderful movie from it. Her Tango Lesson was semiautobiographical well produced and absorbing. This movie is ambitious  let's see if we can make a romantic comedy about the clash of civilizations and the meaning of life and although visually fascinating it not surprisingly doesn't quite make it. It has its moments though  Maid Shirley Henderson's disquisitions on the nature of dirt to the camera Sam Neil's guitar miming to an Eric Clapton number and the restaurant orgasm to name a few. Sally Potter still has the ability to find a different angle on existence.".

Potter claimed that she would be thrilled if even one line of hers was as good as the Bard's. I believe much of her work is on par with his. The text is both witty and intelligent and addresses a plethora of modern day issues of conscience. The iambic pentameter flows very naturally throughout the film and is never a distraction  only a credit to the abilities of the writer! As with any Shakspearean production the feelings and inner turmoil of the main characters are central. The cinematography is excellent. The film is simply beautiful to watch and behold.

I like Potter's unique style however.I recommend this film for almost anyone even though it is challenging and some may not appreciate it. Hey it's all personal or is it? Note R. Ebert's review reflects Potter's intent most closely I believe.";

However it took me over a half hour to realize that the whole film was one epic poem  before then all I thought was This dialogue is horrible! People don't actually speak like this! But that's the point. Poetry is not meant to imitate average speech. That's why it's poetry.Joan Allen plays a lonely wife whose name is never mentioned trapped in a loveless marriage who has a fiercely passionate affair with a Muslim man from Lebanon. Because she was born in Northern Ireland but raised however in America she thinks she understands her lover's pain and suffering as an Arab man living in London. These two lovers fight about race class religion politics stereotypes and identity and with the recent bombings on the London Underground this film is unsettlingly too relevant. Yes is a superb love poem that speaks volumes about what we as a society are afraid to mention in our post911 world. But unfortunately sitting through this film feels more like homework than pleasure.".

The unique characteristic of the film is that the characters discuss the meaning of life and the complexities of relationships entirely in poetic verse. Pure rhymes slant rhymes internal rhymes  virtually every type of rhyme can be found in this film. The problem is that the novelty of the conceit wears off mighty quickly so that all we are ultimately left with are a bunch of pretentious whiney characters driving us crazy with their hightoned blathering. Allow me to propose a simple rule of thumb you know you'll be needing a sturdy pair of hip boots to wade through any movie play or novel in which two of the main characters are referred to simply as He and She.I hope I won't be dismissed as a Philistine for objecting to this film. As a matter of fact I am always open for anything even remotely novel and different in filmmaking and I actually quite like the idea of a movie that plays like an extended poem. The problem is that I just couldn't stand any of the people we were being asked to care about in this particular work. Joan Allen and Sam Neill play a middleaged English couple whose marriage has long ago become a hollow shell. They are clearly intended to be models of the enervated upper class  cynical bored filled with ennui and unable to communicate their innermost thoughts and feelings to one another  but we've seen these types of characters and marriages so many times before that Anthony and She feel more like caricatures than actual people I'm not quite sure why he gets a real name and she  I mean She  doesn't but no matter. And their speaking in verse only makes them all that more insufferable in their pseudoprofundity and monumental selfabsorption.Allen due to her extraordinary gifts as an actress is at least able to cut through the pretentiousness and create some feeling for her character but Neill and Simon Abkarian who looks distressingly like Borat as a chef from Beirut who becomes her lover he's the He to Allen's She are not quite so fortunate. Moreover to make matters worse in a movie in which language plays such a crucial part some of the accents are so thick that much of the dialogue is simply incomprehensible. That only compounds the frustration of watching the movie.There are some genuinely lyrical moments when the movie seems to be working and we can see what the filmmakers were trying to get at.

	schema:reviewBody "A rhymed couplet is a gloss a sheen. It is courtly borne of sophistry and what there is to be found in it is often in what is left unsaid rather than what you might find on the page. It is also used when used pithily to express concisely and without fear of mockery for preciousness the exact inward workings of one's soul. As Angelo in Measure for Measure hardly a man given to poetry says Ever before now When men were fond I smiled and wondered how. Sometimes Shakespeare uses them as a drum roll to let you know the soliloquy is over. Their use is varied and imprecise but it is rare to find a work of primarily dramatic intent that utilizes them over any length of time.This is perhaps appropriate because Sally Potter's Yes while undeniably interesting is varied and imprecise moreso than it thinks it is. Blame not Joan Allen even when she is on the verge of making us believe she is losing control and surrendering she must still cope with the regimented rhymes. Blame not Simon Abkarian though a bit goofy his facility borders on the sublime. Rather it is ironing and weaving on behalf of the directorwriter that has left catches and snags in a pattern that is intended to be tightly woven. The asides by the delightful Shirley Henderson are indeed delightful but their relationship to the plot is tangential at best. To say that the sketchily drawn Sam Neill's character is sketchily drawn is to belie the intricacies of a skillful sketch. I wasn't even aware except from reviews afterwards that his character was a politico.The most moving part of the movie the part that reduced me to tears was the Auntie's silent soliloquy about death. It certainly rivaled Shakespeare. And it had scratchall to do with the film.It is not surprising as many have noted that the confrontation scene is reported to be the first scene written in the film. It was an interesting scene and I liked how she called him a terrorist not as an unspecific slur but because of his behavior towards her personally. What was surprising and disappointing was that this scene was not the jumping off point into the deeper regions and darker places. That would have made for an interesting movie. By having it as the climax we go from 60 to 0 in 2 hours. The Deus Ex Auntie relieves Potter of having to write anything really difficult. God forbid we should have to go down further beneath the polished and rhyming surface into the ugly and worthwhile murk.The shot composition is excellent but I wish someone would tell Ms. Potter and Wong Kar Wai that the blurred slomo is a feature available on the cheapest camera and thus looks cheap cheap cheap.The Onion's review of this film really annoyed me because it stated as a matter of course Visually and narratively Yes is inarguably pretentious Oh is it now? I would say that it is only marginally successful but I think it is a sorry state of affairs when trying to do anything interesting earns you a de facto smear. If you come back with well it had a pretension in the same way that a hopeful was a pretender to a throne then your sense of meaning stops in the era of rhymed couplets. They could have just said that at least she tried to do something different and not been such snide sots.So at least she tried to do something different but instead of just getting our feet wet next time she should try throwing us without warning off a high high cliff so high we never know when we will ever hit the water or how deep and dark it might be when we get there. Ms. Potter is the one that really needs to lose control. And Yes the laughing on the beach ending wasn't really earned. This is most worth seeing for the two main performances although I might say that Mr. Abkarian's native confidence was occasionally out of place in his interpretation the character was always so sure of himself sometimes even more than his dialogue indicated.".

Gorky had lived an incredibly hard life he was a survivor of the Armenian genocide. His mother was not. She starved to death. Simon Abkarian's performance as Gorky was supernatural. He channeled Gorky. His scenes felt as if conveyed from a miracle camera dispatched across restrictions of time and space to Gorky's studio. The power and impact of Abkarian's performance was all the more amazing because iirc he never spoke. I resolved to see Abkarian in any other movies I could find. I was eager to see Yes. Alas Yes just doesn't work. The iambic pentameter and rhyming doesn't sound like Shakespeare when it sounds like any other literature it sounds like Dr. Seuss. Sometimes it just sounds like an incomprehensible series of syllables that the listener expects are condemning the West and encouraging us all to just get along. In addition to the stilted and unnatural dialogue the film includes many Dutch angles and characters address the camera. In short this film really doesn't want you to experience any willing suspension of disbelief. It wants you to sit spine straight on needles and pins aware at every moment that you are having an important experimental cultural experience and that Sally Potter is behind that camera.The two main characters  never named  never take on any life. This is remarkable given the fine talents Sally Potter has lured into this science experiment. Joan Allen is always sincere and lovable. Abkarian comes off less well perhaps because he is given the goofier role. Given how utterly stereotypical and lifeless the main characters are it's hard to know how seriously Potter wants them to be taken. Joan Allen plays a beautiful icy blonde super wealthy woman who lives a loveless marriage in a monochrome apartment. Abkarian is a passionate Ethnic Other dark hairy a doctor in my own country a waiter in yours and always ready for luuuuv. He dances and recites poetry. At least Potter doesn't have him say Come with me to the Casbah or sing Sheikh of Araby. The film can't tell the small story of two people who may or may not be in love it doesn't get anywhere near saying anything deep or new or heartfelt or important or even vaguely true about the bigger issues it wants to address terrorism EastWest relations RichPoor relations or stem cell research.".

If you've got this far looking for info on the film you know what it's about so I'm not going to do a summary. But I will tell you that the rhyming couplets are a distraction from the story. I found that the rhyming couplets did nothing to complement the story only convolute it. They didn't seem to serve a purpose. Add to that way too much time spend just watching people sit and stare into space as music plays a seemingly endless monologue from a dying character I know and care nothing about which also describes every character in this movie oddly enough and a story that I simply couldn't give a rat's ass about and you've got an hour and half of a painful movie to sit through. The movie feels much longer than it is and probably should have been a short film. The gimmick of verse wears off quickly and a lot of time could have been cut out.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw it at the Toronto Film Festival but I had not seen any of Sally Potter's previous films prior to this and mainly saw it because of Joan Allen. Yes is a film with Joan Allen and Sam Neill and directed by Sally Potter. It is about a woman who is in a loveless marriage who has an affair with a Lebanese chef who was a surgeon in Beirut. Shirley Henderson plays the cleaner who acts as narrator and sort of Greek chorus to give background and opinion. I didn't like this film but I think women in general will. The acting is good especially Joan Allen and Simon Abkarian apparently this was his first major role in English I could not tell he was that good but slow paced with some artistic shots shots through water or glass or some obstruction because in real life we don't always have the perfect angle and things are not always clear. Most of the dialogue was in iambic pentameter with rhyming couplets. If you've seen Sally Potter's other work and liked it then I think you'll like this. It is definitely different and Joan Allen was gorgeous but more for the art house crowd who appreciate a Dutch angle or the lens obstacles or the fact the film speed was off. There was deliberate slowing or disjointing of the frame speed in several scenes with her and her lover. As if the film was being shown at 22 or 26 frames per second or time was passing differently which could have been a case of trying to catch the human perspective where time sometimes seems sped up so an hour goes by in a blink of an eye or a moment can seem to last forever. While most of the audience loved it I think the average guy would be bored by this film. Having said that there are several layers to this film and may improve with additional viewings".

	schema:headline " Poetic film by Potter is both a hit and a miss";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those efforts that can easily divide audiences right down the middle and unless your familiar with the director and into independent films in general this can be a challenging viewing experience. Story is set in London where we see a completely bored woman Joan Allen known only as She in a miserable marriage to an English politician Sam Neill and one night while at a dinner party she catches the eye of a restaurant cook. He Simon Abkarian is Lebanese and instantly starts to flirt with She and it doesn't take long before both of them are head on into an affair but the one thing that seems to stand in their way isn't her marriage but the difference in nationalities.SPOILER ALERT While at work He gets into a heated argument with a coworker and is fired and decides to go back to the Middle East while She just can't go through the charades of her marriage anymore. After her Aunt dies She decides to pack her bags and leave her husband and daughter and head to Cuba! with the hope of finding herself and figuring out her place in a complicated world.After the critical success of Orlando director Sally Potter's follow up efforts have been a mixed bag but I think this film shows both her best and worst in terms of her talent. Potter's approach is consistently artistic definitely not commercial and here her script is written in an iambic pentameter style with the actors speaking in couplets which I personally found interesting but for me the problems are with the film as a whole. The love affair seems to be used as a metaphor for current events and this grows a bit tiresome after awhile especially with the scenes involving the multi racial coworkers of He. To Potter's credit she does create an atmosphere that is definitely dreamlike and some of the scenes with Allen and Abkarian exude an undeniable eroticism especially the scene in the restaurant and it's too bad there weren't more of them. Some have described Potter's script as Shakespearian but the only scene that seems to fit that description is when She's aunt dies in the hospital and we hear her soliloquy during her death but other than that I look at this script as being poetic. What doesn't work for me is most of the last 30 minutes of the film where Allen goes to Cuba to get away and unless there is some hidden message somewhere with Potter...there probably is I can't figure out why she decides on Cuba. If anyone knows for sure please explain why Allen goes to Cuba instead of all the other parts of the world that would be easier to get to. Potter also has low paid laborers janitors maids etc... looking directly into the camera as if they are the only ones who know what's going on and I found the reasoning for this a bit vague. While I'm not recommending this I still found it to be an interesting attempt at making a film in a poetic form and to her credit Potter has consistently challenged audiences with her artistic approach to projects but I still think that her best is yet to be seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "Potter's idiosyncratic exploration of conflict is almost a diamond bashed into a cheap ring. The film's title is a clever intellectual device an affirmation of the positive explained in the ending by the narratorphilosopher cleaning lady and in a conversation about numbers midfilm. As an antiwar film post 911 and filmed during the early occupation of Iraq it is rather less coherent hinting at its theme obliquely through the love affair of an IrishAmerican woman and man from Beirut.The most immediately distinctive characteristic is that the whole film uses a dialogue of iambic pentameter. In this it is brilliantly successful. The lines come naturally and I felt myself transported as if hearing Shakespeare in his own era. It runs the gamut of eloquent flights of poetry unfurling like a woman's hair from a clasp to the foulmouthed language of a punkrocker kitchen assistant. It never once seems forced.The story follows a beautiful woman maybe in her forties played by Joan Allen and never named. She is a scientist lives a luxurious lifestyle but in a cold 'open' marriage to a politician played by Sam Neill. She strikes up a passionate affair with a waiterchef from the Middle East who charms her one night at an official function she must attend. But having played the wonderful and sincere Lothario he breaks off with her when he realises he is only valued for the image she has of him. He has to struggle to fit in living in a western country speaking English adopting 'her' culture. Yet she knows nothing of him his background. Not even a single word of his language.It is in the portrayal of different  and far from simplistic  gender stereotypes that Potter excels. All the characters are beautifully hewn and totally unalike each justifiable to him or herself. We don't gain much insight into politics but we do see interesting 'types' of women  and men. All portrayed with respect and highlighting our shallow understanding of anyone who might be of a different mental makeup to ourselves.The film's shortcomings can be viewed sympathetically. The religious rants are just that and lacking depth. But would we expect more of most people? Perhaps not. But as the cleaner is prone to comment on everything a few words of insight might not have been amiss. Or is it that Ms Potter knows as little about Christianity Islam and Lebanon as the characters she accuses? Some scenes would have benefited from jump cuts at the point where interest languishes. One might argue that they are consistent with the storyline of overattachment to a love affair or particular point of view. That did not stop me wanting the scene to move on instead of saying the same thing again in another impressive if redundant piece of verse.The sudden shifts of location  to Beirut and Cuba  are visually appealing even if Joan Allen had to be in reality shot in the Dominican Republic due to U.S. restrictions on its citizens working in Cuba. But they also have the feeling of a copout for mainstream audiences. Potter claimed that Endings are notoriously difficult and technical problems and time pressures added to the production worries. But this does not assuage the reality that the intended political comment is explored without being well thought out. And that the choice of ending seems to be more for appeasing audiences than adding to a consistent whole.Yes is a proud addition to Sally Potter's highly personal and curiously successful work. Though perhaps not the masterpiece she might have wanted.".

	schema:reviewBody "YES is a seriously beautiful film. I haven't seen a film this mesmerizingly beautiful in a very along time. Without even knowing anything about it I purchased the DVD for 4 and it's the best 4 I've ever spent. With so many crappy blockbusters and overrated Oscar bait films out there it's a shame a film this good is virtually unknown. What's really remarkable  fascinating about YES is that it's 100 original. I've never seen anything like it. How many movies today can claim to be that?I've seen a lot of Joan Allen's previous films and she's the best she's ever been in YES. Her performance is a true revelation and plainly shows that she's often miscast in most of her projects. Joan Allen really shines here. In fact the whole cast shines including Sam Neil. The sparing between Joan and Neal is almost electrifying in its simplicity and directness. The cinematography is vivid and lends itself perfectly with the tone of the film. But the thing that makes the movie is the writing. It's the best. Just listening to the dialogue is bliss. The whole Aunt at the hospital moment is simply remarkable. I get goosebumps whenever I watch and listen to that scene. It's almost unreal how beautiful it is. One of the greatest moments in cinema if you ask me.As for those who say the rhyming dialogue is distracting I watched this movie with other people and they didn't even noticed it until I told them about it.I highly recommend YES. It's true hidden gem that needs to be discovered by as many people as possible.".

There is no jumping about emptying whole magazines and more! into people shooting from the hip at targets 200 metres away and hitting them with the first shot while snipers on the opposite side couldn't hit the Titanic from 2 metres away.So to sum up I'd give the plot characters and acting 710 but the action sequences I'd wholeheartdly give 1210!

	schema:reviewBody "THE FINAL OPTION like RED DAWN and THE SOLDIER was a product of that longago era called The Cold War.  A lot of people today seem to forget that there really were groups like the movie's The People's Lobby and the Nuclear Disarmament movement was going hot and heavy.  And it's true that the Soviet Union through the KGB and the other East Bloc intelligence agencies funded these groups and terrorist outfits like the BaaderMeinhof and the Red Brigades.  So there's a background to this story.  And really it's not too bad.  The acting is pretty decent especially Edward Woodward who would go on to do BREAKER MORANT and TV's THE EQUALIZER.  However I think that they could have infiltrated Skellen into the bad guys without beating the snot out of those two unsuspecting exchange officers especially the rather wimpy looking US Ranger Captain.  But what really makes the film is the climactic assault on and clearing of the US Ambassador's residence.  Of course this is based upon the assault on the Iranian Embassy in 1980.  Still it looks great and also seems very realistic.  For example no SAS troopers are killed by the terrorists but one is injured going through a flaming window.  And unlike your average American hero or member of THE ATEAM you see Skellen reload his empty MAC10.  As for any naysayers who wonder why the SAS guys don't get shot it's a fact that when an entry team does its job right and the opposition is basically untrained the advantage always goes to the side with the training and the surprise. I'd like to see a new SAS movie if it's made by the same team.  These British film makers do a better job than our own American ones because they go for realistic plausible action and plots rather than the overblown hyper unrealistic stories that Hollywood loves to make.  Mind you I love movies like DIE HARD LETHAL WEAPON and such but it's refreshing to see something that looks like a training film done right.".

	onyx:emotionText "THE FINAL OPTION like RED DAWN and THE SOLDIER was a product of that longago era called The Cold War.  A lot of people today seem to forget that there really were groups like the movie's The People's Lobby and the Nuclear Disarmament movement was going hot and heavy.  And it's true that the Soviet Union through the KGB and the other East Bloc intelligence agencies funded these groups and terrorist outfits like the BaaderMeinhof and the Red Brigades.  So there's a background to this story.  And really it's not too bad.  The acting is pretty decent especially Edward Woodward who would go on to do BREAKER MORANT and TV's THE EQUALIZER.

Of course it was made at the beginning of the Special Air Service Regiment superstardom mania that took hold in Britain after the successful Operation Nimrod at the Iranian Embassy in London. It can be dated and cheesy at times and certainly the viewer has to wait quite a long time for the ultimate payoff. But when that payoff comes it's well worth the time you spent watching Captain Skellen Lewis Collins infiltrate the CNDesque terrorist movement.Who Dares Wins unlike say The Delta Force avoids Ramboesque action and does try to be faithful to how the SAS conducts operations or shall I say how the public PERCEIVE they conduct operations. Obviously the script took much inspiration from the Princes Gate situation.It is a side plot however that is perhaps the best CT sequence ever caught on film SPOILER warning ahead!. After Skellen's wife is taken hostage by two members of the terrorist group undercover SAS members take up station in the nextdoor house. There they carefully drill and insert a camera to monitor the situation. Finally when the time comes they use a frame charge to blast the wall between the two walls. The power is turned off in the neighboring house and two SAS troopers dispatch the terrorists using Browning 9mm handguns with flashlights. The scene which starts with a trooper holding up his silver Browning and releasing the slide forward so the camera gets a good view is classic.If I had any quibbles with the movie it was in its depiction of the German GSG9 and American Army Ranger character. These two arrive at the Regiment's base in Hereford on exchange training duty. First of all the United States would not send a Ranger for CT training. To be fair the scriptwriters probably did not know of the existence of Delta Force which had just come to public attention around that time. Of course both officers bumble through their initial task. It's hard to believe that West Germany's elite GSG9 would send such a dufus on a exchange assignment.I also used to think it was rather unrealistic that the American Ambassador's residence is seized yet during the entire crisis the British authorities do not seem to consult the American government nor is Delta Force or in deference to the scriptwriters Rangers brought in. However as I got older and learned the subject more host nations are responsible for the security of diplomats. Thus the British authorities would be first on the scene and it would be their task to implement an Immediate Action plan that would be used at as a final option until a more refined plan could be instituted. So in that context perhaps the Americans never had time to deploy.Splitting hairs I know...still a great film.".

What I love about action films up to 1990 or so is that the good guys are really the good guys and the bad guys are really the bad guys there's no ambiguity here. The Final Option is a movie that works on many levels culminating with the hero being taken hostage by The People's Lobby taking the hero's wife hostage you have two dramas occurring at once. Judy Davis is awesome as the lead terroristshe's deep into her character acts her heart out. And that guy playing the hero Skellon is really tough and stoic and really James Bond all the way and really in shape too his wife is really cute. And then we have Helga played by Countess Dracula and Carmilla herself INGRID PITT a mean very mean German who wants to literally shoot the baby!!!! There's a good catch about where the terrorists are actually getting their money from making us think about the power seekers and who the power seekers really are and how the power seekers are really pulling the strings. Roy Budd's music is truly great for a true action film with a deeper meaning . . . an awful lot of blood squibs in mouths bleeding lips and so forth. See this movie!!!!".

Interesting to read that Lewis Collins could have been admitted to SAS save for his celebrity.".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember seeing this movie when it first came out. OK let's be honest here no one deserved any acting awards but for pure entertainment value it's terrific. As for the cast reviews well let's leave Lewis Collins until last. Judy Davies had not been that long known in the industry and as as we all know has gone gone on to do real quality work. Edward Woodward gave a standard performance as the police commissioner and Tony Doyle deceased was perfect as the tough SAS colonel. Richard Widmark and Robert Webber were both at the tail end of their careers and probably only did the movie for the pay but still gave satisfying performances. As for Lewis Collins well here is an actor who never forged the career that I hoped he would. I had the extreme privilege of meeting Lewis in Perth Western Australia in 1984 when he was performing Deathtrap. Here we really got to see Lewis shine on the stage. Lewis is a what you see is what you get type of person. His image off screen is the same as on he is an action man. Lewis wasn't really acting in who dares wins he was being himself and as the immortal Spencer Tracy said to a young Burt Reynolds when Reynolds asked him for advise on acting Mr Tracy's response was just don't let anyone catch you doing it acting that is. So there's the review for Lewis's performance he wasn't acting but being himself which is the greatest compliment you can pay an actor. He would have made an immortal James Bond and bettered them all i believe but it wasn't to be. His legacy was to give us Bodie who was up there with Bond but at least we got him on a weekly basis.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Europe it's known as Who Dares Wins in America it's known as The Final Option but under any title this ludicrous SAS action flick asks the audience to put their disbelief to one side for around two hours. I find it incredibly hard to comprehend how Lewis Collins the hero here was almost chosen as Roger Moore's successor in the Bond films.... this guy is so expressionless he'd struggle to get a job in a waxwork museum as a waxwork!!! Luckily Judy Davis is on hand to partially redeem the affair with a meaty performance as a hardline lady terrorist and there's a climactic ten minute action sequence that is quite competently orchestrated by director Ian Sharp. Let it be added that it's a very very very long wait for these closing excitements to come around and I can't honestly say that a near two hour wait for a bit of decent action was worth the effort.SAS hard man Peter Skellen Lewis Collins goes undercover among a group of peace protesters who would like to see the end of nuclear weapons stockpiling. He meets their leader Frankie Judy Davis a strongtalking and opinionated woman who might just be capable of taking extraordinary measures to achieve her goals. Frankie's dedicated bunch violently lay siege to the American Embassy in London demanding that a nuclear missile be fired at a naval base in Scotland she believes that when the world witnesses a nuclear blast for real everyone will be so appalled that they will join her campaign for disarmament. Unfortunately for Frankie she makes the mistake of taking Skellen on her little embassy raid and he plans to thwart their plan from inside with a little welltimed outside help from his SAS comrades.The film is inspired  quite obviously  by the awesome SAS assault on the Iranian Embassy in 1981. Someone who saw that event on the news apparently thought it would be good to devise a film along similar lines. Unfortunately the film is rather banal with too much stupid dialogue and a heck of a lot of embarrassingly bad scenes the archbishop's debate which descends into a riot anyone? Frankie's idea to bring about peace by instigating a nuclear blast is ridiculous anyway so she becomes a laughable figure just when the audience is on the verge of viewing her as an interesting villain. Who Dares Wins tries to be a celebration of the military legend that is the SAS but at the same time it dips into clumsy action clichs and illthoughtout plotting. The result is a wellintentioned but wholly ineffective slice of Boy's Own absurdity.".

Also the terrorists see Skellen meeting up with his contact and then eliminate the contact so that should make them more suspicious. Supposedly Frankie takes Skellen on board because they develop a relationship in the space of five minutes of cheesy chatup lines. It can only be explained by the comment towards the end that they are amateurs.The other ridiculous aspect is the terrorists demand that the British government drop a nuclear bomb on a submarine base. Firstly they are against nuclear bombs so this hardly seems something they would demand. Secondly they should realise that the Government wouldn't do it in a million years...From the SAS point of view the plot seems believable. The rescue scenes at the end are gripping and will leave you in a chill the first time you see them particularly the Mews scenes.It's worth watching anyway".

I suddenly realised I was talking to Lewis Collins. For me that was quite a sad moment as I got the feeling he knew where it was and just wanted to be recognised. Collins was a HUGE TV star from 1978 to 1980 and like ALL British kids at the time I wanted to be either Bodie or Doyle from The Professionals. I saw Who Dares Wins at the cinema and was enthralled by it. I really felt it would take lewis Collins to Hollywood and beyond but it wasn't to be and that's a shame. He would have made a perfect James Bond. Anyway Who Dares Wins. It is a first class action movie and a fine tribute to our Special Air Service soldiers. The dialogue is sometimes wobbly and melodramatic but the exchanges between Richard Widmark and Judy Davis as many others have said are fantastic and the action sequences vie with ANYTHING you'll see from Hollywood. The photography direction and music are excellent too. As for the plot. The early 1980s WERE a very paranoid time. I well remember how nervous I often felt at the crazy pronouncements of Thatcher  Raegan who both seemed to be on a religious crusade against Communism and both seemed to believe a nuclear war was winnable. If Gorbechov hadn't come along and the USSR had had an equally hardline ideolgoue in The kremlin I'm not sure any of us would be here today so the plot of Who Dares Wins isn't nearly as unrealistic as it might appear in 2005. It's a fine movie and it shows we Brits can still compete with Hollywood. By the way I have an American friend who said he never realised Judy Davis was Australian so her accent must've been spot on. 9 out of 10.".

It was certainly made to cash in on the famous Iranian Embassy siege a mere year before they released this which was televised live in Britain as the SAS stormed the building. Who Dares Wins has certainly dated as all 80's action films have but it has great action scenes and stunt work. Collins is good in this and perhaps would have made a good 007 I don't know if he ever tested for the role but his Bond would have been closer to Connery than any since. The story is very silly and some scenes like the rock concert are cringe worthy but the action makes up for it with a superb siege at the end.".

Who Dares Wins has certainly dated as all 80's action films have but it has great action scenes and stunt work. Collins is good in this and perhaps would have made a good 007 I don't know if he ever tested for the role but his Bond would have been closer to Connery than any since. The story is very silly and some scenes like the rock concert are cringe worthy but the action makes up for it with a superb siege at the end.";

Suddenly Wesley has become very desirable despite the fleshy antenna that grows out of his head during excitement. His newfound success threatens to alienate the girl he really cares about Leeanne and Xenobia's motives may have something to do with the fact that she is not of this earth.";

This leaves the teen with a phallic antenna on top of his head that drives women crazy leading to many odd and often uninvited sexual encounters with everyone from the cheerleader squad to the school faculty.In this millennium we have films like Not Another Teen movie and the directtovideo American Pie Band Camp. In the 80s and 90s teenagers in the throes of puberty had movies like this which aired on USA's Up All Night several times during the late 80searly 90s under the title I Was a Teenage Sex Project. I gave this movie a 4 out of 10 for its place in filmdom but for movies of its genre it deserves a 7 at the very least. I'd say it was one of the last great TA movies to make it to the masses more for Judy Landers than anything and I put it right up there with Zapped Once Bitten and a few others. After Up All Night went off the air and Ronda Shear and Gilbert Gottfried had to get real jobs the line between simple eye candy and softcore porn became so blurred that movies like this are only seen on premium cable after midnight and TA movies these days no longer try to be subtle with their humor. This film was produced just as the quality of this genre began to die of asphyxia and very few made after it are worth seeing and those of us who remember seeing Dr. Alien when it first came out are just a bit old to be watching 19yearolds bounce around in the nude. Simply put this was one of those movies that didn't need too much editing to be enjoyed for a good tease on basic cable but of course you'd have to hit a local video store to see all the bare skin That's why these movies were made folks so don't shoot the messenger. If you were a teenage boy in late 80s or even a bit younger you might find this good for a nostalgic cheesy laugh coupled with an anatomy lesson but if you're a teenage boy now with the same afflictions then something more recent is probably what you're after by this time most of the girls are old enough to be your mother anyway.".

Billy Jayne whom you may have seen in Bloody Birthday Cujo Just One of the Guys and 'Parker Lewis Can't Lose' stars as Wesley a straight arrow wimpy college student who agrees to help out with a scientific project for extra credit in his biology class. Trouble is his new teacher Ms. Xenobia veteran TV bimbo Judy Landers isn't playing it totally straight with him and the vitamin that she tests on him transforms him into an irresistible stud complete with a chittering worm that pops out of his head.Very amiable from beginning to end Dr. Alien may not have its viewers necessarily laughing out loud but it may have them smiling at the least. It's got amusing makeup effects by Greg Cannom and his team and a nonstop upbeat pop  rock soundtrack. It's also quite sexy and voyeurs will love the generous servings of breast shots that director Dave DeCoteau provides. In addition to the perky Ms. Landers the lovely ladies of the movie include Olivia Barash Repo Man Ginger Lynn Linnea Quigley and Laura Albert as the rocker chicks Michelle Bauer and Karen Russell as coeds and Elizabeth Kaitan as a waitress. The solid schlock movie supporting cast features such people as Stuart Fratkin Teen Wolf Too as the obligatory obnoxious best friend Raymond O'Connor Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myers as Xenobias' nerdy associate Arlene Golonka The InLaws as Wesley's mom Jaynes' reallife brother Bobby Tremors as his sibling and Edy Williams Chained Heat as a gym teacher. Troy Donahue gets prominent billing but actually isn't in the movie for very long.If you're looking for some dumb trashy fun Dr. Alien is recommended. Hell one can't knock any lowbrow comedy that actually works a message about selfesteem into its mix. It's fairly fast paced stuff with a reasonably short running time and enough gags to make it palatable.Six out of 10.".

This kind of film has a 2.4 on IMDb's rating scale for a reason. Many I'm sure have the wittiest zingers aimed right at this film but I couldn't help it. I just let myself go to it because the premise taps into something I think is plain obvious..a lot of us have that fantasy where wanton college chicks against their better judgment thanks to an alien sex organ which alters their perspective on decency are motivated towards a male no matter who he is. You could be the dorkiest brainiac or have sores and the worst case of acne known to man and still have women ready to hump you thanks to an experimental alien formula which provides you with a unique gift. Rounding out the cast is Wesley's loveinterest LeeanneOlivia Barashwho is a rather softspoken gentle gal not demanding him to change into some hunk really falling in love with who he really was..is. Many are familiar with RobertJacobyJayne from Tremors as the smart aleck kid everyone wanted to see eaten pretty much the same kind of brat as Wes' brother in this film. Jim Hackett and Arlene Golonka are delightfully lame as Wes' square parents who unabashedly support their son through his crisis no matter how his behavior has changed. Stuart Fratkin is Wes' horny buddy Marvin always spending his time trying to get his pal to loosen up around girls really awestruck at his new ability to get laid. Kenneth J Halldirector of The Halfway House and Linnea Quigley's Horror Workoutwrote the screenplay and Linnea Quigley has a minor role as a male fantasy of Wes' who stars in a rock chick trioalong with Ginger Lynn Allen  Laura Albertwho are often surrounding our hero ready for action. And yep all three show their breasts often. And Michelle Bauer has a cameo as one of those workout college coeds who gets all hot and bothered when Wes is accidentally thrown into the girl's locker room..even the teacher wants a piece of the action!by Marvin. Greg Cannom would provide the makeup team and the alien unveils itself to carry the appearance of a massive purple dome with bug eyes.

If as 'punk' music had never happened and these college kids were stuck in some strange time warp where groups like Van Halen or people like Meatloaf were on the cutting edge of radical music. I wonder if any of the people involved in making this had ever actually met any High School teenagers? The lead character goes from been a geek overnight into a 'Fonzie' type who ends up fronting a rock band who are so hardcore that he gels his hair up takes his shirt off and bares his chest. Oh that rock  roll madness!Think it says a lot about the attitude of this film when the parents meet the other members of the band for dinner. They have long hair and tattoos and their drummer is a black man! Is that the living end or what?? Actually I could never believe a real black guy would ever get involved with these sad bunch of losers and their crappy music.Offensive on all fronts to women and everybody really. I can't really bring myself to go into the plot 'young geek becomes a babe magnet but finds true love and his real calling in music.'

This by far and sadly so is her best movie and she does look hot. There was lots of nudity in this movie the actresses must of known they were going to have to take their shirts off in this one. But the smart one was Judy in this movie she cashed her check without taking her shirt off. Judy watching was easy in the 80's also very enjoyable but this movie takes the cake it also was one of her last jobs in the film industry. She married a Professional Baseball Pitcher who just happened to be pitching for the dodgers at the time they met and they settled down to make a family. This movie is a knockoff of 50's and 60's sci fi movies with nudity added in so it feels just like a cheesy teen flick from the 80's. I haven't seen this movie since the early 90's and that one was edited so I didn't see the nudity. But if your younger and you want to see the queen of the 80's this is a must see. I gave it a 7 because it's watchable and kind of funny watching Judy turn into an alien towards the end of the movie. Other than that I doubt I could even sit through this again 15 years later but then again maybe I could.".

There's a whole handfull of wires in this one but you never really get the chance to see them because of all the incredable action scenes that fill this watching a comic book on the screeen fiasco of gravity defiance. Since it's obviously based on some Chinese mythology or legend which I failed to really comprehend let me just describe it in terms that we can all understand... It's CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON meets THE MATRIX!".

After several awful American action adventure films Ballistic Daredevil Cradle of Life Zhu Warriors struck me as brilliantly original filmmaking. The story is complete nonsense but I found the film's sincerity good heartedness and complete lack of irony refreshing and the film looks spectacular. Sure the special effects are not technically as flawless as those produced by Hollywood but the filmmakers wisely are more interested in color composition and movement than realism and so many of the shots are breathtaking. In one shot two of the superhuman characters stand on craggy spires of rock a huge moon rising before them the image perfectly balanced by the three elements. In another a princesswarrior spires through the heavens behind her glowing sword like a heatseeking missile. And the colors explode from shot to shot used to express emotion rather than to represent reality.The characters have the same simplicity and directness of comic book characters offering no great depth in themselves but referring to archtypes that resonate more deeply. Physically several of the actors are astonishingly beautiful. They play their roles straight up without irony or guile and so are believable.Most strange of all despite the clumsiness of plot and thin characterizations I found myself very near tears at the end moved by the beautiful simplicity of the actors and the wildly original goodhearted vision of the director.".

Thank that to Tsui Hark's extensive use of CGI effects. He's able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds a land where beings fly freely and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades split swords and the ultra cool Moon Orb.While there are many characters in this one the focus is mainly on King Sky and Enigma.  The romance aspect is there although the movie seems much darker than its predecessor.  Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen makes this movie worth watching.  In the beginning I like how she resembles the Countess from Zu Warriors and she does well playing Enigma as she deals with facing her past life.  Oh by the way did I mention that Cecilia's very appealing to the eye??In truth Zu Warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983.  Tsui Hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema.".

This movie is wonderously crafted through the use of high tech cgi which allows fans of the fantasy genre to see their visions come to life.  The acting is perfect for this type of movie if you were an immortal with supernatural powers I would think you'd keep more to yourself.Unlike the comments of many the plot is actually quite EASY to follow while maintaining a quick pace that adds a sense of urgency.  Anyone that cannot keep track of the different characters simply must not be paying attention since or are used to such levels of sophistication as the titanic.  The plot is engaging and layered with themes so epic that they will leave you gasping for air.  Legend of Zu is on a level of greatness so high that perhaps many people are put off by its grandeur.  Allow yourself to be completely engulfed within its fantastical vision and you will grow to love this movie.".

While short on real kung fu the action sequences are fantastic fun and constantly confounding your expectations.  Aside from generally knowing that Good will overcome Evil the movie is impossible to predict.The movie is available on DVD now so pick it up.

This movie has incredible special effects a true epic storyline complex great character interaction and mindblowing battles  they have to be seen to be believed! The only complaint I have is the subtitles on the HK DVD version I got some lines were not translated  ???.I just don't understand when I read  hear from various sources it has a confusing plot.... I couldn't follow the story.... or Characters came from nowhere.... From the very 1st time I watched this movie I understood it followed it knew why characters were there and I absolutely loved it! I've watched it about 8 times already and each time it is pure enjoyment. Oh and this is not just my opinion because I've shown this movie to many fellow Americans people who have never seen an HK film before who feel the same way. Not one of them failed to follow the storyline and each person declared their love for this movie. Oh man why can't we have stuff like this coming out of Hollywood? At least Lord of the Rings had a nice marriage of special effects character development and storyline.This is not coming from a Asian film lover newbie either. I own an extensive library of Asian films and I must say that this movie is one of my greatest DVDs. When you watch it you will be blown away by the amazing special effects and epic feel of this movie. You will be drawn into this fantasy world and you won't want to leave! I've seen both the 1983 version and the 2001 both done by Tsui Hark and the 2001 is far better in comparison IMO.Besides the subtitles I have one additional complaint about this movie I didn't want it to end.... I'm begging you Mr. Hark  can we please have a sequel?".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit that Tsui Hark is one of a kind you can't top a person with a strong style of movie presence.  A Chinese fantasy picture may not be easy to present to an audience the director attempted to bring back the classic fantasy tales of Zu Mountain and this is what he displayed.The new Legend of Zu has truly improved from the one in 1983.  From this new millenium update we could see Tsui Hark's vision of the Zu mountains. Spectacular visual designs amazing actionfantasy epic made beautifully well.  Kept me glued through the entire picture.  Great cast with just fine acting.  It's truly a fun movie to watch but is it too weird?Now the down side is people will definitely get confused with it's broad story line shortened down into a 95 minute movie. Plot may not have much relation among characters but by rewatching the movie you'll have a better sense of understanding the characters itself.  Some can complain there isn't too much physical combat besides with characters that have supernatural powers to defeat foes spirits fighting by handtohand wouldn't really make sense at all.  I appreciated this nice stylish picture.  It may have a thin story but hey look at Tsui Hark's Time  Tide we got confused by the plot as well but it was truly something stylish and awesome.  Tsui Hark always attracts something different into H.K. Cinema.  American audiences may have some difficulty to understand while watching this movie cause this ain't no Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon this is a whole new genre.  Although it may not be a masterpiece but it's special effects is truly better than Storm Riders.  This is really worth checking out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Legend of ZuI remember well Tsui Hark's original Zu Warriors made 18 years earlier. Over one Christmas on a rare week when Channel 4 in the UK showed a week of Hong Kong movies Zu Warriors was so gripping for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable that it's been etched into the memory of the now grown up sprog...In fact I think the original Zu Warriors is one of the earliest films I saw as a kid that I can clearly recall the story line and action scenes from. And the memories of seeing Yuen Biao Sammo Hung and others in their classic prime.So when I saw this remake of Zu Warriors there was a feeling of apprehension. Could it beat the dreamy childhood memories I had of the original or will it follow the road of other remakes and die a death more horrible than the baddies and their broken necks you find in those kung fu movies?Well the answer is I can't say. But that was because this isn't really a remake. The stories and styles are almost completely different.The Legend of Zu tells of the story of King Sky a lone warrior whose master Dawn declares her love for him but her life is taken from her by a monster called Insomnia. Two hundred years later Insomnia returns Dawn is reincarnated as Enigma and Insomnia has returned to destroy Zu. Meanwhile White Eyebrows and Red try with the help of King Sky to stop Insomnia.The plot isn't one full of twists and turns but had enough detail in it to keep me interested. But I can see this film as one you either love or you hate. The film is very much about the special effects with the majority of it involving several computer generated environments much like The Storm Riders and A Man Called Hero. But unlike the other two this film was one which didn't overdo the graphics and the whole thing was tasteful. Nothing appears rushed  unlike Hero. The backgrounds were complementary to the acting and not at all overpowering the scenes.The story also involves plenty of characters and the intermingling of so many individuals does make the film intriguing. It was possibly on the verge of 'too many cooks' but generally each character had its part in the story. But some of the roles appear to be 'extended cameos' in my opinion and I somehow am left to slightly question the necessity of this.Ekin Cheng and Louis Koo play very central roles in the film but I couldn't say this film showed their best performances. Cecilia Cheung appears to at least have matured in her acting but it is still quite raw. Kelly Lin was the new revelation for me. Despite her very short role I have apologise and admit to ogling!Overall I have to say did enjoy this film as much as I enjoyed the 'original'. Given that both movies are made by the legendary Tsui Hark the two films together are part of a chronicle showing how film making in Hong Kong has changed over two decades. And one beauty of that is the fact that you can't really compare the two films at all as much as apples are apples and pears are pears.Ultimately both are thoroughly enjoyable films in their own right. And I'm going back to reminisce by watching the original again.Two to watch but not compare.".

The film stars a cornucopia of HK talents including Crouching Tiger's Zhang Ziyi as a young soldier Sammo Hung of Martial Law and 40 years of HK fight films and Akin Chang of The Storm Riders as the last remaining student from a mountain destroyed several hundred years ago. It is also written and directed by Tsui Hark HK's number one action producer and features fight choreography by Yuen Wo Ping of The Matrix and Crouching Tiger. The film is Chang's and his sad story of having no home and pining for the woman and teacher he once loved is the heart of the film. Like many Chinese period pieces it occassionally ventures into melodrama but the characters and story pull you along with grand help by visuals that rival any USmade film. In short it is an epic.

	schema:headline " The Legend of Zu hasn't aged well so this won't be for everyone!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Legend of Zu has been a favorite of mine for a long time. Mind you this was based on the two times I have watched it. Read what I originally wrote about it Zu Warriors of the Magic Mountain was and is an impressive classic! You never would have guessed it was made in 1983. Tsui Hark's use of special effects was very creative and inventive. He continued doing in most of his later productions. Even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre. Legend of Zu is connected to Zuwarriors from magic mountain! It is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one. The plot is a bit hard to follow. But to be honest it doesn't matter. It is all about the action and adventure! I always was wondering what Tsui Hark would do if he got his hands on CGI. Now we know he made this movie. Maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that I am not going to be critical about that. There is so much happening on the screen you simply won't believe. I think it is a big shame that this movie wasn't shown in theaters here in Holland. Because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas. This movie easily can beat big budget Hollywood productions like Superman Returns or X Men 3 putain merde never ever watch this atrocious film. It's a downright insult to film fans and comic book lovers. The only thing I do have to mention is the lack of humour. In most of Tsui Harks's movies he combines drama fantasy martial arts and humour. Somehow it is missing in this movie. Again I am not going to be picky about these small matters. Legend of Zu delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you will see. A true classic! When I got the chance to buy the Blu Ray DVD I did not hesitate a second and purchased it from www.dddhouse.com. This was based on sentiments alone. Now after having watched it I am almost completely shocked how badly it has aged. The once so impressive spectacle isn't that impressive anymore. Because of that I was able to focus on other elements a whole lot more and I have to admit that The Legend of Zu is not the classic I thought it was. However that does not mean it's a total fail. There are still some elements in the film that are incredibly creative and inventive visually. But the once gorgeous eye candy definitely has lost it's shine considerably. Could you fault a director for using a technology that is ever advancing? Well judging from the few scenes I watched on Youtube I can already tell the original Zu Warriors of the Magic Mountain holds up better than Tsui Hark's second film in the franchise. But I will get back to this once I have looked at the original more critically. If I have to guess it's because practical effects look better than CGI effects. That and that other elements in the original are stronger. It's like Tsui Hark got completely caught up into the application of special effects and spectacle too much and very hastily designed the story and characterization around it as an after thought. Naturally this should have been reversed. But this could imply that at least the action is memorable. Which brings me to my main gripe with The Legend of Zu. There are only a few fight scenes that offer the action goodness I crave in these kinds of films. If you remove all the razzle and dazzle there is very little left to enjoy. The saving grace easily is the cast since they all do their best to take the confusing mess seriously.So is this still worth watching? If you haven't before and love Wuxia and Hong Kong films then definitely. But if you are not a big fan then I can't recommend it since it's not an easy film to get into.For more honest reviews check www.chrichtonsworld.com".

	onyx:emotionText "The Legend of Zu has been a favorite of mine for a long time. Mind you this was based on the two times I have watched it. Read what I originally wrote about it Zu Warriors of the Magic Mountain was and is an impressive classic! You never would have guessed it was made in 1983. Tsui Hark's use of special effects was very creative and inventive. He continued doing in most of his later productions. Even now it can measure up to other movies in this genre. Legend of Zu is connected to Zuwarriors from magic mountain! It is not necessary to have seen this movie to understand the plot of this one. The plot is a bit hard to follow. But to be honest it doesn't matter. It is all about the action and adventure! I always was wondering what Tsui Hark would do if he got his hands on CGI. Now we know he made this movie. Maybe it sometimes is too much but the overall result is so beautiful that I am not going to be critical about that. There is so much happening on the screen you simply won't believe. I think it is a big shame that this movie wasn't shown in theaters here in Holland. Because this movie is screaming for screen time in cinemas. This movie easily can beat big budget Hollywood productions like Superman Returns or X Men 3 putain merde never ever watch this atrocious film. It's a downright insult to film fans and comic book lovers. The only thing I do have to mention is the lack of humour. In most of Tsui Harks's movies he combines drama fantasy martial arts and humour. Somehow it is missing in this movie. Again I am not going to be picky about these small matters. Legend of Zu delivers on the action front with the most beautiful special effects you will see. A true classic! When I got the chance to buy the Blu Ray DVD I did not hesitate a second and purchased it from www.dddhouse.com. This was based on sentiments alone. Now after having watched it I am almost completely shocked how badly it has aged. The once so impressive spectacle isn't that impressive anymore. Because of that I was able to focus on other elements a whole lot more and I have to admit that The Legend of Zu is not the classic I thought it was. However that does not mean it's a total fail.

There were a number of metaphors and hidden meanings that an average viewer might have overlooked. We all have a mountain of swords within us.

	schema:reviewBody "... at least for early sound. The title character in particular Thunderbolt played by George Bancroft is a rather complex gangster character for a dawn of sound movie. What do you say about a man who'd go to great lengths to kill a fellow he has never met just on general principle but who loves the stray dog that causes him to finally get pinched and put in the death house to the point that when the death house warden grants him a favor Thunderbolt asks for that same dog to stay in his cell as a pet? Fay Wray only 21 at the time plays Ritzy Thunderbolt's girl with a sense of worldweariness that is wise beyond her years. When the film opens she's being hassled by the police to give up Thunderbolt's hiding place in some really classic early sound police interrogation scenes. Ironically she really wants to be free of Thunderbolt who swears he'll never let her go especially if there's another guy involved and there is  bank teller Bob Morgan played by Richard Arlen.The first third of the film moves about quite a bit with some great jazz age settings but the last twothirds is primarily confined to the death house where Thunderbolt awaits his appointment with the chair. There's lots of atmosphere in this one with the death row quartet that keeps getting broken up as one fellow is executed and then restarted as another inmate enters. The death row warden is an interesting fellow with eccentricity and nervousness balanced by a humane streak to the point that he seems misplaced  he seems like he'd be happier managing the shoe department in some retail store.The end has a surprise twist to it that makes Thunderbolt rethink his rather complex plan of revenge just as he makes that last walk to the chair. I'm being intentionally vague here so I don't ruin it for you. Watch it for the surprising sophistication of this early sound piece for the kind of atmosphere you can always count on in a von Sternberg film and for that general touch of class that you find in the early Paramount talkies.".

However while ably flanked by his costars there he is practically the whole show this time around Fay Wray and Richard Arlen being no match for Evelyn Brent and Clive Brook and consequently the role earned Bancroft his sole Oscar nomination and the film's as well! Anyway the director's approach to Sound was not as experimental as may have been anticipated resorting to Death Row histrionics and even a number of songs to showcase the format! and the end result is hardly dazzling in this regard  though the dialogue is surprisingly clean i.e. audible for such an early example. Conversely the visual aspect of the film usually the director's main concern is greatly diluted here through the poor quality of the copy I watched which also sported forced German subtitles! Bancroft is once again a gangster as before his activity remains undisclosed throughout apart from lording it up in an almost exclusivelyblack nightclub! and his moll eventually leaves him for another younger and handsomer man. Here too the mobster is caught and imprisoned  in a wonderful scene where he shows compassion for a mutt subsequently proving inseparable thus preceding Raoul Walsh's HIGH SIERRA by 12 years! Yet he ingeniously has his associates frame the rival for a murder they committed the development of this particular plot strand is unfortunately rather muddled and the hero winds up in the cell opposite Bancroft's.

Again however Bancroft is softened and confesses his role in the young man's entrapment just hours before his execution is due I have to wonder here why he a firsttime felon is scheduled to die before the much soughtafter Thunderbolt!  yes the film's title is a reference to the character's nickname. In any case the moll's own admission that she had left her lover for the gangster rather than the other way around makes the latter realize as was the case in UNDERWORLD that he is in the way and gladly accepts his fate. Incidentally speaking of references to the director's earlier work Wray and Arlen are made to undergo a hasty marriage here  much like Bancroft himself and Betty Compson in THE DOCKS OF NEW YORK 1928!".

	schema:headline " Black humour does not save early talkie from Death Row";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an odd little film whose offbeat humour goes a considerable way  although not really quite far enough  to excuse dodgy dialogue perfunctory plotting and some very laborious line readings from the cast from the big names down to the bitpart players. Richard Arlen in particular gives a fine performance... in those scenes alone where he can rely on silentscreen acting technique and isn't required to deliver any spoken lines which unfortunately isn't very many of them! Fay Wray isn't terribly convincing here either in her role as hardasnails gangster's girl or as lovely and vulnerable sweetheart and the film as a whole seems to veer unevenly between spoof and taking itself seriously. As a result I found it hard to care very much about the fate of any of the characters in particular the romantic leads. George Bancroft pretty much carries the picture singlehanded as the eponymous gangster he was Oscarnominated for this role with some success but again he seems to be uncertain whether to play for straightout melodrama or hammy spoof and to be struggling with the transition to sound.The director's real interest appears to be in the Death Row scenes where much of the humour occurs there is a running gag where the other convicts comment on the action with closeharmony renditions of appropriate popular songs and much of the rest of the film is merely a setup to get to this point. The bank robbery sequence is particularly perfunctory and confusing frankly if the charge hadn't been spelt out subsequently in dialogue I wouldn't have had the faintest idea what Bob was actually condemned for. It is worth persevering with Thunderbolt beyond the opening sequences which are particularly laboured  the film does get a bit better later on  but this is nobody's lost masterpiece I'm afraid. To see Richard Arlen do better try Beggars of Life to see Fay Wray try The Most Dangerous Game to see George Bancroft try Underworld. To see a better early talkie try Rouben Mamoulian's Applause 1929.".

	schema:reviewBody "Von Sternberg's original 95minutes cut was never released. Instead Zukor and Lasky ordered the movie to be cut down to a more exhibitorfriendly length  which turned out to be 85 minutes. So if you're looking for smooth continuity you won't find it in this film which proceeds via a series of jumps until both the principals find themselves in the Death House. Needless to say the scissors were not taken to George Bancroft's scenes. In fact not a single frame was removed from these scenes which was good in a way because it meant that the really enjoyable Curtis MosbyTheresa Harris nightclub footage was also retained in full. However the movie is definitely off balance and even a little difficult to follow let alone swallow until we arrive at the Death House where the rhythm finally and unexpectedly settles down and even allows humor of all things! to be injected into the play. Nonetheless if a comedian like Tully Marshall seems a strange choice for a Death House warden Tully had played serious roles  and played them well  but here is definitely cast as the comic relief George is always on top of his material and so totally in control that he can even make the plot twists sound credible and his final scenes unexpectedly moving. He is helped out here by Richard Arlen an actor who started at the top giving incredibly gripping performances in such films as Wings Beggars of Life and The Virginian and then gradually working his way down to the PineThomas side of Poverty Row and finally the formula westerns of A.C. Lyles. As for Fay Wray I would use the adjective disappointing. Her nondescript portrayal would be more tolerable had she been more attractively dressed and presented. As it is one wonders why the charismatic Thunderbolt is so possessive of such an averagelooking girl who is also so totally lacking in personality. Opposites attract I guess!".

So it's not very surprising that this Josef von Sternberg movie comes off as a bit old fashioned. It's lack of incidental music makes it seem a bit too quiet...but that was true of all the sound films of the day. Likewise some of the acting is a bit stilted...and this was not at all unusual for 1929. So I try to cut this and other movies from 192730 a bit of slack.The title character Thunderbolt Jim Lang George Bancroft is one of the mostwanted men in the country. He's been responsible for many bank robberies and deaths and the police are desperately searching for him. But their only lead is his old girlfriend Ritzie IMDB incorrectly spells it 'Ritzy' and she's played by Fay Wray. But she's sick of him and wants to go straightand has taken up with a nice guy Bob Richard Arlen. But Thunderbolt has promised that if she takes up with ANYONE other than him he'll get them...and he does this in a most peculiar way...while he's in prison! Huh? How does he do this and how does it all end? See the film and find out for yourself.The film has some very good things going for itparticularly the mobster talk throughout the movie. It's all very tough and fun. Bancroft's performance is also quite entertaining not necessarily GOOD but entertaining. Still the movie's plot is very tough to believe though it is still entertaining to see today...even with its old fashioned style and bizarre scenes with Thunderbolt inexplicably in his cell with a pet dog!Instead of the usual background music it's a quiet filmnormal for 1929. But in all the death row scenes there is often some sort of spiritual being sung...and wow were they annoying and overdone!".

	schema:reviewBody "Unlike it's bigger rivals Paramount eagerly embraced talking pictures with both hands. They were one of the first studios in 1928 to bring out an all talkie movie with the sophisticated Interference and by 1929 boasted stars Maurice Chevalier Ruth Chatterton etc who were foremost in their field. They also had a big star in George Bancroft a silent star who came to fame in Josef von Sternberg's gangster movies and whose clear speaking voice guaranteed him a long career in talkies. Unfortunately ego got in the way but Thunderbolt was a mighty effort  it talked in all the right places and in 1929 that was a very big deal. It was the 4th and final collaboration between von Sternberg and Bancroft  it wasn't their best effort but there was plenty of gangster violence and tough talk!!It was a stylish underworld showcase for George Bancroft. When you see other films of 1929 with awkward pauses and stilted dialogue  this film moved and talked at a rapid natural pace  it was like Sternberg had been making talkies all his life. The stylization especially in the early scenes when Ritzie is bought in for questioning she is seated on a raised platform almost like a witness box and she caresses her furs. Also the Harlem night club is seen through a lattice work of shadows could it be a symbol for prison bars?Music and songs are also incorporated naturally. When delectable Theresa Harris sings Daddy Won't You Please Come Home? it is not just a throwaway song but is especially listened to by a thoughtful Thunderbolt and there is a wealth of meaning in their gazes. When he is on death row the songs are supplied by the prison band. Broken Hearted with it's trite words here's the boy here's the girl here am I broken hearted almost mocks the complex feelings of Bancroft and Arlen.The story is basic  Ritzie Fay Wray and Bob Richard Arlen meet night after night clandestinely in the park. He is a lowly bank employee she is the girl friend of the town's most notorious mobster Thunderbolt Jim Carson. She wants to quit and be decent again but Carson will see her in Hell first  furthermore he would track down the other guy if it is the last thing he does!! It almost is as Bob is caught in a holdup  all orchestrated by Thunderbolt and finds himself in the condemned cell adjoining Thunderbolt's own. Jim has gruesome plans for Bob  but he doesn't count on the faithfulness of a scruffy little mutt!!Richard Arlen like Bancroft was perfect for the talkies  there is a really nice scene where Arlen is horseplaying around with his mother Eugenie Besserer who was Al Jolson's mammy in The Jazz Singer a natural banter between the pair but in typical Sternberg style the camera was focused on Fay Wray's reaction to them a tearful smile playing around her lips.Highly Recommended.".

He's terrible when he's unscripted cannot function without a teleprompter doesn't have a clue what he's talking about reduces policies to simple catchphrases but the wealthy contribute generously to his campaign and he's awfully userfriendly to big business. As one character in Silver City points out Dickie sounds gubernatorial on TV when the sound's muted. Sound familiar?In Silver City writereditordirector John Sayles rolls a Chinatownesque murder mystery cynical political commentary and pointed observations about contemporary media into one film that succeeds more often than not. There are moments when I got the impression Sayles was trying too hard to drive home his point about Dickie's incompetence. As fun as it might have been to mock Dickie he's too easy a target. The greasy players around Dickie  for instance his handler Chuck Raven played with smarmy charm by Richard Dreyfuss  are far more interesting. Where Silver City crackles is in its distrust of our political system the influence of slimy corporate types on candidates and ineptitude of the media.Despite this being one of Sayles' weaker films he remains one of the finest filmmakers this nation has produced in the last 25 years. His filmography contains some of the best independent films in recent memory  Return of the Secaucus 7 1980 Lianna 1983 Matewan 1987 Eight Men Out 1988 Passion Fish 1992 his masterpiece Lone Star 1996 and Men With Guns 2000. Even much of his lesserknown works City of Hope 1991 The Secret of Roan Inish 1994 and Limbo 1999 are remarkable pieces of storytelling. He's also socially conscious acutely aware of the importance of shedding light on social problems be they the plight of immigrants childless couples or corruptibility of politicians.What's ultimately a bit disappointing about Silver City is not so much its multilayered story but Sayles' inability to keep it tightly wound. As much as I admire Sayles another editor with a fresh set of eyes might have helped tremendously.He's deftly handled multistory plots before but this film doesn't seem keenly focused. Sayles weaves too many threads that don't patch together all that well. He relies a bit too much on coincidence  especially using two migrant workers in a pivotal plot point  to unravel his mystery and many interesting subplots and characters remain dangling most glaringly a subplot involving reporter Nora an underused Mario Bello and her fianc Chandler Billy Zane a selfproclaimed champion of the underdog  he's a bigbusiness and tobacco lobbyist.The actors many of them Sayles regulars are terrific as usual. Chris Cooper plays Dickie with great aplomb but Sayles surprisingly wastes other talented actors in throwaway roles. Tim Roth Thora Birch and Daryl Hannah have little to do in roles that scream for more importance. Hannah gets some of the best dialogue but her Maddy Pilager needed more screen time.Sayles' Jake Gittes is reporterturnedinvestigator Danny O'Brien who's more akin to Elliot Gould's Marlowe than Bogart's. Danny Huston plays O'Brien with tremendous charm but Huston lacks the magnetism of his sister father or grandfather. David Strathairn might have worked better. Another Sayles regular Joe Morton would have been a fascinating choice.Sayles' cynicism about our wimpy media and political process is well founded. We're after all living in an age when the media ignored the real story behind the Florida debacle in the 2000 election the disenfranchisement of hundreds if not thousands of black voters reporters shirk their duties for fear of being branded as unpatriotic major newspapers issue mea culpas for swallowing everything this administration served up never questioning its motives in the lead up to the utterly meaningless and pointless war in Iraq political candidates hold town meetings with prescreened audiences who sign loyalty oaths and serve up prearranged softball questions and at least one TV news network's mostly a mouthpiece for a political party.Sayles' forte's always been excellent dialogue and when he moves away from Dickie the writing often is smart piercing and worthy of his best work. There are two especially razorsharp moments  between Chuck and Danny at a bar and a postcoitus Maddy.Silver City is by no means mediocre. And frankly even mediocre Sayles would be better than most of what Hollywood makes. Though this film still is better than most at the multiplex right now this is sub par Sayles. He set the standard so high with Matewan and Lone Star that we expect better from him. Silver City concludes on a symbolic cautionary note about the dangers of allowing the Dickie Pilagers of this world to win. The scary thing is we already have a reallife Dickie Pilager. And despite his good intentions he's more dangerous than anyone fiction could ever create.".

But he comes from a politically influential family and his daddy's a powerful U.S. senator. Dickie however lacks panache. He can't put together a simple sentence without stumbling. He's terrible when he's unscripted cannot function without a teleprompter doesn't have a clue what he's talking about reduces policies to simple catchphrases but the wealthy contribute generously to his campaign and he's awfully userfriendly to big business.

	schema:reviewBody "While not at the level of the best Sayles movies Lone Star The Secret of Roan Inish etc. Silver City is still entertaining. The film suffers a bit from trying to do too much and not quite making it all the way to any of its targets. But there's still a lot to enjoy.My first thought while watching this movie was hey Chris Cooper isn't the star! Since his face is featured on the poster and he starred in Lone Star and is generally considered an A List actor these days this was a bit of a surprise. The lead actor turned out to be Danny Huston halfbrother of Angelica son of John grandson of Walter etc. Huston's character Danny O'Brien is hired by the Pilager campaign to intimidate a few enemies of Dickie Pilager Cooper after a dead body shows up in a lake during a campaign photo op. But O'Brien is by nature antiestablishment and instincts from his previous life as an investigative journalist kick in so he starts to investigate much more than he was hired to.The supporting cast is terrific though many of them Tim Roth and Thora Birch come to mind are wasted in tiny roles. Aside from Huston and Cooper the only actors given much to work with are Maria Bello as his exgirlfriend who also happens to be a political reporter Richard Dreyfuss as the Rovelike campaign manager and Sal Lopez as a Mexican chef that O'Brien gets involved in investigating the background of the victim. Daryl Hannah has a nice small role as Maddy Pilager the candidate's sister.The general problem the movie has is that it seems a bit indecisive as to whether it's about immigration or about politics. It seems to be a bit more about immigration than politics and other films such as Redford's The Candidate have covered the latter ground with considerably more energy and insight. Some reviewers have noted a parallel to the Huston masterpiece Chinatown  but that's a high standard to aim for and Silver City really doesn't come close. The script is far too disjointed and Danny Huston is just not close to Nicholson's level as an actor. Still the movie is enjoyable especially for its insights into the migrant worker community which is usually ignored by most Americans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes Sayles is overambitious in this movie and lectures us about too many things. But Silver City is worth seeing just for the wonderful individual performances of its actors. Chris Cooper is deadon in his imitation of Dubya. He conveys privileged arrogance impatience mangled English and downright cluelessness. Alongside Cooper's work stand the performances of Kris Kristoffersen how does he manage to be so softspoken and so threatening at the same time?and the wonderful Ralph Waite the quintessential American actor. Also great performances from Tim Roth as the radical blogger James Gammon as the Sheriff and Sal Lopez as a Mexican cook. But do other people think Danny Huston was miscast as the main character Danny O'Brien? He seemed so awshucks goofy and dumb much of the time. Plus was he made up to look like Mike Connors in Mannix or what? That 50's hairstyle was WEIRD. Now Tim Roth HE looked and acted like a burntout radical reporter. The problem goes right back to the writing  Sayles is just trying to say way too much in this movie and we get long lectures instead of good storytelling about landdevelopers dirty politicians immigrant abuse pollution journalistic ethics corporate America dysfunctional dynastic families recreational substance abuse casual sex broken hearts  the list goes on and on. Lone Star was much more focused and the relationship in that movie between Sheriff Sam Deeds and his Hispanic lover Pilar became a metaphor for the strange  symbiotic  incestuous relationship between Mexico and the U.S. Lone Star had the same great individual performances Silver City has but it trusted its audience to be more intelligent and get it without hammering us over the head with the message. If you have the chance to see Silver City definitely see it  the acting is wonderful. But expect a flawed movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Pretty scary film with its only slightly veiled alignment with Bush's environmental and immigration policiescontradiction in terms to be sure! this uneven and fragmented film missed the mark in great filmmaking but hit it somewhat in its frightening depiction of the real power behind the powers that appear to be in charge in today's politics.Cris Cooper's character's dysfunction with the English language was so very similar to Bush's and really appeared pathetic in a man running for governor but to his credit he didn't say nucular one time but did have that same unfortunate impromptu speaking difficulty that Bush has when speaking off the cuff. Really embarrassing and hard to watch just like with Bush.Kris Kristofferson's crusty empirebuilding powermad moneygrubbing SagebrushRebellion character scared the hell out of me in the same way Dick Cheney does as did R. Dreyfuss' Karl Rovelike character. Both were excellent as the roles fit them well. Wayyyyyy creepy both but even more scary to know that real people exist that are just exactly that way and are running our country!!!The Huston family entry in this film was the loser protagonist but a weak choice for the leading role due to his toolaidback style and little boy disingenuous big smile plus his family's obvious starmaking push behind him. Let's get the boy a job shouldn't be the reason for casting movie leads. A more bulldogged but younger James Woods or Richard Dreyfustype lead would have been much more credible in the role and probably would have saved the film. Darryl Hannah was very good in her small role as the slutty trustfund sister of the candidate uselessly taking up space in life but apparently giving lots of men good times in the sack through the years.On 2nd thought maybe not so useless after all. Overall this film made me sad and uncomfortable. Sad to know that it characterized so well the political attitudes in the American presidential office today the very one that will make all of us suffer greatly until it is finally unseated. But also sad that the film was not put together a bit better with the good actors and story it had. Then it could have been as effective and as good as Wag The Dog.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was disappointed by this. Oh it is great fun goofing on any politician the more smarmy and sanctimonious the better. But I can get political goofs by the dump truck load from elsewhere. What I expected was something as gently incisive as say Doonesbury but with the cinematic skills we know Sayles has. Something as gentle and sharp as tanner on Tanner.We have three threads here. The first is the depiction of the system the handlers and supporters that make a president. We all know how it is many politicians admit it and nearly all journalists report on it. There isn't a shred of newness in this thread and surely not out of Dreyfuss. There's a second component having to do with the story that wraps the thing. Now here is where I expected some art. What we end up with a single big corporation as the bad guy no beyond that a single corporate man. Then we see how his misdeeds unravel a bit. Sure we have payoffs bribery rampant disregard for the environment and a coverup.But see. The thing to make fun of is how some reduce big complex issues to simple narratives. How they take a million threads of a complex tapestry with inscrutable hues and patterns and reduce it to a paper towel with flag patterns. So why do the same thing when satirizing them? Why? It isn't as if there aren't people in the film world incapable of doing this? Or was it just a rush job?Most people let all that slip because Chris Cooper's version is too delicious. Here's the problem with this its not disturbing enough. The thing with the target's speech is how he needs to have his mouth work but his mind cannot produce the coherent thought fast enough so it looks for stored phrases and tries to evaluate them for appropriateness on the fly. This gives both odd pauses and sometimes goofy leaps in concepts and metaphors.Listen to Cooper and pay attention to the leaps. Both are fabricated for dramatic effect. The pauses are regular. They're not even but they have multiples pause twice as long three times as long. And they have a rhythm that if you listen makes a sort of sense.Now look at the linguistic leaps. They have the same patterns regular semantic distances. That's because we as viewers have to be in on the joke. We know he will jump and precisely how far. We just don't know the direction. See humor is in the unexpected and in order for it to work you need to set expectations.Now dear reader listen to the target. He is not creating something as art he is just living. What you will find is a wellstudied artifact of a man whose cognitive centers have been damaged by cocaine saturation. There is no regularity. Pauses are random. The semantic distances are random. That's the whole point. This is what you find in substance abusers. Always. It is not dumbness but drug damage.Oddly the National Institutes of Health had a great research program on this because all sorts of conditions like Alzheimers can be diagnosed by measuring these speech effects. But once the link was make to cocaine users the program was terminated. Now that would make a good movie Huh?Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.".

What you will find is a wellstudied artifact of a man whose cognitive centers have been damaged by cocaine saturation. There is no regularity. Pauses are random. The semantic distances are random. That's the whole point. This is what you find in substance abusers. Always. It is not dumbness but drug damage.Oddly the National Institutes of Health had a great research program on this because all sorts of conditions like Alzheimers can be diagnosed by measuring these speech effects. But once the link was make to cocaine users the program was terminated. Now that would make a good movie Huh?Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.";

And then those moments would quickly be covered over by layers of poor writing clumsy direction and abysmal acting. I truly love almost all of John Sayles' work but Silver City is ghastly.I got the feeling that Sayles may have been working on the beginnings of a good story involving the illegal labor and industrial corruption plot lines but then he got rushed and stuck the secondary plot line satirizing the Bush administration onto it. The two stories don't really connect with each other and the weaker elements of the political theme dominate the first 34 of the movie causing me to lose patience with the whole affair.The other major flaw is Danny Huston's acting. His dialog in every scene is delivered with a gawping grin regardless of its appropriateness to the mood. I hated this guy by the end of the film having been reminded of every bad actor in every high school play I've ever seen. Not having seen Huston in anything else I don't know whether to blame him or to blame Sayles' direction of him more. Regardless he's the unfortunate focal point of a very unfortunate movie.Right down to the last sledgehammersubtle final scene I was disappointed by Silver City. Sayles at his best or heck even Sayles at mediocre can be so very much better than this film. See ANY of his other works instead. This isn't even worth a rental.".

If you said 'Chinatown' you'd be correct if you said 'Silver City' you'd also be correct. There are other similarities such as both have stars with last names Huston and justice is long coming. Beyond that there is no qualitative similarity Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown' is a classic John Sayles' 'Silver City' is a contemporary curiosity.'Contemporary' because the liberal Sayles writes and directs about a political campaign for the governorship of Colorado that barely disguises its protagonists as George Bush Chris Cooper and Karl Rove Richard Dreyfuss knockoffs. Cooper's candidate has halting incomplete and scripted sentences undoubtedly the speech patterns of Bush. The manipulative and effective machinations of Dreyfuss's operative are patently those of the infamous Bush campaign mastermind. The story and dialogue are undistinguished as if they count on the audience to be mesmerized by the broad parallels to the 2004 campaign. See 'Primary Colors' for wit and grit about the Clinton campaign starring John Travolta. Although Danny Huston son of John and brother of Angelica is a lesser Jack Nicholson his easygoing persona works well for a detective who constantly gets himself into trouble rather than his clients out of it.The comparison to Michael Moore's documentary 'Fahrenheit 911' is inevitable. The heavyhandedness of 'Silver' makes Moore's work look almost subtle yet Sayles must be praised for his dissenting voice in parlous times for free speech. Sayles is more successful in weaving the intricate patterns of corruption in 'City of Hope' here he seems more like Moore in an overt attempt to topple a sitting president. Sayles's 'Lone Star' is more believable and that's about incest. John Viscount Morley in 'Rousseau' wrote 'Those who would treat politics and morality apart will never understand the one or the other.'These filmmakers understand both in varying degrees of success.".

Starting right off with a politician who cannot think while he talks portrayed excellently by Chris Cooper the film rolls right into a murder mystery that keeps the momentum going to the last frame. Richard Dreyfuss plays a Carl Rove type master political manipulator after his own interests and those of his filthyrich backers. When Danny O'Brien Danny Huston is hired to investigateintimidate some of the local dissenters his path takes us to the rest of the characters that make up this amazing and astute satire on current politics and the corruption therein. If you ever thought that money was not running everything in politics this will help enlighten you. It is a delight to see Ralpf Waite in a fine performance as a mining engineer and Michael Murphy as the father of the candidate in the aptly named Pilager dynasty. Danny Huston carries the film on it's way as the man who strings it all together an interesting portrayal of a man torn by his own self doubt who for a while forgot to fight the good fight. He reawakens as the investigation reveals the underpinnings of down and dirty political interests that have nothing to do with public or environmental good. There is a great deal of subtle humor here satire in very good form.This film is worth seeing on so many levels. Any one with two brain cells to rub together would enjoy this film but for those of political astuteness this is a must. It will make you feel good to see and hear what you have been feeling for the last five years put into such an aware showcase. Everyone is the film puts in a fine performance. The scenes are in beautiful Colorado. The cast and crew writer and director John Sayles and producer Maggie Renzi have created a piece of art with social conscience as usual yet more progressive than ever.If you can't win the game just change the rules the movie explains.

The obvious Dubya clone is too broad and we don't we see how he ticks. Richard Dreyfuss is great as the campaign director though he too doesn't really get another screen time. Still on the whole there is a lot to offer especially the sense of place though some of the mountains look like fake background. Sayles also offers some great supporting characters as always. Daryl Hannah must be underlined here she is quite a find  who knew?Liking the film I guess depends on liking the former news reporter given the role to investigate an embarrassing find. I enjoyed Danny Huston's character and found his investigations handled well. The catererchef he hires to help him out also gives a nice performance as does Huston's exgf the reporter. As do others they both meet along the way. For instance the scenes involving an investigative website and rightwing talk show host were enjoyable.The film ends on a realistic note that is refreshing. It tells a story stories actually while preaching its message. And some of the bad guys including Kris Kristofferson are not portrayed as evil slimebags or anything adding a sense of fairness to the whole thing.A flawed movie that remains an enjoyable movie for mature moviegoers.".

	schema:headline " Solid Sayles";
	schema:reviewBody "From the advertisements and many of the reviews I had thought that this was a direct attack on President Bush with Chris Cooper impersonating him in a cheap joke for two hours. Not so. Dickie Pilager is most certainly a thinly veiled George W. Bush but he's only a small part of the Saylesian community presented and he disappears for half hours at a time. I'd like to point out though that the parody is deft and indeed really hilarious. It's a better impression of him than I've seen anyone on Saturday Night Live give. This film goes with the image of W that he is more of a puppet than anything else working hard for corporate America while appealing to the prejudices and values of the everyday Americans. The movie is actually a detective story with Danny Huston a sort of unconventional P.I. he was a newspaper reporter but was fired. He is asked by Pilager's campaign manager Richard Dreyfuss to investigate a body that popped up out of the water when they were filming a commercial. Dreyfuss wants to know that this was just a coincidence and that no one was trying to embarrass his candidate. Of course Huston turns up more than Dreyfuss wanted him to. The revelations are surprising and I think the story as a whole is subtle and intelligent. This fictional story of politics is more damning than Michael Moore's direct attacks on the President although that's not saying too much as I found Fahrenheit 911 to be a weak attack anyhow. I think the montage at the film's end is extremely powerful even though I do believe Sayles went far overboard on the final scene where dead fish litter the glassy lake surface while America the Beautiful blares over the soundtrack. It would be easy to convince people who haven't seen the film that it is very unsubtle with that final sequence. This isn't quite one of Sayles' best but it is a worthy edition to his canon. His fans will certainly be pleased.".

	onyx:emotionText "From the advertisements and many of the reviews I had thought that this was a direct attack on President Bush with Chris Cooper impersonating him in a cheap joke for two hours. Not so. Dickie Pilager is most certainly a thinly veiled George W. Bush but he's only a small part of the Saylesian community presented and he disappears for half hours at a time. I'd like to point out though that the parody is deft and indeed really hilarious. It's a better impression of him than I've seen anyone on Saturday Night Live give. This film goes with the image of W that he is more of a puppet than anything else working hard for corporate America while appealing to the prejudices and values of the everyday Americans. The movie is actually a detective story with Danny Huston a sort of unconventional P.I. he was a newspaper reporter but was fired. He is asked by Pilager's campaign manager Richard Dreyfuss to investigate a body that popped up out of the water when they were filming a commercial. Dreyfuss wants to know that this was just a coincidence and that no one was trying to embarrass his candidate. Of course Huston turns up more than Dreyfuss wanted him to. The revelations are surprising and I think the story as a whole is subtle and intelligent.

	schema:reviewBody "On a campaign shoot for his election as state governor Dickie Pilager hooks a dead body in a river. Campaign manager Chuck Raven moves quickly to help get Pilager out of the way and ensure the local police deal with the issue very sensitively but also feels that somebody has deliberately tried to damage his campaign and hires former investigative journalist Danny O'Brien to do some digging and send a warning to those that he suspects would have done such a thing. O'Brien starts to do his job but along the way he gets intrigued by Pilager's background and by doing some digging starts to undercover some sinister connections between the body and the future Governor.With a main character that very clearly mocks the current US President this film was still timely despite the fact that it came out in the UK over a year after it did in the US. However trading on one character is not enough to carry this film particularly when we spend most of our time with Huston's Danny O'Brien. With the focus on O'Brien we needed a really tight and smart story to uncover but instead the script is baggy and rambling like it lacks teeth or direction. Eventually it does make some sort of point but it takes its time and it certainly is not the tight smart dramasatire that it was being sold as in the UK. This is a shame because it is a missed opportunity and it produces a film that is surprisingly dull and unengaging. I know from Lone Star that Sayles can work with a main story while making the subplots all just as strong and interesting but here he can't manage it  even letting the main thrust get away from him. It is a shame but although still interesting I found myself wondering what could have been more often than I was thinking about what it actually was doing.The performances help to a point but after a while they can only do so much. Huston is the main character here and he leads the film well  just a shame nobody told him that his character was not strong or deep enough to make the audience interested in him as much as we were in the main political story. Cooper is where the best material lies and it was a shame that he is limited to so few scenes and essentially just does a few short impressions of Bushisms. Dreyfuss adds class despite not having a great deal to do  he should have been more important within the political conspiracy but the material just isn't there to use him. The support cast is solid but distractingly full  turns from Hannah Kristofferson Roth Bello Birch and others all fill the film out but they do contribute to the feeling that it isn't focused or anywhere near tight enough.Overall this was an OK film but the lack of tight focus makes it feel baggy and a bit frustrating as it doesn't go where you want it to. The cast are all good but they can't stop the film feeling baggy and aimless at times. With such a good impression of Bush at its core it is a shame that the film couldn't produce a sharper satire with a tighter plot which is ultimately the main problem with it. Fans of John Sayles will probably still enjoy it thanks to his approach but for me I struggled with the feeling that it seemed to do nothing and do it slowly.".

Even on the DVD's special feature of the making of the film they address who they are making fun of and that this film was almost done on purpose to do that.

Cooper plays a gubernatorial hopeful that just happens to resemble our current commander in chief. I have to say the crowd I watched this film with roared with laughter every time Cooper laid down a Bushism. Cooper was deadon. My only complaint would be that there were so many compelling characters I wish the story went on for another 2 hours.

But for once finally like its sister film BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN there is a film which doesn't use the transgendered person as the butt of a joke. At last a movie that humanizes the experience and makes it accessible to anyone who watches it regardless of gender preference.I'd been anxious to watch TRANSAMERICA on the heels of having watched NORMAL on HBO which also dealt on the same subject a man who comes out to himself as being trapped in the wrong sex. Both films skirt away from too much melodrama and treat the issue with the dignity that it deserves with the difference that TRANSAMERICA veers off into flatout comedy with Bree's arrival to her family's home but even that looks welcome in a story that could have become tedious despite its risky subject matter.The story of Bree formerly known as Stanley who is this close to getting her lifelong dream of being a woman except for a little problem she has a son now 17 years old who's in jail and she must come to terms with him before taking this final step. She's none too happy this means opening the door back to her old life as a man and she's not about to do this. The kid is a total hindrance. So she decides to keep it a secret bail him out drive him to Los Angeles and be done with him.And that in short is the entire setup of TRANSAMERICA. It's a road movie about two people involved in an uneasy relationship but unlike many road movies these are two real conscious breathing people who tell more about their lives than any flashback sequence. Toby for instance isn't just another teen with troubles but someone who dreams to meet his father who doesn't want to go to his home town because of a hideous secret that lives there. His incursion into porn remains unexplained but many pornstars have a history of some form of abuse and a need to be loved but an ingrained fear of rejection which is the main issue with Toby. He wants a father but wonders will he be rejected. Kevin Zegers plays Toby like a quieter but still intense Leo DiCaprio.Felicity Huffman needless to say has the meatier role. She seems to be adept in playing real people who have real stories to tell as in her turn as Lynette Scavo on Desperate Housewives. Since not much is said about Bree except that she like Bree from the show as played by Marcia Cross is also a perfectionist if a dowdier one a woman who obsesses over voice inflections and personal appearance and social decorum everything is left to Huffman's body language and facial expressions. I kept wondering what it was that made her as Stanley veer off into what seems to be an underachieving life when she had it all. Since many transsexuals have gone this path  leaving a life of normalcy and working odd jobs trying to blend in or to live as a stealth  it didn't surprise me when I saw that Bree was a waitress in a Mexican restaurant. Transsexuals for the majority live lonely lives and unless they are in gendertolerant cities they won't be found in the corporate arena. Many of them go through incredible hardships and meet violent ends. Some thrive as performers on the fringes of society seen as freaks to be snickered at. That is what we as a society impose on them a friendly alienation. Huffman manages to bring all that forth in the way she behaves among people  even how she is in her own home all practiced gestures and shy manners. She is her role down to her private parts.And bold for showing them  where most actresses over the age of forty would balk at a nude scene Huffman dives in and even though it's short because we've seen her with a fake penis on two occasions it's fitting to see her as the woman she is portraying. Very very daring without being exploitative.TRANSAMERICA is more tolerant and compassionate than it seems at first. Like I stated the film does not leer at her like a freak of nature but a real person though she herself her need for perfection is the one to bring out the laughter. It may not eventually be awarded the Oscar for Best Actress but as of now it's going down in history as being a sensitive portrayal of a woman trying to make it in the world with her son.".

She has come to the decision that will change her forever and perhaps live a happier life than the one she has led up to that moment when we meet her. Unfortunately for her fate intervenes in a way she didn't even planned upon.Duncan Tucker the director and writer of Transamerica takes a difficult subject and expanded on it. This is not exactly what any Hollywood films dare to present to a general audience since it deals with a frank approach to a subject that is not commonly seen treated so honestly and with so much integrity. Mr. Tucker shows a respectful restraint in the way he shows his story that is never shocking or in one's face.Transamerica is basically a road movie. It takes us to New York first where Bree has come to bail out the son Toby she never knew about but who appears to be a real person and he stands in the way since Toby the young man is suddenly her responsibility and she must face the consequences. Transamerica is a cross country trip where two people get to spend some time together as they travel this vast country from New York to Los Angeles.Toby a male hustler working the streets of Manhattan questions Bree's motives because he doesn't want any part of what she proposes to him. First a stop to see his stepfather is something he would rather not do. He doesn't have any happy memories of a man that has abused him sexually while he lived at home. Toby for all his street smarts evidently doesn't even guess what Bree is really like until an incident where he discovers the truth.Transamerica is a film about discoveries. Bree is at first horrified when she is told about Toby. Little by little her instincts start smoothing things over until she accepts the teen ager as a part of herself. The relationship between them flourish along the highways where they are seen traveling and make them come closer together as they should.The best thing to see the film is because of the wonderful job Felicity Huffman does in her portrayal of Bree. The actress disappears in the role in ways one couldn't imagine. The mannerisms of the trans gender woman are captured almost effortless by Ms. Huffman who carries the film on her shoulders and runs away with it. Her performance is nothing but perfection.Kevin Zegers plays Toby the son Bree knew nothing about. It's a credit to this young actor to blend perfectly with the more experienced Ms. Huffman and making this young man true to life. The supporting playing by Fionnula Flanagan Burt Young Elizabeth Pena and Graham Greene among others compliment the film well.The credit for presenting this film belongs to the courage of Duncan Tucker who wrote a beautiful screen play and then directed with love and understanding for a thorny subject.".

First a stop to see his stepfather is something he would rather not do. He doesn't have any happy memories of a man that has abused him sexually while he lived at home. Toby for all his street smarts evidently doesn't even guess what Bree is really like until an incident where he discovers the truth.Transamerica is a film about discoveries. Bree is at first horrified when she is told about Toby. Little by little her instincts start smoothing things over until she accepts the teen ager as a part of herself. The relationship between them flourish along the highways where they are seen traveling and make them come closer together as they should.The best thing to see the film is because of the wonderful job Felicity Huffman does in her portrayal of Bree. The actress disappears in the role in ways one couldn't imagine. The mannerisms of the trans gender woman are captured almost effortless by Ms. Huffman who carries the film on her shoulders and runs away with it. Her performance is nothing but perfection.Kevin Zegers plays Toby the son Bree knew nothing about. It's a credit to this young actor to blend perfectly with the more experienced Ms. Huffman and making this young man true to life. The supporting playing by Fionnula Flanagan Burt Young Elizabeth Pena and Graham Greene among others compliment the film well.The credit for presenting this film belongs to the courage of Duncan Tucker who wrote a beautiful screen play and then directed with love and understanding for a thorny subject.";

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw Transamerica as the closing film for the Frameline film festival in San Francisco where it won the The Frameline Audience Award for Best Feature. The film was obviously a labor of love. Duncan Tucker wrote directed and wisely cast Felicity Huffman as Bree before she had been cast as a desperate housewife. Huffman's husband William Macy was executive producer. The plot line is certainly the tried and true formula of the transformational road trip yet the irony of Bree's concurrent sexual transformation freshens a story that could easily have been clich. Kevin Zegers and the rest of the supporting cast are superb but Huffman's characterization of Bree is Oscar caliber. See Transamerica! It's not tragic like Boys Don't Cry. It's not about sexuality fetish or camp. It's a movie about otherness transformation family and ultimately acceptance. Felicity Huffman's Golden Globe winning and Oscar nominated performance is absolutely astounding. Her acting skill fills Bree with insecurity pathos warmth humor and growth which ultimately transforms the audience's involvement from freak show curiosity to empathy and identification.Thankfully the Weinstein brothers recognized just how outstandingly strong this performance is and decided that Transamerica would be one of the first films they would choose to distribute after their great success at Miramax. I saw this movie again during it's limited distribution again in general distribution and now own the DVD. Each time I've watched it I find even more to like. Transamerica is an indie classic.".

Bree Osbourne Felicity Huffman watches this instructional tape using it as yet one more step to ultimately eliminate every trace of Stanley Schupack the man she once was and biologically still is or at least she still will be for the next week. Bree is a preoperation maletofemale transsexual with a definite distaste for all things supposedly male. This means anything vulgar or classless and even her penis. She would much rather embrace all that is delicate artistic and insightful. These conscious decisions show gender as a performance a calculated choice to put forth the parts of you that you identify as more innately masculine or feminine in accordance with who you want to be. In Bree's case the decisions she makes are often awkward and misplaced from the jerkiness of her walk to her often difficulttoprocesshow sherationalizedthatwasagoodlook forher ensembles. Despite that the decisions she makes are her own and having made them and consequently sticking with them is more important than the decisions themselves. After all she is about to make a much bigger decision that she will have to live with for the rest of her lifeJust as Bree can almost feel the jarring cold of the surgical knife on her skin she learns that her one sexual fumble with a woman back in college when she was still Stanley led to the birth of a child. oh those silly college experimentations. That child Toby Kevin Zegers has gotten himself arrested and sent to a juvenile detention unit up in New York City. In response Bree's therapist will not sign off on her authorization to go ahead with the surgery if Bree refuses to confront this boy and her past. Upon meeting Toby Bree learns that he hustles to earn a living and enjoys his hallucinogenics while he is still holding on to his dream of making it in the movies. He aims high but he's still a realist acknowledging that his big future in the film industry will likely be in gay porn. From the looks of him in his undies I dare say he's a pretty perceptive kid not to mention a good shot at success. In the driver's seat we have a timid and awkward father who will soon be a mother but has not divulged this much to her son. In the passenger seat we have an ambitious and bright young man who has lost his way without realizing. And thus begins the great transamerican road trip from New York City to Los Angeles. Bree's seemingly unsolicited act of kindness inspires Toby to be a better man and return that kindness to this stranger. This cycle continues along the way as we watch two people who are so acutely aware of the roles they portray to the world shed their thick skins and take on new roles without even realizing they're doing it. One is trying to be heard right now and the other has tried for so long not to be seen. Yet on this cross country trek they both leave these acts they're so used to aside and embrace their new selves as a mother who helps her child see his worth and a child who makes his mother feel more like a woman than any instructional videotape or hormone she's ever seen or taken.Felicity Huffman knows how to play a reluctant mother. As the exhausted mother of four Lynette Scavo on television's DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES Huffman exhibits her strengths as an actress by playing Lynette as a woman who relies on her instincts. She is protective and fierce while still sensitive and nurturing. While her television character's hesitation comes from a lack of confidence in her abilities to embody one of life's most natural roles her TRANSAMERICA film persona holds back for mostly selfish reasons. She has not felt like herself her entire life The look of disgust on her face when a doctor asks how she feels about her penis hits hard for how quick and harsh a reaction it is. Having a problem son to deal with and eventually confront regarding his misconceived notions about his birth father is a direct obstacle that she had not counted on. This is her initial fear but Bree is actually terrified that she has no nurturing capabilities just like her television counterpart. It is only by spending time with her son that she comes to learn that she has much wisdom to impart upon him that she was not ruined entirely by her parents or that she could stand to learn a thing or two from him as well. The issue of control having it in one's life or over one's self is a struggle for most but can be even more of an arduous challenge for marginalized people like a transsexual person. He or she not only needs to ingest numerous hormones in order be more like the person they feel they are inside which is in complete contradiction to the body they've been given but they then have to deal with the ignorance and judgment that is given to them each time they put on their armor and walk outside their door. TRANSAMERICA is a film about learning how to incorporate the person you've always known yourself to be the person you so desperately want to become and about healing the relationships with the people you meet and touch along the winding road that gets you there.".

	schema:headline " Really not what I expected! Absolutely wonderful film.";
	schema:reviewBody "I only saw this movie because I've really grown to like Felicity Huffman in Desperate Housewives and because of the Oscar buzz surrounding it. I was expecting a strange crazy movie about characters I could never relate to filled with sex and stereotypes as are most movies I've seenheard about relating to either gay or transsexual people. Instead this movie was just amazing. Really thoughtprovoking wonderfully acted by Felicity and by Kevin Zegers. This movie was about 2 characters who most people would not relate to in theory but as the movie develops you see that they are just like every one of us going through the exact same things. The movie went into deep fundamental issues that are really part of what everyone goes through in life. Growing up finding out who you really are trying to be happy and making a ton of mistakes along the way.In the end Bree just wants to feel comfortable in her own skin and she wants the respect of her parents. I really forgot that I was watching an actress playing a man playing a woman. You just get sucked into this movie. When it ended I actually stared at the screen for a few seconds thinking oh man is this it? I wanted more! I found Toby to be a very interesting character. You have a 17 year old boy whose mother committed suicide whose stepfather molested him who is a junkie a male prostitute but is also interested in girls and walks around with a stuffed animal from his childhood. He seems like a very very confused teenager  confused about who he is and about what he wants. He just does what people want him to. That seems to be how he gets by in life. But then you see another side of him. He seems like a good person intelligent who wants to have a good life but has never had any real support to do that. If you met him you wouldn't even imagine the kind of background he has had and how he makes a living. He's a very attractive guy who unfortunately seems to think that sex is all he has to offer. I think some of the big lessons to learn from this movie are that you can't judge people based on physical appearances or based on things you really aren't familiar with such as transgendered people. We are all just human in the end and we all have the same emotions we all just want to be happy to love someone and to be loved. I was very happy and pleasantly surprised to see in this movie that Bree's changes are not related at all to sex. And the love she is looking for is from her family. Her only sexual experience was in college with Toby's mom. She has never been with a man. And I thought it was good and refreshing to see that her surgery and everything she goes through has nothing to do with any of that. It's just about her. Like she told her mom you never had a son. I'm honestly not extremely familiar with transgendered people but I have heard that people like Bree say that they have always been a woman just in the wrong body. And when you hear something like that your natural reaction is to think that that person is crazy. But this movie made me feel differently about the whole thing. Because I felt like what was really emphasized was that this person is unhappy as they are. Bree thinks that a surgery will cure all of her problems. But it really doesn't. You can tell that she's more comfortable in her skin after the surgery. She even dresses much better. But she still has a long way to go to feel good about herself gain confidence and figure out what she wants to do in life. It's really a coming of age story for both Bree and Toby. Bree goes through similar emotions that teenagers go through. And she is now in her 40's but her life is only now really kicking into gear.In this movie you have two lost souls who are used to being independent but also unhappy. They end up finding out that they are father and son and they realize how much a bond like that is missing from their lives. I really with there were a sequel to this movie because I really care about these characters now.I hope Felicity wins the Oscar. She definitely deserves it! Sorry for rambling so much but I just saw the movie and it really gets your brain working  I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. You will relate to it and you will enjoy it.".

I was expecting a strange crazy movie about characters I could never relate to filled with sex and stereotypes as are most movies I've seenheard about relating to either gay or transsexual people. Instead this movie was just amazing. Really thoughtprovoking wonderfully acted by Felicity and by Kevin Zegers. This movie was about 2 characters who most people would not relate to in theory but as the movie develops you see that they are just like every one of us going through the exact same things. The movie went into deep fundamental issues that are really part of what everyone goes through in life. Growing up finding out who you really are trying to be happy and making a ton of mistakes along the way.In the end Bree just wants to feel comfortable in her own skin and she wants the respect of her parents. I really forgot that I was watching an actress playing a man playing a woman. You just get sucked into this movie. When it ended I actually stared at the screen for a few seconds thinking oh man is this it? I wanted more! I found Toby to be a very interesting character. You have a 17 year old boy whose mother committed suicide whose stepfather molested him who is a junkie a male prostitute but is also interested in girls and walks around with a stuffed animal from his childhood. He seems like a very very confused teenager  confused about who he is and about what he wants. He just does what people want him to. That seems to be how he gets by in life. But then you see another side of him. He seems like a good person intelligent who wants to have a good life but has never had any real support to do that. If you met him you wouldn't even imagine the kind of background he has had and how he makes a living. He's a very attractive guy who unfortunately seems to think that sex is all he has to offer. I think some of the big lessons to learn from this movie are that you can't judge people based on physical appearances or based on things you really aren't familiar with such as transgendered people. We are all just human in the end and we all have the same emotions we all just want to be happy to love someone and to be loved. I was very happy and pleasantly surprised to see in this movie that Bree's changes are not related at all to sex. And the love she is looking for is from her family. Her only sexual experience was in college with Toby's mom. She has never been with a man. And I thought it was good and refreshing to see that her surgery and everything she goes through has nothing to do with any of that. It's just about her. Like she told her mom you never had a son. I'm honestly not extremely familiar with transgendered people but I have heard that people like Bree say that they have always been a woman just in the wrong body. And when you hear something like that your natural reaction is to think that that person is crazy. But this movie made me feel differently about the whole thing. Because I felt like what was really emphasized was that this person is unhappy as they are. Bree thinks that a surgery will cure all of her problems. But it really doesn't. You can tell that she's more comfortable in her skin after the surgery. She even dresses much better. But she still has a long way to go to feel good about herself gain confidence and figure out what she wants to do in life. It's really a coming of age story for both Bree and Toby. Bree goes through similar emotions that teenagers go through. And she is now in her 40's but her life is only now really kicking into gear.In this movie you have two lost souls who are used to being independent but also unhappy. They end up finding out that they are father and son and they realize how much a bond like that is missing from their lives. I really with there were a sequel to this movie because I really care about these characters now.I hope Felicity wins the Oscar. She definitely deserves it! Sorry for rambling so much but I just saw the movie and it really gets your brain working  I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. You will relate to it and you will enjoy it.";

	schema:reviewBody "'Transamerica' is mainly a road movie about a preoperative transsexual Bree Huffman her unknowing son Zegers and their complex yet developing relationship. There are some brilliant shots of the vast American landscapes throughout the film. This is not a predominant social rights movie. It focuses more on the relationship between the two protagonists. It's about about individual acceptance rather than social approval. It's not a tragic piece either. In spite of involving a risky subject Tucker cleverly gives a comic touch to his writing by balancing it with the drama without making any of it even slightly melodramatic.Bree is just a couple of days away from fulfilling her dream of becoming a women when suddenly she receives an unexpected phone call saying that her son's in jail. Bree is reluctant and not too happy about facing her past but after taking her therapist Margaret she goes to New York and bails her son out of jail and decides to drive with him to L.A. During this trip they tell each other about their lives the use of flashbacks has been cleverly avoided.Felicity Huffman delivers a brave and fantastic performance of what she herself described as the role of a lifetime. She displays Bree with insecurity pathos fear humour and growth which really makes one forget that they're actually looking at an actress act. Her use of nonverbal language is remarkable. While in the beginning the audience may feel that they're looking at an ugly freak one can't help but love the character after the end credits have rolled. Kevin Zegers intensely underplays his part as Bree's son Toby and does a fine job. Elizabeth Pena Graham Greene and Fionulla Flanagan stand out in smaller roles.'Transamerica' is a wonderful sincere film about very real people. It's about a woman and her son surviving in a difficult world. Though many have described Huffman's performance to be of Oscar calibre the Oscars have rewarded many nondeserving performances. It is definitely one of the most challenging performances and one that will be remembered in the history of cinema. A fine piece of cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "Transamerica follows the trajectory of the long tradition of road movies with opposites paired up on a voyage of selfdiscovery with stops along the way to their pasts.The gimmick here recalls Broken Flowerss trip when another biological father discovers a son. Here it's not just that the person who produced the sperm is on the verge of transsexual completion that helps the film rise above various genre clichs there was more than passing similarity to scenes from such films as The Sure Thing Smoke Signals and Midnight Run in debut writerdirector Duncan Tucker's script plus unfortunate throwback images of the south from Deliverance and way overthetop dysfunctional families and some Native American commentary on transsexuals coinciding with a convenient appearance by the ever estimable Graham Greene. As graphically embodied in two terrific performances Bree Felicity Huffman as ne Stanley and the newfound son Toby have opposite relations to their bodies. Having felt like a stealth woman trapped in a man's body Bree is naive to the pleasures of the flesh and is used to having to be wrapped up tight in her struggle to control normality that has impeded every part of her life. Toby is an abused gay hustler who probably for good reason and profit assumes that people of either gender or those inbetween are responding to him physically and Kevin Zegers is such an unfettered tousled Adonis that he is even more sensual than Joseph GordonLevitt's somewhat similar screwedup kid in Mysterious Skin. Both have had only negative experiences with family as we see along the way and both have a lot to learn about the parentchild relationship and honesty. While it makes it too easy for the audience's perception to have the transsexual be played by an actress like Vanessa Redgrave as Renee Richards or Olympia Dukakis in Tales of the City or Famke Janssen on NipTuck vs. Terence Stamp in The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert with only two momentary reversion lapses to masculine mannerisms played for laughs and revelation at least for more realism Bree is not in the arts or some highpowered whitecollar job. There were a lot of chuckles throughout the film but I was surprised that not all of the folks at the crowded opening weekend matine of a very mixed gay and straight audience joined in. Though the two guys next to me who had been discussing Lord of the Rings just before the film started were uproarious at Tobys analysis of the gay subtext in that story. It was a cheap shot for easy laughs to have Bree be halfJewish.While I thought it was for symbolism that the two have a key stopover in Phoenix it turns out that was filmed at the director's parents' house in Arizona. I presume the kid's concluding black cowboy hat and blond hair is a bit of an homage to Midnight Cowboy.The soundtrack selections are excellent reflections of the environments the characters are in from Latin in California to hip hop in New York to a lovely range of Southern country and gospel moving through Texas with a Lucinda Williams track Native American in New Mexico with a beautiful new Dolly Parton song over the credits that should get an Oscar nomination.".

After the film ended my companion told me the lead was played by Felicity Huffman. A woman. From birth.Having no advance knowledge of Ms. Huffman or her prior performances but having had prior knowledge of transsexuals I must say that she was absolutely convincinga truly astonishing performance.I don't want to slight the other actors and actresses there wasn't a weak link in this ensemble. This was a thoroughly enjoyable film. It is not for children but I think that most adults will not regret seeing it.";

	schema:headline " Fearless Performance by Huffman Elevates a Uniquely Enthralling Road Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Felicity Huffman gives hands down one of the sharpest and bravest performances I have seen this year as Sabrina Bree Osbourne a LAbased transsexual a week away from hisher final operation to rid himselfherself of the genitalia that reminds himher that heshe was once an unhappy man named Stanley. However this is not an extended overthetop comedy skit nor a preachy social commentary film on changing sexual roles. Rather it is an often ribald farce that gains its dramatic resonance from the spiraling convolutions of the plot and an unexpected poignancy at key moments along the way.With his first featurelength film directorwriter Duncan Tucker has fashioned a spirited road movie that matches Bree with the 17year old son heshe ever knew existed Toby a homeless teenaged delinquent who was the product of Stanley's fumbling attempt at sexual relations with a longago girlfriend who recently died. A true odd couple along the lines of Walter Salles's Central Station Bree and Toby make a crosscountry trek from New York where Toby was in custody back to LA. It all sounds pretty contrived. However in conveying Bree's prim manner academic wellspring of knowledge and droll humor Huffman grounds the film with an amazingly convincing impersonation of a man on the threshold of becoming a woman physically and struggling to keep up with the gender transition emotionally.Tucker wisely paints Bree's menial job as a telemarketer as a way to disclose that Stanley has been struggling for years to build the selfworth to become a woman and Huffman responds with her character's weary demeanor and tense posture. In what could have been a minefield of burlesque comedy opportunities there is not a single false note in her acting as she makes the controlled ladylike movements and studied vocal intonations believable traits of Bree. She is also made up simply without fuss an expert job by Jason Hayes to look credibly like she is precariously on the malefemale border with a constant fear of falling back to her character's old self.Fortunately Huffman is surrounded by a strong supporting cast. Although he often seems to be channeling Edward Furlong and Leonardo Di Caprio in portraying Toby's sullenness Kevin Zegers captures his character's confusion and angst with emotional accuracy. Tucker also wisely uses some wonderful undertheradar actors in key roles  Elizabeth Pea whom I have not seen since her poignant turn in John Sayles's 1996 Lone Star as Bree's strongminded therapist Margaret Graham Greene Kicking Bird in Dances with Wolves as Bree's wishful suitor Calvin Manygoats in a sweetly rendered episode of unrequited love and a surprisingly laidback Burt Young Paulie in all the Rocky films and an especially histrionic Fionnula Flanagan as Bree's parents heavy in denial over their offspring's decision.In fact Young Flanagan and Carrie Preston as Bree's cynical addictionrecovering sister Sidney are all hilarious in the movie's comedy peak as the dysfunctional family from hell when Bree and Toby barely make it to her hometown Phoenix prior to her operation. The family feeds almost too easily into Bree's selfdoubt but ultimately act as most families do when crises occur. The film has a few serious moments that veer toward melodrama to heighten the revelations involved but Tucker thankfully does not belabor them favoring instead the shrewd absurdist comedy elements. This is definitely an unexpected gem worth seeking out.".

	schema:headline " Engaging Movie From the Very Start";
	schema:reviewBody "Felicity Huffman turns in one of the most complex and engaging performances I've seen in a long time as Sabrina Bree Osbourne a transsexual who's down to her final stages of her final operation as she's about to lose the man jewels as she is finally rid of the horrid past she encountered when she was a man named Stanley. It's a misnomer to some who think that this is a goofy zany comedy film or a preachy film about the trials and tribulations of becoming transsexual. It is a vulgar satire that uplifts the dramatic elements from the obstacles of the plot and the surprising outcomes that manifest at the principal elements as the movie progresses.In his directorial debut Duncan Tucker has took on the classic road movie to a new direction that pits Bree and her reacquaintance with the son she only once fathered. Toby is a juvenile homeless kid who is the biological son of the former Stanley who was once in a relationship with his recently deceased mother. Bree and Toby embark on a crosscountry journey from New York to Los Angeles. Sure people might scoff by saying that this is another crosscountry road movie. But if you look into the movie beyond the surface it's really about a journey of a man trying to adapt into womanhood and the hardships it is in trying to adjust to the new life that has become of Bree.Tucker cleverly uses Bree's dreadful occupation as a telemarketer as a symbol of the obstacles Stanley faced during his quest of becoming a woman and Huffman utilizes her character's vulnerable traits and stiff posture. Sure it looked like open field for comical farce but her acting it pitch perfect and takes her training and regiments very seriously which is all very believable. With the help from Jason Hayes wig designer we get to see the gradual physical molding of a man turn woman right before our very eyes and the fear of Bree returning to her old alter ego.The supporting cast backs Huffman up nicely. Young Kevin Zegers was accurate as the poor young confused misunderstood soul Toby who's oblivious that his father is now a mother and that Bree cowardly lied to Toby saying she was a church missionary when really she's really his biological father. Elizabeth Pena of Lone Star fame was sublime as Bree's strongopinioned therapist. Graham Greene Dances With Wolves was in top form as Bree's suitor Calvin Manygoats. And the scenestealing comes from Bree's parents played by Bert Young and Fionnula Flanagan who are in perpetual denial over their son's liferendering decision.Along with the parents Carrie Preston as Bree's sister Sidney make the perfect dysfunctional family comedy foil as they easily go into Bree's selfloathing which is par for the course in most families who try to deal with problems. The film sporadically shifts into being overly sentimental tearjerker and instead Tucker focuses more on the comedy elements and the absurd scenes that follow. This is a film worthy of its accolades and I'm sure you'll enjoy it too.".

I had seen 'The Angry Inch' and it did nothing for me . Then I saw A Soldiers Girl and that movie stuck with me but it was violent . Then I viewed Transamerica and was at last entertained . Felicity Huffman  was an Oscar's performance to say the least and she did win that award . She was amazing and I do not think a male playing the role could have carried it off as well . All the actors were 100 percent human and able to reach the audience ! Kevin Segers is a bright spot in the movie as Toby  Bree's son that she did not know she had. Kevin's performance was nothing short of Oscar material  which he should have won something . There are a lot of great up and coming actors from Canada . And if it were not for the Canadians we would not have movies like this  and The Barbarian Invasion''s . Hollywood just cannot come out of the closet long enough to make a movie in this genre  let alone in off the wall subjects. I gave this welcome flick 8 stars out of 10 . ciao yaaah69".

This film deals with obviously transsexuality in a very human way  issues about what it is to be a woman and whether transsexuality is a psychological disorder as Brie says in the beginning isn't it odd for a psychological disorder to be cured with plastic surgery?. In the periphery it also deals with prostitution drug abuse homosexuality incest family acceptance and honesty.Transamerica skips ably from comedy to drama and you'll find yourself laughing riotously at pointsThe Church of the Potential Father got an lol from me and perhaps crying at points. It deals with hard topics in a frank and touching way. I found it very interesting that they chose to portray Brie with a female actress as opposed to a mtof or male actress. I'm not sure if it's simply because of Felicity Huffman's fame after Desperate Housewives or as yet another comment on the nature of sexualitygender  she's a woman playing a man who is a woman...As somebody who is very liberal accepting and already somewhat knowledgeable about lgbt topics I found this an extremely moving portrait of what it is to be in a gendersexualitygray area in America.

When I put the movie in I was completely indulged right from the very beginning. It sucks you in and never let's you go and that's how you end up truly appreciating the heartwarming masterpiece for what it is by the end. The acting was flawless I couldn't have picked a better cast myself. Felicity Huffman and Kevin Zegers gave some of my favorite performances of all time. The script was so touching and perfectly done that if the actual script was made into a book I would read it every day and everything else is just to absolutely die for especially Kevin Zegers! He is now my man candy all because of this film haha. If you have no interest at all in watching this film I suggest that you see it solely for him because he is amazingly amazing and I wish him the best on his way to stardom.Well enough said this movie is 100 guaranteed satisfaction. Everything in it from the characters story acting directing to all of the above and etc. are wonderfully fantastic and I am glad I finally viewed it for I will be viewing this gem for many years to come.

If it was trying to cash in on the success of the 1984 original and the 1987 sequel to a lesser extent Fox would have put it in theatres. Then again maybe that was the original idea. This wouldn't be the first film to simply go direct to TV and video when they studio decided not to waste time with a theatrical release.The movie itself just isn't very funny. It's a rehash of the events in the first movie but doesn't have the raunchy edge of that film nor does it have the peculiar but undeniable heart that actually gave the original some emotional punch. Comparing the scene at the pep rally there and the finale here in court is kind of comparing a small diamond to a big piece of broken glass.The new nerds also aren't very interesting and Gregg Binkley tries hard but doesn't have the weird watchable quality that Robert Carradine does. If you'll look closely the credits list Chi in the cast that's Chi McBride playing Malcolm Pennington III and giving almost no indication that he'd emerge as a terrific actor and certainly none that he'd be the breakthrough star on BOSTON PUBLIC playing Steven Harper.One thing that sort of caught my attention was the way the nerds here kept making implicit references to other minority groups. When Lewis refuses to help his cousin and other persecuted nerds he's labeled a selfhating nerd. Another character says they need as many nerds in power as they can get. And when a character admits at the film's end that he's a secret nerd he says It feels great to come out of the closet! The point seems to be that being a nerd is like being black gay Jewish female from another country what have you. It's a strange point.The film has another actor play Gilbert near the end as Anthony Edwards followed up on his very brief role in the 2nd movie by not appearing here at all. He didn't appear in part 4 either and III came out a few years before he broke through on ER. Didn't like seeing someone else play his role but it fit this misshapen boring film.There is one great line here. When Lewis and wife Betty ask the local college DJ to broadcast in the name of nerd freedom the DJ stands up and says There's no greater friend to the nerd than the American DJ. If we weren't all nerds ourselves we'd all be on television. It's such a good line that it overlooks that most college radio stations have so little listening range that the DJ might be the only person who gets the message.".

You can replace a lot of actors in a lot of roles but not this one Mr. Carradine owns it and nobody could ever do what he's done with this character. I also liked seeing Julia Montgomery back in her role as Betty and Curtis Armstrong as Booger. I didn't care for the new generation of nerds. Toyota is just a bad ripoff of Booger I don't understand that Edith character at all and the character of Harold Skolnick seriously lacked the charm of the original nerds. I liked how Stan Gable finally came to understand who he is and to embrace himself seems like he finally learned how to take responsibility for his own life. All in all this was a cute movie but it did not have the charm of the original or the first sequel. My favorite part was the end when the original nerds came back to support Lewis. The actor who played Gilbert bore a striking similarity to Anthony Edwards. I would love to see another ROTN come out perhaps with Lewis and Betty's son now at Adam's College? I would watch that most definitely!!!".

Yeah they're a bit ridicules not to mention that I think Revenge of the Nerds III The Next Generation took a different direction than the original Nerd film but it's all good.

His nephew and his nephew's friend have gone to the same college and have joined the Lamb's but we have a new dean in town Stan is back! He and an alumni of the school are joining together to ban all nerds from the town. The nerds call on Lewis to get back to his nerd roots and help them take over the town hopefully Lewis can get past this silly smooth operator appearance because it's not working for him or the nerds that need him most.Revenge of the Nerds III The Next Generation is nothing special but it still has a few laughs. I really didn't think it was bad at least not as bad as the rating would on IMDb led me on. Revenge of the Nerds III The Next Generation is just a fun movie that I think people need to be open too it's a different direction in the story but it works over all.

This time out we have a fresh group of nerds showing up at Atoms College which has pretty much been nerd friendly for the past decade. Soon Stanley Gable Ted McGinley is hired as Dean and he plans on making the college more jocks but the gang from the original movie has other plans. You can file this one under the what the heck where they thinking section because if someone wanted to kick start the franchise why on earth make it a pathetic madeforTV movie? Okay movies for television can be pretty good but the production values here are so cheap and the story so bad you're really going to feel like you're watching an episode of Saved by the Bell The College Years. I'm really not sure where to start but I guess we'll begin with the two new leads who are downright annoying pathetic and just unlikeable. The key behind the first film is that we liked the characters but that's not the case here as all of the newbies are just annoying and you can't help but want to pick on them as well. Another major problem are the characters from the first movie as they too are underwritten and come off looking like cheap fake copies of the originals. Curtis Armstrong McGinley Julie Montgomery and Robert Carradine are just a few of the folks brought back here and more get dragged into the film at the very end for brief cameos. I really like the idea of bringing back the original group but if they were going to go through all the trouble of getting everyone signed it looks like they would have spent some extra time on an actual story. What we have here is just one bad sequence after another and we know where it's all going to go as we get the typical tired story of the nerds having to fight yet again. This here is a real mess of a movie and a major insult to the original film. The only reason this thing avoids a BOMB rating is due to McGinley and Carradine sharing a few nice moments when they first meet up after all these years.".

Scott James Cromwell Bernie Casey and Ted McGinley.In this next chapter the nerds of past and future team up to regain control of the Adams College campus when it's taken over by the Alpha Betas led by fellow alumni Orrin Price Morton Downey Jr. and Stan GableMcGinley.When Gable is installed as the dean of students he uses his power to cause trouble for the new Tri Lambs consisting of Harold Skolnick Binkley Ira Steve Toyota Cho Malcolm Warner Pennington III McBride Trevor Gulf Pinette and Judy Moglen.In addition LewisCarradine who hides his past is happily married to wife Betty Montgomery he is more concerned in being friends with the enemy.However after seeing Stan's true colours this causes Lewis to spring into action and return to his nerd self assisting his nephew and friends in their battle of brains vs. brawn.Surprisingly enough when Price's reign of trouble goes a step too far and Lewis gets accused of a crime he didn't commit all his old friends return to support him.Seeing this causes the former jock to change his mind and stands up admitting to being a nerd and testifies against Price leading to his arrest.The movie ends on a happy note as the heroes celebrate victory once again nerd freedom is restored to school.Although not as hilarious as it's predecessor Revenge Of The Nerds Part 3 The Next Generation does provide some silly laughs great quotes and decent performances.I'd give it a 5.210".

Scott James Cromwell Bernie Casey and Ted McGinley.In this next chapter the nerds of past and future team up to regain control of the Adams College campus when it's taken over by the Alpha Betas led by fellow alumni Orrin Price Morton Downey Jr. and Stan GableMcGinley.When Gable is installed as the dean of students he uses his power to cause trouble for the new Tri Lambs consisting of Harold Skolnick Binkley Ira Steve Toyota Cho Malcolm Warner Pennington III McBride Trevor Gulf Pinette and Judy Moglen.In addition LewisCarradine who hides his past is happily married to wife Betty Montgomery he is more concerned in being friends with the enemy.However after seeing Stan's true colours this causes Lewis to spring into action and return to his nerd self assisting his nephew and friends in their battle of brains vs. brawn.Surprisingly enough when Price's reign of trouble goes a step too far and Lewis gets accused of a crime he didn't commit all his old friends return to support him.Seeing this causes the former jock to change his mind and stands up admitting to being a nerd and testifies against Price leading to his arrest.The movie ends on a happy note as the heroes celebrate victory once again nerd freedom is restored to school.Although not as hilarious as it's predecessor Revenge Of The Nerds Part 3 The Next Generation does provide some silly laughs great quotes and decent performances.I'd give it a 5.210";

Do you laugh at poop jokes or for that matter just really dumb jokes?If you know a bit about Japanese culture and can laugh at stupid jokes then this is for you.Starting as one man's quest to get a car so he can have sex in it this film morphs into a destruction of dozens of Japanese icons. It proves that Western eyes aren't the only ones who find much of Japanese culture silly.If you have a passing awareness of what they are sending up and tearing down this is absolutely hysterical. Granted you won't get everything but you'll probably smile from start to finish with frequent bursts of laughter.One of the chief reasons this works is that there is intelligence behind the humor. Yes the hero is a pig and his attitudes towards women are terrible but thats the point and much of the pain that he ends up getting he deserves for being the way he is. The jokes about the icons is often dead on for example the film dismantles Lone Wolf and Cub in a minute and a half so perfectly I doubt that I'll be able to watch the movies with a straight face ever again.If you know Japanese culture and love to laugh see this movie. You may not love it all but you will laugh.A word of warning this movie would be rated R if released in the US. Not just for the sex and nudity but for the scatological humor which cross over into the graphic.For Japanophiles with a low brow sense of humor 8 out of 10. For everyone else 4 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "It sometimes comes as a surprise to people when they learn that Takeshi Kitano is best known in Japan as a comedian. The man with the most deadpan expression ever is mainly known for his gangster movies and for the sometimes shocking portrayal of violence they contain. I'm surprised that people are surprised though because even his most hardboiled gangster movies contain a strain of deadpan absurdist humour that is at least as characteristic of his films as the violence. Maybe a lot of people simply miss the humour  Americans aren't best known for their appreciation of subtle comedy after all Watching GETTING ANY? it's hard to imagine anybody missing the fact it is a comedy though as it is anything but subtle. Actually maybe that's not true  the humour is still often times subtle but the movie as a whole is unmissably surreal and absurd.The premise is simple. A not too bright loser has but one thing on his mind  getting laid. He really hasn't got much of a clue how one goes about this though and the movie largely concerns his increasingly stupid schemes to get some. First on the list... get a car. Should be simple enough right? Not for this guy  His plans get more and more ludicrous as the movie progresses and lead him into some ridiculous and sometimes hilarious situations.This is without a doubt the strangest movie Kitano has done and it's as wild and inventive as any movie that springs to mind except maybe the odd Jeff Lau or Stephen Chiau film. The movie plays like a strung together sequence of sketches parodying numerous movies and cultural elements rather like a Japanese Monty Python film. Like Monty Python it's clear that there's a keen intelligence behind all the stupidity.The movie is not without flaws unfortunately  chief of which is that it loses focus for a long time around the half way mark. Our hero gets himself into a couple of dire situations and for some time the whole purpose of his adventure getting some is forgotten. It's still funny and ridiculous but dilutes the experience somewhat and drags on a little too long. It perhaps becomes a little too absurd for its own good in the second half coming too close to simply being random.GETTING ANY? is a fairly lightweight contribution to Kitano's resume but one so totally opposed to his unique style of filmmaking shown in films like SONATINE and HANABI that it simply had to be made. Kitano is far more than a one trick pony even though it's mainly for one trick that he's known in the west. Unfortunately GETTING ANY is probably altogether too strange to have widespread appeal in the US and won't do much to broaden peoples' perception of him.".

At least Image has released in Hong Kong and USA the DVD of Minna Yatteruka getting any? with English subtitles and we've been able to see the unknown Kitano in a hilarious movie.First of all I have to say that I've seen all Kitano movies even Dolls and this movie has nothing to do with them it's a completely different story has more to do with tv shows he directed like Takeshi's Castle.So the movie is just astonishing it comes from the most stupid situation and developes through gag to gag. One hour and a half of cinema parody fullfiled with Japanese Manga stupidity. The rhythm of the movie is slow very slow at some points for a comedy but it's still a good movie. I found parodies from his other yakuza movies Ultraman even the gohstbusters! and I'm sure I missed a lot.Overall Review A very funny movie a fresh product but might be too weird for the general audience.

Why are they making this a racial thing saying if you like Japanese culture. Who are these asshats who are so busy feeling pretentious for sitting through a vintage and indie film made in Japan that they totally missed the quite obvious point? It is a brilliant satire and reading the reviews and seeing how that flew over their heads almost repulses me!? This film is simply about MEN who think their cars impress women! How dare these reviewers think that Japanese people aren't human and also don't go through this sort of peer pressure! That this film is simply mocking Japanese pop culture. I'm confused! This film was made in 1994! Now unless the director literally said I made this film to mock Japanese pop culture and you can prove that with a link to a credible source I don't get why people are saying this!One guy even said this movie mocks Zatoichi! Zatoichi was made almost 10 years after this film so HOW IS THIS FILM MOCKING ZATOICHI?! Shut up you ignorant weaboo!!? He just wants to brag that he has seen Zatoichi so he mentioned it!! And other people who do not know better themselves will find his idiotic review worthy.Now on to why I love and totally understand this film and do NOT see this as merely a Japanese movie. One scene shows the main actor conspiring a plan to get sex by having a first class plane ticket. The director shows us his fantasies and how he goes after the ridiculous thing. He says to himself I need money. I can rob a bank. I need a gun to rob a bank. And I'm totally in tune with this guy at this point so I tell myself as a joke the 1st time I have seen the movie Well I guess he's going to have to become a policeman so he can get a gun so he can rob a bank. And what does this guy do? Well I can't say much but he goes through a ridiculous number of attempts to get a gun! It is hilarious and sometimes he is too stupid even for me but I never blame the movie I see this as a brutal relentless mockery of the mentality of desperate insecure men who hide behind their materials to get women. And I loved this movie inside and out.I think this movie needs to be redone and rebooted as an almost exact remake. With famous actors of today in Japan. Modern Japanese movies with attractive Japanese cast has no problem appealing to the modern and young crowd in and out of Japan the type of people who have to see this movie the most. Stop hiding behind your materials you look silly. And stop getting yourself into a chain of unnecessary situations to impress other people. This movie for me is a fine balance of wit and silliness while never straying from its purpose. I mean it's not about the silliness of each scene it's about WHY is he doing it. He messed up a bigtime movie he got a role in JUST so he can be an actor JUST so he can meet groupies JUST so he can get laid. HE'S ridiculous but the MOVIE is spot on with making fun of men like this. This movie is an unsung answer to life's dumbest problems like materialism and getting sex. It shouldn't be looked at as simply Japanese quirkiness. This movie is similar to Britain's The Inbetweeners. Which is also not about being British. It's about being a desperate teenage boy simple. And America could never do this properly. It would be all slapstick and no wit and obviously it is another American who made the ignorant racial review about this movie! Ha.".

One scene shows the main actor conspiring a plan to get sex by having a first class plane ticket. The director shows us his fantasies and how he goes after the ridiculous thing. He says to himself I need money. I can rob a bank. I need a gun to rob a bank. And I'm totally in tune with this guy at this point so I tell myself as a joke the 1st time I have seen the movie Well I guess he's going to have to become a policeman so he can get a gun so he can rob a bank. And what does this guy do? Well I can't say much but he goes through a ridiculous number of attempts to get a gun! It is hilarious and sometimes he is too stupid even for me but I never blame the movie I see this as a brutal relentless mockery of the mentality of desperate insecure men who hide behind their materials to get women. And I loved this movie inside and out.I think this movie needs to be redone and rebooted as an almost exact remake. With famous actors of today in Japan. Modern Japanese movies with attractive Japanese cast has no problem appealing to the modern and young crowd in and out of Japan the type of people who have to see this movie the most. Stop hiding behind your materials you look silly. And stop getting yourself into a chain of unnecessary situations to impress other people. This movie for me is a fine balance of wit and silliness while never straying from its purpose. I mean it's not about the silliness of each scene it's about WHY is he doing it. He messed up a bigtime movie he got a role in JUST so he can be an actor JUST so he can meet groupies JUST so he can get laid. HE'S ridiculous but the MOVIE is spot on with making fun of men like this. This movie is an unsung answer to life's dumbest problems like materialism and getting sex. It shouldn't be looked at as simply Japanese quirkiness. This movie is similar to Britain's The Inbetweeners. Which is also not about being British. It's about being a desperate teenage boy simple. And America could never do this properly. It would be all slapstick and no wit and obviously it is another American who made the ignorant racial review about this movie! Ha.";

This seems to be his consuming passion and throughout this VERY freeform film he bounces into many surreal and Benny Hillstyle skits. For a while he tries to figure out the best way to get a girl to be willing to have sex with himand he imagines himself in many bizarre situationsmany that are absolutely soaked in nudity. The goes from being a failed bank robber to a failed actor to a failed gangster to the invisible man he didn't fail here to a weird flyman who adores human waste.Much of this is not funny but some is and you'll laugh out loud. But it's not consistent at all very cartoony and much like a film if it were made by 8 yearolds with a big budget. But at other times it's clever satireand stuff you'd adore if you are into Japanese cultureas it pokes fun of Zatoichi Ultraman Joe Shishido a great gangster from 1960s Japanese films and even Ghost Busters.

Kitano's usual crisp writing style is all together missing in this film which has a rather basic plot a pathetic middleaged man who's goal in life is to one day have sex in a car but at the same time is mired by the off the wall misadventures of the main character Asao.  In fact Asao's adventures become so off the wall that by the end of the film I completely lost track of how he wound up in his final state or maybe by the end of the film I just didnt care anymore to think about it.  What makes the off the wall plot even worse is the smattering of off the wall characters to go with it like the pink nighty wearing Yakuza Boss the old man who steals Asao's bomb cake and the dying Yakuza gangster who keeps popping up every so often to give Asao a helping hand.However despite its shortcomings the movie did have its moments. Kitano's scientist character was rather amusing and it was a fresh change to see him playing a character that didnt shoot anyone in the face its kinda like seeing Clint Eastwood in a comedy.  Also the film did some pretty good lampooning on popular Japanese film genres such as the Yakuza Film and the Giant Monster Movie.In conclusion Minna yatteruka was an o.k. comedy but thats about it.  It lacked the subtle humor found in Kitano's other films like Kikujiro which I found more enjoyable.  Due to that I would have to give this film a 6 and a word of advice to the film maker  There is such a thing as having too much stool in a movie.".

Close plays a double role as Patinkin's wife Jan  and as Maxie a 20's vaudeville actress who returns to this plane to occupy Jan's body. Glenn Close is really fabulous in these roles. This is a great movie based on the fact that it is a great story with excellent acting. Maxie doesn't rely on massive special effects or inane contemporary music. It is classic comedy that leaves you feeling good when the film is over. This is 98 minutes of excellent entertainment that I would highly recommend.".

It is classic comedy that leaves you feeling good when the film is over. This is 98 minutes of excellent entertainment that I would highly recommend.";

She was amazing in her portrayal of a guarded housewife to a fun life loving 1920's actress named Maxie. The shift and broad spectrum to which Close portrays the characters enables me to see why she was praised as highly as she has been.

	schema:reviewBody "Maxie is a childhood favorite of mine that used to get a lot of airtime on cable in the mid80s now largely forgotten. The basic premise is Jan the uptight and conservative secretary of a San Francisco bishop becomes possessed by the spirit of 20s jazz baby and starlet Maxie Malone played by Glenn Close in a dual role. Mandy Patinkin plays her hapless yet gentle husband Nick and the whole movie deals with the shenanigans of Maxie's return to the living world. Ruth Gordon has a brief yet touching role as Maxie's best friend Trudy. A pity there wasn't more of her in this film. Maxie died in a car crash on the way to a movie audition in 1927 which could've potentially made her a star. The conflict arises because of Nick's strong attraction to Maxie and his love for his wife. Close as Maxie and Patinkin have plenty of chemistry and there was a part of me that wished Maxie took over completely and kicked Jan to the curb. At times both the characters of Jan and Maxie were slightly irritating. I cannot explain why I felt that way but I did at certain moments. Close is not one of my favorite actresses but she does a decent job here. One of the best scenes is the blazingly white hot Bye Bye Blackbird number. Throughout the movie my allegiance switched back and forth between Jan and Maxie so it was a bit disconcerting. The problem with this film that I noticed now that I've seen it as an adult is the payoff is never really there. There's certain characters like the Ruth Gordon one that could've been expanded on more the bishop talking about performing an exorcism on Jan but we never see it and other characters that are just there for no real reason and don't advance the story along any. The end with Jan and Nick escaping the hotel in silly disguises was unnecessary. Although I love movies about the 20s this film wasn't as enjoyable as it was when I was a kid. It's not a terrible film but it could've had a lot more comedic potential. It's not a bad movie to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon.".

I must admit that Glenn Close is one of my least favourite film actresses of all time and her performance here does little to change my opinion of her limited abilities.

	schema:reviewBody "I was a TV addict at a very early age.  I lived with my grandparents and my grandfather and I used to fight over what to watch on his television.  He loved westerns we watched Cheyenne and Wyatt Earp and Rifleman and numerous others during the fifties.  I didn't quite share his enthusiasm for these shows but it was a way to pass the time with him.  But after seeing The West Divide I know why he loved westerns so.  Some may refer to it as a B movie but I think the B stands for basic.  There's something thrilling about its lack of artifice.  The sound of fists connecting to flesh doesn't have that ungodly amplification that later more technically sophisticated examples of the genre had.  The sentiment is rarefied like the open air. When the heroine is shot it's played out plainly and purely sometimes you can get a stronger emotional effect without a musical score.  And the sequence with the runaway team is bracing I figure the legendary Yakima Canutt stunted in this scene.And then there is the young John Wayne.  I think it is during this period in his career that he proved himself to be the giant star he became.  When he dons white buckskin in The Telegraph Trail he becomes almost otherworldly.  Here he plays a man posing as an outlaw to find the killer of his father.  By the time he has set things right lying supine in his longlost brother's arms you understand why so many moviegoers couldn't get enough of him.  His entire body in that moment gives way to the scene and you cherish how tenderly and passionately he's willing to play his part. This movie taps into that well of memories some of us have with family and loved ones and as Father's Day is tomorrow it helps remind me what deep elemental emotion men often feel that these days goes unacknowledged.  I certainly wasn't aware of it in those days with my grandfather but I've gained a new consciousness that has come with my being about his age at the time and watching things I know he'd have loved.  Like The West Divide. It makes you wish they made more westerns like this one.".

Of course Whitlock is once again a villain in the Snidely Whiplash tradition who not only wants the ranch but also has evil designs on McKee's daughter Virginia Brown Faire.In reviewing B westerns sometimes I have a tendency to reach back to those 19th century morality plays so popular in that era. Whitlock in fact even laughs like a villain in one of those plays. For reference you should see the Irene DunneAllan Jones version of Showboat to see just the kind of drama they used to put on then. It survived in the B western John Wayne's as well as other's.Wayne of course by the end solves all the problems concerned and the villain gets his just desserts.

He discovers a young kid being raised by one of the outlaws. Interesting in this B western set firmly in the 19th century morality play tradition we also have a topic so very gingerly touched on as child abuse. A rather adult theme for a western or any kind of picture at that time.Wayne was just beginning his stay at Monogram Pictures Lone Star westerns this was his third. Monogram had a stock company to rival the much better one of John Ford. Note how for the next three or four years the casts are just about the same in every Wayne western at that studio. It gets hard to keep these in chronological order I wouldn't be surprised if a few of these weren't shot simultaneously.The best you can say about the Monogram films is that they kept John Wayne employed not something easily said during the Depression.

	schema:reviewBody "It appears a little more thought than usual went into this Lone Star Western as the story line is fairly consistent and director Robert North Bradbury throws in a few elements I haven't seen yet after watching almost all of them. Wayne's character is Ted Hayden who takes on the guise of wanted murderer Gat Ganns when it might help him get the goods on bad guy Gentry Lloyd Whitlock. George Hayes not yet known as Gabby teams up with Wayne to outwit the baddies and save the day for the Winters Lafe McKee and Virginia Faire Brown.It struck me that Wayne's appearance in the film bears some resemblance to another cowboy star Hopalong Cassidy. His character wears all black including the tall cowboy hat and he rides a white horse in the story. Of course Hoppy teamed with Gabby to round out that connection as well.The story itself is fairly formulaic bad guy Gentry wants the Winters ranch and they aren't selling. Stealing their money and their cattle and getting rid of Mr. Winters all sounds pretty familiar with Gentry hiring the phony Ganns to help pull it off. Then he plans to eliminate Ganns as well by killing him and claiming the reward money. Needless to say the good guys figure it all out and the payoff is a beaut. As Gentry staggers out of a cabin following a fight with Hayden his own men gun him down by mistake  OOPS! Yakima Canutt performs some of the daring stunts he's known for one involves bringing two buckboard horses to a halt after they've broken away from their rig with Yak riding the hitch like a pair of water skis. There's a wilder one though when as Hayden he dives off his horse and through the window of a cabin in pursuit of Gentry. It's one of the better stunts you'll see Yak perform in this or any movie.Typically John Wayne gets the girl at the end of the picture but it's not surprising. Earlier in the story his character Hayden remarks to Gentry  ...I'll stay at the Winters place tonight I got a few things I want to pick up. The difference this time out though the film doesn't end in a clinch between the new couple. Instead they chase down young Jim Hayden after he embarrasses big brother and Fay into a match up.For trivia fans you might want to keep that 'Wanted' poster for Gat Ganns in mind if you look up some more of Wayne's Lone Star films. It appears again tacked to a cabin wall in a scene from The Trail Beyond. Even in the Thirties they found ways to economize.".

It has all the bad elements of the series bad acting convoluted and dull plotanachronisms telephones automobiles and women in 1930's clothes. Only the stunt work is excellent providing the five or six interesting moments.At one point Wayne turns to the bad guy and says that he's acting like a character out of a dime novel. He's exactly right. The bad guy and the story are stereotypes even for 1933.The series seems to move between films that basically follow straight stereotypical Western stories and films that provide funny and clever twists on the stereotypical stories. This one is played straight and thus only has interest for cinema or Western historians. The other type Riders of Destiny and the Star Packer for example are still quite entertaining 75 years later.".

	onyx:emotionText "This was the fourth of the sixteen Wayne Lone Star series. I must respectfully disagree with those on IMDb who rate it highly. I thought it was one of the worse in the series. It has all the bad elements of the series bad acting convoluted and dull plotanachronisms telephones automobiles and women in 1930's clothes. Only the stunt work is excellent providing the five or six interesting moments.At one point Wayne turns to the bad guy and says that he's acting like a character out of a dime novel. He's exactly right. The bad guy and the story are stereotypes even for 1933.The series seems to move between films that basically follow straight stereotypical Western stories and films that provide funny and clever twists on the stereotypical stories. This one is played straight and thus only has interest for cinema or Western historians. The other type Riders of Destiny and the Star Packer for example are still quite entertaining 75 years later.";

	schema:reviewBody "Like a slew of other John Wayne Bwesterns shown on the Encore Channel this one has a 'new and improved' musical track created I assume by the Fox Lorber company who distributed it. Frankly the music is obviously new but not the least bit improved over the normal public domain copies of this film you can download for free. The problems with the music are many. First the same sound track is used in many of the Wayne filmsthe exact same music. Second the music is often dropped into scenes like a sledgehammer with little appreciation of whether or not it's appropriate! Third being modern electronic music it's totally inappropriate to the film. Fourth the music is much louder and hollowsounding than the rest of the filmand quite distracting.For fans of Westerns you may or may not recognize Gabby Hayes in this one. Early in his Bmovie days he had not yet solidified his old coot personaand his beard is absent here. I wasn't surprised as I've seen him play villains and erudite gentlemen around this same time periodbut those familiar with his days as Roy Rogers' sidekick might be surprised by his earlier personas.The starts out horribly. Wayne and Hayes are sitting by fire having a conversation that would never happen in real life. Instead of talking like two normal folks they do a lengthy exposition where they explain the back story in only a few momentsas if they are reading a script. As I said no one talks that wayespecially when both the characters are supposed to already be familiar with what they are talking aboutas it involved them! This is sloppy screen writing at its worst and was a device used to avoid the 'unnecessary' addition of a couple more moments of dialog and action to set the same foundation for the film. And considering that these Wayne films all were under one hour long such gimmicks for economy sake weren't that uncommon...but it's still sloppy. And naturally you can assume that what follows will all relate to this back story involving the murder of Wayne's father.Soon afterwords John and Gabby come upon a woman who was accidentally shot a bit earlier. They cart her off to town for medical attention. I loved the next scene where the doctor says that they got her there just in time as she had a severed artery. There is no way she could have survived this long with such a serious wound she probably would have died within minutes. And I loved when the doctor then said the wound wasn't very serious!! Crazy! I would love to know who was the medical consultant for this film....Dr. Hackenbush perhaps?! Like Randy Rides Alone also John Wayne 1934 this film soon involves a gang and their efforts to steal land away from a nice young lady and her father. Naturally the chivalrous Wayne will help girl and in the process catch those who killed his Pa. The only noticeable difference is that for once in this film Wayne is dressed in black...a departure from the usual clich of a hero in white.Along the way Wayne saves the life of a kid and sees that the kid's father is a bit of a sadistic brute. Naturally the way to deal with this is to beat the snot out of himwhich Wayne does with surprising difficulty considering the guy looked old and a bit pudgy. Wayne remarks that this guy's face is familiar....could it be this guy has a clue as to the identity of the gang who killed Dad?! Gosh! Aside from the black hat and a nearly cleanshaven Hayes there really are no surprises here. In fact compared to Wayne's other Bmovies this one is definitely a few notches below themmostly because of the quality of the script. Sure I can accept the formulaic aspects of the movieheck this is what you expect in a Bwestern. But everything is telegraphed and presented so poorlythat's why this one is so atrociously written. It's a shame as with a bit of a rewrite this could have been a lot more watchablethough rewrites was a luxury not usually afforded to Bs.By the way in addition to the dippy doctor I also liked when the rancher told Wayne and Hayes that he'd phoned the Sheriff! Such bizarre anachronisms set in the old West were not actually that uncommon in films of the genre. Heck Gene Autry often had such plot devices in his filmssuch as chasing the guys on horseback using a pickup truck!!".

Canutt had dark hair and a noticeable bald patch but hack director R. N.

	schema:reviewBody "Ted Hayden John Wayne joins an outlaw gang under the guise of a man he found dying to find the one or ones responsible for his father's death. Only to discover the gang leader's is the one responsible but love and previously unknown family.This is not a bad movie but may not be for all. First of all there are a lot of audio problems throughout the film which is fairly short by today's standards. There are times that you have to strain to hear some performers with weaker voices. I noticed in a scene at the end of the film a sound from the microphone when they switched to closeups of the actors in scene possibly due to changes in the audio.John Wayne is possibly the best performer in this film. He is easily the easiest for the audience to connect with. His sidekick George Gabby Hayes is in my opinion completely forgettable only due to not being on screen much. I also found Virginia Brown Faire who played Wayne's love interest to be pretty poor in her performance. I just could not believe her as she said many of her lines.A big problem with this movie is that due to the short length of the movie under an hour there was just not enough time to develop the characters or any subplot. If you ask me the romantic subplot was really rushed. There was just no time to expand any of the main plot as well.The chemistry between performers was pretty good. I would have liked to have seen more between Wayne and Hayes as well as Wayne and the young boy who Wayne's character befriends. Due to Faire's lackluster performance it was hard to believe the relationship between her and Wayne at times.Like the audio the sound effects were pretty bad. There were more fist fights than gun fights in this movie. While you could hear gun shots in this film it was nearly impossible to hear punches connect. You have to really strain to hear the smack of the punches apparently connecting during fights especially when they were fairly distant from the microphone on set.As for wardrobes they were all pretty nice. However none of the clothing appeared to have been worn for some time by the people it looked pretty much new. All the clothing looked really nice though and fit the classic Old West stereotype created by Hollywood.There was absolutely no music in this film. Music could have helped enhance the mood of some scenes but because the movie was from the early days of Hollywood it wasn't needed.There is an extremely little amount of violence in this movie. Due to the time it was made there is absolutely no blood. The most violent thing in the entire film is a fist fight. Parents young children could watch this without you worrying about an excessive amount of blood.This movie wasn't bad but it's far from perfect. Fans of The Duke will probably like this a lot more than others. However his fans will most likely enjoy it more.".

First of all there are a lot of audio problems throughout the film which is fairly short by today's standards. There are times that you have to strain to hear some performers with weaker voices. I noticed in a scene at the end of the film a sound from the microphone when they switched to closeups of the actors in scene possibly due to changes in the audio.John Wayne is possibly the best performer in this film. He is easily the easiest for the audience to connect with. His sidekick George Gabby Hayes is in my opinion completely forgettable only due to not being on screen much. I also found Virginia Brown Faire who played Wayne's love interest to be pretty poor in her performance. I just could not believe her as she said many of her lines.A big problem with this movie is that due to the short length of the movie under an hour there was just not enough time to develop the characters or any subplot. If you ask me the romantic subplot was really rushed. There was just no time to expand any of the main plot as well.The chemistry between performers was pretty good. I would have liked to have seen more between Wayne and Hayes as well as Wayne and the young boy who Wayne's character befriends. Due to Faire's lackluster performance it was hard to believe the relationship between her and Wayne at times.Like the audio the sound effects were pretty bad. There were more fist fights than gun fights in this movie. While you could hear gun shots in this film it was nearly impossible to hear punches connect. You have to really strain to hear the smack of the punches apparently connecting during fights especially when they were fairly distant from the microphone on set.As for wardrobes they were all pretty nice. However none of the clothing appeared to have been worn for some time by the people it looked pretty much new. All the clothing looked really nice though and fit the classic Old West stereotype created by Hollywood.There was absolutely no music in this film. Music could have helped enhance the mood of some scenes but because the movie was from the early days of Hollywood it wasn't needed.There is an extremely little amount of violence in this movie. Due to the time it was made there is absolutely no blood. The most violent thing in the entire film is a fist fight. Parents young children could watch this without you worrying about an excessive amount of blood.This movie wasn't bad but it's far from perfect. Fans of The Duke will probably like this a lot more than others. However his fans will most likely enjoy it more.";

	schema:reviewBody "There's a short list of films where John Wayne's character dies. I don't think West Of The Divide is on that list but look again.In the opening five minutes we watch a man collapse after drinking from a poison water hole. A close up reveals him to be none other than John Wayne. Less than a minute later he's dead.Don't worry That's not a spoiler. John Wayne is playing two characters in this movie. One Gatt Gans is a deadly outlaw who as mentioned winds up just dead. The other Ted Hayden happens to look like Gans which Hayden discovers after lifting a wanted poster off Gans's corpse. It turns out Gans was en route to perform a hired killing and it just so happens Hayden has some unfinished business with the hombre behind it.Maybe fate's kinda taken a hand in this deal Hayden observes before telling his pal Dusty George not yet Gabby Hayes that he'll pretend to be this bozo with the identical kisser.Fate indeed takes a hand in West Of The Divide a mighty heavy one too. West Of The Divide is practically nothing but fate taking a hand.A couple of scenes on a young woman rides away from two bandits. She falls off her horse and hides in a barn. A few moments later the bandits ride by and happen to get into a fight over losing her. One pulls out a gun and in the scuffle unknowingly wings her with a bullet. Minutes later while she's bleeding dangerously close to death Hayden and Dusty just happen to decide to bunk down in the same barn. Dusty discovers some blood and well...That's not even mentioning the little boy who happens to have his own connection to Hayden's past and happens to be associated with the group of baddies who happen to be after the woman and her money and happens to pick just the right moment to lift some bullets from someone's gun...As much as it happens to reek of plot convenience West Of The Divide also offers some memorably weak acting. The father the chief villain the woman all play their roles with wooden stiffness. Even Hayes lacks his typical elan.Wayne by contrast is terrific whether making friends with the boy or delivering some long and pointless exposition to Dusty about how Dusty saved him when he was a boy Anyway it won't do you no good livin' this all over again says Dusty after stringing out Hayden's tale for five long minutes. Wayne also grimaces with believable anger when he catches up with someone he's been after for a long time. Given the material it would have been understandable if Wayne had just gone through the motions but he really inhabits the part. It's a foretaste of what he would do with better roles in the notsodistant future though he didn't always perform as well as this in his Bpicture days.The stunts here are solid too. One involves a man standing on a runaway buckboard as it disintegrates around him maybe the coolest stunt in the whole Wayne run of Lone Star pictures.When I wasn't watching Wayne I was mostly just bored with this. Director Robert N. Bradbury maintains his characteristically slow pace making all the silly fate twists he throws at you easier to notice. The Lone Star pictures were meant for casual viewing and by younger viewers but even with the bar lowered so it seems somehow not quite low enough for this dull oater.For Wayne completists only who want to see him in a rare double role and playing a bad guy too. Just don't go anywhere for the first five minutes. After that though there's little point sticking around.".

Wayne easily slips into the role of Gat Ganns a notorious assassinforhire facing the Hangman's Noose. Though Wayne's Real Life defection to the Dark Side was still a decade away his penchant for Jekyll and Hyde movie roles during the 1930s is as much an indicator of future behavior as Middle Schooler Omar cheering for the hijackers on 911. Preachers discourage us from Playing with Hellfire as Wayne does in WEST OF THE DIVIDE and most of his other early flicks. When Damien fatally runs down his Mommy with his tricycle in the original OMEN it's hard not to think of the babyfaced Wayne in a picture such as DIVIDE cutting his teeth for the deviltry to come in THE ALAMO RIO BRAVO and CHISUM. Perhaps the inevitable 666 birthmark is the reason Wayne never appears shavenheaded in a movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Finally a film that you feel does not purposely play at the collective heartstrings of humanity or jerk you for tears every chance it gets. In spite of its tragic and heartfelt content of a mother reconnecting with her 6yearold daughter after she has been released from prison Sherrybaby moves back into realistic mode and feels truly engaging because of it.Undoubtedly Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance in the film reeks of Oscarbait for it is simply an excellent performance. Sadly I think the academy will overlook 'Sherrybaby' because the film is simply not good enough on its own and the sum of its individual components rarely if ever do justice to its titular actress. However awards are not everything and rest assured that the film still has plenty to offer. In the front row for this is its realistic and unshowy core sewn together by Maggie Gyllenhaal as excon and former teenagemomanddrugaddict Sherry. Upon returning to her old life she finds that it is nothing like she left it. Her daughter Alexis now lives with her brother and his wife Lynette both of whom have become strong parental figures for the young girl much to the dismay and frustration of Sherry who wants nothing more than to rebuild a bond of trust and love with her daughter but who now finds Lynette a barrier.This frustration makes and propels 'Sherrybaby'. It stems from a variety of things that the film touches upon at several points the seedy halfway home Sherry is sent to live at upon her release the trouble she has readjusting herself to society and to work I'll suck your dick if you give me the job I want. her abusive relationship with her father her coping drug addiction and the fact that Lynette is discouraging Alexis from calling Sherry 'mommy'. The film is evenly peppered with these problems but luckily it never tips over into gloominess. What it does most however it plunge bravely into the white trash culture of America junkfood fat people seedy jobs and apartments pinning its scantilyclad centre Sherry somewhere in between.I think Gyllenhaal captures her character with effortless conviction. From the mood swings frustration confused maternal love to the ultimate frailty she translates every component of her wreck of a character with perfect emotional transparency. It all translates into a very real and heartrending performance. Best of all she never falls prey to showiness or exaggerated melodrama she keeps it downtoearth. Soon Sherry turns into a manifestation of the title 'Sherrybaby' as she finds herself sucked back into her teenage life of sorts she craves attention she is helpless she wants to do drugs she sleeps around. All the while she remains on the outside of things looking in because she has been absent for so many years.Certainly all performances in the film hold up pretty well. It is especially interesting to see Danny Trejo in a role in which he is actually nice for a change  a bit of a sleaze true  but still on the side of good as opposed to rentable badguythug. All the interactions between the characters follow the theme of the film it is realistic. But 'Sherrybaby' is not devoid of faults. At all. One of its key shortcomings is its lack of any clear point. You get the feeling most scenes do not serve any purpose other than to give us a feel for the way things are run wow I feel like I'm writing about Scorsese in the white trash culture. There is in this way no clear narrative structure. What is worse is that there is little or no humour to ease the mood and nearly NO music score throughout the film. In fact dissecting the film would probably reveal individual components that could not even pretend to equal the sum of it all. Thankfully Maggie Gyllenhaal elicits so much sympathy as Sherry that it does not really matter.7 out of 10".

They also said that most woman in jail have been sexually or physically abused at sometime in their life. Great job and kudos to all those that worked on this movie!";

Gyllenhaal gives her best performance to date as Sherry a heroin addictthief on parole who struggles to stay clean and rekindle a relationship with her estranged fiveyearold daughter. Everything else in the movie is mediocre at best. The other actors are good but none of them have roles with enough substance for special merits. 'Sherrybaby' is not an easy movie to watch it's painfully realistic and I felt incredibly embarrassed by Gyllenhaal's Sherry throughout the entire film. It's also somewhat predictable. Long story short 'Sherrybaby' would be nothing without Gyllenhaal's groundbreaking and tearjerking performance. Grade B".

When it started and the premise of an addict getting out of jail unraveled I had a sinking feeling in my stomach  like oh one of those movies  yipes! But in every place where it could have been clich and have the wince factor  it didn't. Again and again the script took the subtle approach and it pays off huge in the end. The directing was right on particularly in scenes with minor characters where we just got enough with a quick short set up. Additionally the little girl playing the lead's daughter nearly stole the film in parts. She was something special. This film has the stuff I hope it gets recognized for what it achieved.".

	schema:reviewBody "The rehabilitation of an exconvict can provide juicy stories so this should be no exception as glamorous shortskirted jailbird Sherry Swanson Maggie Gyllenhaal from 'The Secretary' leaves prison yearning desperately to be reunited with her young and very lovable child Alexis. The telling of the story tries hard not to follow conventions and seems to have considerable integrity yet by building high expectations it can almost not fail to charm and disappoint in equal measure.With a beautiful background song 'Some Kind of Heaven' we join Sherry as she starts parole and arrives at a halfway house bible in hand full of excitement and hope. Her character skilfully conveyed by Gyllenhaal alternates between that of a warm charismatic individual and the more archetypical exprisoner. She has worked hard to reform herself during her incarceration kicking drugs studying parenting courses developing her faith and now has a beautiful warm smile that melts cold hearts but just when you might worry about being subjected to an hour and a half of saccharin she snaps when pushed swears copiously threatens a fellow excon that pushes her around and when the employment manager looks set to consign her to waiting tables in a restaurant tells him frankly I'll suck your dick if you give me the job I want. Starting a new life and getting back with her daughter proves hard as events conspire around her. Someone from Sherry's rehab programme recognises her from a strip club where she worked at age 16 her parole officer is hard on her just at the time when she her new dream job starts taking off Alexis' foster parents are rightly cautious about having her around and her father is a pervert. At first she uses sex as a release for her jealousies and frustrations with life but soon progresses to alcohol and worse. Her selfconfidence worn down she realises she is only angry at herself and her inability to cope as well as she would like. Ironically and perhaps with more humour than intended she admits I'm just mad cos I suck. At one point she rejects a down to earth lifechanging programme in favour of her Good Book and sceptics might feel that leaning on religion in this way hardly does her any favours. Sherry's problem is maybe that she wants to 'reform' only to the extent she deems necessary to raise her child but her comprehension of the task facing is like someone looking through a keyhole.Realistic flyonthewall performances prevent Sherrybaby from descending into a sentimental hard luck story. Society feels sympathy for someone in her predicament but society  and also the law  feels even more concern when a defenceless child is caught up in the midst. The task of reintegrating with the outside world may be an almost impossible one and Sherry fights bravely even if we disapprove of some of her methods but the increasing worry  and one that the movie to its credit doesn't dodge  is for the wellbeing of Alexis. Even left to her own devices which she isn't Alexis unable to comprehend the complexity of what's happening around her would probably gravitate to those adults radiating the emotional stability of her foster parents rather than the gushing love coupled with violent verbal or physical outbursts of her real mother. In one scene Sherry violently rebukes a parent who is shaking and berating her son. Whatever the moral justification Alexis is frightened and backs away.Sherrybaby's weakness is that meanders on too long for the amount of underlying plot. Repeated family reunions add little to the story and begin to look like a TV documentary that goes on just slightly past its sellby date. But to its credit it tackles a difficult subject with honesty includes some gutsy performances doesn't flinch from including very believable adult subject matter and is quite enjoyable as long as you don't expect too much.".

Yes she has the stretch marks but really does she deserve the title of mother? And does she love herself? Probably not and maybe that is her biggest problem. It is said that women who are always seeking sex are really seeking a love that they cannot find. One always feels that if only they would pick the right man. But this is an illusion. There is no right man until she is the right woman.Maggie Gyllenhaal does an outstanding job of becoming this woman who is lost in this world without a compass as to how she should behave and why who is lost to everything but her immediate feelings. She is a child emotionally and she cannot understand why it is that life is so hard for her and why the world is so cruel.This is a masterful portrait of a kind of person that is part of humanity.

Into what world does belong? is a question I kept asking myself. I don't know the answer.Laurie Collyer's direction is exquisite. The players and especially the little girl are wonderfully directed. Everything is like the people next door without a hint of anything phony. The contemporary Garden State setting is real and the details and the atmosphere are as genuine as the New Jersey Turnpike. And the ending surprises. It is perfect but in a way that I suspect most viewers will not be able to predict. I know it surprised me.My hat is off to Laurie Collyer and Maggie Gyllenhaal. Thank you for this modest little masterpiece and for not compromising reality or putting in any unnecessary fig leaves or giving in to any notions of political correctness.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the film back in September 2006 and I can still remember what a strong dauntless performance Maggie Gyllenhaal delivered in wd Laurie Collyer's debut film SherryBaby. Yes I believe the young child actor Ryan Simpkins portraying her daughter Alexis is remarkable but Ms. Gyllenhaal's Sherry Swanson character inhabited stays. She was in d Marc Foster's Stranger Than Fiction playing opposite Will Ferrell it's another dependable delivery as expected. To truly appreciate Ms. Gyllenhaal beyond her famed role opposite James Spader in d Steven Shainberg's Secretary 2002 screenplay by Erin Cressida Wilson one really should watch her in SherryBaby. The film appears to be so simply delivered that it's more than meets the eye. Probably not until you discoveredrealized the possible reasons behind her drug habit and what drove Sherry to her irregularirresponsible behaviors displayed it could be difficult to watch the 'destructive' almost hopelessly helpless scenes in the film. Wd Collyer took the risk of not trying to provide palatable or toneddown storyline but gave it to us tough as it should be but thoughtful. It's hard medicine at best with no apology. And hope in spite of it all is what Collyer wants to generate. Hang in there the ending is worth waiting for and I love the ending credit roll song which most of the time I noticed provides the central theme of what the film we just watched When I Find My Life  a song by Marianne Faithful sung by Dana Fuchs 1. The lyrics were spoton describing the sentiments we experienced with Sherry and her family. She is so lucky to have such a caring observant brother Bobby Swanson  a sensitive lowkey performance by Brad William Henke which I appreciate. There are also steady supporting cast from Danny Trejo as 12step veteraneventual friend Dean Giancarlo Esposito as the firm though not without heart Parole Officer Hernandez Bridget Barkan as Bobby's wife Lynette whom Alexis gotten used to and grew to love Samuel Bottoms as Dad Swanson not an easy distinction of the fatherdaughter relationship at first glance. Together filmmaker Laurie Collyer and actor Maggie Gyllenhaal gave us a worthwhile SherryBaby  it may not be pleasant for everyone NFE but it dares  not reticent in telling like it is.This film does remind me of wd Olivier Assayas' Clean 2004 the French production with Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte also about a drugprison rehabilitated mother trying to redeem herself and gain back her son's faith. Available on DVD. Also reminds me of wd Cristina Comencini's Don't Tell 2005 an Italian film aka 'The Beast in the Heart' involves a sisterbrother supportive relationship of similar topic. SherryBaby is by far grittier in its depiction and the tumultuous emotional journey complete.1 The lyrics of the song When I Find My Life is available online. Such poignant words 'Oh i will free the bird in me Oh when i find my life. What i always knew could be Oh when i find my life.' 'I will see the truth in me' 'I will let go the pain' 'I will reach beyond the strain' 'Fear of lost and fear of pain'. Enter for search lyrics when I find my life  and you should get results to Marianne Faithful lyrics.".

There are also steady supporting cast from Danny Trejo as 12step veteraneventual friend Dean Giancarlo Esposito as the firm though not without heart Parole Officer Hernandez Bridget Barkan as Bobby's wife Lynette whom Alexis gotten used to and grew to love Samuel Bottoms as Dad Swanson not an easy distinction of the fatherdaughter relationship at first glance. Together filmmaker Laurie Collyer and actor Maggie Gyllenhaal gave us a worthwhile SherryBaby  it may not be pleasant for everyone NFE but it dares  not reticent in telling like it is.This film does remind me of wd Olivier Assayas' Clean 2004 the French production with Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte also about a drugprison rehabilitated mother trying to redeem herself and gain back her son's faith. Available on DVD. Also reminds me of wd Cristina Comencini's Don't Tell 2005 an Italian film aka 'The Beast in the Heart' involves a sisterbrother supportive relationship of similar topic. SherryBaby is by far grittier in its depiction and the tumultuous emotional journey complete.1 The lyrics of the song When I Find My Life is available online. Such poignant words 'Oh i will free the bird in me Oh when i find my life. What i always knew could be Oh when i find my life.' 'I will see the truth in me' 'I will let go the pain' 'I will reach beyond the strain' 'Fear of lost and fear of pain'.

The story may not be entirely original but I think that's a strength because it's the telling of the story through each of the characters that makes it an achievement. Seldom does a film have such strong protagonists and antagonists and allow viewers to really empathize with each. I enjoyed seeing the raw tension between the characters who could relate to personally as my family participated in the Foster Care system for many years growing up. I think some may want to see more of a definitive ending but for me it's more about the journey and the struggles therein.I would recommend this movie for those who want to see a seemingly familiar story told in a unique way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Maggie Gyllenhaal emerges as an undeniably powerful actress in the title role of this lowbudget 2006 indie. Rather than providing her usual scenestealing turn she gets to convey the nuances of a fullblown character by delivering an astonishing range of emotion as a struggling exconvict. The film reminds me quite a bit of Ulu Grosbard's overlooked 1978 Straight Time in which Dustin Hoffman plays a paroled exburglar who cannot shake his former life. Both provide incisive looks into the hardscrabble existence of people trying desperately to reform but in doing so the stories become so desultory and the situations start to have a bythenumbers feeling that the dramatic momentum dissipates toward their inevitable conclusions.Directed and written by Laurie Collyer the film takes an unflinching look at Sherry Swanson a former heroin addict just released on parole after three years in prison for robbery. Returning home to New Jersey she is desperate to stay clean and sober in order to reclaim her young daughter Alexis from her sympathetic brother Bobby and his conflicted wife Lynette. Without drugs Sherry's addictive behavior manifests itself in cigarettes alcohol and emboldened sexual acts to get what she needs. Yet her biggest addiction is her relentless pursuit of an idealized image of herself as a mother and it is her disconnect with reality that produces the film's most poignant moments. Otherwise the movie gets increasingly frustrating to watch because Collyer provides only hints of what Sherry brought her to her dilemma. What we see mainly are flashes of shorttempered narcissism when we see people understandably looking to emotionally disengage from her including her indiscriminate father.There are some surprisingly graphic scenes that show how Sherry uses her shopworn beauty as emotional armor when Collyer could have better used them to underline her melancholy mental state. In the face of these script shortcomings Gyllenhaal displays enough dexterity to fill in a lot of the blanks especially when she shows how Sherry starts realizing the depth of her accountability for her problems. Brad William Henke provides solid support as Bobby as does Bridget Barkan as Lynette Danny Trejo as a supportive fellow addict Giancarlo Esposito as Sherry's hardened parole officer and ebullient little Ryan Simpkins as Alexis. I have to admit I could not wait for the 96minute movie to be over but it is worthwhile for Gyllenhaal's courageous work as it is she who holds the film together. Sadly the 2007 DVD does not contains any significant extras a commentary from Gyllenhaal and Collyer would have been most welcome other than the trailer.".

Yeah Sherry should not try to sleep with the group leader yeah Sherry should reign in her anger around her daughter yeah Sherry should not relapse and shoot up yeah Sherry should find happiness within herself and not be constantly seeking others' especially Alexis' approval.I do not believe that Sherry's character is a victim however I saw that she did not have the same tools as the adults around her. The fact that she had been using drugs heavily since she was a teenager explains why she is unable to act appropriately in social situations being that mental and emotion growth is stunted once one becomes an addict. This is also why you see her rely on her sexuality to get what she wants and you see her get angry and lash out she hasn't learned any other way. Additionally it's clear she's simply illprepared for the world around her shown nicely in the opening scene where it's rainy and cold outside and she's wearing a tank top and short skirt.It is likely that if there were more of a back story explained we would see Sherry's father sexually assaulting her when she was young and also her mother dying. These things were probably what would have led her to drugs as a coping mechanism.My point is if her family and program coordinators gave Sherry the respect she deserved as a human being they'd be giving her a jump start into the world of taking care of herself and her child. They would not have to give up custody of Alexis however they could give Sherry fair chances to prove that she deserves to raise her daughter eventually over time probably still with their help.Sherry ends up figuring it out. Whether it was the support of Dean or just her rationale catching up with her she triumphs at the end of the film by doing what is best for her daughter and ultimately herself.I thought it was a beautiful and heartfelt performance by Maggie Gyllenhaal.

	schema:headline " Not preachy and naked Maggie Gyllenhaal!";
	schema:reviewBody "Here's what I liked about Sherrybaby1. Maggie Gyllenhaal gives an effective appealing performance and gets somewhat naked. 2. The movie manages to just avoid happilyeverafter clichs. 3. There are subtle hints to the backstory rather than obvious manipulations.But it's not really enough. There are plenty of scenes in the movie that just seem to lag a bit as if something might poke through the ennui and stir things up but not really. So color this one as a halfstep above the usual womanmakingitrightwhenshe'sdonesowrong movie. But only a halfstep.Sherry Swanson Gyllenhaal is out of prison after doing a stretch for robbery and drugs and basic slutty scummy behavior. We first see her arrive at the halfway house at which she's to spend the rest of her sentence. Ah she's finally out and she's going to do the right thing this time you'll see! You can almost see her eyes twinkle. Sherry has a daughter she hasn't seen since she was in stir named Alexis. Alexis has been cared for lo these many years by Sherry brother Bob and his wife Lynnette. Bob picks Sherry up at the halfway house and brings her to his house for the reunion and of course Alexis is excited to see a new person who smothers her in attention. But it's not long before young Alexis is calling her Sherry instead of Mommy which Sherry takes as a sign that Bob and Lynnette are trying to take her baby away from her. As if they needed to try Sherry's not gonna get custody anytime soon.Sherry also tangles with her parole officer played with some gusto by Giancarlo Esposito who isn't going to cut her much slack. Which is just as well because pretty much every other guy in the movie somehow succumbs to Sherry's charms and does what she wants. It's when she doesn't get her way that things go all pissy. See Sherry's not really what you'd call proactive she expects things to work out for her without her doing any of the work. So to speed things along she takes certain immoral shortcuts. In fact after watching the first thirty minutes or so I thought I'd put in a porno by mistake. I mean I thought I'd been sent the wrong disk by Netflix. Yeah that. Anyway the pattern seemed to be 1 Decide to do something. 2 Approach male who could facilitate that. 3 Have sex with male. 4 Repeat if necessary.So far so good  Sherry isn't a completely new person when she emerges from the clink and that at least feels realistic because how often are excons completely rehabilitated and never do anything wrong ever again? Probably not very many. Forget recidivism because that includes only those who got caught. At any rate Sherry's still a slut. And prone to profanity as she doesn't mind dropping fbombs in front of her kid who she's trying to win over.Then you have the eventual relapse and visits to a support group and new friends. But this isn't a hugsandkisses kind of movie  even though Sherry holds hands with everyone in the group and pledges to be free of her demons we all know she might never and we question her commitment to same. That's fine because in reality it's an extremely difficult undertaking and to me if she'd overcome everything too easily all similarity to reality would be out the door. But director Laurie Collyer played it straight giving the film a good boost of authenticity.Movies like this usually aren't my bag at all. If I wanted to see a movie about a bad girl making her way in the world I'd turn on Lifetime. Oh sure I know there's an audience for strong independent women but clearly I'm not it. So I didn't expect this to be all that wonderful I'd just heard that Gyllenhaal was good in it. And I like her. And she was. Plus she got naked! So for those positives it's not too bad of a movie. A bit grim in spots and it's very gritty  drug use sex language all make appearances. Still it IS a wellmade film about a strong independent woman who doesn't have all of the answers.".

	onyx:emotionText "Here's what I liked about Sherrybaby1. Maggie Gyllenhaal gives an effective appealing performance and gets somewhat naked. 2. The movie manages to just avoid happilyeverafter clichs. 3. There are subtle hints to the backstory rather than obvious manipulations.But it's not really enough. There are plenty of scenes in the movie that just seem to lag a bit as if something might poke through the ennui and stir things up but not really. So color this one as a halfstep above the usual womanmakingitrightwhenshe'sdonesowrong movie. But only a halfstep.Sherry Swanson Gyllenhaal is out of prison after doing a stretch for robbery and drugs and basic slutty scummy behavior. We first see her arrive at the halfway house at which she's to spend the rest of her sentence. Ah she's finally out and she's going to do the right thing this time you'll see! You can almost see her eyes twinkle. Sherry has a daughter she hasn't seen since she was in stir named Alexis. Alexis has been cared for lo these many years by Sherry brother Bob and his wife Lynnette. Bob picks Sherry up at the halfway house and brings her to his house for the reunion and of course Alexis is excited to see a new person who smothers her in attention. But it's not long before young Alexis is calling her Sherry instead of Mommy which Sherry takes as a sign that Bob and Lynnette are trying to take her baby away from her. As if they needed to try Sherry's not gonna get custody anytime soon.Sherry also tangles with her parole officer played with some gusto by Giancarlo Esposito who isn't going to cut her much slack. Which is just as well because pretty much every other guy in the movie somehow succumbs to Sherry's charms and does what she wants. It's when she doesn't get her way that things go all pissy. See Sherry's not really what you'd call proactive she expects things to work out for her without her doing any of the work. So to speed things along she takes certain immoral shortcuts. In fact after watching the first thirty minutes or so I thought I'd put in a porno by mistake. I mean I thought I'd been sent the wrong disk by Netflix. Yeah that. Anyway the pattern seemed to be 1 Decide to do something. 2 Approach male who could facilitate that. 3 Have sex with male. 4 Repeat if necessary.So far so good  Sherry isn't a completely new person when she emerges from the clink and that at least feels realistic because how often are excons completely rehabilitated and never do anything wrong ever again? Probably not very many. Forget recidivism because that includes only those who got caught. At any rate Sherry's still a slut. And prone to profanity as she doesn't mind dropping fbombs in front of her kid who she's trying to win over.Then you have the eventual relapse and visits to a support group and new friends.

	schema:reviewBody "I decided to watch this movie not only because of the main protagonist Maggie Gyllenhaal but also because of the theme from which I assumed that the film has to do with a very sensitive issue not so much with drug addiction and get into society again but more importantly trying to reunite with your own child and build trust. Rejection from your own family more specific from your own child is one of the worst things that can happen to a parent it seems an unending torture especially when the child is too young to understand completely and sometimes can be easily confused with what is going on.It is a sad story about an exdrug addict who after some time in prison gets back in town clean and willing to stay that way dedicate herself to her one and only daughter. There are some important things that I want to say in this review and that actually are the reasons why this movie must not mislead you into being sad or emotional about the poor mother that life tore her apart.When the movie ended I was emotionally affected from the whole story and from Gyllenhaal's acting. There is no doubt that she masterfully moved the audience with her performance. But... If someone take a more careful look in every frame of the film he will notice that in the second half of the movie there is a scene that explains all they why's of the situations.Why Sherry did drugs when she was young? Why Sherry was a bit aggressive with other people sometimes even with her own daughter? Why Sherry lost control of everything and went to jail? Before that specific scene when Sherry goes at her father's house where she founds her father her brother her brother's wife and her little girl throwing a birthday party for her daughter there is another scene when for the first time after she's out of jail her father comes for a visit in her brother's house. She is so happy to see him extremely happy. She hugs him she kisses him in the mouth she tries to get his attention with laughing and saying or doing crazy things jump on the couch or sing in the dinner table. Plus her father is remarried with another woman and she is there also.It was strange indeed and it might have caught viewer's attention but with the scene in the end it all makes sense after all. This scene uncovers the truth to the audience and directs us to believe that the reason why Sherry is in this terrible path is the relationship with his own father that he assaulted her sexually obviously from a young age we understand that from the comfort he has to touch her breasts in his son's house and that he destroyed her life. The End.So the female director of this movie wants to reproduce a certain meaning of the figure of the father the silence of his son while he is watching his own father sexually harass his daughter and lead the viewer to a consistent pattern the one which family is violent to the children a real catastrophe. It is very easy to do so it is very easy to manipulate the thoughts and the unconscious of the viewer to this result. Why? Because the role of the father in the family hardly exists we only see him from a distance there are no further explanations or scenes that analyze his character or his relationship with his daughter. The scene of the sexual assault is a raw crude resort.Very bad things have happened to Sherry and we know who we have to blame for it. When she sees her father for the first time she is so happy she does not seem to bother at all with his presence or his behavior. And when he finally is alone with her and touch her she runs far away and she needs desperately her dose. Someone might not think of this but it is a cheap solution to put the blame on one of her family members and use the pattern that in our days is so usual in everyday life.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sherrybaby 2006An almost literal slice of life and highly believable. Maggie Gyllenhaal is everything here and she acts her heart out. Which is to say she makes her part so convincing in the nuances and lack of glamor utterly she becomes the character Sherry a former junkie just released from jail. It's a story of her trying to find the dignity and frankly intelligence to cope and to reintegrate. Around her is a fairly ordinary world and she uses sex and a little pent up anger to wend her way between her parole officers her sisterinlaw her halfway house roomies and a new friend or two. Key to all this is Sherry's little girl who she clearly loves. But she doesn't have a clue how to be a mother.This must be a painfully common story and the one drawback is the events float in their sliceoflife as if that's sufficient. It is convincing but by halfway through it starts to become clear that there is in fact no story at all. It's just going to be the meandering of this young woman barely dressed in every scene never seeing herself for how other people see her in one big heartbreak. It has an ending a kind of denouement but it's very slight. So this is easy to recommend try the first ten minutes. If you like getting absorbed and don't mind that getting absorbed is the only point then go for it. Gyllenhaal is a wonder and the cast around her is right on. Director Laurie Collyer is someone to watch. When she gets more cinematically narrative and transforming material she might pull off a more lasting masterpiece. This is her first fullfledged film after a wellregarded HBO movie and it's very smartly made.".

The film is a notch above something you'd see on Lifetime but all the credit has to go to Gyllenhaal and director Laurie Collyer. Collyer's direction is nice and suttle with her screenplay that's not too original but what's there is brought to life by the very good performance from Gyllenhaal.

	schema:headline " Needs much more than just a good performance to make it watchable";
	schema:reviewBody "I wanted to like SherryBaby. I really did. I like Maggie Gyllenhaal and I like good acting. I was lead to believe that the film had both. But after watching it sadly this is about the only two things it has.SherryBaby is about Sherry Gyllenhaal a former drug addict who is fresh from jail and trying to restart her life. Besides trying to become a better person she wants to reconnect with her young daughter who has been living with her brother and sisterinlaw while she was in prison. But it appears that the road may be a little harder than she first thought.Right from the start you can tell the film really does not want to try anything complicated. It is a straight story of a woman seeking redemption for her past woes. We have seen this kind of film time and time again but every piece of advertising tends to lead us into believing this film is different.But it isn't.With a short ninetysix minute running time SherryBaby is a totally ambiguous mess of ideas that never come to fruition. You know that writer director Laurie Collyer is really trying to make something of this classically themed story but it looks like she just wanted to keep it as short and to the point as possible. That means every direction the film wants to take by bringing up past issues new characters and possible ideas for her absolutely dire need for drugs is never explored. It is strictly mentioned poked and prodded at and then is left for the viewer to decide what to do with it. What is the point of throwing indiscernible material at us if it is never explored? They cannot and this is the key problem. The film obviously wants to build an extreme amount of pathos for Sherry and for her situation. We want her to be a better person and the film suggests that she wants to be as well. But the character is lazy and wavering much like the film. It stays in the one viewpoint and it never lets us really get a taste of who Sherry is. How am I as a viewer supposed to feel for such an idiosyncratic person? How is it fair to pass judgment and assumptions on the woman if I never really know who she is the first place? How is it fair for the filmmakers to pass this off as a complete film when in reality it is so messily put together and runs around in circles? For all of these questions comes a simple answer you cannot. It just simply does not have the needed material to even attempt it. The haphazard story needs more than just Sherry walking around and falling into silly sexual situations with just about every man she encounters short of her own brother. It needs some reasoning for her actions not just a quick skip and a hop to piece together situations mindlessly. It needs some genuine human emotion from more than Sherry. It needs actual real characters for her to interact with not stereotypical archetypes perfected in far better films. It needs to do more than just set up for a good performance from the lead character. Movies like Ray Monster The Last King of Scotland and Capote actually had stories and decent supporting actors to back up their Oscarwinning leads. They actually gave their actors something to work with alongside themselves. Yes they completely blow away everything in sight with their brilliant acting but at least they had something to compete against. SherryBaby gives Gyllenhaal herself to compete against and nothing else.For all of my ranting on the terrible film it is mildly watchable because of Gyllenhaal. She breathes life into a terribly underwritten lead and makes her real and not onedimensional like everyone else. You can see her reaching for an emotional chord around every twisty turn of her performance and you know that she is really trying. But the material gives her very little to really do unlike those Academy Award winning roles that gave the actors a whole ton of things they could possibly do. She feels very held back and her genuinely naked work here both figuratively and literally is shadowed by how weak of a film she is working within.The rest of the supporting cast can really not be spoken for. They do basically nothing but help advance the plot. Each and every one of them has something to offer Gyllenhaal's character but none of them really do anything more. They simply offer a mild side story that could have made the film stronger and longer. Danny Trejo one of my favourite Robert Rodriquez goto guys turns in a peculiar performance but only because he seems to be the only one besides Gyllenhaal really trying to make something of the material. And because all of the supporting characters are even more underwritten than the lead you will probably barely notice his work here which is so unlike anything I have ever seen him do.This is a movie that needed much more than a good performance to make it passable. If Sherry was any other young female actress I doubt this film would even vaguely need to be seen by anyone. But because Gyllenhaal gives the character some real life attributes people actually took notice of the movie. Sadly other than her the film only serves one other person to show reasoning for how a bad movie could have been made better. It offers far too many examples and leaves too many things ambiguous. It needed more and sadly will never receive that treatment.510.".

Besides trying to become a better person she wants to reconnect with her young daughter who has been living with her brother and sisterinlaw while she was in prison. But it appears that the road may be a little harder than she first thought.Right from the start you can tell the film really does not want to try anything complicated. It is a straight story of a woman seeking redemption for her past woes. We have seen this kind of film time and time again but every piece of advertising tends to lead us into believing this film is different.But it isn't.With a short ninetysix minute running time SherryBaby is a totally ambiguous mess of ideas that never come to fruition. You know that writer director Laurie Collyer is really trying to make something of this classically themed story but it looks like she just wanted to keep it as short and to the point as possible. That means every direction the film wants to take by bringing up past issues new characters and possible ideas for her absolutely dire need for drugs is never explored. It is strictly mentioned poked and prodded at and then is left for the viewer to decide what to do with it. What is the point of throwing indiscernible material at us if it is never explored? They cannot and this is the key problem. The film obviously wants to build an extreme amount of pathos for Sherry and for her situation. We want her to be a better person and the film suggests that she wants to be as well. But the character is lazy and wavering much like the film. It stays in the one viewpoint and it never lets us really get a taste of who Sherry is. How am I as a viewer supposed to feel for such an idiosyncratic person? How is it fair to pass judgment and assumptions on the woman if I never really know who she is the first place? How is it fair for the filmmakers to pass this off as a complete film when in reality it is so messily put together and runs around in circles? For all of these questions comes a simple answer you cannot. It just simply does not have the needed material to even attempt it. The haphazard story needs more than just Sherry walking around and falling into silly sexual situations with just about every man she encounters short of her own brother. It needs some reasoning for her actions not just a quick skip and a hop to piece together situations mindlessly. It needs some genuine human emotion from more than Sherry. It needs actual real characters for her to interact with not stereotypical archetypes perfected in far better films. It needs to do more than just set up for a good performance from the lead character. Movies like Ray Monster The Last King of Scotland and Capote actually had stories and decent supporting actors to back up their Oscarwinning leads. They actually gave their actors something to work with alongside themselves. Yes they completely blow away everything in sight with their brilliant acting but at least they had something to compete against. SherryBaby gives Gyllenhaal herself to compete against and nothing else.For all of my ranting on the terrible film it is mildly watchable because of Gyllenhaal. She breathes life into a terribly underwritten lead and makes her real and not onedimensional like everyone else. You can see her reaching for an emotional chord around every twisty turn of her performance and you know that she is really trying. But the material gives her very little to really do unlike those Academy Award winning roles that gave the actors a whole ton of things they could possibly do. She feels very held back and her genuinely naked work here both figuratively and literally is shadowed by how weak of a film she is working within.The rest of the supporting cast can really not be spoken for. They do basically nothing but help advance the plot. Each and every one of them has something to offer Gyllenhaal's character but none of them really do anything more. They simply offer a mild side story that could have made the film stronger and longer. Danny Trejo one of my favourite Robert Rodriquez goto guys turns in a peculiar performance but only because he seems to be the only one besides Gyllenhaal really trying to make something of the material. And because all of the supporting characters are even more underwritten than the lead you will probably barely notice his work here which is so unlike anything I have ever seen him do.This is a movie that needed much more than a good performance to make it passable. If Sherry was any other young female actress I doubt this film would even vaguely need to be seen by anyone. But because Gyllenhaal gives the character some real life attributes people actually took notice of the movie. Sadly other than her the film only serves one other person to show reasoning for how a bad movie could have been made better. It offers far too many examples and leaves too many things ambiguous. It needed more and sadly will never receive that treatment.510.";

Bravo.The movie itself was also amazing. The druggiemomtriestoredeemherself plot is somewhat clich but I enjoy the way Sherrybaby plays it out. A cast of relative unknowns save Gyllenhaal carries it out perfectly it is truly an actordriven film. Seeing Sherry grasp at straws to stay clean simultaneously vying for the affection of her daughter of her sister in law was truly heartbreaking. This film is a mustsee for anyone who is a parent anyone who is a child anyone who has ever struggled and anyone who roots for the underdog.".
