	schema:reviewBody "Paris Texas is a slow moody and delicate study about a man who once ran away from everything and now is coming to terms with himself and learning to forgive himself by finally facing he people he turned his back on. The Wim Wenders directed movie still today rests in a fairly under recognized status which doesn't stretch the term cult classic when applied to it. Paris Texas is about redemption the road family and the bleakness of the American Southwest. It contains one of the most memorable and unusual openings ever. We hear Ry Cooder's lonely single note twangy guitar on the soundtrack with cinematographer Robby Mller Barfly To Live and Die in L.A.  Dead Man capturing the majestic vistas rock formations and the open desert in his camera. Actor Harry Dean Stanton walks out of the dry and desolate landscape wearing a wornout black sports jacket and dusty red baseball cap. It's a beautifully staged opening sequence. A perfect start to a perfect movie. This man is lost and in need of being found. It's his brother played by actor Dean Stockwell Quantum Leap Blue Velvet who gets word of Stanton's whereabouts and goes after him which begins the journey of redemption. Nastassja Kinski plays Stanton's young xwife and the true love of his life. Kinski the daughter of legendary German actor Klaus Kinski doesn't make her entrance into the film until the later reels but her lingering presence is felt throughout. It's almost the same type of thing that Coppola did by not having Brando appear in Apocalypse Now until the conclusion. The scenes that Kinski does have in the end with Stanton are some of the best moments ever captured on film. They're highly emotional and will cause even the most hardhearted to shed a tear. Both Stanton and Kinski are very subtle and understated in their acting. It's true to their characters. Eight year old Hunter Carson plays Stanton's biological son who was raised by his uncle Stockwell. Carson certainly deserves mention in any conversation about great child performances on film. Paris Texas is a masterpiece. There's no way around it. It's a movie that slowly reveals itself putting the audience right in the shoes of Stanton who also is trying to remember his past and face it. The story was penned by playwright and actor Sam Shepard though he doesn't appear in the film. Shepard a very good playwright has outdone himself with Paris Texas surpassing his perhaps more well known True West. Paris Texas is a film that must not only be seen but experienced. Sure the pacing is extremely slow but as an audience member use that to your advantage to suck in the picturesque orange southwest desert against the deep blue skys and the poignant acting and haunting soundtrack. There's no reason not to treat yourself to this uniquely American masterpiece meditation. It would make a great nightcap for a triple feature with two other simular themed American films The Searchers and Taxi Driver.".

	schema:reviewBody "I would say that Paris Texas is not for everyone but truly that can be said about every movie. But I will say this fans of methodically paced beautifully shot existentially rooted and purely experiential cinema will not be disappointed. Paris Texas is virtually my favorite movie and a movie that whether you like it or not will leave some impact on you. It is a journey an experience an odyssey. Yes it is long. Yes it is slow. Defined plot points? Please.But what this movie does do is place into the mind of it's lead character. Travis Henderson an older man gruff and worn out with age wanders out of the Texas desert after missing from his family for four years. He is mute and apparently unaware of who he is. His brother Walt finds him and tries to rehabilitate him back into sanity. The film then covers Travis's journey to reconnect with a past which he has long since forgotten. He reunites with his son his sister inlaw and eventually in a scene which I tear up just thinking about his wife.But that is all I will divulge about his wife. That is a scene which you really have to see to believe. While this film really doesn't rely on plot it does have structure and tone. And what carries us through this mystical story is the unbelievably beautiful photography. We see the world as it should be seen a starkly beautiful but uncompromising place. The use of color and motifs really makes this film a marvel to look at. And then we get to performances. Everyone's great so I will focus on our two truly main characters. Harry Dean Stanton plays Travis a gentle kind man that despite having personal demons is a great fatherly figure fine maybe he isn't the best father...but there's no denying he left an impact on his son's life. And seeing Stanton bring this character to life in the most subtle and somber way possible is amazing. And then we have Natassja Kinski who plays Jane his wife. She doesn't show up until the third act and 95 percent of her performance takes place in one room. But Kinski's portrayal of emotion...and her quiet yet powerful demeanor...and the way she talks...god it's unbelievable. Stanton and Kinski have some of the best chemistry ever which is even more impressive considering they're never in the same room see the movie...you'll understand. In the end these two carry the movie on their backs and do an amazing job doing it.You may not cry but you will think about crying. You will think about all the sad moments in your life. And it will all be washed out of you by movie's end. Believe me I know this from personal experience. This movie is almost therapeutic in the way. Because the story is healing our own souls at the same time as it is healing Travis's. So. What's more to say about Paris Texas? It's a beautiful movie one that relies on photography and performances to tell it's story and a movie that portrays emotions on a master class level. And what do I mean by 'AntiRomance'? It's not worth explaining here. See the movie you'll understand.".

After not having watched it for years I've played it again a few times over the last couple of years.  Many movies I recall having liked in the past are just big disappointments when I watch them years later.  That's not the case with this one!  Then I was single now I'm married.  That alone makes a big difference but I also find that even some small elements now have more meaning.  I previously attached no significance to the scene where Travis was determined to find the same rental car in which he and Walt had previously driven.  But how often people do sentimentally and fiercely cling to objectively unimportant things in reaction to having had their hearts and spirits broken more than a few times over important things.  I often recall this scene when observing some instance of this in myself or others.I am struck by what opposite opinions people have of this movie.  If you have few problems relating to other people or you don't care much about relating to other humans and little in your life disappoints you over long spells of your life you will probably find this movie very boring. I sort of envy people in this situation though before I would want to wish myself to be like that I pause at how much my life would be changed and how little of my personality would be left if I did.I too eagerly await the release of this movie on high quality DVD and hope that my still barely viewable Beta will last til then.Oh Travis.".

	schema:headline " Unique portrait at family life in early 'eighties America.";
	schema:reviewBody "Paris Texas is by far one of the best films ever made. It's a wellphotographed film it's almost like a portrait. In the center you have the characters Travis Walt Hunter Jane and Anne and all around them you see the desert and the empty space and the places they inhabit. The major characters are all memorable especially Harry Dean Stanton as Travis and Dean Stockwell as Walt.The film is about reunion. The first third of the film dealing with the reunion of brothers Travis and Walt in the Texas desert is both very touching and very real. You can sense the frustration on Walt's face when Travis doesn't want to talk to him about anything and throughout the road trip you begin to get more interested in Travis' ramblings to Walt about Paris Texas. The second third deals with the reunion of Travis with his son Hunter and to a lesser extent since he's only been gone for less than a week the reunion of Walt with his wife Anna and Hunter. This is by far my favorite part of the film because it shows a young boy Hunter trying to readjust after his father returns after a fouryear absence. Hunter by the way he's a great actor is nice to Travis at first but refuses to walk home from school with him because Everyone drives. The fact that director Wim Wenders focuses on this little portion of the film shows true family lifeit expands the little sin that Hunter has done. This event sets up perhaps my favorite scene in any film Hunter and Travis walking home togetheron opposite sides of the streetwith the boy mimicking the movements of his real father. In the following scene I'm touched because the neighborhood reminds me of homeHunter stops and allows his father to cross the street to join him. There is also a scene also with no dialogue that deserves mentionthe family watching Super 8mm film of a family fishing trip. Here we see Jane for the first time a beauty and we get a portrait of the happy family while the film plays background music for us. It's a wonderful scene that's executed beautifully. The film of the fishing trip allows Hunter to make an observation to Anne about his fatherhe sees by the way Travis looked at Jane that Travis still loves her very much.The last third of the film comes as a real shock and I won't spoil it for anyone because this third of the film is what made me REALLY love the entire film. The sequence of events in the final third actually came out of left field because I was never really expecting that. You should have figured out though that there is a reunion between Travis and his estranged wife Jane. Harry Dean Stanton's monologue is perhaps one of the best ever caught on film. It's really long but you hear every word and every pause. And what I like about that particular scene is the lightingnotice how the sunlight comes in through the window in Jane's room and suddenly near the end you realize that it's been artificial light after all. There is a similar lighting effect in A Clockwork Orangeduring Alex's chat with F. Alexander and his two coconspirators over wine and spaghetti.Overall Paris Texas is a great film that should be noted both for its photography and for its realistic look at family life. These are people who are a real familyopinionated angry happy sad melodramatic judgmental highstrung incommunicado etc. They refuse sometimes to admit their true feelings and that is exactly what makes a family a family sometimes the fact that you can't say what you really want to say at a certain time.This is the kind of film directors really want to makesmall realistic poignant...and with zero special effects.".

Hunter by the way he's a great actor is nice to Travis at first but refuses to walk home from school with him because Everyone drives. The fact that director Wim Wenders focuses on this little portion of the film shows true family lifeit expands the little sin that Hunter has done. This event sets up perhaps my favorite scene in any film Hunter and Travis walking home togetheron opposite sides of the streetwith the boy mimicking the movements of his real father. In the following scene I'm touched because the neighborhood reminds me of homeHunter stops and allows his father to cross the street to join him. There is also a scene also with no dialogue that deserves mentionthe family watching Super 8mm film of a family fishing trip. Here we see Jane for the first time a beauty and we get a portrait of the happy family while the film plays background music for us. It's a wonderful scene that's executed beautifully. The film of the fishing trip allows Hunter to make an observation to Anne about his fatherhe sees by the way Travis looked at Jane that Travis still loves her very much.The last third of the film comes as a real shock and I won't spoil it for anyone because this third of the film is what made me REALLY love the entire film. The sequence of events in the final third actually came out of left field because I was never really expecting that. You should have figured out though that there is a reunion between Travis and his estranged wife Jane. Harry Dean Stanton's monologue is perhaps one of the best ever caught on film. It's really long but you hear every word and every pause. And what I like about that particular scene is the lightingnotice how the sunlight comes in through the window in Jane's room and suddenly near the end you realize that it's been artificial light after all. There is a similar lighting effect in A Clockwork Orangeduring Alex's chat with F. Alexander and his two coconspirators over wine and spaghetti.Overall Paris Texas is a great film that should be noted both for its photography and for its realistic look at family life. These are people who are a real familyopinionated angry happy sad melodramatic judgmental highstrung incommunicado etc. They refuse sometimes to admit their true feelings and that is exactly what makes a family a family sometimes the fact that you can't say what you really want to say at a certain time.This is the kind of film directors really want to makesmall realistic poignant...and with zero special effects.";

The scene where Stanton confronts his wife and tells what he did and why he did it must rank among the supreme scenes not just of film but of human life.

	schema:headline " The Continued Development of the Dark Romance with Cinema";
	schema:reviewBody "Directed by cinematic lyricist Wim Wenders Paris Texas is a slowburning masterpiece. Marked at first by stark beautiful photography of the American Southwest later by memorable dialogue and conversational intercourse and lastly by sublime and emotionally involving character development the film transcends the idea of an atmospheric mood piece to deliver an engrossing meditation on loneliness alienation family and redemption.Character actor Harry Dean Stanton is fantastic in the lead role of Travis  a man who had fallen into an emotional black hole and is then reunited with his brother Dean Stockwell who has been raising Travis' young son Hunter Hunter Carson in an idyllic and loving suburban landscape with his foreign wife Ann Aurore Clement. As Travis slowly begins to grapple with his past and bond with his son he soon realizes he must find his long lost wife Jane an excellent and understated Nastassja Kinksi whom he still deeply loves on some level and abandoned their son years ago shortly after Travis went off the deep end.This all could've been the plot of Lifetime TV movie but the European filmmaker's perspective on an all American slice of melodrama adds an undercurrent of intrigue in that you never know what these characters are going to do next. We soon find Travis practically abducting his son who eagerly plays along from his happy new family life to go on a trek to Houston to find Jane.The closing in scene in a Houston hotel where son and mother are reunited is one of the most fascinatingly rich scenes ever put on screen. Rarely does any one scene work to engage a viewer on so many levels Firstly There is a complex psychological framework that is set into place in the scenes prior between Stanton and Kinski in the peep show booth where she now works which are two of the most expertly photographed and brilliantly acted scenes I've ever witnessed. Travis has confessed all to his lost love Jane and she is clearly in dire straits. His attempt to reunite her with their son is both selfish in that it is clearly not in the child's best interest to be raised by his emotionally troubled mother when he has loving foster parents waiting for him back home and selfless in that he truly feels his only way to repair the damage he has done is to leave after getting mother and son back together.Secondly It is beautifully acted with Kinski's ghostlike entrance and young Hunter Carson's trepidation. Witness his hand slide across the wall looking for something to grip and then his hands running through his hair before he finally decides to embrace her.Thirdly It is exquisitely photographed. Earlier we see scenes of stark isolation as the child waits in the hotel room. Sofia Coppola later used a similar photographic technique in Lost in Translation to show how being alone in a big city and looking down from an anonymous hotel room window can be one of the loneliest things in the world.The final scene is both beautiful and emotional and at the same time makes the viewer wonder how will this all end? Yes it is wonderful to see the child and mother reunite but their new life could easily turn into an emotional hell because of the now absent Travis' misguided attempt at his own redemption.A film working on so many levels like this is best summed up in its own dialogue. In one scene where Travis is drunk and telling his son some family history he essentially says that his father was more in love with an idea of her than with his actual mother. This is a fantastic movie for people more in love with the romantic idea of movies and their potential power as an art form than with any one movie in particular. As such this ranks among the best I have ever seen.".

Wenders achieves his high technical and vision point concerning his way of thinking not just film but life in this masterpiece.He had before discussed the production of images and how this affects our way of seeing and perceiving life.

The landscapes are so important as the words or actions between the characters are it really touches people surrounded by it it influences some how their personalities. I mean each photograme tries to bring this relation.It is beautiful how Wenders can build his caracters personalities not by the way they think or act but what impresses them what visually interests them  like when Travis is watching not the airplane but its shadow on the ground while it takes off.After all that i can just say that the rest of the whole story is made by really beautiful touching and delicate situations of a man's life trying to reorder the lost pieces from a puzzle.And yes the conversation between Travis and his exwife by the last half hour to the end is one of the most touching moments seen on the screen.".

The lead character Travis is an older man who in the first ten minutes of the film wonders alone in the desert like a horse with no name seemingly suffering from severe trauma. But Travis' later behavior and the behavior of other characters in the film are not believable given this opening gambit.However if we discard our need to interpret behavior rationally then the film works either as a dream or more generically as a parable of modern day America from the viewpoint of a European film director. The characters and their journey through the film's story are symbolic of American culture as a whole with its everpresent loneliness urban alienation emotional separation and general rootlessness.The film's visuals and music combine to prop up the thin story and give the film its enduring cultural theme. Cinematographer Robby Muller's images are stunning. His location shots both in the desert and in the urban jungle using polarizing filters are works of true photographic art. The images with their florescent greens reds blues and yellows in dim light are just terrific. More than any dialogue could these visuals effectively convey the loneliness alienation and lost love that are so characteristically American. And Ry Cooder's simple but haunting TexMex guitar sounds amplify this grim mood.The film's main flaw is its length. With a runtime of 150 minutes some parts of the film could have been edited out without loss of the film's message.Paris Texas is a memorable art house film about the modern American experience. Like other art house films the story is not necessarily to be taken literally.

But the few times that I have seen it since it has made deep impressions on me that only a few films have done. Harry Dean Stanton's performance should be ranked among the great performances of all time in the movies. He doesn't have to say much in the first half of the film but the expressions on his face tell us he is in pain almost like his soul has been ripped from his body. But we only find out later the reason for this.Spoilers Travis Stanton we find is suffering from guilt and the pain of losing the things in life that he loved the most. Most men that have loved will see part of themselves in Travis' stories of how jealousy drove him to not let his wife out of his sight but we don't take it as far as Travis drink drove his jealousy to new heights. Even though some of his stories would appall us now we have seen how he destroyed his life or the drink destroyed him we now feel sorry for him. The two monologues with Jane are in my opinion two scenes that will stay with every viewer for a long time. Travis cannot even look at Jane because it would cause him too much pain and break him even further. But before he leaves Jane he needs to tell her why he did the things to her that he did only then could Travis find some peace and maybe regain a part of the soul that he lost.Like John Wayne in The Searchers Travis realises at the end of the film that he has to go and leave alone that he ruined his chance of a happy life with Hunter and Jane or he realised that he could never be happy with her for the intense love that he felt for Jane would always bring jealousy and suspicion would that would always be at the front of his mind.The music also deserve a mention. The southern bluesy slide guitar by Ry Cooder is so simple but so effective in adding to the lazy pace of the movie.".

But before he leaves Jane he needs to tell her why he did the things to her that he did only then could Travis find some peace and maybe regain a part of the soul that he lost.Like John Wayne in The Searchers Travis realises at the end of the film that he has to go and leave alone that he ruined his chance of a happy life with Hunter and Jane or he realised that he could never be happy with her for the intense love that he felt for Jane would always bring jealousy and suspicion would that would always be at the front of his mind.The music also deserve a mention. The southern bluesy slide guitar by Ry Cooder is so simple but so effective in adding to the lazy pace of the movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "Throughout the entirety of Paris Texas's twoandahalfhour running time and not one minute of it wasted it's nearly impossible to take your eyes off Harry Dean Stanton. When he first appears he's animalistic not talking motivated only by his strange unreadable desires. Later on he starts talking and starts having more conventional desires but there's always that wild uncertain edge to his performance so that there's always a step remove between us and him. His Travis is a dangerous character as much for the audience as the other characters. He's entranced by spectacle  the vast emptiness of the Texas horizon the story of his own conception the falsity of a peep show the million artificial lights of Los Angeles and the obsession that gives the film its name the story of his conception in a fake Paris. He tries but is ultimately unable to deal with the reality of his actions and in the end is reduced to passively watching a spectacle again seeing his son end exwife embrace from a distance.Travis's brother Walt seems to be the opposition to his wild ways someone the audience can relate to in their attempts to deal with the strangeness of Travis. But Walt also lives in a world trapped by images he creates billboards simulacra if there ever were any and creates a model family that is ultimately an untenable attempt at playing house his wife is notably French tying in his obsessions to Travis's. We are presented with two quintessential American images the warm suburban nuclear family and the rugged loner prowling the frontier but both are illusions and both bring only suffering.All of this is to say nothing of the technical excellence of Paris Texas the gorgeous cinematography the noteperfect acting from not just Stanton but the rest of the cast as well those two heartbreaking long scenes near the end... but all of this is also spectacle and at the same time the film is drawing us in with its execution it's warning us of the dangers of the seductive image. My favourite films are for the most part films that are at least in part about the act of watching. Paris Texas falls into these two overlapping categories neatly.".

	schema:headline " Excellent and potent tale of loss";
	schema:reviewBody "Paris Texas is my first ever taste of acclaimed director Wim Wenders and while the film isn't exactly sweet it's certainly not bitter enough to steer itself away from the realms of the masterpiece. Paris Texas is very much a character driven story and it follows the account of a man that wanders out of the hot desert sun with an acute case of amnesia. When his brother Walt finds him he helps him to remember his life and we then watch as our protagonist rekindles his former relationships first with son and then with the mother of his child. Wim Wenders handles this story with the utmost skill and it works thanks to the tentative way that he portrays the characters to the audience. Just like the town of it's title Paris Texas is basically a film about being lost. I and I'm sure many other people didn't even realise that there was a place called Paris in the middle of Texas and this little place is symbolic of the substance that is at the core of this movie.The film doesn't benefit from any big name actors but the actors in the movie do give it their all and ensure that it doesn't fall down on the acting side. Harry Dean Stanton takes the lead role and does a good job in at first portraying a man consumed with amnesia and then consumed with the time he has lost. Nastassja Kinski is the only member of the cast that has a really notable list of film credits other than this movie but ironically she has the least screen time of the five leads. Every minute she is on screen is a delight however and she lights up the screen with both of her talents looks and acting ability. The young Hunter Carson gives a rare child performance i.e. one that isn't incredibly annoying but strangely he didn't appear in very many movies after this one. The climax to the tale is more than satisfying and is easily one of the most haunting and potent I've ever seen in a film. Wenders shows his talent with both the execution and the implications of it and it's a satisfying end to a very satisfying movie. Recommended.".

And this is nowhere more true it seems to me than when there are children involved.Travis and Jane had a bad marriage. It was mostly his fault but in truth they both showed signs of instability. When the big blowup came the shrapnel scattered far and wide. One such piece was in the form of their 4yearold son Hunter.Now Hunter was lucky. Unlike his parents who disappeared into obscurity he ended up as the fosterchild of Travis's brother and his wife. They were stable happily married and gave him a loving home. He was as content as a boy could be under the circumstances.Uhoh don't count your chickens Hunter. Four years later out of the festering sands of the Mojave desert and looking like some sort of moulting lizard emerges Travis. He is heading for some obscure destination  possibly his dusty plot at Paris Texas where he might have been considering spending the rest of his life growing tree tomatoes or anything else far removed from the responsibilities of parenthood. Instead he encounters civilisation which contacts his brother. Somewhat against his will Travis is reunited with the son whom he abandoned.Now to give him his credit Travis is a man who realises that he has made some serious mistakes. Had the rest of the movie been about how he confronted those mistakes and actually did something about them and then won back his son's love bit by bit I'd have given it 10 out of 10. The final shot could have been that touching scene when Hunter stops and Travis crosses the road and they go up the hill together. Fade out.But no. Instead of doing that he decides to atone for his mistakes by taking his now 7yearold son away from his happy and stable new home on a journey down to Houston to find his mother. Hunter is to be sacrificed for the sake of Travis's conscience.In spite of discovering that Jane is unmarried and working as a nightclub hostess you could say a prostitute he leaves the boy with her and runs off. No doubt he is heading for that arid patch at Paris Texas once again. Except this time he probably thinks he has at long last done something good in his life.I can't agree. One of the worst exhibitions of parental irresponsibility I have ever seen in a movie is when Travis gets his son to phone his foster parents to tell them he has left home. This of course is after putting them to a lot of needless worry wondering where he was.Poor Hunter. How long before she quits on him again? Or hits the bottle? Or before he gets abused by one of her clients? Oh but the music's great. And the acting. And Texas.".

Walt also brings bad news  he has been raising Travis' son Hunter as his own since he was dumped on his doorstep by Travis' wife Jane  who then just disappeared herself. Trying desperately to build a relationship with his son Travis also decides to track down Jane and make his family whole again.Over the years this film seems to have grown in stature and reputation partly because it is perhaps not as widely seen as it once was. For that reason I made sure I watched it when I got the chance recently and was struck immediately by one of the main reasons that I kept watching the film at times that being the blend of beautiful visuals and haunting score. Normally films that have weak narrative will not suck me in but strong visual style isn't that what the complaint about most summer blockbusters is? however the striking look to the first parts of the film really drew me into it even when the plot did not. As everyone else in the world says Ry Cooder's score was very well used and that's all I'll say on that issue since too many reviews seem to focus on this as if it were the most important part of the film.The plot is lets be honest very slowly delivered  painfully slow at times but yet it managed to fill almost 2 hours quite easily and surprised me by how it suddenly became an impressive film when for large sections of it I felt left out disinterested and distracted. Of course many younger viewers may not make it that far because it is very slow at times and this will put many off before it gets better. It does build well and it is really with the scenes between Travis and Jane that the film is at its strongest I'm sure others have different interpretations but I do like to think that Travis was dead and only returned to reunite his family  whether dead to them or really dead is another matter but the ending was nicely low key and lacking the sickly sentiment that could have killed it. The cast are a big reason this works because many of them do play really well. Stanton is great and he does tend to steal the film from those around him  whether mute or unseen behind mirrored glass. He is excellent in his scenes with Kinski who more than holds her own in a smaller role. Stockwell is good in support and Carson turns in a likable performance that pretty much manages to avoid cute kid destruction.Overall this is not a perfect film and many viewers coming to it on the back of its reputation may struggle to stay with a plot that develops very slowly indeed without a great deal of explanation. The acting is good the score is very well used while the direction and cinematography is close to mesmerising at times. The script does deliver but I was never totally into it until the final third fortunately at this point things become much clearer and much more interesting and despite taking an age to get anywhere I was ultimately glad that I had watched it and had enjoyed the total film more than I had enjoyed individual moments of it.".

A man stumbles out of a desert after 4 years gone missing and travels back to Los Angeles with his brother to reunite him with his son before leaving again to find his past lover and the mother of his son. Behind its endlessly clever jiving title lies a totally complete sentimental and sophisticated work. Seeing Paris Texas through developed hardened and scarred eyes is just as poignant as when it splashes over the tabula rasa mind of a supple and innocent child. One of the most wondrous aspects of this film is how Wim Wenders sets off from Europe to the southwest and immediately captures its natural beauty. I remember the opening shot well. When I sat down to watch Paris Texas aged 12 or so my dad came in and said Oh that's a great film. But you have to turn up the volume on the tiny TV. You can't watch a film with that good a soundtrack with the volume that quiet. What follows has become a very personally affecting journey. Analytically Paris Texas bears no fruits of profound wisdom or revelations but then it never sets out to. I'm drawn powerlessly to the way that Wenders treats movement as a completely different entity throughout Paris Texas changing his cinematographic aura and mood whenever the characters in focus are travelling seeking panning shots of everything that the nonstudio surrounding has to offer the lens neon alien landforms concrete scrap metal cars and interchanges all with the blissful haunting and chilling score by Ry Cooder truly one of the most masterful pieces of music ever written. However when the characters are still in monologue in deep conversation or in thought the tempo and mood instantly change. Such chameleonlike versatility is immensely impressive regardless of its content. Taking my two favourite scenes in the film starting with movement the protagonist a closed and intriguing man that silently infatuates the audience from the very beginning crosses a bridge over a freeway whilst a deranged man screams rapturous gospel in a piercing timeless voice whilst Cooder's slide guitar becomes agitated and Wenders' camera sticks tightly to the protagonist's steps. I read a conversation with the actor who played he who is dubbed Paris Texas's 'screaming man' and he told me most of the scene was adlibbed. I like that. Don't you? By contrast the film's climax its most hailed stationary scene begins with the protagonist walking through a club draped in a low and fuzzy light to a booth where his past lover comes to join him unaware of who she is talking to. Her Natasha Kinskji and him HarryDead Stanton play out an overwhelmingly intimate and emotionally power screenplay whilst the camera doesn't move a muscle. Preamble over the point I'm getting it as that most scenes in Paris Texas are like this. They're ridden with charm and accessibility whilst still managing to be of breathtaking aesthetic beauty.".

The beginning is a marvelous opening with Ry Cooder's wonderful blues guitar it is one of the best soundtrack's iv'e ever heard. And who's that? Well if it isn't the presence of Harry Dean Stanton in his best role to this daythe performance is really captivatingas he wanders to the path of nothing in the lonely desert. He soon makes his way in to a bar and passes outand thats when the movie begins if you know what i mean. The man we just saw has no nameno pastnothing. Soon the doctor that takes him in finds a number which is his brotherDean Stockwell. The brother rushes down to the deserts of Texas and finds a hurting and scarred man with no life in him. One of the many brilliant things about this movie is that Stanton doesn't say a word until 20 minutes in to this filmand you get to do some real character study of him in this time. We soon find out Stanton has a son and that his brother has taken care of him for the years Stanton's been gone. When they arrive to LAmany things happen very quickly for Stanton. He meets the son that doesn't remember himHunter CarsonStockwells wifeAurore Clement in one of her best rolesi haven't seen her in muchand she deserves morebecause she is a very good actor and laterwhen they see film clipswe find out that Stanton also has a long lost wife in which he remembers. But Carson and Stanton really hit it off as father and son in a memorable 3 minutes where Stanton jokes around with the Son. Stanton is determined to find the wife but only hear rumors of where she is which is that she is working in Houston.Pretty shockinglyStanton and Carson make there way to Houston without telling Stockwell or Clement. The finest scene of ALLis when Stanton finds The wifeNastassja Kinski in such a gripping and flawless performance that makes this movie a masterpiece. There is a long talk with the two of them that you just can't explain on a computerand the tension is marvelous. The ending is just to good to be true and you can really see that Wim Wenders has put a lot of work in this movie. And yes i started crying. A LOT. Please see this movie. Everything about it is greatthe cinematographythe actingthe soundtrackthe melancholic thing about it.It is really worth it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well first of all when I read the review for the movie in my hometown paper I was a little scared that Pirates might be a let down. The trailer and the movie clips it seemed didn't really let on that there was much of a story line  that it just kind of goes on and on and on like the Matrix 2 with no storyline  just fighting. Plus most people do agree sequels are hardly ever as good as the originals. And in this case it's true... Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest isn't the original. But its an awesome movie in its own right! There are a few surprises in this movie. A few characters come back from the first that you wouldn't expect to see in the second. but... um! that's all I'm saying. This movie is definitely a lot more violent and gory than the first one. Don't bring the little kids to it. But trust me  this is not a Matrixtype movie... There is an actual storyline. And a good one at that. Capt. Jack Sparrow is back as well as Elizabeth and Will who are forced to find him and obtain his compass or else they will face the gallows. Well actually Will has to find him. Elizabeth escapes and yes... as you've seen in the trailers she does dress up like a man for this movie. Making it all the more comical. you'll see what I mean.The comedy was superb in this movie. Of course it wasn't as good as the first but you can't expect it to be. Yes there were a few instances were they could've shortened the fighting scenes but it was very well shot and scripted.I wish they would've changed a few things about the movie but you can't have everything. And don't expect everything to be resolved at the end. No! There's a cliffhanger ending that leaves you wanting the watch the next one the moment the credits start rolling.If you like the first movie you'll like the second... And that's all I'm saying.Jack Sparrow Why is the rum always gone? he stands up and staggers Oh... That's why.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some blockbuster movies pretend to be more than they actually are. They sometimes even try to be philosophical. 'Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest' thank goodness does no such thing. From start to finish it practically flaunts the fact that it is pure and utter entertainment comic yet breathtaking. The slapstick comedy involving the various sequences on the cannibal island and the water mill are amusing the scenes at sea with the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken draw gasps and as ever the antics of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow brings endless pleasure. Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann does her share too but Orlando Bloom as William Turner is still somewhat...wooden perhaps because of the insipid character that he plays. His almost idiotic chivalry and goodness simply does not click with the mischievous magnetism that Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann delivers. He still does amuse from time to time however. The supporting cast is truly stellar Bill Nighy as Captain Davy Jones Stellan Skarsgard as Bill 'Boostrap' Turner and Naomie Harris as Tia Dalma are simply brilliant. Bill Nighy delivers his lines with aplomb smacking his lips as if he relishes each syllable. Stellan Skarsgard is completely believable as the wretched Bootstrap Bill a man who has fallen to the depths as far as he can go and yet can still find the strength to endure it all in the love he has for his son William. Naomie Harris is just as charismatic as the former two but her charisma is not menacing or stoic but mysterious and even alluring. When she grins her blacktoothed grin one cannot help but grin along with her. In the end 'Dead Man's Chest' is a rollercoasterride of a movie that thoroughly exploits every minute of its twoandahalfhour running time ending with a final cliffhanger that leaves people feeling excited yet frustrated. Remember when you watched 'Lord of the Rings The Fellowship of the Ring' and realized that you would have to wait another year for 'The Two Towers'? Like that. NB. If you have the patience stay till the end of credits. It's mildly amusing.".

However something motivated me to give it another chance and surprisingly I enjoyed it. It is quite well executed. The action sequences and stunts are brilliantly choreographed. My favourite one was the threeway sword fight that continued through a spinning wheel. I liked that the director used minimal CGI for these scenes. The cinematography is stunning and the exotic landscape is breathtaking.The actors do a fairly good job of reprising their role. It's great to see Johnny Depp again as Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom is quite alright but his chemistry with Keira Knightley appears to be weaker than in the first movie. Knightley does an okay job too. Jack Davenport is a surprise to watch in a different gettup. Bill Nighy is great as the squidfaced villain and Naomie Harris is convincing as the witch with the Jamaican accent. The rest of the cast are adequate.The dialogues are funny and witty and the comedy works but at times 'Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest' felt more like a repetition than a continuation of 'Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl'. The CGI particularly on Davy Jones and his crew looked poor when compared to that used in Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' the kind which would have excellently worked for this movie. The ending is unintentionally funny and seems very rushed. Not to mention it's continuous a cliffhanger ending so the third one better be good.For me what stood out more about this movie than the first one were the amazing outdoorsy locations and the action scenes. It's quite a good sequel and very entertaining. Hopefully the third one properly rounds up the trilogy and not end up like the disastrous 'XMen'.".

Johnny Depp did well in his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow as previously in the first film. Keira Knightley and Bill Nighy were also of mentionable performances. I thought Orlando Bloom was a little wooden as I thought of his performance in the first film but still believable and he managed to pull it off. The ending which was rather interesting served its purpose in suspense. It left the audience hanging and it also left me hanging in a buzz of questions. I'm extremely eager to see the next Pirates of Caribbean film. However the film did contain quite a number of references to the first film The Curse of the Black Pearl and I advise you to recap your knowledge of the first film and rewatch it to get the gist.

Everything that is brought into the movie as being there for our hero's to overcome is still there when the credits roll those ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MINUTES finally end. Two and a half hours just to set up a third movie? I'm sorry but that has to be the biggest rip off since Manhatten and those beads and trinkets used to buy it.To be sure the cast is still beautiful At least the leads are and the action comes fast and furious but it leads absolutely nowhere. The first movie was a complete film. There was a resolution at the end and if there never had been a sequel made it would not have affected what people thought of that movie one bit. This film requires you to see the unreleased and let me add not due to be released for almost another year. Watching Johnny Depp act in these films is worth the price of admission and its not a bad movie just a pointless one. Personally I now know I could have saved my time and money waited till next summer and gone to the ACTUAL sequel not this clumsy attempt to pad this into a five hour epic. Sheesh they were able to tell Gone With the Wind Ben Hur or Lawrence of Arabia in far less time then the five hours that these two movies will eventually need to resolve issues that everyone in the audience already knows the ending to.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start off by saying how much I loved the first PotC movie. I adored it. It's not on my list of favorite movies of all time but I still adored it. Johnny Depp was brilliant the story was fun it was immensely entertaining even Orlando Bloom didn't annoy me as much as he usually does. But this thing? People are comparing THIS to The Empire Strikes Back? THIS movie beat the records of Revenge of the Sith and Spiderman? Two movies that are actually GOOD? Instead of comparing Dead Man's Chest to The Empire Strikes Back my favorite movie of all time I would compare it to Temple of Doom. It was nowhere near as good as the first movie and relied far too much on special effects and gross out moments. Disney made the mistake that studios often make when they have an extreme success with an action movie they assumed it was the special effects that people liked not the story or the characters. Where was my beloved Captain Jack? The movie was TWO AND A HALF hours long. You think they could have put him in it more but no. His character was also rather onedimensional in this film having hardly any scruples for abandoning his friends and such. The plot was contrived and just plain dumb. Half the time I had no earthly idea what was going on. In fact the friend I saw the movie with kept poking me in the arm and asking Wait...what's happening? And don't get me started on the villain. He was a freaking OCTOPUS. All the CGI they used for the various undead things looked so cheesy. They weren't frightening in the least. What about Davy Jones's motive? Why DID he want Captain Jack's soul so much? I was utterly confused.Finally what was UP with the whole romance between Elizabeth and Jack? What about Will? I know any woman in her right mind probably WOULD choose Johnny Depp over Orlando Bloom any day but this makes the romance between Elizabeth and Will in the first movie pretty pointless. And their romance was most of the PLOT in the first movie.So basically I hated this movie. It wasn't offensively bad though and not AS bad as Temple of Doom what is? I was laughing throughout the entire thing at its utter stupidity. Frankly though I would rather go be disappointed by X3 again.Which is pretty sad.".

	schema:reviewBody "If I hadn't spent 8 to get into the theater I would have left this movie about half way through. But I stayed hoping it would eventually get better  no such luck. I think Disney let their idea people get out of control. The movie just got too crowded with special effects and totally goofy plot twists which eventually robbed a good cast of any opportunity to actually act. Davey Jones and his crew are so overendowed with gimmicks squirming over their bodies that they ended up more being more distracting than entertaining. And why did the director need to get so focused on being as gross as possible? Instead of gratuitous sex Disney gives us gratuitous slime. Johnny Depp nibbling on a necklace made of human toes was something I didn't get I didn't need it and neither did the movie.Compared to the first film Dead Man's Chest was a let down. I can't think of any redeeming qualities except maybe that it is making a few people a lot of money.".

	schema:headline " Dead Man's Chest is great entertainment";
	schema:reviewBody "Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest reviewed by Sam Osbornrating 3.0 out of 4More more more seems to be the theme running through Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest. There's more adventure more violence more pirates and more myth. Not to mention that two and a half hour running length. But while Superman Returns may have dragged some in its 150 minutes Pirates hurtles along at a pace only expected from the offspring of a Disneyland themeride rarely slowing for piddling bits of nonsense like oh say story. Of course story's not the point of these flicks and it surely doesn't have to be. There's entertainment enough to be had without all the other hodgepodge. And Pirates 2 for all its expansion manages to dodge common sequelitis pitfalls. It doesn't overdose on a memorable character from the original cough Matrix Revolutions cough or overbroaden it's scope cough Matrix Reloadedcough. Dead Man's Chest is a continuation of the original Pirates adventure just with a couple extra unmarked sails tacked onto its deck. The plot has something to do with ole' Captain Jack Sparrow Johnny Depp of course and his debt to Davy Jones Bill Nighy. Debts as we've all learned by now are not things Mr. Sparrow is most proficient at repaying. The Dead Man's Chest factors in as it holds Mr. Jones' beating heart which was ravaged by the likes of a lady whom he loved in the past. The English Navy blowhards also seem to be after the chest and blackmail William Turner Orlando Bloom to seek out Capt. Jack's magic compass which supposedly points toward the treasure. Held in a cell is Will's fianc Elizabeth Swan Kiera Knightley under charges of assisting Capt. Jack in the franchise's last swashbuckler. What it boils down to is a mottled mess of a chase to find the key to Davey Jones' chest and avoiding his gargantuan beast the Kraken. The myth itself wrings deeper than the original's with Davey Jones and his seafood cohorts rendered with an unholy amount of CGI goodness to make them squirm convincingly in all their scaly slippery evil. But the plot doesn't hold much water same as the first though plot was never the point. As long as it paints a tastily mythological backdrop for our pirates to plunder we're kept smiling. And even though the picture has all the weight of a paperclip the franchise has at least matured since it's last time around. The mood has thickened and no longer can we tell that the film is a shameless translation of its Disneyland ride. Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio take efforts to develop each of our three heroes separately using individual subplots to fill in the otherwise empty molds left dry from the original. Will Turner has a family reunion with his father Stellan Skarsgard enslaved by Davy Jones and appearing as though he's slowly evolving into a starfish. Will's fianc Ms. Swan escapes from her cell and hides as a stowaway on a trade vessel. And Jack of course still functioning as the star of the show develops his slimier persona with delectable cowardice and deception. Ironic that the teenagers of America have chosen Mr. Sparrow as their most prized character in film. Oh wait that honor instead belongs to Napoleon Dynamite. Perhaps we should be nervous about our country's future? Anyway along with the characters the adventure is also thickened heartily though probably not by consequence of the writing but instead because of the greatly inflated budget. Our friends are volleyed about the seas facing the enormous sea monster the Kraken whose plungerlike tentacles crumple vessels like copypaper. Swordplay is more indulgent too with Verbinksi going so far as to mount a chivalric swordfight inside a huge rolling waterwheel as it bounces along the island's foliage. Verbinski juggles these stunts with ease proving once again his filmmaking versatility. If you'll remember all the way back to last October I know in Hollywoodtime nine months is an epoch Verbinski made a quiet gloomy little character study called The Weather Man. And before that Verbinski also directed The Ring and Captain Jack's first adventure in 2003. Yup this guy's the real deal. In the waterwheel sequence Verbinski chooses not to succumb to any mere CGI trickery and mounts a camera on the wheel's axis to show that at one point he forced Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom to swordfight on a giant spinning wooden wheel. And he's more artistic than your typical Brett Ratneresquire director finding a visual aesthetic perfect for a pirate's tale. But art and pretentious critic fodder aside Dead Man's Chest is great entertainment. It's rich and exciting and chockfull of Captain Jackisms for high schoolers to repeat over and again. And the life of pirates is still a chunk of history that Hollywood has been unwilling to bite into for a while. Pirates of the Caribbean for all its feathery lightweight fun gorges on this chunk and keeps us hooked on the adventure waiting along with all the local eighth and ninth graders next year for the midnight showing of Captain Jack's trilogy capper.".

Making matters worse Sparrow's problems manage to interfere with the wedding plans of Will and Elizabeth who are forced to join Jack on yet another one of his misadventures.Depp's Oscarnominated performance as Captain Jack is still a marvel in slovenly pirate behavior with his slurred speech swaying swagger and slack waving arms. But whether channeling famed Rolling Stones' guitarist Keith Richards or not it's the duality of the character that continues to intrigue us. He is a lusty fearless man with a deeply defiant and somewhat sneaky streak but whose delicate features long dread locked hair Kohlrimmed eyes and almost girly mannerisms give him a subtly effeminate air that belies his macho antics. This time around young Brits Knightley and Bloom have a little more to do with Elizabeth's growing attraction to Jack and Will's reunion with his father Bill Bootstrap Turner Stellan Skarsgrd who's soul is stuck on the Flying Dutchman. And Nighy Love Actually once again makes his mark as an effective villain infusing his rather quirky acting ticksthe laconic delivery the laidback attitudewhich shines through all the special effects makeup. Let's just say Nighy certainly rivals Depp in the arrogant rock star stance even if he has tentacles for a face.The other thing Dead Man's Chest does right is make things bigger and better. From a hairraising sword fight on top of a spinning water wheel to the way Davy Jones and his crew lookall water logged and crustaceanlikethe film's production value is simply amazing. Returning producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Gore Verbinski make sure the action sequences the sets the costumes the makeup and the special effects give the audience a familiarity to the original while also taking them on a whole new adventure. And if you are a fan of the Disney park attraction the one at Disneyland not Disney World the elements that got missed in the first onethe creepy bayou the beating heart in the treasure chestare in this sequel. Dead Man's Chest does lag a bit from time to time especially in heating up the Jack Elizabeth and Will love triangle. But that's OK. We enjoy watching their banter as much as we do the rest of it. And for those who'll want more adventure after the movie ends Dead Man's Chest gives us a promise the third installment will be just as much pirate fun.910".

	schema:headline " 'Pirates' is visually stunning but drifts due to convoluted plot";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on the massive popularity of the first installment Piates of the Caribbean Curse of the Black Pearl in 2003 it was only natural for a sequel to this Disney swashbuckler to make its way to theatres.After an adequate amount of time Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest starring most of the last movie's original cast Johnny Depp Orlando Bloom Keira Knightly Jonathan Pryce etc. has hit the big screen.And while the visuals special effects and sets are extraordinary the film seems to drag on searching for coherence in a meandering plot line which drifts all over the South Seas. It's not that I did not like this picture or enjoy certain parts immensely it's simply another case of the first one being better as well as easier to understand.Dead Man's Chest picks up basically where the first left off but Will Turner Bloom and Elizabeth Swann Knightly are arrested on Port Royale by Lord Cutler Beckett Tom Hollander Pride  Prejudice The Libertine. The charge Conspiring to aid in the escape of noted pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow Depp. The possible penalty Death by hanging the British answer to everything.Cutler gives Turner an option however. Find Sparrow and retrieve a certain key to a certain treasure chest and all will be forgiven. Meanwhile Sparrow and his motley crew have beached on a remote South Pacific island thanks to Jack's nonfunctioning compass inhabited by cannibals. While the crew is imprisoned in huge round wooden cages suspended from high cliffs Sparrow is treated like a demigod.After a series of goofy but funny chases the fun cannot last here though and with Turner's help most of the men and Jack beat a hasty retreat from the venue. A side trip to visit what seems like a voodoo conjurer Tia Dalma Naomie Harris A Cock  Bull Story sheds a little more light on things. A key such as Beckett described to Turner does indeed exist and it opens the chest which contains the stillliving heart of Davy Jones the mythical sailor punished for all eternity for falling in love with a woman or something to that effect.Shortly thereafter the Black Pearl is overtaken by the ghostly Flying Dutchman captained by none other than the squidlike Davy Jones Bill Nighy Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy The Constant Gardner and manned by a doomed crew now more fish and barnacle than man. Turner is kept on board while Jack to pay off some debt to Jones is sent to bring 100 souls to Jones as a ransom. On this ship Turner also meets his doomed father Bootstrap Bill Turner Stellan Skarsgard King Arthur Exocist The Beginning.Jones who keeps the key on his slimy person also has sway over a huge sea monster the Kraken which can destroy a vessel and its crew in a matter of moments. The special effects in these sequences are terrific.Meanwhile Swann has stowed away aboard another ship and convinces the captain to put in at the pirate port of Tortuga where Sparrow is recruiting another crew including the disgraced former Commodore James Norrington.When she meets Jack some sparks fly but it's in her hands that the compass finally begins to lead the way to the dead man's chest. It seems that each of the protagonists  Sparrow Turner and Norrington  want Davy Jones' heart for themselves and this sets off a hilarious threeway battle for the organ.As expected Depp is great in this role although he seems a bit more spacedout or intoxicated most of the time and there are some pretty good moments here such as the triple swordfight on a huge rolling water mill if one can sit through the plot complications long enough to figure out what's going on. The conclusion paves the way an obvious sequel due for release in 2007 so that last picture may clear up some of the confusion from this one.".

Turner is kept on board while Jack to pay off some debt to Jones is sent to bring 100 souls to Jones as a ransom. On this ship Turner also meets his doomed father Bootstrap Bill Turner Stellan Skarsgard King Arthur Exocist The Beginning.Jones who keeps the key on his slimy person also has sway over a huge sea monster the Kraken which can destroy a vessel and its crew in a matter of moments. The special effects in these sequences are terrific.Meanwhile Swann has stowed away aboard another ship and convinces the captain to put in at the pirate port of Tortuga where Sparrow is recruiting another crew including the disgraced former Commodore James Norrington.When she meets Jack some sparks fly but it's in her hands that the compass finally begins to lead the way to the dead man's chest. It seems that each of the protagonists  Sparrow Turner and Norrington  want Davy Jones' heart for themselves and this sets off a hilarious threeway battle for the organ.As expected Depp is great in this role although he seems a bit more spacedout or intoxicated most of the time and there are some pretty good moments here such as the triple swordfight on a huge rolling water mill if one can sit through the plot complications long enough to figure out what's going on. The conclusion paves the way an obvious sequel due for release in 2007 so that last picture may clear up some of the confusion from this one.";

Most friends disagree with me on this but.....hey we all look at films differently.This was the best Pirates to me because it had some fascinating new characters it did not have the sappy or annoying characters and romance of the first film it had just the right mix of action and lulls and it had some super specialeffects and humor. Much of that good stuff unfortunately was overdone in the third film.which also dragged on too long. This movie isn't short but none of the action scenes go on too long and so the entire twoandahalf hours is entertaining.Also and this goes for all three of the movie it looks absolutely super on BluRay. It's the reason POTC is often shown in electronic stores promoting highdefinition televisions because this film is about as goodlooking as it gets. It's incredibly sharp.The newest main character is the multitentacled Davy Jones and he's a real hoot. Who knows how many hours each day poor Bill Nighy had to sit in the makeup room before Davy was ready for action. Actually the same good be said for Johnny Depp's Capt. Jack Farrow who wears almost has much makeup as the late Tammy Fae Bakker. Anyway between the battles of both land and sea something interesting always is going on or being said in this movie making it a fun ride all the way.".

The trailers for the new film were a little disappointing so helped not get my expectations too high but i still went to see dead mans chest with a fairly positive mind.OH DEAR...... Now lets start what was good about the film as it is a much shorter list....well the GGI was really good. Davy Jones looked awesome and his henchmen also looked great. The escape from the Tribe was also quite funny.Now onto the bad well for starters the film didn't have the fun swash buckling feel too it they went allot darker and for me this didn't work. In the first film the back stabbing had a humorous element to it in this it felt cold and wrong. Also the humour was just repeat jokes from the first film. There were like 5 rum jokes in the film and only 2 of them were funny. There was hardly any original material that made you laugh like the first film.The film also feels like the first part of a longer film which of course it is but it does not stand alone by itself as a good film. They cram so much story and plot into and none of it is paid off in this film. The cliff hanger at the end does not feel like a cliff hanger the film just stopped and even the ending was contrived. They should have done an Indiana Jones and done two separate films with two separate plots with the same cast.Also the film felt very forced. Why 2 years after POTC would the Indian trading company only just decide to arrest will turner?? Why would they also want to arrest Commander Norrington for letting Jack go when Norrington apparently chased Jack Sparrow till he lost his crew?? Why the hell were the two pirates from the first film rowing a boat in the middle of the sea?? Why after escaping does Elizabeth go and see the Lord?? Why when her and will are reunited do they care about getting a pardon they are both free why not go and live in china?? How the hell do they go and see the witch at the end without a boat?? why see the witch at the end at all?? EVen the set up for the next film was forced.To me it feels like they had a whole load of sequences and gags planned and then they wrote a script around it. The editing was also really bad one minute Jack is running away on the Black Pearl the next he is a Tribe leader and what the hell was will trying to do at the end with all of the dynamite and rum yeah the plan worked but it should not have done.If Pirates 3 is the best film ever then this film could be redeemed. As it stands at the moment it sucks big time and is pure filler. If you are a fan of the first film see this at your own risk.".

Norrington was the only character that grew. Jack Sparrow's character was changed from a crooked good man to. . . I don't even know. His character was extremely shallow and humorless. It felt as though a two year old designed his character. The characters that we knew and loved became warped in this movie. Will just sulked his way through the movie and I don't even know what was up with Elizabeth. And what was with that horrible ending? Asking if they wanted to go on a new adventure was lame a letdown and a horrible way to finish off the movie.The only good thing I can see about this movie is that there is no way the third one can be any worse.

	schema:reviewBody "Okay I made a previous comment praising this movie in the sense of good spirit because I liked the actors and their performances even though I horribly dread it compared to Curse of the Black Pearl. However now that I have indulged myself in metaphorical rum I have come to realize that I was way too forgiving of this movie. Firstly the flaws in the content were abysmal The plot was overloaded with action devoid of all the quaint understated humor of the original ex why is the rum gone?. This movie has had its heart ripped out much like Davy Jones. If you enjoy action heavy movies by all means go see Dead Man's Chest. However if you repeatedly watch Curse of the Black Pearl for nostalgia's sake and miss the subtle humor and small production feel you will cry with agony 10 minutes into this movie. This movie takes itself way too seriously. Secondly the only thing that redeems this movie while simultaneously condemning it is that all the glitz distracts you from the picture's lack of soul. To the special effects team photoreal animation can be distracting when used too much! CG effects in general can be a distraction when used too much. This is a prime example of special effects gone wrong! In fact the movie is so weighed down by its special effects that the actors don't get a chance to act hence lack of soul. I don't blame the actors because they did a brilliant job on The Curse of the Black Pearl so I believe they know their stuff. Thirdly I felt the time slip through my fingers. After 2.5 hours of my life that I will never get back I walked out of the theatre with a gigantic headache. Too many motives subplots! Arrg. Will vs his father vs Davy Jones the Commadore vs Will Will vs Jack Jack vs Davy Jones vs The East India Company vs Elizabeth! What ever happened to plot line 101? The protagonistantagonist ratio is on overload. The whole confusing mess comes to an apex when the Commadore Jack Will Elizabeth and Davy Jone's crew fight ALL at once on the island where Davy Jone's heart is buried. Not only does it give you a headache to watch but because of all the diverging plot lines nothing gets resolved. Annoying. I will conclude with this. I am going to see Pirates 3 because I still enjoyed Captain Jack Sparrow and his smart witty exchanges with Ms. Elizabeth. I am determined to see what becomes of their relationship. But more importantly I hope Jerry Bruckheimer can fix what he broke... the hearts of Pirates fans everywhere. However because the crew shot some of Pirates 3 wo a script while still filming Dead Man's Chest I think things are off to a shaky start. Jumping the gun to save money is economically savvy but not too wise with all these summer halfbaked movies. First I was commandeered onto the X3 shoot me now band wagon and now something worse? Still I hold out hope. Until then I will dive into the metaphorical bottle of rum.We're devils we're black sheep and really bad eggs. Drink up me hearties yo ho!".

The humour does not always work but there are enough colourful costumes and cars to keep things interesting. Therefore we get many musical interludes a lot of frantic running around and an equal amount of scantily clad girls.

	schema:reviewBody "Theo Van Gogh a distant relative of the great artist Vincent with the same name as his brother who was brutally murdered in Holland recently by Muslims has a lasting tribute here in this tale about a connection made between two people on the phone lines. A good film about the telephone psyche that can occur with phone sex. Although this film appears to be roughedged and the English subtitles are a bit annoying there is a dynamic magnetism that draws you forward and if you can suspend your disbelief Coleridge for just a bit this is good entertainment. Haunting and surreal this story is believable. A 30 year old woman places a voice ad for phone play and lures an innocent unsuspecting fellow into a phone connection that becomes mutually exclusive. The two of them think of each other constantly and the obsession leads to some interesting telephone encounters. The director only shows the nose mouth and chin of the fellow and the girl is shrouded in perpetual darkness showing only the back or top of her head or just her body slouched languorously on her couch or bed. This allows the audience to identify with the telephone experience of phone play relating to not knowing what the other person looks like. The immediacy panic and fury that ensues is quite exciting. One encounter has the man in a hurry to catch a flight on a business trip only to have her persuade him to take a few moments to get off in a panic quickie. Another scene has him persuade her to let him listen to her go in the toilet when nature calls which leads eventually to erotic passion for both of them. Another sequence shows them getting emotionally attached while chatting as she twirls her hair nonchalantly alternating her hand between her hair and groping over the rest of her body in the dark secret recesses of her living room. This is cheap and vulgar entertainment suitable only for late night adult viewers. This film does have its place however and taken in context and for what it is worth this film is not a bad effort. More stimulating and inspirational in fact than a lot of the crap that is currently out there. If you let your imagination got to work this film is somewhat erotic and arousing which is what phone play is all about anyways.".

The first film to be shown was Vals Licht but due to altered programming of the TV station that showed it RTL 5 the film ran late there were numerous interviews and documentaries on van Gogh before the film and it would have been impossible for me to watch both films. Having seen the fist 20 minutes of Vals Licht and concluding that the lead actress  would not be too convincing I decided to watch 06 on Nederland 3 instead.The film is about two 30somethings that engage in a telephone relationship after 'meeting' on a telephone sex line. The first part of the film involving the first conversation is actually quite exciting and arousing but soon I found myself wondering about the motives of the main actors and I must say that this is where van Gogh went wrong with the film. I mean there just is not enough to cover 90 minutes of film with and keep the audience interested. There isn't really any hint to why the characters do certain things and as surprising as the twist at the end may have been for some it took me just 30 seconds to figure it out. Not a bad effort but not a good one either. You need not have seen this but I guess it is somewhat passable.06 out of 010".

	schema:reviewBody "'1000 a Minute' is a movie about the interest charges on my credit cards. No just kidding. Not much! Actually '1000 a Minute' that dollar sign is in the opening credits is an aboveaverage Bmovie with an ingenious premise which unfortunately it doesn't quite fulfil.Roger Pryor was a Bmovie version of Clark Gable they played similar roles but Pryor lacked Gable's confidence and his raffish rough edges. Also Pryor was smaller than Gable with a poncier moustache. Muscular and fit Pryor was completely believable as a boxer in 'Belle of the Nineties' ... but his small size relegated him to playing a middleweight at best. Gable was the heavyweight in terms of build and his appeal as a boxoffice draw.I viewed a nitrate print of '1000 a Minute' that had begun to deteriorate and had some footage missing. I viewed as much as I dared of this film through a handheld Steenbeck viewer so as not to subject it to the sprockets of a motorised projector. This movie ingeniously combines two premises that have separately done good service elsewhere. One of these is the one about the eccentric millionaires who make a bet that cruelly exploits some innocent schlub. An early example of this plot line was Mark Twain's story 'The MillionPound Banknote'. A more recent example was the film 'Trading Places' with two schlubs as the millionaires' pawns one white pawn one black pawn. The other premise used here in '1000 a Minute' is the hardy perennial from 'Brewster's Millions' the one about the man who is legally required to squander a vast fortune.'1000 a Minute' stars Roger Pryor as a cynical newspaperman Clark Gable subtype who loses his job and his girlfriend in the same day. Somewhat desperate he finds himself embroiled in the scheme of two eccentric millionaires. They're conducting a wager to see whether or not it's possible for anyone to spend 1000 a minute every minute for 12 continuous hours. Nobody in this film does the maths so I'll do them that bet would cost 720000 not counting the stakes of the wager itself.Pryor of course is the man who gets stuck with the job of spending the dosh. As an incentive he's promised 10000 for himself IF he can keep up the spending ... if he fails he gets zilch. A gunman named Benny with a broad Brooklyn brogue is assigned to stay on Pryor's heels to make sure he follows the rules and keeps up his spendthrift behaviour.This premise is ingenious ... at first. In the early reels the pace picks up speed as Pryor must accelerate his spending. At first this looks a shopaholic's dream gig. But the suspense mounts as Pryor discovers it's getting more difficult to spend the money. When word gets out about Pryor's buying spree merchants assume he's loony and they don't want to do business with him. The cops assume that Pryor is spending stolen loot or spreading counterfeit cash either way they try to collar him.There's a fine supporting cast in this film. Herman Bing was a German character actor who exaggerated his Prussian accent to comic effect with wildly exaggerated rolling R's. Here in '1000 a Minute' Bing does a setpiece in which he explains to Pryor that Pryor can't order oysters because oysters aren't in season. Bing trots out the usual myth that oysters are only in season in months that have an 'R' in their names. This is untrue oysters are a bit more watery in the nonR months but perfectly good to eat. The way Herman Bing twists his 'R's in explaining this concept to Pryor is hilarious! Edgar Kennedy supplies one of his finest examples of his famous slow burn here. The annoying Sterling Holloway is as annoying as usual here I skipped his big scene in my handheld viewer. Franklin Pangborn is a bit less nelly than usual. Just a bit.The real delight of this film is Edward Brophy as Benny the gunman who supervises Pryor's spending habits. Brophy is typically described as playing dummies but that's not accurate on the rare occasions when Edward Brophy played a genuinely stupid man such as in 'The Last Hurrah' he wasn't very credible. Brophy was brilliant at playing befuddled little tough guys smart enough to know something was fishy but who couldn't figure out what to do about it. In '1000 a Minute' he gives one of his funniest performances.SLIGHT SPOILERS. Unfortunately after setting up such a great premise '1000 a Minute' can't keep up the spendthrift pace of its early reels. I missed some footage in the middle but the ending loses steam. It's no surprise that Pryor ends up with Leila Hyams ... but her looks in this film disappointed me. In her silentfilm roles Hyams was meltingly beautiful ... then the talkies revealed her coarse Brooklyn accent. Yet in her early talkie roles Hyams was still good to look at although painful to hear. In '1000 a Minute' Leila has no appeal for me at all. Her long blonde hair is now short and dark. She wears a harsh makeup with lipstick that looks nearly black on screen. Her eyebrows have been plucked and reshaped to resemble nothing found in nature's realm. Leila how could you?Because I viewed a damaged and incomplete print I shan't rate this film. The production values are VERY low throughout. From what I could see this movie starts out as a delightful and original comedy ... and then fails to pay off the promise of its premise.".

Once it made the TV circuit in the early 1950s it seemed to disappear. This is the first I've seen or heard of it in all that time.Mr. MacIntyre's extensive review is quite solid and accurate. I have no qualms with it at all. I found Pryor quite good and Brophy excellent. Bing is absolutely hilarious. Also I enjoyed Holloway as a tax driver who must chauffeur Pryor about without ever getting paid  since Pryor can't spend any money without a receipt and it can't be for a service only for a solid object. Why Holloway doesn't just give up makes for the comedy he's committed to collecting his 6070 fee and hopefully a tip. His slow burns are quite funny.The sound is quite good  deserving of its Oscar nomination although this was the first year that every studio could submit a favorite in the sound score scoring song categories and be guaranteed of a nomination. It had no chance of winning but at least it made Republic feel good about itself.What gets short shrift is the romance  there's hardly any of it. It's all in the chase. I found the script quite humorous and the film itself a lot of fun.POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD Don't know if this counts as a spoiler but for the record the purchases are pearls a race horse a wine cellar a fur coat a car a yacht and a Great Dane.".

	schema:headline " 'Apocalypse' doesn't do everything wrong but it certainly doesn't do everything right.";
	schema:reviewBody "Following the success of the 2002 adaptation from video game to film that was 'Resident Evil' comes its tantalizinglytrailered sequel 'Resident Evil Apocalypse'. I have to say I was entranced by the trailer of this film. I seriously thought that this film had the potential to rise above 'Mortal Kombat' 1995 and 'Resident Evil' as the best cinematic event to spawn from a video game. 'Apocalypse' doesn't do everything wrong but it certainly doesn't do everything right. Let's start with a brief synopsis. Firstly this film picks up literally days after the first drops us off. 'Apocalypse' opens with a rehashed explanation of what we learned about the two main characters in the original Alice Milla Jovovich and Matt Addison Eric Mabius. Again we are told that this Umbrella Corporation is an international superpower and that Alice is or more accurately was the head of security in an underground research facility dubbed The Hive which harbored research and specimens pertaining to biological weaponry. After that we are treated to the scientists who wheeled Addison away at the closure of 'Evil' opening the zombieinfested annals of The Hive. Immediately before the audience 'knows' what happens its pretty obvious and is given away in the final shots of the first 'RE' we transition into a militaristic evacuation of important personnel associated with Umbrella Corp. After a few assorted events that do and simultaneously do not move the plot line a 'do not' being the leadscientist asking how bad the situation is. After this we are introduced to nearly a halfdozen other characters including a renegade police officer Sienna Guillory the remaining members of an elite task force Oded Fehr Zack Ward a VERY stereotypical Black man Mike Epps and a hulking creature which if you paid attention to the first 'RE' you would be aware of its appearance that totes both a rocketlauncher and a handheld chain gun named the Nemesis. As far as performances go the aforementioned actors and actresses do well with the material that they are given. Guillory has Helen of Troy not from the film 'Troy' on her resume as Jovovich has Joan of Arc Fehr has the mummy hunter Ardeth Bay from the 'Mummy' series and Epps is credible in several comedies. There is no real emotion in the script so the viewers really can't ask for any emotion from the actors sadly true. That is where 'Apocalypse' stumbles and in many places falls on it's face.The plot is paper thin with nearly no real complications for the audience until the last ten minutes which is a nearcomplete turn around from the original which actually evoked SOME thought from the audience. It is basically unleash zombies on the city and shoot 'em up. The small subplots really vary from little to no relevance in the story whatsoever. It is pretty predictable that there is some kind of 'oh no my friend was bitten and eventually I'll have to kill him just before he bites me' situation and the big actionset pieces are blatantly set up. The characters are thinner than the plot with their arcs being straighter than a steel arrow. Alice begins the movie as an asskicking femme fatal and finishes the film being...oh you guessed it an asskicking femme fatal. Jill Valentine Guillory is another one of these masculinely tough females although sans Alice's super powers. The only real life that is brought to the script is through the epitome of black stereotypes played by Mike Epps. It was sadly ironic however that my favorite bit of 'Apocalypse' involved a reference to another video game franchise. Again 'RE Apocalypse' is not completely bad. Although few it has its moments. Mike Epps has his funny lines and his one encounter with the Nemesis brought laughs from the entire audience which was something needed in the film. The Nemesis was done well a majority of the time although there is a bit where the big oaf crashes through a wall and his head piece actually shifts visibly on the actor's shoulders and makes a formidable villain for a good margin of the film although his closure is a bit weak. Many of the action sequences had great potential...but the majority of those action scenes were fastcut much like 'AvP' so much so that it was very hard at moments to see exactly what was happening in the shot. 'Apocalypse' suffices much more as an action movie than it does as a horror film and it struggles to keep interest even for someone who has faithfully played the video games. I will be glad to admit though...'Apocalypse' has the BIGGEST most unexpected scare of 2004. I won't say when or where...but I am glad to have experienced it. 'Apocalypse' isn't exactly worth all eight dollars of your admission fee but it doesn't make a bad Saturday afternoon matinee...610.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hollywood is known for its summertime action flicks and recent action films such as The Matrix began to show a hopeful turn towards a trend of thoughtful plots and interesting stories. Unfortunately the large success of Resident Evil Apocalypse may very well be the deathblow to this promising new trend. In a sense the title speaks for itself Resident Evil Apocalypse may very well be the apocalypse of intelligent action movies.After a new virus breaks out in a large industrialized city citizens begin mutating into cannibalistic flesheating zombies. The Umbrella Corporation consisting of the people most directly responsible for the outbreak takes measures to quarantine the city turning it into a horrific sanitarium. The story follows several characters as they attempt to survive and escape the city with the help of an unseen ally who keeps contact with them from outside the city. Things further complicate when Nemesis the movie's biggest toughest monster arrives for the sole purpose of killing just about everything he perceives as a threat.The plot of Resident Evil Apocalypse is perhaps the single worst piece of writing recently played out before the eyes of unfortunate movie fans. From the very beginning the story begs questions that are never answered who gave the Umbrella Corporation a building permit for a gigantic wall that would circle the city and with which they could at a moment's notice lock everyone inside? Why does Alice come crashing into a church through a stainedglass window on a motorcycle armed to the teeth with weaponry to rescue the protagonists with perfect timing despite the fact that she has never met them before and was in the previous scene walking around in the street with only a shotgun and no motorcycle at all? These and many more mindboggling questions are completely ignored the person who was in charge of this film's continuity should never work in Hollywood again. In fact Resident Evil Apocalypse has more plot holes than moldy Swiss cheese. However even when ignoring the numerous plot holes  which is almost an impossibility  the story itself is still laughable revolving partly around an insipid fight for survival that seems to rely on the main group splitting up and one of the subgroups being brutally slaughtered for no good reason with the other part being about Alice a character invented by the scriptwriter as she was never in the game it is very looselytaken from and her relationship with the monster Nemesis. Surprisingly the director managed to craft a story that is significantly less interesting the one presented in the video game version. To cap off all the excitement the movie reaches its climax a full fifteen minutes before the end of the film! After a handful of survivors have escaped Alice is caught and put in a lab where she not only manages to escape but also to manifest psychic powers while quipping off several lines that were used to advertise the movie in commercials. What was the purpose of this 15minute epilogue? To set up the next movie in the series  a completely unnecessary task as the film has already made it clear that there is absolutely no help for the next sequel in terms of quality. In a way it could be said that the one thing the plot truly accomplished was setting the stage for even more cinematic fodder in the future.The acting was not bad and in general was as good as it could have been given the material the actors had to work with. Although Alice is mildly interesting do largely to her reflections and well played by Milla Jovovich the rest of the characters were mostly stale archetypes. The most blatant example is the character of L.J. played by actor Mike Epps who embodies every black stereotype that is popular today. This character's only true purpose is comic relief and to that respect he does it dryly.The cinematography offers a wide variety of different camera shots as well as providing a constant supply of eye candy. In what is easily the highlight of the film Resident Evil Apocalypse shows some impressivelooking stunts such as a scene of Alice running down the side of a sky scraper with either the intent to kill or the intent to break her legs. Either way the scene was a joy ride for the vision. Truthfully the only badly shot scenes that come to mind are the blurry scene unnecessary ugly and pointless and the climatic fight scene at the end badly cut and confusing. Overall though the cinematography was decently good which is likely the cause for this film making so much money in the box office.The setting was exactly what you would expect for an apocalyptic zombie movie  a big city with lots of undead people. The sets maintained a Gothic look throughout and few scenes took place in daylight. Thankfully the lighting was very well done so the film maintained a dark nighttime look while simultaneously allowing the viewers to perfectly see all that was happening. Sets based on real buildings such as schools and police stations all looked exactly as they should. Resident Evil Apocalypse had a big budget and that fact is made apparent by the great sets and props.Unfortunately nothing saves the movie from its horrible plot. A plot should provide any movie with its base and with a plot so holey and incoherent everything that could have made Resident Evil Apocalypse good simply falls apart. Despite the big budget some reasonably wellknown actors and a license and subjectmatter with a cult following nothing can gloss over the essential flaws that keep this movie from any kind of greatness. People who prefer to see mindless exaggerated action sequences devoid of any decent plot will likely enjoy Resident Evil Apocalypse. However those interested in intelligent wellwritten stories will do well to look elsewhere.".

	schema:headline " Resident Evil Apocalypse Has a Lot to Offer";
	schema:reviewBody "I've watched Resident Evil 1 to 5 many times and I have RE 4 and 5 in 3D. Having seen all these movies numerous times I now have come to the realization that Resident Evil Apocalypse is my most favorite in the franchise. Granted the first movie in a franchise is usually also the most enjoyable because it introduces us to the movie's universe. As such the first half of Resident Evil 1 surpasses all others and can be watched many times without regret however while Resident Evil 1 is one of my favorite movies of all time it fails to deliver enough thrills in its second half and this is exactly what RE Apocalypse compensates for. Apart from that RE Apocalypse has a great first half because it is one thing for the Tvirus to spread inside the Hive and a completely different thing for it to spread to the entire city. That being said RE Apocalypse is thrilling and engaging from start to finish because the universe in which the story unfolds is entirely different from the one in the original RE.Also while we had some bland characters in RE 1 such as the medic or the first guy that is pulled in and killed by a horde of zombies almost all of the characters in RE 2 are colorful and each of them contributes to some aspect of the movie. It also feels good to distance oneself from the claustrophobic feeling one gets in RE 1. RE Apocalypse is an actionpacked horror movie that has a lot to offer. We are presented with a stronger and more agile version of Alice who can perform fascinating Kung Fu kicks and acrobatic moves the most interesting of which in my opinion is where Alice is running down a vertical building. The Nemesis is a real life replica of the most feared monster from Resident Evil games. Jill Valentine is simply perfect and makes a video game character come to life. Moreover the sense of humor helps the movie to not get boring. I remember the first time that I watched this movie it left me wanting for more. It has a cliffhanger ending and you can't help but wish to know what happens to Alice next. This is very important given the fact that many great movies let the audience down by a disappointing or predictable ending. The movie has been shot beautifully and the background music is exciting. This movie is strongly recommended to all actionhorror fans right after RE 1.".

I definitely felt I got my money's worth. There are really only two differences between this movie and the original Resident Evil. One this movie introduces a new monster the Nemesis. It's a big monster with bad teeth wearing an overcoat and wielding a rocket launcher. The other difference is that they added another hot woman to the zombie killing mix.

	schema:reviewBody "Please excuse my short outburst but this movie is utterly awful and bares practically no resemblance to the videogames especially in terms of style and action.I'll try and reelaborate on this. Resident Evil Apocalypse is nothing but TRASH. Pure postMatrix trash. The first movie was vomit inducing resulting in pulsing headaches and dissolved moral. I had a small pinch of hope for the sequel namely because the hack known as Paul W.S. Anderson wasn't directing he was too busy murdering FOX's prized franchises so the directing duties was given to firsttimer Alexander Witt. I have come to the conclusion that Witt was just simply Anderson's alias.The director just copied and pasted what Anderson achieved in the first film namely rapid editing a hard rock soundtrack and YAWN kungfu melee. The end result was simply a hacked attempt at copying a previous hacked attempt. Was Witt pressured by the studio to copy another Hack's style? The acting. Well Milla Jovovvovovovocichs hams up the screen time a plenty. Serena Guillory looks quite hot in her Jill outfit but resembles a hooker for the undead. The rest of the cast are just equally as bland. And Nemesis oh Jesus Crumbcakes. How could you feck up such a powerful iconic character from the videogames? Easy get Anderson involved. They MADE Nemesis a complete pussy. And why did he go after Milla? The whole point of the Nemesis in the storyline was to hunt down S.T.A.R.S. Members so why was Milla a hunted target? She has bugger all to do with them. She's just screen fodder.And the final showdown. LAME. A fistfight between Milla and the Nemesis and she fricking BEATS HIM????? And then Nemesis dies by having a helicopter crash land on him? Anyone who played the RE3 game will know what a complete copout that was.If you're a fan of the game AVOID THIS FILM. But if you've never played the videogames enjoy postmatrix filth and into new culture crap and don't give a damn about the quality of films just want a cheap thrill and all.........AVOID THIS FILM AS WELL!".

	schema:headline " About as good as the first overall";
	schema:reviewBody "After having seen Resident Evil god knows how many times and being pretty psyched for the sequel I finally got to see it and on the premiere night too. Of course I knew that the director of the first RE Paul W. S. Anderson wasn't doing this since he was busy making his dream project Aliens Vs Predator. Luckily I can cope with changes like that... as long as the change isn't devastating. For this movie however it's hard to tell... maybe the mediocre attempts at scaring the audience and providing shocks was Anderson's fault as he wrote the script but it may be the new director firsttimer Alexander Witt who's responsible. Let me say this upfront I as many others who enjoyed the first really liked the ending the whole foreshadowing thing and thankfully the film picks up exactly where the first one left off. Actually it goes a little further back to show us exactly what happened before Alice woke up. The plot is decent about as good as it gets when it's Paul W. S. Anderson writing it. It doesn't drag... heh it doesn't drag... heck it doesn't even leave the slightest chance for it to drag as it's constantly moving. The movie never allows the audience to catch their breath apparently someoneI'm guessing Anderson or Witt has never heard of the danger of overdoing action sequences. For anything at all to be good entertaining thrilling whatever... there needs to be what is commonly referred to as 'buffers'. Without those nice little talkytalky scenes inbetween heck maybe even a dash of good oldfashioned character development the action just ends up being trite. And that's pretty much what happens here. They try to squeeze as much action into every single frame as possible and it ends up annoying the audience rather than exciting. The director also has a horrible habit of blurring the image whenever there are more than five zombies onscreen apparently to I guess cover up a bad job on makeup... or something to that effect. If the first had too much make up and such this has too little. The acting is decent enough. Milla Jovovich gives the same good performance that she usually does. The rest of the cast are acceptable. The characters are mostly clichs and stereotypes. Of course by mostly I mean almost 90 of the cases. You got the stupid reporter who just wants to make a story out of all of this despite her being in obvious danger The badass cop who's suspended but still takes her duty deadly serious the halfwitted pathetic guy who's obviously only there for comic relief... actually scratch that last one as he was actually pretty darn funny. For once the person who's supposed to be there for comic relief works instead of just being the mostor even worse least laughable character. The special effects were well done but not spectacular. Definitely not the best I've seen. The action was good but really overthetop. The scenes with the Nemesis range between being some of the best action in the movie to being some of the most pathetic and smirkinspiring scenes. The cinematography is nothing special. The film introduced an unnecessary amount of characters most of whom are just fodder for the zombies or Nemesis anyway. The showdown between Alice and Nemesis was somewhat pathetically staged and probably would have seemed out of place hadn't the rest of the film been of the same qualityhonestly it seemed like a videogame... and while I am quite a big fan of them I'm considerably more interested in playing them than watching them. That big ol' hunk o' biologically engineered walking death was simultaneously underdevelopedfor what they had himit do and overexposed. The film is noisy and loud but not as loud as the first film and while the sound is often horribly overdone it doesn't distract as much as several other big action hits. The film is also less loud when it comes to the soundtrack it was nice to have some change from the onenote loud heavy metal from the first film. All in all a pretty entertaining flick but out of your mind much faster than it got inand that's saying a lot believe me. If you liked the first are a big fan of one or more of the actors or you just have nothing better to do for 90 minutes give it a shot. It kept me watching through the end and despite a few disappointments kept my interest as well. It just didn't stay fresh in my head for more than about fifteen minutes after the credits started which is very little for a film with so much going on in it all the time. I recommend it only to big fans of the first or of Milla Jovovich. I suppose big fans of Paul W. S. Andersonthey must exist somewhere will probably enjoy it too. I will say that most who liked the first will probably like this as well but possibly a little less due to the lesser directing. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I think that's what makes IMDb such a great site for reviews. When a movie trailer peaks my interest one of the first things I do is come to this site to see what others have thought about the film. Usually there are a variety of opinions ranging from excellent to pure crap for any movie no matter how ridiculous it may seem to me and I respect that. It's very disappointing however to check the reviews and see that virtually no one appreciated a movie that I had high hopes for but have yet to watch. It happened with AvP in which complaints of bad lighting bad angles on combat scenes and a general absentmindedness for logic in the plot ruined any anticipation that built up when watching the trailer over and over. But as I have said everyone has an opinion and that's what makes sites like this worth checking out. I have benefited from fair reviews in which the critic still disapproves of a movie but lists it's merits as well as it's faults.I hope to give a fair review for Resident Evil Apocalypse. First off I liked this movie a little better than the first actually. Apocalypse had a sense of urgency that I thought kept the plot rolling at a nice pace. The actor's performances were alright I mean really there was nothing too challenging about their roles. They just had to be convincing at looking scared angry and eventually dead. The story was laid out decently enough nothing too innovative or complex but then again there was nothing innovative or complex about the games in which this movie was based from. I was a fan of the games for the action and the sheer expasiveness of the settings where the game was played. And that's what I think made this sequel so enjoyable. There were more references and subtle details thrown into this movie making it a more complete game to movie conversion. The action scenes were okay entertaining and not dragged out. The special effect scenes involving the lickers explosions etc were par for the course really but it was nice to see the slowmo bullet sequence appear here as it has become a staple of any movie in which a gun is used since the success of the first Matrix and whatever movie the Wachowski Bros ripped it from. The overall location and set of this movie are fantastic which is it's real claim to fame here. Eerie atmosphere labyrinthine city danger around every corner gave the movie the edge that the first didn't quite nail. And finally the costumes were passable. I liked the Nemesis design very true to the game and brought to the movie with the same intensity as it had in RE 3. And finally what everyone thought sent the movie overboard was the UberAlice. Did it ruin the movie? Not really. Could the movie have ended the same way if ALice didn't have these powers I think so. But it would have taken some thought. They destroyed the mutated licker in RE1 okay enough without super powers. Why not just steal Nemesis' bazooka?The review is getting long here so I'll wrap it up quickly. Resident Evil Apocalypse is a good movie if measured in terms of action explosions and atmosphere. It's not going to win any awards for acting at the Oscars and it's certainly not getting any attention in the horror genre for new and innovative ways to kill people. It's just a flatout good flick worth a matine price.".

I remember the first movie was okay so i decided to see the second one ONLY BECAUSE the trailer made it seem like she was in the same setting as the resident evil 2 video game. The game rocked! Within the first 5 minutes of me watching RE Apocalypse I knew it would suck. How crappy was the first scene with those astronauts entering the vault and getting the parasite lose. The movie sucked. Oh my god i cant stress the fact enough. How is it that you cant shoot one of those licker things in the church with bullets because they dodge them but the hero of the story can jump off of her motorcycle and crash it into the monster sending both the motorcycle and the monster 100 feet into the air... Then blowing the motorcycle up a perfectly good vehicle to use during this chaos. This movie was so bad i thought i was infected with the TVirus when i had a strange urge to eat the brains of the people next to me in the movie theater... but they wouldn't mind they were watching the most brainless movie ever.".

He doesn't look disgusting but threatening. Action sequence is grander than the first film. The church scene the rooftop and the final fight are wellchoreographed. However it fell short on horror which is one of the three main genres of the video game franchise that serves as the source material.The film shows how more evil Umbrella can get and this is scary for the real world. The plot twist is unexpected and confusing. It's obvious that there's a need for a second sequel. I'm giving the film 8 of 10. Again I'm looking for scifi action and horror but it fell short on the horror genre. However this is an actionpacked film.".

Angie was to be taken to him but her car crashed forcing her to take cover in her school.So Dr.Ashford contracts the Survivors Alice Jill SJ Mike Epps and Carlos and makes them a deal in return for a way out of the city they will rescues his daughter.Things get worst as Cain sends Nemesis after them from Resident Evil 3 played by Matthew G Taylor. Nemesis really was a force to be deal with. Nemesis was very dangerous in the video game because he could run dodge attacks and chase the player into different areas of the game. Nemesis in this movie is very much like his video game counterpart.So yeah I felt like they really did a lot of tributes to the games with this movie and in my opinion the story was very well done because of the way they mix action and horror in the movie.Being this is my favorite of the series I think it is the best out of the ones that were made and I'm glad to have it and have seen it in the theaters.I give Resident EvilApocalypse a 10 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this movie about two years ago but I didn't bother to write a review about it or anything. To tell the truth I was so mad at the movie and those who made it that I couldn't watch it without yelling at the television screen.Being an ardent fan of the Resident Evil video games  I've played and beaten all but one  I was not only disappointed by this movie and it's predecessor which I haven't seen enough times to review fortunately but I was angered by the complete disregard that the people who created the film had for the story of the games.Alice doesn't exist in the Resident Evil video games. She has never existed in the video games. At first I had held out a hope of tying her into the video game plot perhaps via the TVeronica Virus of Resident Evil Code Veronica for the Dreamcast and Playstation 2 but they let me down. All they created her for was to have a sexy uberpowerful female lead  a Mary Sue for the big screen.They introduce Jill in this movie... for what reason? Oh right so they can get the hopes up of fans of the video games because maybe just maybe this will start to sound more like the real thing and less like a thirteenyearold's fanfiction story. But they disappoint yet again proving that they only brought Jill in to make Alice look better  by being stronger than Jill and showing her up. Carlos Oliviera who accompanied Jill in the Resident Evil 3 game also appears in this movie... only to be stripped of his accent and identity reduced to little more than a standby to shoot at things that get too close. Oh wait for one line they did attempt an accent  an Egyptian one. What part of the name Carlos Oliviera suggested to them that he might be best played by an Egyptian actor? Because really I was thinking that Spanish would be much more appropriate.Two minor characters from the game also make appearances  in name only  in this game Nikolai and Mikael. Of course in keeping with this sad excuse for a movie they don't resemble their video game selves in any way shape or form. Oh wait. Nikolai's still blonde. My bad.Not even Umbrella resembles itself in this movie. The Hive isn't present in any of the games  there is a main Umbrella headquarters but it's in Europe and it certainly isn't any kind of huge underground hive structure. I'm pretty sure someone would have noticed it long before this movie  the government for example. There are reasons why in the game Umbrella's bioweapon branch works in absolute secrecy in hidden underground labs.Then there's Nemesis who is Jill's rivalboss monster in the Resident Evil 3 game. Apparently he used to be Alice's boyfriend  I'm not entirely sure about that and I think it was a stupid subplot  and... I'm sorry when did they ever give an indication that Nemesis had a heart? The plot to this movie was also flimsy and the dialog terrible. I wouldn't have been able to watch the whole thing if it weren't for the laughs I got out of how terribly they did this.I don't understand why they felt the need to attach the Resident Evil name to these awful movies if all that they were going to do was take it so wildly away from the games that it's hardly recognizable anymore.I don't know about the rest of you but the only way I think these movies can be redeemed would be if Alice dies a horrible painful and above all permanent death in the next one.".

But any resident evil game fan well quickly realize that it was a pathetic excuse for there money. Overall if your a zombie movie fan avoid this and see the Dawn Of The Dead remake or 28 days later If your a resident evil fan it might be worth a rental I guess if you liked the first one.

At the start they showed what happened in Racoon city before Alice woke up in the Hospital which was sensible and the first appearance of Nemesis was so cool when he wiped out the S.T.A.R.S team. My most favourite scene in the film is when Alice was running down the building. In the second part they went a lot deeper into the TVirus  it was a bit confusing but in the first it was very straightforward. The whole film is very similar to Resident Evil 3 Nemesis the scene where Alice was running across the building while the helicopter was trying to shoot her and when she was cornered she dropped her gun  caught it before it hit the floor was taken from the game Resident Evil Code Veronica X.

With her flawless perfection of shot and ample bosom how could anyone despise this movie...for laughs.

No one BLOGGED ABOUT IT? Information wants to be free! 2. This stuff reanimates dead flesh. Somehow it managed to seep through the ground and into the coffins of people who had been dead for 20 years. Even though there shouldn't have been any flesh to reanimate not to mention they moved like muscles hadn't atrophied tendons hadn't turned to so much body goo and chunks o'flesh.3. The stated reason for closing off the only exit from this city was to keep the infection in. Though there were OTHER EXITS that could have been destroyed by ramming a truck into them no one went to them. Horror movie stupidity. Who would say ah they're right I could never scale that wall using mountaineering equipment. I'd rather stay in this place with dead people trying to eat my flesh!4. The stuff managed to reanimate dead dogs somehow and created some other undead creatures though no explanation was given for them. If it could do dogs though that means all animals are fair game meaning that rats for an example could be brought back from the dead. Rats will always escape. There are sewers they can climb walls they can jump pretty damn high. There is no such thing as containing a plague that infects animals. There are dead birds all over the place none of them flew out and infected people with deceased bird poo? Even gerbils and hamsters can get away so says Richard Gere.5. Other minor nits are zombies that were sometimes smart sometimes dumb using doors vs. scratching at them zombies that were either superfast ala 28 days later or superslow and so comical who would be afraid? You could outrun them by speedwalking! The Grandmas of Doom the speedwalking gang that used to harass me in the mall could have taken them down.In closing see this movie only if you don't mind turning off your brain and watching action. Don't think. It will fall apart in front of your eyes. I hate this movie so much and it's definitely an insult to horror movies in general and the first movie in specific.".

Though the bad guy seemed like he was doing a poor man's Schindler. The FX was fairly decent and the movie never becomes boring it's too fast paced for that. Some of the sets were obviously based on the games. At least it made me jump out of my seat a few times. Needless to say a third one seems very likely but i like where there going with one scene reminding me of Brian De Palma's The Fury. 6 out of 10".

Of course he is only bluffing and it doesn't take long before the palpable sense of doom and despair convinces you otherwise. Welcome back to the magical world of Harry Potter one that began with wonder and joy but has since become shrouded in death and darkness. Still visibly distraught from the death of his mentor Professor Albus Dumbledore Harry is now tasked to continue with the mission of the late Dumbledore to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes accursed objects containing fragments of Voldemort's soul. It doesn't get any easier since Voldemort is nearing the height of his powers and his bidders have infiltrated the bureaucracy to paint Harry as a wanted criminal. There are fewer and fewer allies around even those within the Order of the Phoenix may have since betrayed their ranks and the first half hour quickly establishes the danger and urgency of the situation at hand. Members of the Order including MadEye Moody Brendan Gleeson and Hagrid Robbie Coltrane attempt to escort Harry to safety but even that mission is met with an attack from the Death Eaters culminating in a dizzyingly exciting highspeed flyingbike chase that shouldn't disappoint fans looking for some action sorely missed in the last movie. Indeed naysayers who think David Yates doesn't know how to stage thrilling action sequences should think again as he demonstrates amply that he is just as capable when it comes to staging them. He also displays an uncanny knack for milking suspense out of scenes in particular Harry Hermoine and Ron's daring raid on the Ministry of Magic and their subsequent visit to Godric's Hollow Harry's birthplace and home to Bathilda Bagshot a magician and dear friend to Dumbledore. These brim with nailbiting tension and Yates plays them out nicely to set your pulse racing at the end. The crux of this film however lies in the relationships between Harry Hermoine and Ron as they set off in the middle of the film across the bleak English countryside on their quest to discover the means to destroy the Horcruxes. On the run from Voldemort the trio find the immensity of their journey taking a toll on them. Harry and Ron's friendship begins to fray as Ron grows suspect of Hermoine's affections for Harry. Meanwhile Harry can barely conceal his frustration with getting no headway and starts losing his temper at Ron. Infused with a profound sense of isolation and loss this middle stretch in the film may be tedious for some impatient viewers but fans will be rewarded with probably the richest depiction of the relationships between the characters since the first two movies. One scene where Harry and Hermoine suddenly decide to dance together to the tune of Nick Cave's The Children playing on the radio is lyrical in its depiction of their desperate attempt to find levity in a world that affords none. Yes their friendship strong and deep since the beginning will be tested and Yates delivers an emotional payoff towards the end of the film that is truly poignant. Thanks to the decision to split the final book into two films Yates doesn't hurry through these scenes. Instead he allows the audience to experience the frustration jealousy and uncertainty of his characters and allows for Radcliffe Watson and Grint to display some fine acting with the minimalest distraction from any visual effects. The additional time also turns out to be a blessing for fans and audiences allowing them the opportunity to see their favourite supporting characters back on screen most prominently of course Dobby the elf who returns to give the movie a touching finale. Amidst the gloom screenwriter Steve Kloves again provides for rare welcome moments of levity. Harry's escort mission is aided by magical decoys of Harry one of them wearing a bra. To get to the Ministry of Magic one needs to flush oneself down a toilet bowl. These occasional sparks of humour enliven a film that is otherwise ominous and menacing. Kloves however fumbles slightly with the lengthy expository and those who have not read the book will find themselves struggling to catch up with the significance of certain characters e.g. Sirius' brother Regulus Arcturus Black and certain events e.g. Bathilda turning into a slithering serpent. Still Kloves never had an enviable task to begin with and Yates at his most confident here guides the proceedings along admirably unfolding them briskly at the start then settling in for a deliberately measured pace and finally picking up speed for as much as a climax as this first parter can have. His assuredness also shows in his artistic choices especially a wayangkulitlike animated sequence telling the story of the Deathly Hallows. Though we know better than to expect the grand showdown between Harry and Voldemort by the end of the film there is still a distinct sense that what we have seen so far is only a buildup for something bigger and far more astounding. But even as a prelude this seventh film is notable in its own right a tense and thrilling experience darker scarier and more mature than any of its predecessors".

	schema:reviewBody "After having seen HP6 I honestly didn't have great expectations in this one. I guessed it would be darker and scarier as every HP movie has been darker and scarier than its predecessor. But HP6 was such a patchwork of scenes that didn't give you the feeling of a coherent work  I was afraid the even more complex story line of HP7 would make an even less coherent movie. However I must say it was definitely a wise decision to split the 7th book into 2 movies. HP7 can take time to explain and introduce all the characters that are necessary to the plot.I love the way Voldemort and the Death Eaters are portrayed in this movie. They are no longer just anonymous caped figures. You can see them interacting with each other discussing and well... being human. Well I'm always a big fan of the blurring of these clearcut goodevil categories in Fantasy.As the book is split into 2 parts all of a sudden there's also time for little embellishments I hadn't realized I had missed in the earlier movies! For example I loved the scene so much where the feather floated through the air when the fairy tale of the Three Brothers was being told. Also the drawing style that was used during the story was really amazing. This HP movie was the first of all that finally gave me the same feeling as Lord of the Rings did Boy this is not just some guys slavishly adapting a book into a movie but they're actually autonomous artists and they have ideas of their own! And I don't mean they changed the whole plot I wouldn't like that! But mostly visually they did more than just bring across what's in the book.This also expresses itself in the decision not to include the childish Harry Potter musical theme at least I didn't hear it correct me if I'm wrong from the first movie that sounds like Wow everything's so magical here! That tune was fine for the first movie but as Harry got older and the movies got darker it kind of felt like they had to force this theme into every movie several times even though it didn't really fit any more. Now the soundtrack too has finally grown up. And I loved it! Last but not least the acting was brilliant! The tense atmosphere between Harry Ron and Hermione really came across. Also with all the doppelgnger scenes you always still saw from their movements and behaviour which character was which though they were in disguise in a different body.All in all as the title says this is a excellent grownup movie and I can recommend it to everyone  except kids! If you have little kids please don't take them. This movie has far too many scary scenes and little comic relief! Plus the plot is quit complex including lots and lots of minor characters. It's really no longer a movie targeted at kids even though it's still labelled Harry Potter.".

	schema:reviewBody "It should be wise for people to at least watch the first six films in order before watching this one if they haven't read the books already.With this film we are slowly but surely bidding farewell to one of cinema's most successful and imaginative franchises. The franchise like Harry Potter himself has grown and matured as the years and films progress. Part I of the Deathly Hallows is ultimately a strong build up to what will be a triumphant bittersweet finale for everybody.I won't waste time trying to talk about the performances because they are all great and powerful in their own way. Never mind that many of the cast members are very talented veteran British actors try getting John Hurt Alan Rickman Ralph Fiennes Brendan Gleeson David Thewlis Michael Gambon Helena Bonham Carter Imelda Staunton Jason Isaacs and Bill Nighy in the same film again  the three young actors who we have come to love and care for following the first film a decade ago basically carry the franchise on their shoulders and this film is no exception. Radcliffe looks handsome Grint looks gruff and Watson looks gorgeous. They've grown into fine young people.Screenwriter Steve Kloves doesn't forget to add the mood and gloom to the story as it slowly unfolds but then again he adds some light humor to the film when it needs it. Bonus points for making this not only a visual spectacle but also a characterdriven ensemble there's some complex characterization here. Also there's some action which aren't seen on screen but mentioned by the characters. It's OK because it's necessary for the brisk pacing and it's not really that important anyways. Besides the human mind can imagine these images far more powerfully.There are many themes in this film. Sacrifice determination obviously friendship and above all  acceptance. As the films progressed the films started to gain an increasingly dark momentum  signaling that all hope may be lost. But in the end will good triumph over evil? Like the film real life isn't so sure. Also the fact that the actors and crew are moving on after a decade of making these films  it's also another way of acceptance  the films have ended they're moving on for the better of their livescareers. It's real life and I wish all these promising young actors brilliant lives and careers ahead of them.Hallows Part I is many parts thrilling as there are quite a number of intense action sequences. Many of them of course are done with wellrendered visual effects and in this one they just blend in at a natural level without being too jarring. However the action sequences are perfectly blended in with the gripping dramatic moments. They don't feel heavy handed and it's beautiful to look at. The animated sequence about the origins of the Deathly Hallows is an absolute masterclass and jawdroppingly beautiful to both watch and listen. If separated by itself it can win an Oscar for best animated short. The crew also get their due here. David Yates has gotten a firm grip on the film's direction since directing the fifth and sixth films years ago. The cinematography is stunning and exquisite and it gives off a certain moody hue to the film. The editing is also crisp it's not choppy when it doesn't need to be. Alexandre Desplat's score really makes a difference it literally puts you into the world with its beautiful harmonious and emotional tones.In short I would have to say that this film is the best Harry Potter film yet in all honesty. I grew up with the series and as per the actors it will be an emotional goodbye. But rest assured the finale will be grand.One more thing. This interpretation of the novel is the best one yet. The novel is done justice something not seen since the first three films. It's something for both the fans and novelreaders alike as there are some pieces only book readers can discover while watching the film. It's definitely a huge improvement over HalfBlood Prince's adaptation which for me is the worst Potter film.Harry Potter is a phenomenon. But like all things it most come to an end eventually. This is the beginning of the end and I wouldn't have it any other way.Overall rating 75100P.S.Eat your hearts out Twihards.".

	schema:reviewBody "I confess. I read the book about a dozen times in the past few years. It's not like I don't do anything else but I do. In a year I probably get through about 2530 books. So reading HP and the DH was just something I was enjoying. There are clues in various places in the books and you just have to marvel at how Jo Rowling tied up all the ends so nicely in the last one.The one thing though that I felt was off in 7 was how she portrayed Hagrid. In a few cases it seemed like she was treating him like a buffoon but that's a personal opinion not something that critically could be considered wrong with the book.But the last book kept elements close together. It brought in all the old characters added a few new ones but basically held together things with bonds of steel. The relationships were both old and new with a true feeling of family and friendships. And we all celebrated the good times in the book and lamented the bad times.So when MadEye Moody gets killed so early in the book a feeling of loss goes with him. When Fleur is so happy to be marrying Bill we're all happy for them both. When we see Kreacher turn from a foul houseelf to a fine houseservant we're happy for him. When Tonks tells us she is pregnant we celebrate! But almost none of that is in the movie. We know instinctively that those things happened in the book but if you haven't read them you're going to go WTF? an awful lot.MadEye is killed in the chase but there isn't a toast to this memory. When Fleur is so intense about the wedding we see no real emotion but for one brief moment. When the trio leaves Kreacher for their exploits at the ministry we have no idea how much he has changed. And when Tonks and Lupin go off there is nothing to suggest the very sad and aching love they have for each other and about Remus's hesitation about his upcoming fatherhood.There is no investment in these characters in the film. It's like strip the souls from everyone but Ron Harry and Hermione make the others more melodramatic with no attachment to the real story and voil! you have Deathly Hallows Part One. I confess I don't like David Yates' direction. There has been something off about it since OOTP though I might be one of the few who think that. I think his often amateurish direction is quite obvious in this film. The film is often like a roller coaster with giddy high points either in the action or the tone but there are also many very low points and there is nothing in the middle. We don't LEARN anything from the characterswe follow them on their journey yes but we have to inject too much of the overall plot from the book to see what has been left out and what is still present. There are times when a collage filming of the many places the trio and in the middle the duo went could get that section speeded up without weighing it down a friend with me found the middle WAY too slow and at times a more polished director could have found ways to make the scenes pack a lot more information into them. It certainly didn't look like the kids weren't eating a whole lot or how much Hermione actually fit into her small pocketbook. The scene that could have managed that would have been the scene in the book where Hermione packs the full sized painting of Sirius Black's relative Phinea Black former headmaster of Hogwarts into her bag. But it was not to be.I think if there had been a consistent tone during the film it would have helped bring a more cohesive tone to the film interlocking all the elements into one. But there wasn't that kind of a feeling in it and I am disappointed that it didn't happen.I might be one of the very few fans who feels the film wasn't a very good one. Yes it's only half of a whole and the second half might be a totally different one emotionally and dramatically. But I just need to say to fans go with the warning that there are a lot of faults with this installment and accept it just as a nice visual film with very very little to do with the entire HP legacy. It probably won't help and you will be filling in the blanks from the books but it's certainly better than nothing.".

Yes it's only half of a whole and the second half might be a totally different one emotionally and dramatically. But I just need to say to fans go with the warning that there are a lot of faults with this installment and accept it just as a nice visual film with very very little to do with the entire HP legacy. It probably won't help and you will be filling in the blanks from the books but it's certainly better than nothing.";

	schema:reviewBody "Deathly Hallows Part 1 follows the book closely but misses out on a few interesting scenes and then makes up a few additional scenes that are poignant and incredibly welcome. In the beginning it seems like the film's skipping through the book's content very quickly but it makes sense when you realise how much is going on. At the end the beginning is far away although the journey there doesn't make it seem like a long while. General opinion seems to be that it drags in the middle but let's face it so did the book. There's no real reason to complain about Endless Camping Trips at all because the film moves from plot point to set piece to plot point all the time. There's some clever ways the film handles its exposition although it is not without its faults. The trio's acting is the second best thing in this film. Emma has improved loads over the past few years and she seems to be at the top of her game in this film. Her acting is stellar. As usual Grint gets saddled with the role of comic relief but he also gets his chance to shine in an array of emotional scenes. Daniel manages to carry the story as the main character. The three manage to stand their own very well without the presence of the adult actors.Speaking of adult actors Nick Morran's Scabior is a delightful character  he's slightly perverted and he has a bit of a Jack Sparrow vibe going on. Peter Mullan's Yaxley was impressive and managed to be quite threatening. It is a shame that we see so little of Bill Nighy's character the new Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour. The character was regrettably cut from the previous film and I wish they hadn't if only to see more of Nighy's impressive performance. Oldtime familiar faces are great as usual. Fiona Shaw gets but one shot of screen time but the look in her eyes says so much about her character. Jasoon Isaacs is terrific as a broken and devastated Lucius Malfoy. The lack of Rickman is a shame but the presence of Bonham Carter makes up for it. Big baddie Ralph Fiennes manages to finally be a menacing scary Voldemort in the film's first scenes but as the story progresses and he gets appearances in a few messy rushed and disappointing visions Voldemort's actions just don't continue being an ominous cloud of danger as they should be. The film's greatest achievement however is the animated sequence detailing the Tale of the Three Brothers an interesting wizard fairytale. It is a daring move from the filmmakers one that will pleasantly surprise the audience.The biggest letdown is how the film doesn't just keep going. After twoandahalf hours it doesn't feel like the story's finished. A few scenes were added to make the climax more exciting but it's just a downright shame that the movie doesn't just continue for another hour or two.".

The Icky Men take the trio to where Voldemort lives but Voldemort is away for the time being and will return momentarily in the mean time won't you have a seat in this lovely damp prison cell while Bellatrix attempts to torture Hermione by biting her neck or whatever it is that she's doing?Voldemort doesn't show up it's a very long holiday he's taking and he can't be disturbed but Dobby does.

Fade to black and Voldemort pops up who's taken the failed capture of his worst enemy rather well given the circumstances and desecrates Dumbledore's tomb and Dumbledore is amazingly fresh and undecomposed and takes Dumbledore's wand. He shoots a random red flare into the sky that serves no purpose whatsoever and the credits roll. Finally.Part 2. How exciting!".

	schema:headline " This gets better and better. Let's get ready for the final one!!";
	schema:reviewBody "Right from the very start when the Warner Bros logo appears this film feels different. The colours are gray and muted the sound is a low rumble and even the famous theme from John Williams seems to have given way to a much darker drone. It doesn't even feel like a Harry Potter movie anymore. It makes the first Chris Columbus movies feel like they are from a whole different universe. And this feeling stayed with me right until the end For the last few instalments of the series possibly from number 3 onwards we've been hearing a lot of this one is darker type of lines being bantered about whether from the critics the fans or even the filmmakers themselves. But it's never been more true than in this final chapter.And yet this is not just a darker and scarier film it is also a much more mature one too. It's as if the filmmakers have grown together with their viewers who are now 10 years older than they were when the first movie got released A few years ago when we first heard about the fact that the seventh and final book was going to be divided into two films we all cynically thought straight away They really want to squeeze every single penny out of this last one those greedy people. And I am sure that must have been one of the reasons however director David Yates has been able to take advantage of this extra time to give the story a certain amount of depth sophistication and gravitas that was missing from all the previous instalments.The pace is a lot slower for a start. Of course you get some cracking action scenes too a particular good one through the Dartfor Tunnel some great visuals whether just the perfect vistas and landscapes the inventive special effects the scene in the trailer too where there are about 8 different Potters is all done in one perfect 360 degree shot and there's even a beautiful short animation sequence where The Tale of the Three Brothers is shown as a shadowplay and that by itself should almost be nominated for an Oscar for BEST animated short but the real core of the movie this time are actually the 3 main characters. Their dialogue scenes take centre stage and are played in the most realistic possible way with long silences pauses and meaningful looks.Even the music is a lot more subtle and understated aside from being of course a lot darker. There's a particular chase scene in a forest towards the second half of the movie where unexpectedly they decided not to play any music at all just letting the sound effects play through that is very very unusual for a blockbuster of this calibre.The film bravely takes a lot of risks on one hand by veering away from what kids are probably expecting but at the same time it'll give fans a real treat and it might even change the minds of some of those Harry Potter haters! It is a film about emotions about characters about friendship first and foremost and it all happens to take place in a magical world. It's what every single avid Harry Potter reader has been waiting for years.In a way the mood of the film is much closer to the Lord of the Rings trilogy not just in the muted colours of the landscape or in the grittier looks of the characters even Harry Potter looks dirtier this time and has even got a bit of a beard! but in the way it's paced and constructed.It's essentially a road movie it's also the first film to be Hogwardfree. We only get one quick glimpse of the train going to the school but that's about it. There are much fewer laughs throughout and most of them come from Ron Rupert Grint but somehow when they do come they seem to work a lot better than they ever did. Maybe because the whole film is so tense that you are just craving for a moment to relax let the tension fade. And this is by no means a criticism in fact quite the opposite.By all means this isn't a masterpiece. For all the tension the great atmosphere and all the brave intentions there are some slightly clunky moments here and there too. For example the scene where Ron comes back and rejoins the group feels a bit out of the blue and could have been handled in a better way. Also some of the dialogue doesn't quite ring true and too many characters come in and out like bellboys in a hotel. But it's interesting to notice how most of the stuff that doesn't quite work in the film has actually been lifted straight from the books. I think once again the film exposes the weaknesses of the book which c'mon let's face it however gripping it wasn't really a great piece of writing. I loved it in fact I loved the whole series but I recognise its limits.It's good to see them trying something different. It's good to see them slowing down a bit and taking good care of their characters. It's good to see them trying to be more mature and stir away from cheesy clichs. I can see why this is JK Rowling's favourite movie.I was happy with it too but then again I love Harry Potter so I am probably biased.Summer 2011 cannot be here soon enough. And after that? Oh dear I am already so sad that it's all going to be over See the full review here httpwp.mep19wJ23v".

It is a movie that has characters with the same names and faces but they are in an alternative universe one created by David Yates starting in movie 5. In that universe all the themes and ideas developed in the bookbased Harry Potter mythology are gone. In its place is a story about an individual boy wizard and his teen friends. What happened to the great choices Harry has to make like does he go after the Horcruxes as Dumbledore instructed or does he get sidetracked looking for the Deathly Hallows? Horcruxes are thrown in as a McGuffin an excuse to take a group camping trip rather than as the key to the whole mystery how do you destroy evil without destroying yourself. The Hallows are the great temptation that the animation in this movie beautifully suggests but then they are completely ignored for the rest of the movies. Remember that Dumbledore and Gregorovich once had a notion of The Greater Good and that idea did not die with the end of their friendship. Dumbledore tried to teach Harry that what he was doing was not for himself it was for the greater good of all beings not just purebloods and certainly not just for teenagers. Okay did you get any of this from this movie? NO because it has all been washed out of the story and replaced with silly teen anxieties and individual relationships. How very sad.".

What's great about this film is that we feel the emotions the characters go through probably because this movie follows the book very closely.

Thankfully all this especially the last mentioned bit does not occur in 3D as previously planned. Be warned not everyone has the stomach to endure the furious thrills that follow every time Voldemort's enormous snake makes an appearance.And while Voldemort himself only shows up during the first and final scene his towering baritone and intimidating personality more than make up for the break. Fiennes conducts the foulfaced antagonist with such exquisite terror and theatrical charisma he's assured to earn a seat in the realm of cinema's greatest villains.

	schema:headline " A big improvement in the series!";
	schema:reviewBody "In my mind the Deathly Hallows Part 1 captured the feeling of exactly what the Harry Potter movies should have been all along gritty emotional and cinematic. I haven't been a huge fan of any of the HP movies to date but I was pleased with the Deathly Hallows because it took a big step up in maturity from the children's fantasy genre and focused on themes very central to the seventh book hopelessness and desperation. After the death of Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore the magical world falls into disarray as Voldemort gains power over the Ministry of Magic and hunts tirelessly after his mortal enemy and our continuing protagonist Harry Potter. While keeping a low cover Harry Ron and Hermoine decide to track down and destroy Voldemort's soul contained in hidden horcruxes but have difficulties deciding what to do and where to start.The Deathly Hallows very successfully portrays the despairfilled journey of the wizarding trio. With dark undertones running through the cinematography Part 1 of the Harry Potter finale is the film that deals more with the emotional stagnation of the characters and spends less time with action scenes and major plot points. Since Rowling's seventh book is separated into two movies Part 1 boasts a much slower pace than earlier HP films and is not so focused on cramming as many subplots and sidestories from the book as possible into the movie's runtime which tends to clutter up the storyline and make the whole thing feel rushed. But where the slow pacing makes this film stand out in the series it also may be its downfall. The Deathly Hallows continually feeds us a feeling of desolation as Harry Ron and Hermoine fail to discover a way to destroy the horcruxes they seem to be making no progress towards defeating the Dark Lord but as an effect the movie seems to be making no progress towards an ending. Storyline lags intensely towards the middle of the film and is dragged out until the conclusion which ends abruptly. You'll be left in your seats feeling like this is going nowhere but that's the point Harry Ron and Hermoine are getting nowhere. So I liked this movie because the pace was slow but I also didn't like this movie because the pace was slow. See what I'm getting at? Aside from that I can't complain much. Performances were fine effects were impressive and best of all nothing dastardly was done to J.K. Rowling's story.The Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a nice improvement and a fine addition to the Harry Potter series and should serve as a solid emotional base for Part 2 to take off with next year. If you've enjoyed the HP movies so far this should be a satisfying experience at least. If not let the Deathly Hallows Part 1 redeem your faith in the series. 710P.S. Keep on the lookout for the scene about the deathly hallows story. It has some of the most beautiful and artistic animation I have ever seen in a movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even having read every Harry Potter book and seen every Harry Potter film I still hesitate to call myself a fan. It isn't that I don't enjoy the world J.K. Rowling invented or the characters she created but rather that my enjoyment of the series has always been transient. With sometimes years between each subsequent release my memory of the litany of events preceding them is often shaky at best and I've never felt particularly inclined to revisit.Inasmuch every Harry Potter has been almost an insular experience for me. I enjoyed the film series as pure Hollywood spectacle but have always felt their independent merits were questionable at best. In that regard taking into account I haven't seen The Sorcerer's Stone since I was in high school Deathly Hallows Part 1 may be the weakest in the series. Curiously in others ways it's the best.I love that director David Yates pumps the breaks for this adaptationthat he actually gives the material breathing room allowing it to be more than a featurelength amusement park ride. On a technical and artistic level there is a lot I admire about his team's work on this penultimate adventure. But at two and a half hours covering only half a book there's no getting around the fact that Deathly Hallows is perhaps the least exciting and inherently least completefeeling film in the franchise.I get it Warner Brothers. Splitting the final Harry Potter into two parts was a brilliant marketing decision. It's hard to lie down and watch a cash cow die and I'm sure many consumers will even relish the grandeur of a twopart finale. From a creative perspective however Rowling's Deathly Hallows might be the worst book in the series to divide.The bloated first half of her novel features a few action sequences peppered in out of necessity but Rowling's authorial stalling is what translates most clearly in this film. Painfully little transpires rendering probably the most faithful adaptation of her work as the weakest cinematically. Of course Potter portrayer Daniel Radcliff and co. do as admiral a job as always in breathing life into the characters and humanizing the often absurd plot developments and plethora of plotholes a magic world entails but nothing can save Deathly Hallows Part 1 from feeling like half of a storyor more precisely one eighth of a story.Unlike prior Potter outings Deathly Hallows also overrelies on the hunting of mystical artifacts. Major story arcs and characters are ignored in favor of horcruxestrinkets imbued with pieces of Voldemort's soul that Harry must seek and destroy before their climactic confrontation. The titular deathly hallows are then yet another collection of requisite magic items between the hallows and the horcruxes Harry Potter 7 feels like one tedious fetch quest.That may be enough to satiate some Pottermaniacs but even having read every book and seen every film I'm not devoted enough to the franchise to overlook that Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a shameless cashgrab. It's a film almost inappreciable when considered on its own and unexciting when compared to its prequels. There is no reason Rowling's last Harry Potter book which is not the longest in the series couldn't have been concisely and effectively wrapped up in two and a half hours and asking audiences to pay twice for one film strikes me as more than a little unfair. Deathly Hallows Part 1 is a colossal teasecrippled on its own and treading water in context its never more than half a film. It's only fair it get half a score.".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1";
	schema:reviewBody "This is not a run of the mill series but something which has been intricately planned for from almost the very beginning. With the last few films crafting the level of suspense into a crescendo where each film augments the impending doom and gloom culminating in the finale seen in The Half Blood Prince things get a lot worst here from the start where The Deathly Hallows begins with a grim reminder from the Minister of Magic before we see Voldemort Ralph Fiennes and his ghastly lieutenants plot to take over both realms Muggle or not in quite Fascist terms.Yes you read that right and what I thought was quite the brilliant stroke of genius to transmit that level of fear and dread into the Potter world through something quite familiar in our world where there's a takeover of ministries and the installation of past villains who are puppets of the regime the continued discrimination and probable extermination of the ordinary non magical Muggles and even the halfbreeds against those who are of pure magical blood and a curious scene where a disguised Potter head inside the undergrounds of the Ministry only to see propaganda being created by the masses in creepy clockwork like fashion.Everything is doom and gloom with copious amounts of shades shadows black and grey save for Hermione's red dress in one scene where our heroic trio are quite clueless without their guardian headmaster Dumbledore Michael Gambon always ready to pull some strings from behind the scenes. His absence is largely felt and they are left mostly to their own devices and smarts to try and figure out a way to get to the remaining Horcruxes and to destroy them. They become the hunted with little allies to rely on where betrayal seem the norm almost from within their own circle of trust as well where a major subplot continues to dwell on the suggested romanticplatonic dynamics between Hermione with Harry and Ron the former sharing a curious dance sequence while on the run and the latter well having his worst fear confront his lack of courage to tell Hermione just how he feels for her well from how many films ago.So the verdict is whether The Deathly Hallows warranted two films. My answer is a resounding definite yes because there's so much going on in the story of the relationships and friendships forged over the years of the closure both good and bad that has to come to the myriad of characters introduced J.K. Rowling doesn't show a lot of mercy by the way and not to mention the inherent quest that Harry Ron and Hermione chose to embark on that has gone beyond just the survival of Harry Potter and what's more introduces to us what those Deathly Hallows actually are which goes just beyond the destruction of the Horcuxes. Danger lurks at every corner and the narrative spins at breakneck speed harrowing most times with the frequent close shaves the rookies encounter against their enemies who are growing more powerful by the minute.While the previous films have boasted special effects extravaganzas be it little things to pepper the scene or large battles between wizards and witches this is kept surprisingly muted in the film since it's swaying on one end of the spectrum with Evil gaining an upper hand and most of the effects not already something seen before in the earlier Potter films. But what ultimately leads this film into being the more powerful one is the strength of the story and how it leads you along the way building anticipation as we root for positive outcomes as much as possible with slight comedy punctuating appropriate moments to lift the spirits.Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint and Emma Watson all share that perfect camaraderie that's been built over the years it's no wonder that they add that convincing depth and natural realism to their friendship with an audience that has largely grew up with them as well. There's no ensemble cast like the one assembled for the Potter franchise though most of them  Ralph Fiennes Alan Rickman Helena Bonham Carter Bill Nighy Tom Felton and a long list more  come and go too frequent and too soon but one hopes the evil Death Eaters do get their spotlight by the time the second installment rolls over.Chris Columbus may have begun the film franchise and made it a large welcome for the young especially and old to embrace J.K Rowling's magical world but I am of the opinion that David Yates inherited the franchise at the right point from The Order of the Phoenix where things required a consistent hand rather than a rotating director's chair and developed the franchise into what it is today in quite unassuming terms. Credit also has to go to Steve Kloves who has adapted from Rowling's books save for the point where Yates came onboard knowing what best to adapt into the film and what to leave behind steering clear of the more cutesy tales and plunging us headlong into Voldemort's return and ascension to power.You know that this will end in a cliffhanger and what a cliffhanger it is whetting your appetite to devour Part 2 as soon as it's released just so to witness how the film franchise of our generation will fittingly conclude. I can't wait and I'm sure the hundreds of thousands of fans around the world cannot wait for the next too.".

Danger lurks at every corner and the narrative spins at breakneck speed harrowing most times with the frequent close shaves the rookies encounter against their enemies who are growing more powerful by the minute.While the previous films have boasted special effects extravaganzas be it little things to pepper the scene or large battles between wizards and witches this is kept surprisingly muted in the film since it's swaying on one end of the spectrum with Evil gaining an upper hand and most of the effects not already something seen before in the earlier Potter films. But what ultimately leads this film into being the more powerful one is the strength of the story and how it leads you along the way building anticipation as we root for positive outcomes as much as possible with slight comedy punctuating appropriate moments to lift the spirits.Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint and Emma Watson all share that perfect camaraderie that's been built over the years it's no wonder that they add that convincing depth and natural realism to their friendship with an audience that has largely grew up with them as well. There's no ensemble cast like the one assembled for the Potter franchise though most of them  Ralph Fiennes Alan Rickman Helena Bonham Carter Bill Nighy Tom Felton and a long list more  come and go too frequent and too soon but one hopes the evil Death Eaters do get their spotlight by the time the second installment rolls over.Chris Columbus may have begun the film franchise and made it a large welcome for the young especially and old to embrace J.K Rowling's magical world but I am of the opinion that David Yates inherited the franchise at the right point from The Order of the Phoenix where things required a consistent hand rather than a rotating director's chair and developed the franchise into what it is today in quite unassuming terms. Credit also has to go to Steve Kloves who has adapted from Rowling's books save for the point where Yates came onboard knowing what best to adapt into the film and what to leave behind steering clear of the more cutesy tales and plunging us headlong into Voldemort's return and ascension to power.You know that this will end in a cliffhanger and what a cliffhanger it is whetting your appetite to devour Part 2 as soon as it's released just so to witness how the film franchise of our generation will fittingly conclude. I can't wait and I'm sure the hundreds of thousands of fans around the world cannot wait for the next too.";

	schema:headline " If you've read the book the movie disappoints..";
	schema:reviewBody "Sadly Kloves and Yates took Rowling's richly detailed character driven story and turned into an action film. I found myself surprised at the realization a couple weeks ago that I had just finished reading the last installment of the Harry Potter books for a third time. Admittedly I have not yet read the first four books coincidentally the first four movies I liked. The last three books I've read and perhaps not so coincidentally I was disappointed by the films for all three so far  in as much as the last book has been split into two parts. Rowling's writings of the books are very rich in detail detail which illustrates quite beautifully the nuances of the relationships that the characters have with one another and thus offer the understanding for the how and why of the characters' development. Key details in Rowling's novels set up plot points and history for the subsequent novels. In The Half Blood Prince the movie Ginny leads Harry into the Room of Requirement to hide the potions book. In the novel Harry decides to hide the book to avoid having it confiscated after using a curse handwritten in the book against Draco Malfoy. The importance of this change is in the final book when Harry is looking for the Horcruxes he recalls having seen the Diadem of Ravenclaw on the bust perched on the cabinet in which he hid the book. Now that the movie has altered this happening they've removed the setup for Harry finding one of the final Horcruxes in the Room of Requirement. Details such as these go towards showing the definition of the characters themselves...how Harry is different from Voldemort is his remarkable capacity to love in spite of all that he has suffered. He cares for his friends whereas Voldemort has no friends. The lessons that Dumbledore has with Harry in the sixth book are important for Harry to learn all that he can to understand Tom Riddle and how he became Voldermort so that he will know how to defeat him. In the movie these lessons are completely glossed over and there is no great understanding offered into Riddle's background and history. Like the comment Dumbledore makes about Tom keeping souvenirs this is a clue for Harry when trying to figure out what objects Voldemort selected as his Horcruxes. In the book The Order of the Phoenix the members of Dumbledore's Army communicate via the enchanted Galleons no mention of this at all in the movie and yet this is key for how the students communicate whilst at school in the last book while waging war. I do understand that the films would be way too long if they all followed the books to the letter however let me offer Sir Peter Jackson and his translation of Tolkien's critically acclaimed classic literature into three fantastic epic films that do absolute justice the books with exceptional scripts and filmmaking. Yates and Kloves would have done well to pause for a moment and asked if they were making action movies or were they trying to tell the story of Harry Potter. To me filmmaking is storytelling in its own right. Granted a book depends upon the imagination of the readers' to create a picture with the words on the page while film removes the necessity of imagination because the picture is painted for the viewer via the interpretation of the filmmaker. Yet in my opinion Yates took too much liberty with the stories and changed them without regard to how it limited the understanding of the characters their development and the choices that they made. I could go on and on because there are so many more instances where the details cut from the books for the movies diminish the robustness of the characters that Rowling created but to what end really? There was no mention of the relationship of the House Elf Kreacher with Harry and how much it had changed after Harry showed Kreacher the smallest of kindnesses by giving him the fake locket. How Kreacher then starting cooking wholesome comforting meals for the three friends while they were doing reconnaissance at the Ministry of Magic. Had the filmmakers chosen to show the time that Harry Ron and Hermione had spent going back and forth under the cloak one at a time shown how they had to move every time they said Voldemort's name because it had been tabooed then Ron's defection and subsequent return would have been more logical understandable and forgivable. Had they shown in the last film that the students were fighting already when Harry and Dumbledore returned introduced Fleur and Bill which sets up the wedding in the next film shown the gravity of Bill's injuries shown the strain for Tonks and Lupin. These moments were all in the books and they are all integral parts of the story that the movies do not tell. The movies just barely skim the surface on these and many other points almost in arrogance with the assumption that a split second on screen is sufficient for the suspension of disbelief....in the case of a movie in the genre of fantasy the suspension of disbelief is not so much the goal as is character development in the hopes that the audience is invested in the characters and wants to join them on the journey. This quality is missing from this film as well as the others that Yates and Kloves have done in the series. I want to say to them  it's not just all about the cool special effects gentlemen the Harry Potter series is in fact an exploration of character the depth of humanity in the face of death and the sacrifices one is willing to make for their friends and loved ones time and again despite tragedy it's about the triumph of the human spirit and the capacity to love. See the film if you must but just know it's the missed the mark.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am thoroughly disappointed after seeing this installment of the movie. After reading every book multiple times and seeing them portrayed on the big screen I've been fairly happy with the way the directorsproducers have instilled the quality of J.K's writing style.However after seeing the 'Deathly Hallows Part 1' I am very disappointed the way they left out such large amounts of information and action that was included in the books. The earlier movies did a good job holding their parts of the book series but the Deathly Hallows seems to have been slashed into bits and pieces and has not meant my standards whatsoever when it comes to including the magic of the writing from the book itself.There are many parts of the book that were missing in just this first half of the last installment of the movies the second part I'm afraid is going to end up being just the same way.There was plenty of good graphics and the sequencing was decent but as I said there was just too much missing for me to enjoy the movie. Parts were ruined by rushing through details that would ultimately help explain the story lineplot much better  some parts were just skipped completely.Now I understand that the books are very long and are hard to portray into a movie and there is an acceptable amount of loss of quality from paper to the big screen but that fine line was crossed at least in my eyes and completely ruined this movie for me.I still would suggest watching the movie. For those of you who haven't read the books you will enjoy the movie much more than I did but even those who haven't read the books will notice there is something missing from the plot.I will be waiting for part 2 to make a final decision on the last installment of the movie series but as of right now I stand disappointed.I rated the movie a 6 out of 10 since the story was still there but lax and the characters were played out decently but had much room to grow. I would have given this movie a much higher rating if it were to have grabbed my attention more often rather than skim over such large parts of the book  even those small things which make the books so good were missing. Without the smaller segments included in the movie it just feels like something much different from the book and for those of us who truly are looking for a great portrayal of the book on the big screen this just wasn't enough.".

On the other hand having watched this installment there is simply too much complex storytelling involved in this book to cram it into only one two and half hour movie.This Part 1 is already a very full two and half hours. The drama begins even before the opening credits roll. The special effects have reached a new high point with the trick of using polyjuice potion to create multiple Harry's. The frenetic escape of Harry in Hagrid's motor sidecar is an achievement in action editing. The trio's penetration of the Ministry of Magic to get the locket horcrux is very exciting and tensionfilled.Momentum dips a bit in the midsection as our trio scour the English wilderness for a way to destroy the horcrux. This prolonged section which some may find boring dealt more with the personal relationships loyalty of the three friends as challenges are thrown their way. The segment is marked by the hardtowatch bloodlust of Bellatrix Lestrange and the nobility of Dobby. Watch out too for a most unexpected dance scene which will surely make you smile if not actually chuckle!In the third section we learn what the deathly hallows are referred to in the title as our trio learns it from Xenophilius Lovegood. But the main highlight here is a most amazing animated short featurette called The Tale of Three Brothers as narrated by Hermione. This Part 1 ends very well with a skysplitting final cliffhanger sequence.Its been repeatedly mentioned how the main actors Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have all grown up in front of our eyes as this movie series unfolded. Rupert and Emma are both taller than Daniel already! Actingwise everyone had likewise improved very much. They all even show some skin here. Yes even Hermione! The support from the esteemed gallery of British actors and actresses serve the film very well indeed. We saw everyone from all the previous films it seems except for Maggie Smith.The direction of David Yates is excellent as he did in the last two films. Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves got just the proper mix of action drama and humor needed to make the saga work on screen. This may just be a setup installment however it stands very strong on its own merits. As the last scene faded to black the audience will definitely develop the resolve to watch out for the concluding part to be released next summer and witness the epic Battle of Hogwarts.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having not read the Harry Potter books I intend to do this after the last film I have been watching the movies on their own merits and thus far have been delighted by what has been an exciting and innovative magical adventure. Therefore even though I figured this final instalment was in two parts so the companies involved could essentially stretch things out and make a few extra bucks I was still excited to see it.I have to say I feel cheated. The film is slow moving full of long and I feel unnecessary episodes of dialogue and very little of the action and effects that are Harry Potter's trademarks. It really does feel like a film that was plonked in the middle while the makers worked on the finale.Again having not read the books I saw little point in the wedding at the beginning  I didn't have a clue who was getting married and felt no emotion. The scene with Harry and Hermione dancing was equally as pointless and they spent waaay too much time camping in woods with nothing happening for my liking. The death of Mad Eye at the beginning was extremely underplayed for such a previously large character it was really just He's dead Awwww booooo  OK so who's making the tea and I didn't have a clue why the cockney thief guy Mumagan or something was even in it. I felt very sorry for any kids watching this who have not read the books as they didn't stand a chance.I did like the overall dark atmosphere of the film and as always the scenes involving Valdemort Bellatrix LaStrange and the Ministry were the highlights for me.Overall this could easily and should have been one final fantastic film and not as it was a simple money making strategy which resulted in a mediocre movie. I sincerely hope the final instalment meets the new and extremely high expectations I have now placed on it!!".

	onyx:emotionText "Having not read the Harry Potter books I intend to do this after the last film I have been watching the movies on their own merits and thus far have been delighted by what has been an exciting and innovative magical adventure. Therefore even though I figured this final instalment was in two parts so the companies involved could essentially stretch things out and make a few extra bucks I was still excited to see it.I have to say I feel cheated. The film is slow moving full of long and I feel unnecessary episodes of dialogue and very little of the action and effects that are Harry Potter's trademarks. It really does feel like a film that was plonked in the middle while the makers worked on the finale.Again having not read the books I saw little point in the wedding at the beginning  I didn't have a clue who was getting married and felt no emotion. The scene with Harry and Hermione dancing was equally as pointless and they spent waaay too much time camping in woods with nothing happening for my liking. The death of Mad Eye at the beginning was extremely underplayed for such a previously large character it was really just He's dead Awwww booooo  OK so who's making the tea and I didn't have a clue why the cockney thief guy Mumagan or something was even in it. I felt very sorry for any kids watching this who have not read the books as they didn't stand a chance.I did like the overall dark atmosphere of the film and as always the scenes involving Valdemort Bellatrix LaStrange and the Ministry were the highlights for me.Overall this could easily and should have been one final fantastic film and not as it was a simple money making strategy which resulted in a mediocre movie. I sincerely hope the final instalment meets the new and extremely high expectations I have now placed on it!!";

	schema:reviewBody "Worst of the Harry Potter series. The biggest problem to me seems that they wanted to save money on effects and actors by spending endless amount of time shooting outdoor forest flyby scenes instead of including side plots and more special effects. The movie has about 30 minutes of outdoor scenes which could be completely removed. Also there's a scene where Harry and Hermione dance that is supposed to be poignant but I found it endless and pointless. I can't remember the last time I saw a nonmusical movie which included a complete song. Usually they are shortened to show the highlights and move the story along but not Deathly Hallows. I'll definitely not be too worried about buying the extended DVD! I'd actually pay extra for a better edited version.".

	schema:headline " Focusing on isolation and desolation this feels far removed from Harry PotterYet its the best";
	schema:reviewBody "Yes I am a fan of the Harry Potter series. I love it because Harry Potter has always had substance and a storyline with twists and turns to figure out as well as character development.This one is by far not only the best acted but also a gutsy move by the director screenplay writer and author J.K. Rowling. Never before would I think I would be going through a very bleak world chimed on by the mystical sounds that brought on the many funny moments of Hogwarts introduced in every Potter movie. The director had to choose when he made this movie and I felt he made the right one.What was the choice? SPOILER ALERT The choice that was made was to put you in shoes of these three kids in a world gone wrong and let you feel the full emotional impact. Using things like a squelchy radio reporting all the deaths and things gone wrong in the wizarding world gave you such a withdrawn feeling that nothing is left out there for you.The hopelessness that you feel is nothing any other post apocalyptic movie can touch. For this the movie is a complete success. The only other one that was close to giving me this feeling was the Road but the Road didn't have 10 years and 6 movies built up to make you feel the intimacy you do with Weasley Hermoine and of course Harry.Special effects although there is still much of the brand in dueling wizards and witches as well as some chase scenesone is even soaring above the clouds and epic battles are sacrificed for minimalist moments of surviving in tents in undisclosed locations. The dance between Harry and Hermoine was unbelievable. It was brief and awkward but for just a mere moment you saw the purity of children within and how it was necessary for them to do such silly things to survive to remember and not lose themselves.Harry Potter has developed unbelievably. Not only is he more confident no longer the kid with the glasses and the awkward smile you really feel that he could be the champion of the story and yet you still see how much pain and anguish he goes through. You feel his follies you get the sense that he is utterly lost without Dumbledore. You see his anger that has culminated for the past six movies and you see him breaking down.Emma Watson as Hermoine Granger has peaked. She is showing some real acting chops in this movie. No longer is she the shrill cracking voice but now she has shown unbelievable conviction to her character and what she is going through.Ronald Weasley of course plays a humorous role well but he is not without his conflicts and there are some scenes that he really rises and shows that he is more than just a goofy redheaded kid you should always be laughing at. He too has his pains.Spay special attention to Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort. He has been given screen time only in chunks but if you watch him closely you'll see what a three dimensional villain he is. At first I felt they got him wrong. I expected an unstoppable force with tenacity in his calmness with the likes of Darth Vader and now I realize that they nailed this villain so well. But he goes through his own pain and anguish in his hot pursuit of Potter and his claim to power. He too goes through a whirlwind of emotions.This is an amazing movie. This not only has the special effects and action but also the minimalist acting of arthouse films. Try to take off the Harry Potter label and look at this movie just once. You'll see past the famousinfamous popularity of the franchise and see a movie for what it really is.".

	schema:headline " A Dark Amazing and Wicked Beginning of the End";
	schema:reviewBody "Almost a decade has passed since Harry first encountered Hogwarts. The long anticipated battle between Harry and Voldemort is drawing near. Hogwarts has become no more safe haven. The Ministry has set Harry as a fugitive. The beginning of the end has begun. First Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is the seventh film in the Harry Potter series based on the first half of the book. It is as usual dark in a DavidYates Style. In its whole 146minute run Deathly Hallows follows Harry Hermione and Ron who are on the run from the MInistry of Magic now controlled by the baldlooking dangerous evil Voldemort as well as trying to locate and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes as explained in HalfBlood Prince. Deathly Hallows will introduce several new characters and they include Xenophilius Lovegood and Rufus Scrmigeour. Xenophilius Lovegood is undoubtedly Luna Lovegood's father. While Rufus Scrmigeour is the Minister until the Death Eaters swarm in the Minister. Deathly Hallows also sees the return of our beloved characters such as Dobby and Kreacher the house elves. Deathly Hallows will not only introduce new characters but also new locations and they include the Malfoy Manor where the Malfoys live. We will also see Harry Ron and Hermione in the mortal world rather than the magical world for around half of the book such as Tottenham Court Road.A note for Harry Potter fans you will not see Harry Hermione and Ron in Hogwarts anymore. There will be no Quidditch games Fred and George's shop love potion problems or even their friends although Neville and Luna appear in small roles. So Deathly Hallows Part 1 is really dark than the previous films and there will be no happy moments. But the movie will still have some jokes funny ones to cheer up scenes which are too heartbreaking.The movie will also see some emotional scenes that will show growth in the characters especially Ron. The relationship between Hermione and Ron would be a little bit threatened due to the quest and of course a bit of Harry. The performances by the actors and actresses actually match the Oscar standards I would say. Emma Watson shows growth in her acting and seemed confident than ever. Rupert Grint showed some growth in his acting too by the emotional scenes given. Daniel Radcliffe seemed even more confident but was a bit less in depth compared to the other two. Overall the movie consists of remarkable acting performances. But I would say the one who performed best was as always from the fifth film Helena Bonham Carter or known as the wicked Bellatrix Lestrange. The acting was totally perfect not to mention the remarkable acting contribution from Imelda Staunton or better known as Dolores Umbridge.Exciting and thrilling I really enjoyed the film. It was dark brilliant and perfect. Although a bit slowpaced I still really enjoyed the film. I don't think it will disappoint any one even its book's fans. Even though the scenes were rearranged while some excluded it was still acceptable and as a reader of the book I really appreciated the changes. So book fans of the series you wouldn't be too disappointed with the movie as the movie was loyal enough to the book. Also the film ends with a horrifying scene related to Voldemort and it makes you have the creeps. But that all ends in Part 2 doesn't it?Thank you David Yates for creating a very dark and amazing film. Can't wait for Part 2! Prince AJB's Score 1010Thanks for reading my review on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1. Hope it's useful to you.".

	schema:headline " The Best Book...The Worst Movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "As an avid Harry Potter fan who has read the books multiple times and of course seen the movies repeatedly I was extremely excited to see this movie at the midnight showing. HalfBlood Prince is my favorite book and other than 7 the darkest book in the series.That being said I was so disgusted with this movie. Yates  company literally turned it into Harry Potter comedy hour. I'm not sure how anyone thought this movie was amazingly dark when the theater was cracking up laughing the entire time at trite jokes. The only thing that should have been funny in this entire movie was Lavender  Won Won's obsession w each other.The movie emphasized the unrequited lovesnoggingRon  Lavender romance over the major plot line which was learning about Tom Riddle's background. With the exception of Dumbledore's first meeting w Tom  Tom asking about how to make Horcruxes all of the background was left out. That's essentially three quarters of the book omitted.What was the point of not having Tonks find Harry on the train?

I honestly would like a doover. They really need to reshoot this movie and try again because it was bad.

	onyx:emotionText "As an avid Harry Potter fan who has read the books multiple times and of course seen the movies repeatedly I was extremely excited to see this movie at the midnight showing. HalfBlood Prince is my favorite book and other than 7 the darkest book in the series.That being said I was so disgusted with this movie. Yates  company literally turned it into Harry Potter comedy hour. I'm not sure how anyone thought this movie was amazingly dark when the theater was cracking up laughing the entire time at trite jokes. The only thing that should have been funny in this entire movie was Lavender  Won Won's obsession w each other.The movie emphasized the unrequited lovesnoggingRon  Lavender romance over the major plot line which was learning about Tom Riddle's background. With the exception of Dumbledore's first meeting w Tom  Tom asking about how to make Horcruxes all of the background was left out. That's essentially three quarters of the book omitted.What was the point of not having Tonks find Harry on the train? How can you have Tonks call Remus sweetie and not explain all the drama between them and how they got together? How can you leave out Madam Rosmerta's involvement? What was the point of the burning of the Burrow scene? The ending was horrific. It was completely different than the book. So now Dumbledore is the only one who can apparate on Hogwarts grounds?

WHY for the love of all that's holy did Harry just STAND there while Snape murdered Dumbledore before his very eyes? He was meant to be PETRIFIED literally!!! And not only that but Snape actually SEES Harry and does nothing about it. Won't Harry find it kinda odd that a Death Eater sees him practically defenceless and doesn't do anything about it? Harry is meant to believe that Snape is a full fledged Death Eater yet he lets Harry get off scott free? That is a SERIOUS oversight in the plot of the book! All these things listed above the major plot points weren't there! I couldn't find them!What I COULD find however was The burning down of the burrow...?!? Dumbledore seeming to only JUST realize that Voldemort used Horcruxes even though he was meant to have already destroyed one... and not only that but I also explicitly heard Dumbledore say They could be anything!!! In the book he clearly points out that they WOULDN'T be just anything that Riddle liked collecting things. In the movie he makes out as if it could be any old thing a shoe a can a piece of paper... better get searching then Harry I found the ring because Magic leaves traces but when I die you're screwed!!! Some random waitress in some random diner... A rock concert tribute to Dumbledore... A revealing of Hermione's love for Ron... and i DEFINITELY found Ron's and Lavender's relationship and... sexual innuendo?? OK the Ron and Lavender subplot in the book was quite nice and funny but in the movie it completely shadowed the ACTUAL story! they were snogging all over the place! it was impossible to focus on anything else with them popping up everywhere! It turned the movie into some sickly romcom! and then I was shocked to find sexual innuendo! yup believe it or not. And i know I wasn't the only one because i heard laughs and hoots all around the theater. The scene where Ginny bends down to tie Harry's shoelaces... what is up with that? Hey hang on a minute isn't Harry's cloak meant to be a hallow? Good thing Luna CHARMED it off him then!!!MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEADSo not only did they destroy the capodopera that this movie could have been but they also didn't set up the next movies. How are Harry Ron and Hermione going to start looking for the Horcruxes if they don't even know what they COULD be? How are the contents of Dumbledore's will going to be passed along if Scrimgeour doesn't even exist? How is Harry going to remember that Xenophilius was wearing the symbol of the Hallows at the wedding if the WEDDING CAN'T EXIST???

How are they going to use Grimmauld Place and Kreacher not to mention Dobby if there was never even a whisper about what happened to them???This movie was thoroughly disappointing and I really think they should... remake it basically!!! Because not only was THIS movie bad but it's set to ruin the next ones as well.

	schema:headline " Great cinematography consistency weak";
	schema:reviewBody "My favorite part of the novel Harry Potter and the Halfblood Prince which was probably my favorite novel in the series was all of the subplots. We had the drama behind the Minister Magic and relations with the Muggle government. We had the quite humorous interactions between Dumbledore and the Dursleys. We had the whole memory of Voldemort's family  really quite crucial to the seventh book  and the memories of Voldemort finding the other Hogwarts founder items to use as Horcruxes. We had Bill and Fleur's relationship. We had Tonks's depression and patronus change which led to Tonks and Remus's relationship. We had lots of interaction and conflict between Harry's house elves. We have Snape's constant suspicion of Harry. We have the complications with Madame Rosmerta. And we had so much in the end  Harry being trapped under the Invisibility Cloak during Dumbledore's death an entire battle at Hogwarts and Dumbledore's elaborate and meaningful funeral.All of that was completely and entirely omitted from the movie.What we do have is a weak plot involving an old Potions textbook that is featured about two times before Harry's friends convince him to do away with the book. Snape never punishes Harry only reveals his identity in a brief scene at the end. The Order of the Phoenix is not mentioned at all throughout the entire movie and neither is Grimmauld. We have a nearly sickening amount of teenage hormonal relationships  while some moments like harry comforting Hermione and Ron whispering Hermione's name in the hospital wing were well done the growing relationship between Ginny and Harry was awkwardly portrayed. Additionally they cut out the entire end scene  battle and all. One would think that a battle scene would attract even more moviegoers to the film and the battle provided filmmakers a chance to show minor characters who weren't heavily featured. No the movie ends with a weak scene showing the three main characters in a tower talking about next year. The same amount of foreshadowing could have been done within canon  Harry telling Ginny that they couldn't see each other anymore at Dumbeldore's funeral. But that certainly didn't happen.Oh and do you remember the Burrow burning down? No? Well it happens. It's a great scene actually very well done but not remotely canon. The Burrow is integral to the plot of the seventh book. Let's see how they pull that one off.Actually they seem to have been pretty obsessed with fire in this film. Hagrid's hut burns down as well.The cinematography though was excellent. One of my favorite scenes showed Harry walking up a staircase and Draco walking up a parallel staircase in the background. The lighting is effective the various focus effects are absolutely magnificent and the soundtrack as always is excellent. The film is a visual pleasure  perhaps lacking in action but it is one of those films that one could watch several times extracting details from the masterful sets.".

	onyx:emotionText "My favorite part of the novel Harry Potter and the Halfblood Prince which was probably my favorite novel in the series was all of the subplots. We had the drama behind the Minister Magic and relations with the Muggle government. We had the quite humorous interactions between Dumbledore and the Dursleys. We had the whole memory of Voldemort's family  really quite crucial to the seventh book  and the memories of Voldemort finding the other Hogwarts founder items to use as Horcruxes. We had Bill and Fleur's relationship. We had Tonks's depression and patronus change which led to Tonks and Remus's relationship. We had lots of interaction and conflict between Harry's house elves. We have Snape's constant suspicion of Harry. We have the complications with Madame Rosmerta. And we had so much in the end  Harry being trapped under the Invisibility Cloak during Dumbledore's death an entire battle at Hogwarts and Dumbledore's elaborate and meaningful funeral.All of that was completely and entirely omitted from the movie.What we do have is a weak plot involving an old Potions textbook that is featured about two times before Harry's friends convince him to do away with the book. Snape never punishes Harry only reveals his identity in a brief scene at the end. The Order of the Phoenix is not mentioned at all throughout the entire movie and neither is Grimmauld. We have a nearly sickening amount of teenage hormonal relationships  while some moments like harry comforting Hermione and Ron whispering Hermione's name in the hospital wing were well done the growing relationship between Ginny and Harry was awkwardly portrayed. Additionally they cut out the entire end scene  battle and all. One would think that a battle scene would attract even more moviegoers to the film and the battle provided filmmakers a chance to show minor characters who weren't heavily featured. No the movie ends with a weak scene showing the three main characters in a tower talking about next year. The same amount of foreshadowing could have been done within canon  Harry telling Ginny that they couldn't see each other anymore at Dumbeldore's funeral. But that certainly didn't happen.Oh and do you remember the Burrow burning down? No? Well it happens. It's a great scene actually very well done but not remotely canon. The Burrow is integral to the plot of the seventh book. Let's see how they pull that one off.Actually they seem to have been pretty obsessed with fire in this film. Hagrid's hut burns down as well.The cinematography though was excellent. One of my favorite scenes showed Harry walking up a staircase and Draco walking up a parallel staircase in the background. The lighting is effective the various focus effects are absolutely magnificent and the soundtrack as always is excellent. The film is a visual pleasure  perhaps lacking in action but it is one of those films that one could watch several times extracting details from the masterful sets.";

	schema:headline " A major disappointment";
	schema:reviewBody "As an avid reader of the HP book series and a devout HP movie fan the sixth installment came up short in almost every aspect of the film.From a purely cinematographic point of view the dialogue was rushed the almost nonexistent plot focused too much on minor relationships and details and none of the scenes elicited the response intended. It was difficult for a scene to last one minute let alone thirty seconds. The climax was not given enough time to fully develop and the story ended so abruptly even I was left with a sense of confusion. I cannot imagine how anyone who has not read the books could have followed the plot line at all.When viewing the film with the book fresh in mind the movie fell so far below expectations it is the greatest disappointment moviewise to date. The team managed to take a complex intricate wellwritten novel and turn it into a fastpasted overhormonal and unemotional movie. When I think of the Half Blood Prince I think of the main purpose to be getting horcruxes not getting laid. When I initially heard about the fake scene at the Burrow I had an open mind and figured it would play into the plot. After viewing however I can only see it as a waste of time because the only character it introduced was Greyback but you never heard of him again through the entire movie until the very endin which he did nothing.The fact that the battle at Hogwarts was left out gives the whole movie an anticlimatic feel. The movie barely even hits on Voldemort's past or what horcruxes are and the cave scene was dry and unemotional. Dumbledore's death and Snape's betrayal did not elicit any response from me or any of my peers that saw the movie with me. At the end of the movie the audience should be lamenting Dumbledore's horrific death but the movie moved so fast it was hard to truly wrap your mind around one scene before another began.All in all I found this movie horribly disappointing. The only actor who I saw any significant improvement in was Emma Watson everyone else seemed cold and unattached. I sincerely hope the seventh movie will be better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Harry Potter and the HalfBlood Prince flat out sucks! It has very little redeeming factors to it its too long and its boring. I will never understand how the filmmakers turned what was actually an okay book into a film this boring. I read the HalfBlood Prince book and I actually liked it. I liked the dark turn the books had taken before fg it up with the Deathly Hallows and the death of Dumbledore was actually dramatic and actually elicited an emotional response from me. It wasn't a great book I felt that the plot delved a bit too deep into the relationships amongst the characters or was that the Order of the Phoenix? Either way it slowed things down and I also didn't really find the book that exciting until the ending that is where things got good. The movie on the other hand was the complete opposite. Things did not get good towards the end if anything it got worse! The HalfBlood Prince is what happens when a book that had so much background to it that when turned into a film the filmmakers need to keep things moving while still telling a good story and have it exciting. This movie didn't do that at all. It was boring from beginning to end nothing but boring dreadfully slow scenes that nearly put me to sleep. Not only that but the many scenes regarding the relationships were so bad that I didn't feel that the characters didn't actually like each other the only reason they do is because the plot requires them too. For example Ginny Weasley is supposedly going to be Harry Potter's girlfriend but her character is so bland and the actress didn't really do a good enough job to make it look like she actually did like Harry. She stares at him with an uninterested look in her eyes one that says to me Why does the script require me to fall for this guy? Its painful to watch and only serves to kill 5 minutes.The rest of the cast is hitormiss. Alan Rickman as Severus Snape as always is brilliant. He is the one cool character and I don't think it is because he is well written. It's because it's Alan Rickman! He is always fun to watch on screen! Whether it is Galaxy Quest or...any of the other Harry Potter films Alan Rickman always does a great job. However the rest of the cast is nothing spectacular. I already mentioned how bland Ginny Weasley is so I won't talk about her again but everyone in this movie just doesn't work. Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange is so over the top that she comes off as hilarious! I know she is meant to be psychotic and all that good stuff but...look at her! Her character isn't subtle at all! She cackles and laughs manically whenever she is on screen and I found her more annoying and funny rather than frightening. The cast of this movie may have good actorsactresses lined up but it's ultimately the characters that fall flat. They either are completely useless or so obviously evil that whenever someone thinks they are not one of the death eaters I feel like shaking them relentlessly shouting HELLO! HOW STUPID ARE YOU!? Look at this guy! He has no nose no hair no visible human traits aside from the fact he looks somewhat human! In case you didn't know I was talking about the evil lord snakeface I mean Voldemort.Onto the plot and trust me this is where I REALLY started to loathe this film. It does so much yet succeeds at doing nothing at all. I watched this movie in a trance trying to remember what happened and why. After some time I eventually just gave up mainly because when I asked myself Why I realized that there was no reason why. Nothing happens in this movie! It was so boring that I almost couldn't believe it. What are they doing now? Oh absolutely nothing. What now? Oh they are trying to find this item for reasons I forgot about and didn't really care about in the first place. Why is this drink that Dumbledore is drinking making him progressively weaker? Why are there zombielike creatures rising up from the water? What is going on? What are those things why should I care? The answer to the last question is I shouldn't. Only hardcore Potter fans will truly know what is going on the rest of us is left confused or was that just me? What's going on now? Oh the death eaters have invaded Hogwarts oh no! That should be dramatic but it really isn't. What just happened oh wait Draco Malfoy couldn't grow a pair and kill Dumbledore he just stood there crying like a little b until the only cool character had to do the deed himself. This was the worst insult of all Dumbledoofus' death wasn't dramatic period. It happened was incredibly boring and went and that was it.This is a movie that I just love to hate. I take great joy in ripping this movie to shreds because I feel that I must have revenge. Revenge against having a series of once okay books turned into movies that started off well then turned to c. It pains me to see a franchise that I actually once liked contrary to my review of the Deathly Hallows Part 1 movie be turned into this. The problem is that while I did like the franchise initially it's the awful conclusion and the awful recent movies that turned me against Harry Potter. I wanted to like this movie I really did but sadly the movie failed. Harry Potter I hate to say this but you failed!".

Don't ask whyno one knows. 2. They never really mentioned that Fenrir Greyback was a werewolf. He just looked like a yelloweyed exceptionally hairy man. 3. They neverbarely mentioned or showed Bill and Fleurand they didn't mention the wedding. So I don't know they're going to start the 7th moviewith a random wedding? Nonbook readers get ready for some surprises! 4. Where was Hagrid? And Neville? They both only had like 2 scenes each and they resorted Neville back to the fumbling loser he was before when he SHOULD have been becoming more of a takecharge kind of guy like he was in the Hallows. 5. Where was ANYONE for that matter? All of those characters we know and love and sometimes love to hate weren't there! Or if they were they had really minor scenes! McGonagall and Parvati and Flitwick and LUNA and people like them. 6. Where were all the memories? The Horcrux discussions? The evening lessons? Everyone heard Dumbledore clearly say of the Horcruxes They could be anything. Riiightwasn't Dumbledore supposed to have an inkling of what they might be? What is Harry supposed to do now guess all of them?7. And what was up with Dumbledore JUST finding out that Voldemort was using Horcruxes? That is wrongweird for two reasons A Dumbledore is supposed to have all the answers so that was weird and B He had already acquired the ring and destroyed itif he didn't know Voldemort was using Horcruxes why? Did he just feel like smashing it?8. There was no battle at the end. The Death Eaters kind of just waltzed in trashed some things and then killed Dumbledore while Harry cowered in fear by the way which is so wrong. Then they left after smashing some windows. And all this happened while everyone was asleep I might add.9. Oh and then Hagrid took Dumbledore's body outside and somehow everyone was randomly outside staring at his body and not even crying or looking sad...? 10. There was no funeral. Okay... so what did they do to Dumbledore's body? Threw it in a sack I guess. 11. And the Flight of the Prince was so lame. It wasn't dramatic at all Harry's and Snape's expressions were so wooden I thought they were trees and it was all over in about three seconds. 12. Harry and Ginny's gettogether and breakup... neither was there. One day Ginny was with Dean the next she was with Harry. And then at the end... they were still together. Okay then. And they never showed Harry awkwardly realizing he liked Ginny. I mean why show THAT when you could show Ron and Lavender thrashing about all the time right...?13. And then Hermione blurted out her love for Ron. Great and allbut what are they going to do for the Hallows now?14. And all the random awkward unexplained moments. Like Ginny tying Harry's shoelaces or Hermione blurting outalmost right after Dumbledore diedOh Harry by the way Ron is okay with you dating Ginny. Um... what? So basically the movie was more like a 99 percent RonandLavender andHermione love triangle than a HarryandGinny or a Harryand Dumbledoreandmemories sort of thing. Wonderful! And yes I am a die hard fan have read each book about 200 timesnot kidding but I am NOT biased. Order of the Phoenix pretty much... sucked but I let it go and enjoyed it 'cause at least it had SOME of the main parts! Like the fight at the end right? But this? Let's just put it like this if I had a magic wand I wouldn't use it to do magicI'd use it to stab myself in the eyes. Cheerio Ginny and that's really my name".

	schema:headline " How to enjoy this movie if you're a fan of the HP Books";
	schema:reviewBody "Last night I had gone to the midnight showing of the movie. This morning I wrote a review below bc I wanted to express how disappointed I was. However I still had tickets to go see it this afternoon. I certainly did not want to sit there for another 2 hours hating it so I had to find a way to like it. I really really wanted to like this movie. I love HP afterall! I decided to try another approach to watch the movie without thinking of the book at all. And I'll be daned if it didn't work! I realized that I had spent so much time picking apart what the movie DID NOT have that I never allowed myself to enjoy what it DID have. Once I did that and accepted that this movie is merely based on the book I was able to enjoy it! Suddenly the love story did not seem to dominate as much as it did on my first viewing.....Honestly I never really thought that changing the way I approached the movie would work but it did. So if your a really big fan of the books and cd's and you really want to find some way to enjoy this movie I suggest you leave all the knowledge you have of the books at home sit back and watch! I started reading reviews last week so I was aware that all the really good stuff in the book wasn't going to be in the movie. Still I was excited and stood in line for almost 3 hours to see this movie. When I left I felt very very disappointed. I couldn't believe what I watched this was a joke right? Sure that other Harry Potter fans felt the same way I started to read the fan reviews. Now I'm wondering....did I miss something? How is it this movie is getting such rave reviews?? Did anyone not notice all the plot moments that were changed or left out completely? SPOILERS I so wanted to see Dumbledore give the Dursley's their due. And how about Harry and Dumbldore going on the journey to view the Marvolos and Voldomorts father? And lets not even talk about the best part of the book the fight at the castle. I read somewhere that the director did not want to do the fight because of the fight in book 7. I mean really come on that's probably the lamest excuse I've ever heard. Ya know I never even shed a bloody tear when they killed Dumbledore. There was no emotional work up to it in my opinion it was really weak. When I read the book I cried for days! Well maybe that's why I did not during the movie....I already mourned him  I knew their had to be a lot of things that did not make it in the movie I just assumed it would be the teenage love angst. Especially given the action films this movie is competing against.But then again it's getting great reviews so I think I'm part of the minority of people who were really really hoping to get a Harry Potter movie that would make JK Rowling proud at least when she cared.The movie was funny absolutely. But that's all it was except for the last 30 minutes. The last 30 minutes like the 5th movie is the best part IMO. But that's not saying much.".

	onyx:emotionText "Last night I had gone to the midnight showing of the movie. This morning I wrote a review below bc I wanted to express how disappointed I was. However I still had tickets to go see it this afternoon. I certainly did not want to sit there for another 2 hours hating it so I had to find a way to like it. I really really wanted to like this movie. I love HP afterall! I decided to try another approach to watch the movie without thinking of the book at all. And I'll be daned if it didn't work! I realized that I had spent so much time picking apart what the movie DID NOT have that I never allowed myself to enjoy what it DID have. Once I did that and accepted that this movie is merely based on the book I was able to enjoy it! Suddenly the love story did not seem to dominate as much as it did on my first viewing.....Honestly I never really thought that changing the way I approached the movie would work but it did. So if your a really big fan of the books and cd's and you really want to find some way to enjoy this movie I suggest you leave all the knowledge you have of the books at home sit back and watch! I started reading reviews last week so I was aware that all the really good stuff in the book wasn't going to be in the movie. Still I was excited and stood in line for almost 3 hours to see this movie. When I left I felt very very disappointed. I couldn't believe what I watched this was a joke right? Sure that other Harry Potter fans felt the same way I started to read the fan reviews. Now I'm wondering....did I miss something? How is it this movie is getting such rave reviews?? Did anyone not notice all the plot moments that were changed or left out completely? SPOILERS I so wanted to see Dumbledore give the Dursley's their due. And how about Harry and Dumbldore going on the journey to view the Marvolos and Voldomorts father? And lets not even talk about the best part of the book the fight at the castle. I read somewhere that the director did not want to do the fight because of the fight in book 7. I mean really come on that's probably the lamest excuse I've ever heard. Ya know I never even shed a bloody tear when they killed Dumbledore. There was no emotional work up to it in my opinion it was really weak. When I read the book I cried for days! Well maybe that's why I did not during the movie....I already mourned him  I knew their had to be a lot of things that did not make it in the movie I just assumed it would be the teenage love angst. Especially given the action films this movie is competing against.But then again it's getting great reviews so I think I'm part of the minority of people who were really really hoping to get a Harry Potter movie that would make JK Rowling proud at least when she cared.The movie was funny absolutely. But that's all it was except for the last 30 minutes. The last 30 minutes like the 5th movie is the best part IMO. But that's not saying much.";

	schema:reviewBody "I consider myself a Harry Potter fan. Not of the movies but from the books which they came from. There's a reason why each of J.K. Rowling's 7 books have brought much fan base all over the world it's because of the magic of the Harry Potter books.In the last several years I feel more and more magic from the books have been cut from the movies. I blame this on Warner Brothers who obviously views the Potter property as a ticket to high profit rather than an experience that filmgoers and book lovers can share together.I loved the essence of the first two films but when Alfonso Cuaron took over as the director of Prisoner of Azkaban it seems more and more material had been cut from the books on which they are based. Prisoner of Azkaban was the first and some key sequences were eliminated. The change wasn't too bad  back then. Then Goblet of Fire came out a year later and even more material was cut. Then Order of the Phoenix came out two years ago and it seems half of the book was cut to the point where the film was quite dull and pointless.But Half Blood Prince is the worst of them all. Many fans of the Harry Potter film series keep on stating that the films are an entirely different form of entertainment than the books and that all the details cannot be included. That's nonsense. The first two Harry Potter movies were able to capture the essence of the books perfectly. The Narnia films were able to capture the essence of their books perfectly as well there is no reason why the rest of the Harry Potter books cannot do the same.What we have with Half Blood Prince is a cliff note's version of the film with much of the material that made the book so special completely cut out. Events such as Harry and Dumbledore's quest for Voldemort's Horcruxes are barely touched on while the majority of the film focuses on the sillier parts of the novel such as the growing hormones between the sixth year Hogwarts students. It seems that the producers of Harry Potter were aware of the growing popularity of the Twilight phenomenon and wanted to make their own teenage romantic love story as part of the series. That doesn't feel right in a Harry Potter film in anyway.I feel that David Yates directed the two worst Harry Potter films so far and that he will undoubtedly destroy the once great Harry Potter film series. The fact that the final book will be split into two separate films makes me question his abilities as a director of the final film of one of the best fantasy book series of all time.".

While not without its merits the sixth film in the HP series was very much a letdown for me.First of all I'm a diehard fan of the books but I absolutely didn't want or expect the movie to follow the book pageforpage. In fact some of the creative liberty taken in the film was quite good. One scene in particular was very good where Bellatrix and Fenrir Greyback attack the burrow leading to a showdown in the marsh between Harry Ginny and the two Death Eaters. Or at least it had the potential to be very good. In fact much of the movie was very anticlimactic. That scene among many other crucial scenes fizzles out when nothing happens. There is a short duel and then the DE's leave. The same thing happens in the end of the movie which was the biggest letdown of all the films so far. The battle through Hogwarts at the end of the book was the big climax leading up to Dumbledore's death. In the film the whole battle is cut out replaced instead by a very short and mawkish scene in which Snape gives a quick Avada Kedavra and then everyone goes on their way.In short the lack of appropriate emotional content and the lack of any real climax anywhere throughout the film just makes the whole thing a bit lackluster. Bringing David Yates back into the picture was clearly a costly mistake.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's less of magic and tricks in the sixth instalment of the Harry Potter series fans need be disappointed  it offers a heavy dose of drama romance and humour rather than the plot. Strangely the teenagers of Hogwarts are shown spending more time sorting out their adolescent problems flirting and pouting. While Harry finds himself attracted to Ginnie Weasley Bonnie Wright Ron much to the dismay of Hermione Emma Watson is besotted with Lavender Brown Jessie Cave. The mood of the film is mostly dark and director David Yates creates an atmosphere of depression and melancholy by showing dense clouds and rain throughout the narrative making it gloomy compared to the previous versions. In terms of content nothing much is revealed though suspense is built up when Draco Malfoy Tom Felton is often shown sneaking around forbidden corridors and secret chambers of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Also the development of the plot in the film version does not justify the title Harry Potter and the HalfBlood Prince. The story shows that Harry stumbles upon a book on potions in the laboratory of Horace Slughorn Jim Broadbent a new bumbling professor of potions. The book belongs to the HalfBlood Prince and it helps him in experimenting and successfully making a potion. But Ginnie thinks he has had enough of the book and hides it.This time the story also bids adieu to one of the most important and adorable characters of the series leaving Harry all alone to fight off the evil Voldemort. Also professor Severus Snape Alan Rickman turns villain.The film has no scary moments...like when Harry and his friends are attacked in a field by Death Eaters and when Professor Albus Dumbledore Michael Gambon takes Harry to a seaside cave.Although nothing much is revealed or explained compared to earlier films the plot has unsuccessfully set up for a perfect stage for the last and final installment of the wizard franchise. It is not must watch for diehard Harry Potter fans as it disappoints totally.P.S.BORING AWFUL TERRIBLE HARRY POTTER MOVIE. WORST MOVIE OF THE MOVIE SERIES. THE LAST IHE MOVIE SHOULD BE DIRECTED BY Mike Newell Who Directed Goblet of Fires of the series AND NOT David Yates Who Directed this Movie".

I do not know how it's possible to destroy the entire concept of Harry Potter and the magic world and having it made in to a teen movie where the people who're in love with each other can't say it cause they're too immature but they succeeded doing it! I sat there for hours wishing for the movie to end so I could do something less stupid with my time.The movie is called The HalfBlood Prince and the only thing the movie has to do with the title is that Harry gets a book that belongs to the halfblood prince which contains some usable notes. Oh and the 10 second long scene with the prince revealing himself by saying Yes I'm the halfblood prince! and nothing more is added to that.The ending scene where Dumbledore is making Harry make him drink the elixir is the only place where you see the slightest bit of suspense and even that scene was cut down to a 5minute sequence to make room for more boring loveelixirscenes. After this death eaters attack dumbledore but instead of doing something they stand there for 5 minutes talking.I have never been this disappointed after going to the cinema and I'm certainly not going to pay money to see the next Harry Potter movie!".

The only thing that was wrong was the title. I thought this was Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince? I did not buy a ticket to Ronald Weasley and the stories of Romance nor did I buy a ticket to Harry Potter's Friends with a touch of YouKnowWho on the side. Not only that what happened to the plot?

In addition why oh whywould you omit critical moments and downgrade important characters to CREATE new ones that don't mean anything to take their place?

However it is not necessary to take a chain saw to what can easily be debated as the best book in the series. HalfBlood Prince is key to setting up the final now two movies and this version missed the mark. Now the major novel plot points are there Harry learns about Voldemort's past Draco struggles with his chosen task and Snape does kill Dumbledore but much of the setup plot and subplots have been completely omitted. For fans out there that have read the book will get a strange feeling in their gut just a few minutes in.After the Deatheater attack on London the muggel minister is supposed to receive a late night visit. Omitted! During the time spent at the Wesley's prior to the school year there is supposed to be a blast from the past and news of an upcoming marriage. Omitted! So just minutes into the feature many of the actual fans should start to wonder if something fishy is going on. After the duration of the film all of the omissions are topped off by the big daddy of them all. There is no funeral for the deceased headmaster. How can that be? it is easily the 2nd biggest moment in seven novels next to the climax when Voldemort is killed. Additional ommisions Many of Dumbeldore's Voldemort memories Any of Snape's interaction as the Defense against the Dark Arts instructorProper development of the Snape Good Vs. Evil plot Quitich cup match unless that is the match shown in the movie but you couldn't tell The alterations in the film are also a huge let down. Unfortunately our friendly writers decided that it would be wise to alter the first kiss of the future Mr. and Mrs. Potter. I cannot even wrap my head around why writers would think fans wouldn't notice. I'm not even going to get into beyond a mention of the two biggest changes. When the headmaster gets killed it needs to be word for word from the novel enough said. Since they felt it necessary to not shoot the funeral I guess they felt it would be fine to end with our three heroes together instead of Harry walking off after breaking up with Ginny. Those are Huge! Now before I continue to rag on the choices of the writers I will say that HBP is visually stunning to a level above the previous films and what they did put into the script works for the film. Only those who have spent the time to read the novel will notice the major issues with this film. For entertainment value alone it was a good movie. Please to not destroy Deathly Hallows the way this edition was destroyed.".

In fact there was very little of the original storyline from the book.There were key plot elements from the book missing. In the book there were a number of memories Dumbledore put into the pensieve regarding the origins of Tom Riddle Voldemort that showed where he came from underlying what the horcruxes were how he got Slytherin's ring he killed his Muggle father and made his uncle Morphin Gaunt take the blame etc. They left out Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's engagement and Molly Weasely's dislike of Fleur. They left out the DA's involvement and their taking the rest of Harry's Felix Felicis potion the involvement of the Order of the Pheonix Bill getting injured and Fleur's acceptance of him even though Fenrir Greyback had disfigured him leading to Molly Weasely's acceptance of her. They got Tonks all wrong. At first in the book when Harry arrives at the Burrow she is crying on Molly's shoulder and it is only later that we find she has been in love with Lupin. In an added scene during the movie at supposedly Christmas break she and Lupin are already together. The actress who plays Tonks is not the same Tonks neither in style nor manner. The Death Eater attack in the movie that resulted in the burning down of the Weaselys' home was NOT in the book and was graphic and grossly unnecessary.As well as Fleur and Bill Rufus Scrimgeour is completely left out and it is not even mentioned that he became Minister of Magic. Percy Weasley is not present. All house elves are left out. Moaning Myrtle is not present and she is a major character in this book. In the book she mentions to Harry about the boy crying in the bathroom Draco Malfoy and when he and Harry have the battle in the bathroom and he is near death it is she who cries out MURDER! alerting people of what happened. In the movie she is absent and Professor Snape's unbidden arrival after Draco and Harry's scuffle makes no sense at all. The parts of Bellatrix Lestrange and Luna Lovegood were beefed up and while I enjoy both characters and the actresses who play them to perfection such an addition did not sit well with me. Also in the book Dumbledore was killed in his office with Harry under his invisibility cloak unable to move speak or react. In the movie he was killed somewhere else. Wrong wrong wrong.I did however enjoy the Weasely twins' shop. They got that right at least. I laughed watching Hagrid and Slughorn absolutely plastered together after Aragog's funeral. Draco Malfoy was perfect. No longer the spoiled brat he once was in the other booksmovies he is shown in his own coming of age. His father in prison he is desperate to prove himself although the task murder is daunting. He cries in the bathroom and uses roundabout ways to do it because deep down he is not a killer which until death Dumbledore sees. The teenage soap operas revolving around Hermione and Ron as well as Harry and Ginny are well done reminding us that this is not just about good and evil magic and wonder but about teenagers growing up and coping with homework and romance. Alan Rickman as always is perfect as Professor Snape. You can see as he makes the unbreakable vow the look on his face that highlights his lack of willingness yet lack of choice in the matter. You can see his division as he struggles to protect Harry as well as to protect Draco Malfoy from spiraling down a dark path from which there is no return. He very aptly portrays Snape's reluctance to kill Dumbledore as he must both as the unbreakable vow dictates and as Dumbledore asks.In short plotwise they got more wrong than right making the movie a gaunt version of the full richness of Rowling's original novel. The visual effects alone while wonderful were not enough to feed the movie's anorexic plot line.While I did not exit the theater within the first hour as many of my fellow moviegoers in the theater did I left the movie theater disappointed outraged and cheated. I felt I had wasted precious time and hardearned money. This movie is not worthy to carry the book's title Harry Potter and the HalfBlood Prince but should be dubbed Harry Potter and a halfassed attempt at a movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "OK....As a big Harry Potter fan i waited for the movie....scheduled to release in November i was disappointed to see the movie release delayed for 6 months. i waited and waited and then the day it was released in India i went to see it. I had high anticipations from the movie after seeing its trailers which were really looking good. Even after the poor attempt of David Yates at the fifth part i was hopeful that he would do justice to the best book in the Harry Potter series but i was wrong!!!! First the good points of the movie. The special effects and the visuals were really stunning and high quality. Dan and others acted really well and it was nice to see Ginny having a meaty role in the movie. She looks gorgeous. The Scenes at Lake were really upto the mark. We had some nice comic moments well enacted by Dan and Rupert. But let me ask...is that the reason one goes to see a Harry Potter movie?? I didn't go to see a teenage romantic comedy. The tagline of the movie says that Harry and Dumbledore try to unravel Voldemort's past and the time we actually get to see his past in only 10 minutes in a damn 230 hours movie!!!! The durseleys were totally left out. So were Bill and Fleur. Hagrid got only two scenes in the whole movie.The only thing we learnt about Voldemort is that he learnt to make horcruxes. Director and writers do not care about telling us what things he chooses to make horcruxes which was so nicely told in the movie.No reference was made for Voldemort's father mother Gaunt. No reference for Voldemort's deeds after schooling what so ever. After 2 hours of comedy sequences between Lavender and Won Won we come to know about horcruxes and thats all!!!! this is serious crap....There is virtually no story in the movie....I am concluded that David Yates doesn't even know how to tell a story in a movie. Nor does he ever bother to read the novel.The last scene was totally a let down which made the movie a complete disappointment for everyone. Death eaters just enter hogwarts and Snape kills Dumbledore with Harry standing just one floor under watching everything like a coward in the novel he was immobilised by Dumbledore's spell. They kill Dumbledore and leave Hogwarts quietly without any fight without anyone watching except Harry. This is bullshit!!! in the novel the fight sequence in the end was so amazing with the Order of phoenix and DA fighting the death eaters...the same was totally missed out which could have been the best part of the movie..Some people might say that its impossible to put the whole novel in a 230 hour movie but then how did Lord of the Rings or the Narnia movies manage to do it....So this movie was the worst Harry Potter movie and David Yates as an HP director is bad luck for HP fans. I wondered whether Warner Bros should have got Chris Nolan to direct this movie.I am not keeping my fingers crossed for the seventh part as i am now sure that we will again get a totally crap movie thanks to Warner Bros that David is directing the last HP assignment.In the nutshell....A Total disastrous movie....Don't waste your time watching it....".

	schema:headline " Immensely satisfying for fans who can see the movie behind the book";
	schema:reviewBody "I was lucky enough to see a preview of HalfBlood Prince three days before opening day. I saw it a second time with my son who is not quite ten but who is generally mature for his age and doesn't scare easily. The two viewings give me the unique advantage of both the adult and the child perspective on the movie. I only recently started counting myself a true Harry Potter fan after my son introduced me to the movies a couple of years ago. I finished the last book only three weeks before seeing the movie adaptation of HalfBlood Prince the first time.With all the book details very fresh in my mind I had high expectations of the movie. And Yates the production crew and the cast definitely delivered. The movie impresses on many levels from an artistic point of view. The stripped landscapes and washed out colors convey a constant feeling of dread and foreboding. The standard train trip to Hogwarts was particularly stark seen against a landscape scorched by a hot summer sun and dotted with dark pools of water. The usual lush greenery and joyous train ride are nowhere to be seen.Personally I felt the pace was spoton and that the movie elegantly made time for all key plot points. But only if you enjoy a plot line driven by character and emotion. For the younger lot looking for frightening wizard duels and attacks by magical creatures the first hour and a half of the movie drags on a bit. My son certainly became fidgety and didn't appreciate the finesse and sophistication of the plot and cinematic approach.Most of the threatening and darkening tone of the movie was also lost upon him whereas I reveled in the finer details contributing to a general sense of everencroaching darkness. There are worse things in life to be afraid of than big hairy spiders. My son missed seeing those  I was a lot more intrigued by the ominous undercurrents made palpable by the indomitable trio of David Yates director Steve Kloves screenplay and Delbonnel photography.Some people feel that the romantic comedy aspects played too large a role in the movie but I felt this aspect added some muchneeded lightness and human drama to the movie. Harry Daniel Radcliffe Hermione Emma Watson and Ron Rupert Grint all find themselves dealing with the vagaries of young love  from dealing with unwanted advances to finding love in unexpected places. The romance was aimed perfectly at the young teen market and I found myself cringing ruefully at some of Lavender Brown's loveobsessed stunts and smiling wistfully at the tenderness between Harry and Ginny. Haven't we all been there at some stage of our lives?All in all Harry Potter is growing up. And so is the market for these movies. If you've seen all the movies up to now or read all the books and your are at an age to appreciate the adult themes and movie techniques this movie should fall pitchperfect on your ear. You are likely to leave the cinema filled with a heartwrenching sadness for innocence lost. Purist fans will most certainly complain bitterly about numerous subplots events and characters that were cut from the movie and the odd scene that doesn't exist in the book. But Yates' truly gutsy adaptation really works and brings a depth and clarity to the main themes of the book that is quite extraordinary. He manages to capture the lingering lightness of that time before the serious business of adulthood sets in alongside the relentless buildup to the final showdown between The Dark Lord and The Chosen One. And the lack of closure at the end of the movie is no accident I believe. Just like the book this movie leaves you aching to see how it all ends never mind the fact that you already know.I must also commend the acting. The young leads have all matured in pace with the maturing content of the books and their acting shows it. Rupert Grint shines brightly in the somewhat Shakespearean love comedy he finds himself in and makes the most of his newfound sport hero popularity. Emma Watson hits the spot portraying Hermione's emotional vulnerability with gentle confidence and softness.As for Radcliffe it's easy to miss the evolution he's undergone as Harry since there are other actors ostensibly given more to do in this outing like Tom Felton and Bonnie Wright both of whom get the opportunity to take their characters to a new level. Tom Felton especially does a remarkable job. But Radcliffe's task of playing the steadfast and courageous yet not flashy or arrogant hero remains a difficult one. Especially on second viewing it becomes clear how his understated and controlled performance speaks very much to the type of man Harry Potter is shaping up to be. A man who is left with a tremendous responsibility at the end of this movie and takes it up without flinching. The boywizard is no more.Of the older guard Alan Rickman's Snape was a consummate performance ... obviously. And Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore never felt more right than in this movie.

	onyx:emotionText "I was lucky enough to see a preview of HalfBlood Prince three days before opening day. I saw it a second time with my son who is not quite ten but who is generally mature for his age and doesn't scare easily. The two viewings give me the unique advantage of both the adult and the child perspective on the movie. I only recently started counting myself a true Harry Potter fan after my son introduced me to the movies a couple of years ago. I finished the last book only three weeks before seeing the movie adaptation of HalfBlood Prince the first time.With all the book details very fresh in my mind I had high expectations of the movie. And Yates the production crew and the cast definitely delivered. The movie impresses on many levels from an artistic point of view. The stripped landscapes and washed out colors convey a constant feeling of dread and foreboding. The standard train trip to Hogwarts was particularly stark seen against a landscape scorched by a hot summer sun and dotted with dark pools of water. The usual lush greenery and joyous train ride are nowhere to be seen.Personally I felt the pace was spoton and that the movie elegantly made time for all key plot points. But only if you enjoy a plot line driven by character and emotion. For the younger lot looking for frightening wizard duels and attacks by magical creatures the first hour and a half of the movie drags on a bit. My son certainly became fidgety and didn't appreciate the finesse and sophistication of the plot and cinematic approach.Most of the threatening and darkening tone of the movie was also lost upon him whereas I reveled in the finer details contributing to a general sense of everencroaching darkness. There are worse things in life to be afraid of than big hairy spiders. My son missed seeing those  I was a lot more intrigued by the ominous undercurrents made palpable by the indomitable trio of David Yates director Steve Kloves screenplay and Delbonnel photography.Some people feel that the romantic comedy aspects played too large a role in the movie but I felt this aspect added some muchneeded lightness and human drama to the movie. Harry Daniel Radcliffe Hermione Emma Watson and Ron Rupert Grint all find themselves dealing with the vagaries of young love  from dealing with unwanted advances to finding love in unexpected places. The romance was aimed perfectly at the young teen market and I found myself cringing ruefully at some of Lavender Brown's loveobsessed stunts and smiling wistfully at the tenderness between Harry and Ginny. Haven't we all been there at some stage of our lives?All in all Harry Potter is growing up. And so is the market for these movies. If you've seen all the movies up to now or read all the books and your are at an age to appreciate the adult themes and movie techniques this movie should fall pitchperfect on your ear. You are likely to leave the cinema filled with a heartwrenching sadness for innocence lost. Purist fans will most certainly complain bitterly about numerous subplots events and characters that were cut from the movie and the odd scene that doesn't exist in the book. But Yates' truly gutsy adaptation really works and brings a depth and clarity to the main themes of the book that is quite extraordinary. He manages to capture the lingering lightness of that time before the serious business of adulthood sets in alongside the relentless buildup to the final showdown between The Dark Lord and The Chosen One. And the lack of closure at the end of the movie is no accident I believe. Just like the book this movie leaves you aching to see how it all ends never mind the fact that you already know.I must also commend the acting. The young leads have all matured in pace with the maturing content of the books and their acting shows it. Rupert Grint shines brightly in the somewhat Shakespearean love comedy he finds himself in and makes the most of his newfound sport hero popularity. Emma Watson hits the spot portraying Hermione's emotional vulnerability with gentle confidence and softness.As for Radcliffe it's easy to miss the evolution he's undergone as Harry since there are other actors ostensibly given more to do in this outing like Tom Felton and Bonnie Wright both of whom get the opportunity to take their characters to a new level. Tom Felton especially does a remarkable job. But Radcliffe's task of playing the steadfast and courageous yet not flashy or arrogant hero remains a difficult one. Especially on second viewing it becomes clear how his understated and controlled performance speaks very much to the type of man Harry Potter is shaping up to be. A man who is left with a tremendous responsibility at the end of this movie and takes it up without flinching. The boywizard is no more.Of the older guard Alan Rickman's Snape was a consummate performance ... obviously. And Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore never felt more right than in this movie. Jim Broadbent's Slughorn is deliciously played with just the right mix of offputting sycophancy and endearing pathos.All in all  a triumph all around!";

So i advise everyone to save their time and money and wait maybe for a rental. Its a little to late for me since i wasted my money and wont get the 2 hrs of my life back..Another thought if there's any thought for the next 2 final films to be amazing the directer David yates and the screen writer steve kloves must be fired.

The Global Union President arrives in a flyingsaucer with her retinue of worldsoldiers equipped with deathray guns to put an end to the rebellion. The president and the country are put on trial. The Austrian president recounts the country's' long battle for peace and shows how Austria stopped the invasion of the Turks and gave the world the operetta and the waltz.

It's not of great quality but  so sweet in some way and also an important piece of history a sciencefiction film as much as a document of a rather short period of Austrian history namely the ten years from 1945 to 1955 where the four occupying powers were here. The film takes a look into the future year 2000 where some things changed radically but most things are just the same as they were. The Big Four are still in the country and the new president played by Josef Meinrad suddenly claims that Austria is independent. The occupying powers immediately call the World Protection Commission that should decide whether Austria is endangering the world peace or not. If so they will destroy the country or at least evacuate ! the population into sparsely populated regions of the world.To politically interested people this will seem familiar. Funny how relevant this movie is to the current situation. Only two months before 2000 April 1st the European Union sanctioned Austria however for other reasons. And the sanctions were not as drastic as those in the film.I found it very sweet but it could also be seen as an unpleasant element that the film is full of patriotism. Every Austrian loves Austria! Hans Moser instructed by the president composes a song and the whole nation really the WHOLE nation sings it. Isn't that beautiful?A reason for the film's most exaggerated even childish ideas and developments is that it was made on behalf of the Austrian government not as some worldclass piece of art but in order to make publicity for their negotiations according the state treaty they wanted to get. Nothing of the plot is supposed to be taken seriously but the film as a whole is really amusing and original.".

April 2000 or April 1 2000 is an Austrian Germanlanguage film from 1952 so this one is already almost 65 years old. It is among the most known works by director Liebeneiner and the same applies to the writers Brunngraber and Marboe but also in their case because they were not really that prolific. This is a blackandwhite film and runs for 100 minutes approximately. One reason why this film has not totally vanished into oblivion is because the cast includes a whole lot of somewhat famous names such as Krahl Jrgens Meinrad Hrbiger and Moser. But the main reason i think is because of how different it is. Science fiction is even today not very frequent in Germanlanguage film but back then it was almost nonexistent. And this one here is as scifi as it gets. There are subgenres such as war comedy or maybe even romance but none of these are as present as science fiction. And it is a very Austrian film as it depicts a fictitious version of what 1950s people thought what Austrian in the year 2000 would look like? Well.. I doubt it. This is more of a comedic take and it is a very absurd film from start to finish. The UFOs early on say it all. Unfortunately I must say that I did not enjoy the watch here for the most part. To me it dragged on several occasions and I also felt there were too many characters in here that lacked elaboration who they were and what they did and most of all why they were in this movie for examples all the statesmen appearing early. Many characters were just there without adding anything to the film and I found it disappointing. I would only recommend this film to Austrians who really love blackandwhite films. Everybody else can skip it and they will not be missing much.".

Daughters of soldiers they are taught discipline and deprivation not luxury. The girls however have more personality and strength of character than those in the majority of movies produced nowadays. Manuela is a highly emotional 14 year old 'new girl' who has no mother. She like the rest of her classmates yearns for the attention of the fair and beautiful Fraulein von Burnberg. Ilse is the school troublemaker leader and clown. Witty and outspoken she repeatedly entertains the other girls binding them together in secret comradery against their oppressive elders. At an afterplay function Manuela is the only student who can tolerate the taste of the punch given to them as a reward. Her friends pass their cups on to her and she soon gets herself quite drunk. In a semiconscious state she announces her feelings for the popular Fraulein von Burnberg to the entire school along with the infuriated Headmistress. These girls are not all lesbians they are merely children starved of human contact and love. As a result they throw their hearts at the open mind and kind heart of Frau von Burnberg. I found it surprising and beautiful how loyal the girls were to each other. There is very little rivalry or conflict among the students a vast contrast to the modern representation of teens. Even when Manuela embarrasses herself horribly in front of the school her classmates stick by her without hesitation. That's cool.".

	schema:reviewBody "The original play Gestern und Morgen had its premiere in 1930 and was an immediate success. This prompted Carl Froelich to adapt the play for film. Both leading actress of the play Hertha Thiele her first film and the original director of the play Leontine Sagan also her first film were invited to join. The direction was split into direction of the cast and miseenscene by Leontine Sagan and overall direction by Carl Froelich this means that Froelich was responsible for the overall quality of the film in German Knstleriche Oberleitung.The play as well as the later novel emphasizes the sexuallesbian love theme but the film adaptation was toned down the original sad end was replaced by a happy end. Though the film goes as far as it can in its theme of awakening lesbian feelings and sexual feelings of young girls in general  shifting emphasis automatically meant concentrating on the theme of the cold and inhumane authoritarian Prussian way of life and upbringing a way of thinking still present in the Weimar republic and in 1931 already considered a danger to the young republic. Then audiences were more interested in this aspect than in the sexual one. Despite this it still remains a remarkable film of the Weimar period in depicting the more loosening attitude towards sexuality in general as well as the dismissal of the old authoritarian life style though and this is the weak point of the premise  it never succeeds in relating the two.  A political stand this film certainly takes not but as the original title Yesterday and Tomorrow says this film makes a plea for a more liberal and humane society.  Of course the film was banned after the Nazi takeover though for some obscure reason Goebbels liked the film as film.The old way of thinking is shown in some remarkable images. The opening of the film after some shots of Potsdam  shows first the marching of soldiers than cuts to a  walk of the girls the girls do not walk but march as the soldiers do. The Prussian authority is represented by the Frau Oberin whose presence in the film is that like an average hard boiled Prussian king and not unlike Frederick the Great the king who was depicted in nationalist films in the 20' and 30's a number of times her hairdo is not simply a way to wear one's hair it fits like a crown on her head. When she presides a meeting with the other teachers she presides as a queen sitting slightly above the level of the teachers. Fear for authority is conveyed through the Von Kenten character whose physical attitude constantly is that of a writhed of fear human being.Note the military trumpet in the final scene one of the examples of the excellent use of sound as Frau Oberin walks resigned through the corridor there may have been a small relapse in the system within the institution the trumpet tells us that outside things are still unchanged.The direction of SaganFroelich and the cinematography are outstanding but it could never have become the classic it is if  both Hertha Thiele and Dorothea Wieck had not been in the lead. Photogenic Thiele plays Manuela as a sensitive but still proud girl Wieck gives the Von Bernburg character all the subtleties and uncertainties it needs. But let's not forget the completely forgotten actress Ellen von Schwannecke as a wonderful Ilse. Thiele and Wieck would repeat their cooperation in an amazing film by Frank Wysbar one of the producers of Mdchen Anna und Elisabeth 1933 also a film with a lesbian theme.A very odd aspect is also noteworthy. The 4 main people involved can be divided in 2 sub groups Hertha Thiele and Leontine Sagan went into exile in 1933 and were not to have a career after 1945 in WestGermany while Dorothea Wieck and Carl Froelich he became member of the NSDAP continued their careers in Nazi Germany and after 1945. Convinced of it that involvement in this film also meant according its basic ideas remember that it was not an established production company that made the film but a collective  this splitup of minds can almost be seen as symbol for the schism in Germany.For a complete understanding of this film and the play I recommend to read the novel as well.".

The quality of the film was certainly poor and the subtitles leave much to question but the overall effect of the film is poignant. It succeeds in lifting the veil which conceals adolescent female life and without exploiting the budding sexuality of young girls a phenomenon too often seen in cinema today. It seems strange that this careful balance of exposition and preservation was better kept seventy years ago than it is today.  Should this movie be remade now one would doubtless see nuditystereotypical lesbian behavior and exploitation of the relationship between the student and teacher.

	schema:reviewBody "Even though this film wasn't the most crowdpleasing one I've seen lately I think it's a rather important one.  The openly lesbian themes of the movie are quite surprising considering that the movie was made in 1931.  The theme of sexual discovery in a girls' boarding school was quite revolutionary for film at the time.  It was also an interesting critique of society and was very antifascist.  The Prussian principal represents the authoritarian militaristic aspect of society while the kind teacher represents a more maternal and loving part.  The combination of lesbian themes with that kind character shows us that a more femaledominated society would be a positive change.  The Prussian school shows that women are oppressed by patriarchal society into a militaristic machine and the rebel teacher is a movement away from that.  This film is an intriguing view of life right before Hitler.  It provides a meaningful glimpse into the lesbian subculture of Berlin before the Nazis came to power.".

The acting is of great quality.  You don't need to know German to understand what's going on even with out the subtitles. I find it interesting that feminine sexual powers are used throughout the film. The beloved teacher Frulein von Bernburg uses her sexual powers to win the affection of the children keeping them in check. During rehearsals for a play one of the girls is told to use her feminine powers to be more seductive to play her part.  Sex appeal is also mentioned in describing a movie star. The antifascism isn't blatant in the film but in the opening scene we see soldiers marching and then the schoolgirls marching hinting at the hidden meaning.

	schema:headline " Mdchen in Uniform is clearly a wonderful portrayal of sexuality in film but what exactly is the sexuality that is portrayed?";
	schema:reviewBody "Mdchen in Uniform is a very impressive German film that presents an unusual sexual awakening in an equally unusual situation which leads to some complex content to analyze. It is clearly the presentation of a sexuality that is not considered normal but it is not necessarily a lesbian film. I think that the fact that there is not a single man in the film and even more the intimate relationship between Manuela and Frulein von Bernburg give the impression that there is a strong lesbian undertone in the film but I don't think that it was meant to be seen that way. It seemed to me that it was more of a coming of age film than a lesbian film.I think that Mdchen in Uniform was the portrayal of a girl who needed a higher than average amount of attention and who was reaching the age where her sexuality was beginning to take form and because she was in an allgirl school and had no male influence in her life she attached to the most accessible person who could fulfill those needs  Frulein von Bernburg. It seemed to me that Manuela became so amorously attached to Frulein von Bernburg more because of a lack of options than because of an interest in the same sex. There is undeniably a lot of femalefemale eroticism in the film such as that goodnight kiss but I don't think that it is a portrayal of lesbianism. It seems to me that the film has at least as much to say about budding sexuality and freedom of exploration for teenagers as it does about homosexuality.Manuela's needs for attention and the same need harbored by the other girls in the film was most directly presented in the scene where Frulein von Bernburg comes through the room to kiss the girls goodnight one by one. In the novel Swann's Way Marcel Proust presents a character who is so obsessed with his goodnight kiss from his mother that he literally fantasizes about it all day and then is miserable after she kisses him because he will have to wait so long before he gets that attention from her again. He is completely dependent on that kiss and in that gigantic novel a large part of the reason that he is so obsessed with his mother's kiss is because he is largely isolated from the outside world an has an emotionally distant father. His only source of affectionate attention is from his mother and it is portrayed in a way that almost seems incestuous because he loves so much to feel his mothers lips on his face. This is the same thing that is going on in Mdchen in Uniform except in a slightly different form.Now whether or not Mdchen in Uniform is in fact a lesbian film there are definitely some typical stereotypes derailed in the close of the movie. Manuela was driven to the point of suicide by the adults at the allgirl school she attended and it was the children who had to come in to save her which is an element of the story that strengthens the assertion that it supports freedom for teenagers who are clearly able to make wise decisions on their own and there is also the fact that she did not commit suicide which is significant because it would have been the stereotypical way for a woman especially a homosexual woman to respond to a stressful situation that she cannot control.It seemed to me that in that way the movie broke down a some stereotypes but it is important to really analyze the film so that we can see what if any stereotypes are applied to the characters and to the story. The sexuality in the film is obviously not traditional but one must take into account the circumstances under which that sexuality is portrayed before one can decipher a specific message from the film.".

This film is not so much about lesbianism as it is about Germany was striving to become so disciplined and unfeeling towards one another. Of course lesbianism was bound to happen. There were no other options. You have a girl who wants to be loved and love just seems unthinkable in the German culture of the Nazi uprising. Even though this film was made in 1931 the girls' uniforms reminded me of the concentration camps uniforms. The school was trying to discourage close relationships between girls and among teachers and students. I don't think of it much as a lesbian film as a chilling portrait of how Germany was bounded for destruction during World War II. Maybe the film points as a good reminder of how relationships should be encouraged and feelings are human. This school was trying to restrict the girls' humanity into an almost robotlike existence. That's how I always saw this film. I never thought of it as a lesbian film because the girls in the school had no other choice or option. They weren't allowed freedom and that's what the major theme of this movie is. Germany was beginning to restrict it's freedom on their citizens and forcing them to become less human in order to succeed but that's just my opinion.".

The story is never boring and easily holds one's interest these many years later. It is strongly atmospheric and immerses one in the hothouse environs of the strictly disciplined allfemale world where the girls develop close and intimate relationships and passionate crushes on their favorite teacher Dorothea Wieck. She is fine here and so is Hertha Thiele as Manuela the primary focus of the story but then the entire cast performs well including Erika Mann daughter of Thomas Mann and wife of W.H. Auden as a bespectacled tattletale instructor always running to the head of the school. The ending sent out a strong message and worked well though you are left on your own to wonder how things resolved themselves as per the two lead characters.

A little knowledge of EuroGerman history was helpful  since this movie was banned in Germany just prior to Hitler's coming into full power and there is a lesbian angle to the story. Yet having lived in Europe I was NOT prone to assigning every handholding dance or goodnight kiss to lesbianism. The Prussian attitudes were represented by the older women still in power and the new German attitudes were given to the young girls the hope of the future. Germany couldn't have been in much more turmoil at the time and was cranking up towards the war to make up for the last war fascism racial purification intolerance and an even deeper sense of conformity. This film is loaded with the era's issues and not necessarily supportive of where Germany was headed.".

It was banned and tried to eradicate from existence. Luckily there were not successful and copies of it still exist today. Another reason why they hated it was certainly the antiauthoritarian plot here with all the actresses playing students and staff at an allgirls school. And the main antagonist was the old Oberin the head of the institute with her strict rules and regulations. Not only one of the film's director is female Leontine Sagan but the entire cast here is. No males included.I thought it took a while till the film really became good but the longer it goes the better it becomes. I would not call it a mussee but it certainly has its moments and a pretty dramatic final sequence too. the last show with the head mistress leaving is also quite good. Today none of the actresses in here are really famous but the film still is probably more famous than the remake starring Romy Schneider from the 1950s. I think both films are good and I recommend checking them out. Thumbs up for Mdchen in Uniform.".

Near the opening just when the new girl is being shown around the boarding school there is a scene of the girls' chorus enthusiastically singing a patriotic song and the camera dollies in through the mob to one particular face. As it does so the sound of her voice becomes louder and distinguishable from the others so we can hear that she's shouting a corruption of the lyrics  something about needing to eat.The careful meshing of images and sound wasn't standard for the time except of course that Hitchcock had played around with it in early films like Blackmail. But it's apparent that some effort was put into the direction. There's a nicely staged high angle shot of a fivestory square staircase filled with chattering children moving upward as if on a frisky escalator.The new girl is fourteenyearold Manuela von Meinhardis whose mother had died when she was young and father serves in the military. After the other students welcome her they warn her about falling in love with one of the teachers the compassionate but mercurial Frulein von Bernburg. Manuela then is promptly groomed and fitted with an ugly uniform with precise and ergonomic Grndlichkeit.This is some girls' school too. The rules are strict somewhere between a convent and Marine Corps boot camp. You can't have money candy or books of your own. You can't put a picture of a movie star on the inside of your locker door. Everything is presided over by a stern homely Headmistress who reminds me of Miss Pavor DeGrone my fifth grade arithmetic teacher. Try to imagine a scowling Erik von Stroheim in drag. Through discipline and hunger we shall be great again. Now this is 1931 so Hitler hadn't risen to the dazzling heights he would yet achieve but it's also Prussia home of the Junkers land of the Spartans.At bed time von Bernburg comes around to the dormitory and kisses each girl delicately on the head. The girls hungry for affection as well as chocolate await their turns ecstatically. But when it's Manuela's turn she throws herself into the teacher's arms and they kiss on the lips which introduces a note into the relationship that's only been hinted at before although the note is minor. In a later scene von Bernburg gives Manuela a new petticoat and the impression is conveyed that the teacher is especially fond of Manuela but that Manuela's affection goes rather deeper than that. Well after all Manuela is at an age where as the headmistress puts it their emotions are aroused. Any doubt about Manuela's physical development is put to rest in a scene in which she wears tights as part of a costume for Schiller's play Don Carlos. She's pretty nicely filled out even if she's illegal. Schiller wrote the play around 1785. I had to read his work in a German class and he's pretty good even amusing at times. It's Schiller's words that are sung by the chorus in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony some of the noblest music extant.During a postplay celebration an alcoholic punch is passed around and Manuela happy beyond imagining because she was successful as the principal player and because she believes von Bernburg loves her gets drunk and shouts out some opinions that find their way to the ears of Miss DeGrone I mean the headmistress. Manuela and von Bernburg are forbidden to speak to one another again and Manuela's classmates are ordered to shun her. This leaves Manuela pretty down in the dumps. I'll leave it at that.I suppose it was surprising in 1931 to find a film dealing with what everyone since appears to have called lesbianism but it's really a story about the need to leaven discipline with understanding and mercy. Anyway it's not really surprising that the teenaged girls should develop crushes on an authority figure or on each other even if it leads to some sexual experimentation.This is the kind of school that sociologists call a total institution in which everything is controlled and people of the same sex are forced to spend time together. If this is as bad as it gets in a Prussian girls boarding school any state prison in American has it beat by a mile.".

It's about a Prussianstyle girls school and the difficulty a new arrival has at fitting in to the stupidly strict system i.e. rules just for the sake of having rules. This difficulty is remediated somewhat by a kind housemother. In this relationship there are strong hints of lesbianism though considering this is the early 1930s a modern viewer may find the treatment of this taboo a little vague and sillythough not nearly as silly as the excised gay scene from Spartacus. For this reason alone it is a very curious movie. I actually would have found it perhaps more interesting if they had either allowed this relationship to evolve more or if they had helped the young infatuated girl to understand how these feelings are perhaps related to her loss of her mother and her own pubescence another parallel issue in the movie. Oh well. This isn't really a complaint just curiosity.Late in the movie there is a dandy climax cinematic not sexual. The young girl is pushed and pushed unmercifully by the draconian headmistress until she attempts suicide. I liked this touch but wonder how the story might have been different if either the girl HAD actually died. Also after she is saved the movie ends with the headmistress visibly shakenbut ends there. I wanted to see what would happen next in the mind of the movie's writers and director.Oh well enough of my ranting. It's a good though not great movie with themes that make it either an adult film or at least one you should think twice before letting your teens see it alone maybe see it with them and discuss the images instead.".

What is lost in the translation to English though are many of the messages that were quite revolutionary for the time and place that the movie was made.  The film actually reflects the preNazi German society especially the places of both women and homosexuality.  This was hard to follow in the subtitles which showing the movie's age were often missing or very hard to read.  I found the movie rather unentertaining to watch however I feel that if I had known more about the time period and place that it was coming from before I viewed it then it might have had greater meaning to me.  If the language and cultural barrier can be crossed I feel the Madchen in Uniform achieves its point of addressing the social and political issues of Germany when it is observed with the correct historical context and openness in mind.".

	schema:reviewBody "My initial reaction to this film was that it served no purpose.  It seemed to me at least to be about a German boarding school for girls who mostly had lesbian infatuations with their teacher and other students.  Although this is what it is mainly about its true nature is to illustrate the bonds and relationships created between friends and also to show the importance of a maternal figure in a girl's life.  When Manuela first arrives at the school she has a gap in her life that would usually be filled by a mother figure.  Because her mother died her father did not know how to take care of her and her aunt did not give her the love she needed she searches for someone who can give her what she has been lacking for so long.  Fraulein von Bernburg is the teacher who can do this.  She is strict with the students yet does not punish them.  She treats Manuela in a way she does no other.  If this love began as something similar to the type a family would share it slowly transitions to something more than that.  It creates a bond between them that is not permitted in the school but in the end it allows both Manuela and Fraulein von Bernburg to be set free from the oppression of the school.  A criticism I have though is the ending.  Once the finale occurs it just ends.  No closure is brought to these characters. Although it was a touching story line for the most part this movie was not very entertaining.".

	schema:headline " Mdchen in Uniform is clearly a wonderful portrayal of sexuality in film but what exactly is the sexuality that is portrayed?";
	schema:reviewBody "Mdchen in Uniform is a very impressive German film that presents an unusual sexual awakening in an equally unusual situation which leads to some complex content to analyze. It is clearly the presentation of a sexuality that is not considered normal but it is not necessarily a lesbian film. I think that the fact that there is not a single man in the film and even more the intimate relationship between Manuela and Frulein von Bernburg give the impression that there is a strong lesbian undertone in the film but I don't think that it was meant to be seen that way. It seemed to me that it was more of a coming of age film than a lesbian film.I think that Mdchen in Uniform was the portrayal of a girl who needed a higher than average amount of attention and who was reaching the age where her sexuality was beginning to take form and because she was in an allgirl school and had no male influence in her life she attached to the most accessible person who could fulfill those needs  Frulein von Bernburg. It seemed to me that Manuela became so amorously attached to Frulein von Bernburg more because of a lack of options than because of an interest in the same sex. There is undeniably a lot of femalefemale eroticism in the film such as that goodnight kiss but I don't think that it is a portrayal of lesbianism. It seems to me that the film has at least as much to say about budding sexuality and freedom of exploration for teenagers as it does about homosexuality.Manuela's needs for attention and the same need harbored by the other girls in the film was most directly presented in the scene where Frulein von Bernburg comes through the room to kiss the girls goodnight one by one. In the novel Swann's Way Marcel Proust presents a character who is so obsessed with his goodnight kiss from his mother that he literally fantasizes about it all day and then is miserable after she kisses him because he will have to wait so long before he gets that attention from her again. He is completely dependent on that kiss and in that gigantic novel a large part of the reason that he is so obsessed with his mother's kiss is because he is largely isolated from the outside world an has an emotionally distant father. His only source of affectionate attention is from his mother and it is portrayed in a way that almost seems incestuous because he loves so much to feel his mothers lips on his face. This is the same thing that is going on in Mdchen in Uniform except in a slightly different form.Now whether or not Mdchen in Uniform is in fact a lesbian film there are definitely some typical stereotypes derailed in the close of the movie. Manuela was driven to the point of suicide by the adults at the allgirl school she attended and it was the children who had to come in to save her which is an element of the story that strengthens the assertion that it supports freedom for teenagers who are clearly able to make wise decisions on their own or at least need to be given at least a small amount of freedom and respect and there is also the fact that she did not commit suicide which is significant because it would have been the stereotypical way for a woman especially a homosexual woman to respond to a stressful situation that she cannot control.It seemed to me that in that way the movie broke down some stereotypes but it is important to really analyze the film so that we can see what if any stereotypes are applied to the characters and to the story. The sexuality in the film is obviously not traditional but one must take into account the circumstances under which that sexuality is portrayed before one can decipher a specific message from the film.".

His current amour is Malcolm Hayworth and he gives her the same story he's given all of them  his wife Oberon won't divorce him. However he receives a telegram stating that she has and he panics. He rushes home to New York with Malcolm right behind him and tries to woo her back. She's planning to marry Mr. Wright Bellamy who is more than disturbed by the fact that she still seems interested in her husband.This is a fairly trite comedy with some very funny slapstick and of course two of the screen's most beautiful women Oberon and Hayworth. This film was made just before Hayworth broke through into big stardom and she's delicious. She has the best role in the film. It always amuses me to see her so vivacious and talkative on screen. According to one of her biographers when the kids from the old neighborhood saw her on screen for the first time they were shocked at how much she was talking. She never talked as a young girl. Though she didn't really like movie stardom the screen was where she could let herself go and be someone else. Morgan is attractive and just right as the errant husband. Bellamy is in his usual role as the man who doesn't get the girl and he does beleaguered very well. Oberon lends sophistication and class to the film. Someone commented here that she looked plump. I don't know what they're talking about.This is a good movie to see for the stars. The story isn't much.".

Again and again you KNOW by the end of the movie he'll be left alone so when I saw him dating Dennis Morgan's exwife Merle Oberon in this movie I knew he'd be a miserable loser eventually!The film begins with Morgan learning that his wife's divorce is final and he connives to get her backthough she's now with Bellamy! of all people! So he's off to get her...and pretty Rita Hayworth is following as she wants him and is thrilled that he's now divorced. While all of this is reasonably enjoyable I couldn't help thinking that I've seen similar films many timesand often the other films were a bit better. After all while Moran and Oberon were fine the likes of Cary Grant Irene Dunne or Rosalind Russell simply were better. My advice is see The Awful Truth His Girl Fridayor My Favorite Wife instead.

Morgan is only mildly amusing in his attempt to play a comic role with GEORGE TOBIAS getting some of the best lines. But Rita does well as a flirtatious lady who'd like to take him away from Merle and RALPH BELLAMY is good in another one of his thankless roles as the man who loses the girl.Despite the cast it's too trite to be really enjoyable and the gags just don't work.

Here we have wife Merle Oberon divorcing Dennis because he is rarely around. The picture is devoted to Morgan trying to woo wife Merle back. Bellamy is her new beau and Rita Hayworth plays a reporter with designs on Morgan as well. James Gleason is Morgan's boss who only sees breaking up the latter with his wife so that he can get the most out of him workwise.The ending is almost slapsticklike and not much appreciated.".

As far as how accurate the story is  for Fox not bad at all. The background of Bell's teaching experience and family history of working with speech and sound is correct he did have a demonstration of his new device he did have patent problems he did take on the little boy and Mabel as deaf clients to teach he did teach fingerspelling he did have patent problems he did marry Mabel their first child was a girl and Mabel's father was one of his investors. The Fonda character Watson was also real though Bell had two other assistants and the scene where Bell finds out the telephone works when he calls for Watson is accurate. Also Bell mentions a great interest in aeronautics in the movie  he indeed did a lot of work in aeronautics later on.Don Ameche does a great job as Bell. Before Tyrone Power appeared at 20th Century Fox Ameche was set for many more lead roles Power's popularity pushed him into second leads. If Ameche seems melodramatic in the courtroom scenes that was the style of the day. He gives a serious intense and sincere performance. It's probably the role for which he's best remembered. Henry Fonda is wonderful  he's funny and relaxed positively excellent. In another year he'd be starring in his own movies. Loretta Young as Mabel is believable as well as lovely and her sisters in real life  Sally Blane Polly Young and Georgiana Young  play her sisters here.Gene Lockhart as Sanders is another standout in a poignant performance as a man who wants his deaf son to be able to speak. Charles Coburn plays Mable's nononsense gruff father very well.Considering that the movie Suez is fiction from beginning to end 20th Century Fox is to be commended for bringing so much real history into this film and making it so entertaining.".

	schema:headline " Great biography picture in it's time";
	schema:reviewBody "Alexander Graham Bell came from a family of elocutionists. His grandfather and father were both published on the subject. He trained also to become a teacher but having a deaf mother he came to desire more than just teaching.In his early stages of teaching he begins by teaching a young mute boy Bobs Watson while being paid by the father of the boy Gene Lockhart. The money he earns from this he uses to work on first the telegraph then the telephone.The mute boy's father is so pleased with the way his son can communicate using a special alphabet glovethat he introduces Bell to his friend Charles Coburn who has 4 daughters including a daughter who became death after having scarlet fever when she was younger. The father kept speaking of his 'little girl'. Imagine Bells surprise when it turned out to be a grown woman Loretta Young who along with her three sisters play the roles of the business man's daughters.Mabel Young 'fell' for him at first sight as she accidentally runs into him when he is coming to their house not realizing he is the man her father invited to help her. Thinking this business man is going to be able to help him finance the telegraph he begins to tell him of his invention until the father says he wants Bell to help his daughter. They can talk of the invention another time.The two fall in love with Young playing a woman who not only backs Alec's BellAmeche grand ideas and inventions but encourages him not to give up hope and occasionally puts her foot down when it comes to him not giving up the idea of inventing the telephone and when Bell later is attacked by a firm who claim he stole their invention and sued Bell.Bell got this news right when it seemed things were going the best for him. Queen Victoria had agreed to wire the castle with the telephone and what the queen did was often imitated throughout the world! Plus Bell finds out he is to be a father. But he also gets a letter from his father in law that a company is suing him for copyright stealing.He determines to return to the States fight the lawsuit with truth to defend not only his invention but his fatherinlaw his friend the mute boy's father both of whom backed him to the hilt on the telephone his partner in experiments WatsonHenry Fonda and for all inventors who are poor and have their ideas copyrighted only to be stolen by those with less scruples and more money.When she hears how badly the trial is going due to lack of evidence Bell's wife and mother come to the trial. It seems that for lack of available paper Bell had written a love letter to his dear Mabel on the back of an important bit of evidence that could be the key to him winning the lawsuit and keep he and his partners from being robbed of his invention and going bankrupt.Interestingly both Lockhart and Coburn also are important players in the story 'Edison the Man' but with Coburn being the more sympathetic and Lockhart the heavy. In this one Lockhart is usually more sympathetic and Coburn usually more cynical. Both have added beards and mustaches that change the appearance to a degree. This film I believe was released first.Yes it is likely that Hollywood may have embellished the biography a bit and why not? It is an inspiring film that shows that there is much hunger pain and even delays in being married when someone follows their dream to invent. But it also is often well worth it if the inventor sticks with it. Of course it's no guarantee all stories will turn out as well as this one and ironically in Edison the Man Edison also has to defend his invention of electricity in court.Not sure if anyone else caught it but I think they did make one goof in the film. Towards the end the mother of Bell's wife Spring Byington knocks on the door of the room Bell and his wife are in.

	onyx:emotionText "Alexander Graham Bell came from a family of elocutionists. His grandfather and father were both published on the subject. He trained also to become a teacher but having a deaf mother he came to desire more than just teaching.In his early stages of teaching he begins by teaching a young mute boy Bobs Watson while being paid by the father of the boy Gene Lockhart. The money he earns from this he uses to work on first the telegraph then the telephone.The mute boy's father is so pleased with the way his son can communicate using a special alphabet glovethat he introduces Bell to his friend Charles Coburn who has 4 daughters including a daughter who became death after having scarlet fever when she was younger. The father kept speaking of his 'little girl'. Imagine Bells surprise when it turned out to be a grown woman Loretta Young who along with her three sisters play the roles of the business man's daughters.Mabel Young 'fell' for him at first sight as she accidentally runs into him when he is coming to their house not realizing he is the man her father invited to help her. Thinking this business man is going to be able to help him finance the telegraph he begins to tell him of his invention until the father says he wants Bell to help his daughter. They can talk of the invention another time.The two fall in love with Young playing a woman who not only backs Alec's BellAmeche grand ideas and inventions but encourages him not to give up hope and occasionally puts her foot down when it comes to him not giving up the idea of inventing the telephone and when Bell later is attacked by a firm who claim he stole their invention and sued Bell.Bell got this news right when it seemed things were going the best for him. Queen Victoria had agreed to wire the castle with the telephone and what the queen did was often imitated throughout the world! Plus Bell finds out he is to be a father. But he also gets a letter from his father in law that a company is suing him for copyright stealing.He determines to return to the States fight the lawsuit with truth to defend not only his invention but his fatherinlaw his friend the mute boy's father both of whom backed him to the hilt on the telephone his partner in experiments WatsonHenry Fonda and for all inventors who are poor and have their ideas copyrighted only to be stolen by those with less scruples and more money.When she hears how badly the trial is going due to lack of evidence Bell's wife and mother come to the trial. It seems that for lack of available paper Bell had written a love letter to his dear Mabel on the back of an important bit of evidence that could be the key to him winning the lawsuit and keep he and his partners from being robbed of his invention and going bankrupt.Interestingly both Lockhart and Coburn also are important players in the story 'Edison the Man' but with Coburn being the more sympathetic and Lockhart the heavy. In this one Lockhart is usually more sympathetic and Coburn usually more cynical. Both have added beards and mustaches that change the appearance to a degree. This film I believe was released first.Yes it is likely that Hollywood may have embellished the biography a bit and why not? It is an inspiring film that shows that there is much hunger pain and even delays in being married when someone follows their dream to invent. But it also is often well worth it if the inventor sticks with it. Of course it's no guarantee all stories will turn out as well as this one and ironically in Edison the Man Edison also has to defend his invention of electricity in court.Not sure if anyone else caught it but I think they did make one goof in the film. Towards the end the mother of Bell's wife Spring Byington knocks on the door of the room Bell and his wife are in. I believe Bell may ask who it is but when the mother says it's mom Bell's wife deaf says 'come in Mom'. Either a clever guess on her part or an error revealing that she can really hear. Nothing had been said that I could see...to show if he was somehow able to help her hear or to give her a clue as to who it was at the door.To the commenter that was deaf and asked about Young's character Mabel being born deaf or becoming it the father says it was from scarlet fever as a young girl and she was sent to England I believe to study how to read lips.Considering that it was 18756 that the story was set in and that the film was release only about 10 years into 'talkies' I thought it was quite a good performance on Young's part.An enjoyable movie.

He is like Gregory Peck and Christopher Reeve in that respect.It's fictionalised in parts  for instance since Bell only went to Canada and later the US in his 20s he should really have a Scottish accent  but I think that it's fairly accurate for the most part. Bell's two daughters Elsie  who is depicted in the film as a baby  and Marian were still alive when it was released. I wonder if they saw it and what they thought of it.

More complex than two Styrofoam cups and a string he tries fails and finally succeeds.

Cynical against Bell's dreams Coburn at first stands in their way but the gentle Gene Lockhart for once cast against type as a truly likable character completely supports him as Bell has taken interest in his young deaf son the adorable Bobby Watson giving Lockhart a touching Christmas present that is a four hankie moment. In a smaller role Henry Fonda plays Bell's assistant Mr. Watson who is there for the groundbreaking moment.This lavish production features a huge cast of character performers including Spring Byington Coburn's dingy wife Elizabeth Patterson a cantankerous landlady Beryl Mercer the imperious Queen Victoria Zeffie Tilbury Lockhart's lovable mother and Harry Davenport as the judge in the patent trial. Loretta Young is joined onscreen by her reallife sisters as her character's sisters.Overshadowed in memory because of so many masterpieces released in the same year 1939 it was still Ameche's most famous role among dozens in which he simply held court for leading ladies like Young Alice Faye and Betty Grable. Ameche's wideeyed enthusiasm which has sometimes been mocked is actually engaging. It is just what America needed in 1939 to remind them after a lengthy depression and the onslaught of war in Europe of the achievements of the past century in the wake of some truly tough times ahead.".

	schema:reviewBody "I felt compelled to click the Contains spoiler box for a story about Alexander Graham Bell the spoiler being that he invented the telephone. What does that tell us about the end of civilization as we know it? Actually this is an engaging movie although I believed only certain features of its presentation. Alexander Graham Bell was born. He invented the telephone. He died. Of those points I'm sure. I guess his wife was deaf and Bell himself a Scot by birth was preceded by two generations of writers interested in the mechanics of speech and associated pathologies. And we know he had an assistant named Watson Henry Fonda here because of that famous first voice transmission  Watson come here. I need you. I'm doubtful that it was caused by Bell's having spilled sulfuric acid on his leg. It's true too that the success of the device was boosted when it was adopted in the palace of Queen Victoria or so I was taught years ago in an anthropology course on culture change and innovation.But all that doesn't amount to much. The film is an entertaining piece of semieducational family fare.

	onyx:emotionText "I felt compelled to click the Contains spoiler box for a story about Alexander Graham Bell the spoiler being that he invented the telephone. What does that tell us about the end of civilization as we know it? Actually this is an engaging movie although I believed only certain features of its presentation. Alexander Graham Bell was born. He invented the telephone. He died. Of those points I'm sure. I guess his wife was deaf and Bell himself a Scot by birth was preceded by two generations of writers interested in the mechanics of speech and associated pathologies. And we know he had an assistant named Watson Henry Fonda here because of that famous first voice transmission  Watson come here. I need you. I'm doubtful that it was caused by Bell's having spilled sulfuric acid on his leg. It's true too that the success of the device was boosted when it was adopted in the palace of Queen Victoria or so I was taught years ago in an anthropology course on culture change and innovation.But all that doesn't amount to much. The film is an entertaining piece of semieducational family fare. Bell and Watson suffer through hard times together punctuated by occasional breakthroughs or epiphanies usually followed by more hard times. As Watson Henry Fonda adds some necessary commonsensical and often softly funny observations about the lives they're leading. Too bad he more or less disappears from the movie about half way through like Lear's fool.But it's Boston in 1875 and we see the obsessive Bell making his way through a light snow fall of cornflakes while children throw snowballs at him a lamplighter lights a lamp screaming children ride sleds along the sidewalks embanked by fake snow and horses and carriage jingle their way down the studio streets.

	schema:headline " Classic theatrical version of the invention of the telephone.";
	schema:reviewBody "1939 was indeed a magical year for Hollywood and this classic biop of one of American's most celebrated inventors during his most interesting period is one of the less remembered highlights. I was very surprised at the rather few reviews at this site compared to the several hundred reviews of The Grapes of Wrath released the following year. Both were shot in high quality BW. Although it much simplifies and often grossly fictionalizes the details relating to the invention of and subsequent patent battles relating to the first practical telephone it definitely succeeds as a vibrant theatrical presentation of Bell and his associates during this exciting time period. Bell makes a particularly appealing subject for this sort of film because of his primary interest during this period in teaching the deafincluding his future wife to communicate by visuals and speech trainingalthough he was very opposed to a special sign language!. Also his status as a pooroverly emphasized lone inventor trying to scoop some well financed competitors.Ironically the invention of an auditory means of instantaneous long distance communication served to further isolate the deaf from mainstream society being at least partially dependent on visual communication. The profoundly deaf would have to await the advent of relatively cheap FAX machines and PCs to participate directly in relatively fast long distance communications other than using the telegraph...The viewer should also be aware that it was Tom Edison's subsequent invention of the carbonbased transmitterreceiver that finally provided clear speech over long distances and thus greatly increased the utility of the telephone. The casting was near perfect. The classy infectiously hyperactive Don Ameche and gorgeous always empathetic Loretta Young had played husband and wife before in Ramona and were a very charismatic match in this film. Loretta mostly just had to look lovely supposedly learn to communicate using lip reading and be continuously supportive of Bell's 'crazy' inventive obsessions. Having her real sisters play her stage sisters was a nice embellishing touch.Some complain that Ameche constantly grossly overacted. But to me his hyperenthusiasm about whatever he was doing translated into greater interest in the film proceedings. He personifies the obsessive enthusiasm of the inventor or scientist who feels he is on the verge of a great discovery as well as the dogged determination of the healer who feels his efforts make a lifechanging impact on his patients.Just as Dr. Watson was indispensable to Sherlock Homes. and Jim Watson partnered with Francis Crick in figuring out the structure of DNA young2022y.o Tom Watson was hired to make Bell's experimental efforts at an improved telegraph and telephone. Bell was not mechanically gifted thus required such a person to make his ideas a practical reality. Some complain that Henry Fonda's Watson was too much the opposite of Ameche's hyperenthusiatic sometimes nearly hysterical Bell laconic frequently complaining and pessimistic. However theatrically Fonda's Watson serves to help balance Ameche's Bell giving the audience a respite. He also served to articulate the many frustrations and sacrifices typically involved in trying to invent something revolutionary.The very familiar character actors Charles Coburn and Gene Lockhart play their usual roles as mature authority figures serving as Bell's reluctant source of financing during this period Coburn also playing Bell's future father in law. They are later characterized as risking their entire fortunes in financing Bell's patent war. Thus they also achieve the status of heroes in this film. There is a villain in this story in the form of competing inventor Eliza Gray and his supporting corporation Western Electric who file a patent infringement suit against Bell's fledgling company. Both filed a patent for very similar devices on the very same day thus the assumption is that one must have stolen the idea from the other but who did the stealing? Things look bad for Bell during most of the trial but it's resolved in fictitious melodramatic style when Loretta unexpectedly reads a dated love letter from Bell to the court then oh incidentally reveals that it was written on the back of a diagram of his key thinking and breakthrough apparatus. Historically Eliza Gray was no villain but a competent inventor of other things. This trial segment afforded Ameche the opportunity to articulate a memorable impassioned plea not to allow wellhealed corporations to bully poor individual inventors into giving up legal credit for their inventions. This speech reminds me of a number of other impassioned speeches in films of this era such as those of Paul Muni  when playing Louis Pasteur or Emile Zola and Spencer Tracey when playing Henry Stanley or defending Clark Gable's character in Boomtown for example. Granted that this film was mainly about Bell's invention of a telephone. However Tom Watson's essential contribution to this invention has been consistently downplayed although the easy going Watson never seemed to care. Watson was actually much like Bell in that he easily got bored with a given lifestyle thus periodically attempted to shed his skin. After a few additional years making all of Bell's early commercial telephones he decided to play farmer for a few years but soon grew bored with that. Then he began making marine motors and eventually built his company into the Fore River Ship and Engine company one of the largest in the US. During a period of financial trouble he quit this and tried his hand at being a geologist after study at MIT. Not very successful he then decided to become a stage actor and playwright later adding public lectures on various topics in his declining years. His last celebrated dealing with the telephone occurred in 1915 when he joined Bell in the symbolic first transcontinental phone conversation thus commemorating their first  accidental phone conversation in the lab. Incidentally Bell disputed his claim dramatized in the film that this conversation was occasioned by Bell spilling acid on himself.".

In fact some of Bell's early life was pretty interesting and could have been brought more into the plot. But again this is Hollywood not the Encyclopedia Britannica.What is great filmmaking? I'd say when a film prints an indelible image on one's mind  that's great filmmaking. And the last time I saw this film was on television some time over 50 years ago. And yet the scene where Bell spills sulfuric acid on his leg and says Mr. Watson come here I want you remained as fresh and clear in my mind in 2013 as when I first saw the movie on the late show back in the 1960s or was it the 1950s?. I ALWAYS found Don Ameche to be a very appealing actor and of course this is his most famous role...and frankly the film is all his! Of course he has some fine support here. Loretta Young is fine as Bell's deaf wife. Henry Fonda plays the key role of Mr. Watson and does nicely but he had not fully come into his own yet. Charles Coburn and Gene Lockhart play the old codgers well and Spring Byington doesn't get enough screen time. And thank God  Bobs Watson is mute in the film and not only doesn't talk but doesn't cry! This is one of the great and memorable screen biographies and despite some flaws is very watchable interesting and entertaining. Highly recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes the promotional department of a film causes people to not view a film because it is misrepresented by the graphics on the poster the DVD cover or the trailer. Such is the case with AFTERWARDS  a lovely exploration of the concept of death and dying philosophy that has nothing to do with the image of John Malkovich holding a smoking gun! And that is a shame this is a film that has a lot to say and provides a lot to think about thanks to the writing directing and acting. The story is adapted from the novel Et Aprs... by Guillaume Musso by Michel Spinosa and writerdirector Gilles Bourdos. It is a complex story that thankfully due to the talent of the cast and director is able to carry the audience into a place perhaps not considered or discovered before. It is a thinking person's film and a rewarding one. The film opens in an idyllic setting of a lake of water lilies where we observe a little French boy Nathan and an English speaking girl Claire gently admiring swansinteresting to note that swans are traditionally or mythically associated with death. The girl slips on the dock is trapped and sends the boy to find her parents. The boy runs to the highway where he becomes the victim of a tragic hit and run accident. The film then jumps ahead about twenty years and we discover Nathan Romain Duris as a successful New York lawyer living alone after his marriage to Claire Evangeline Lilly has ended after the crib death of their son leaving Claire to manage alone in New Mexico with the couple's surviving daughter Nathan cannot cope with the fact that he feels responsible for the son's death by not responding to his cries. A strange doctor Dr. Kay John Malkovich appears in Nathan's life claiming that he is able to sense death before it happens he works in a hospital for the terminally ill among them is one young lad Jeremy Reece Thompson with cardiac carcinoma who is struggling with his incipient dying. Dr. Kay is not malevolent he is simply a 'Messenger'  one given the ability to visualize a bright white halo around a person who is soon to die. Nathan will not consider the veracity of this obtuse thought until Dr. Kay suggests he visit an old friend Anna Pascale Bussires who now works in a diner living with her Russian father and her son. Nathan is curious meets Anna and upon visiting her home witnesses the death of Anna's father. Nathan contacts Dr. Kay hostile that Dr Kay had suggested Anna was to die but instead lost her father and Dr Kay reassures Nathan of the process soon Anna dies also. At this point Dr Kay shares Nathan's history Nathan did not die in the hit and run accident many years ago and was attended by Dr Kay who then knew that Nathan was also a Messenger. How Nathan turns his life around to flee to New Mexico and join Claire is the transformation of the film. This is a delicate story told with sincerity and lack of sensationalism. It is a journey into the philosophy of what happens to us as we die. Nathan explains this to is daughter as death being like a ship that sails to the horizon and disappears to our eyes yet the ship sails on beyond our scope of vision into another unknown space. Director Gilles Bourdos handles the pacing of this visually stunning film with such grace that it becomes a gentle work allowing the finest acting yet seen from Malkovich and reminds us of just how fine an actor Romain Duris has become. This is also a lovely introduction of Evangeline Lilly an actress with tremendous screen presence and acting ability. Forget the trailer and the ugly cover of this DVD and allow yourself to enjoy this mesmerizingly beautiful film. Grady Harp".

	onyx:emotionText "Sometimes the promotional department of a film causes people to not view a film because it is misrepresented by the graphics on the poster the DVD cover or the trailer. Such is the case with AFTERWARDS  a lovely exploration of the concept of death and dying philosophy that has nothing to do with the image of John Malkovich holding a smoking gun! And that is a shame this is a film that has a lot to say and provides a lot to think about thanks to the writing directing and acting. The story is adapted from the novel Et Aprs... by Guillaume Musso by Michel Spinosa and writerdirector Gilles Bourdos. It is a complex story that thankfully due to the talent of the cast and director is able to carry the audience into a place perhaps not considered or discovered before. It is a thinking person's film and a rewarding one. The film opens in an idyllic setting of a lake of water lilies where we observe a little French boy Nathan and an English speaking girl Claire gently admiring swansinteresting to note that swans are traditionally or mythically associated with death. The girl slips on the dock is trapped and sends the boy to find her parents. The boy runs to the highway where he becomes the victim of a tragic hit and run accident. The film then jumps ahead about twenty years and we discover Nathan Romain Duris as a successful New York lawyer living alone after his marriage to Claire Evangeline Lilly has ended after the crib death of their son leaving Claire to manage alone in New Mexico with the couple's surviving daughter Nathan cannot cope with the fact that he feels responsible for the son's death by not responding to his cries. A strange doctor Dr. Kay John Malkovich appears in Nathan's life claiming that he is able to sense death before it happens he works in a hospital for the terminally ill among them is one young lad Jeremy Reece Thompson with cardiac carcinoma who is struggling with his incipient dying. Dr. Kay is not malevolent he is simply a 'Messenger'  one given the ability to visualize a bright white halo around a person who is soon to die.

	schema:reviewBody "For a movie that concerned itself so much with death and dying I was surprised at how much it said about life and learning how to live. Anyone who has been through a period of personal evolution will be able to relate to the main character as he reflects on the past events of his life and begins to change the dynamic of how he lives going forward. Those who haven't already reached these conclusions on their own will probably find it more difficult to understand.I believe the reserved performance by the main character was a perfect representation of a man who is led by his career and by practical matters and has shut himself off from his emotions and any real sense of living. Malkovich plays the somewhat creepy mysterious benefactor of insights unseen until the end of the movie and delivers everything you'd expect from him in such a role. The female characters generate the same sympathy and compassion from the audience as they do from their male counterparts in the film and that's why this movie works. If we are moved we understand how they would be moved.Preparing oneself to die by truly embracing life is not the theme I was expecting from this movie but it's probably a better one than what I was looking for. I generally classify movies like this as must see films because anyone that hasn't figured something like this out on their own really should. And the sooner the better.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just saw this movie and the main selling point was Malkovich in the cast. He was fine as was the female lead played by Evangeline Lilly. The main thing that did this movie in for me was a rather leaden performance from Romain Duris. The basic plot is that Malkovich is a messenger or someone who can foretell people's deaths. He is also a doctor working with dying people. He contacts Duris and for the greater part of the movie the audience is lead to believe that Duris is destined to die. Needless to say this isn't the way the movie plays out. The director or writer manages to establish a dull plodding rhythm to the film which is confusing and distracting. No more info for anyone interested in seeing the film and the film is worth a rental if only to watch and revel in another quirky performance from Malkovich and a great performance from Evangeline Lilly. The main problem is it's difficult to empathize sympathize or otherwise ize with Duris who has the emotional range of a rock in this film.".

The beginning and the end take a bit of thinking about and thank goodness for DVD and the chance to play it a couple of times to try and understand it.There was a period three quarters through the film when I felt the film definitely dragged Nathan visiting his divorced wife Claire in wherever it was and his reluctance to fly home back to New Yorkbut part from that the film entertained and provided lots of interest.Malkovich plays a Doctor who is a messenger with the vision to foresee the death of someone with a glowing white light. Dr Kay Malkovich first encounters Nathan the lawyer as a child and it is later in life when he sets out on a mission to deliver the message to him literally.Of course things don't pan out quite what you might expect but this is a fine drama plenty of suspense nice scenes and you get what you pay for. You shouldn't be disappointed.Just love that eerie voice of Malkovich so unique! Just imagine if Anthony Hopkins possessed it for Hannibal!".

This scene holds the key to perhaps understanding the mystery posed by the creators of this complex film.Without explanation we are taken to a Manhattan plush conference room where Nathan a successful lawyer is hearing a colleague present a case which the firm might be interested in taking.

The doctor watches Nathan while he puts sugar in his coffee he is shocked by the amount of sugar the lawyer uses so he warns him about possible health risks something that is dismissed. The nature of Dr. Kay's visit is not immediately known but the effect of his visit will linger in Nathan's mind and it will disturb him deeply.

Directed by Gilles Bourdos and based on a novel Et apres which we never read with Mr. Bourdos and Michel Spinosa's adaptation of the original material. The film is gorgeously photographed by Pin Bing Lee with an original musical score by Alexandre Desplat a man with an excellent taste in whatever project he decides to undertake. The film was shot in different locales going from Quebec to Manhattan to New Mexico.Romain Duris a versatile French actor is at the center of the film playing Nathan.

	schema:headline " a moving tale about life and death";
	schema:reviewBody "This is my first review on IMDb and while I am a serious movie fan I definitely do not consider myself a movie critic...I mostly judge movies on how I like them and why... So consider the following an account of my liking rather than something you would expect in the feuilleton...I have read many reviews on IMDb and was rather amazed that there are so far only two reviews available on this motion picture. In my opinion Afterwards is an excellent movie which is why I decided to add a third review here... SPOILER ALERTAfterwards is the story of successful New York lawyer Nathan played by Romain Duris who through the acquaintance of Dr. Kay John Malkovich learns of and about his role as a messenger of death. A messenger can see when other people are about to die unexpectedly through sickness or unnatural causes. He or she then ought to enter these peoples' lives in a way such that they may die in peace with themselves and their loved ones. The price for being a messenger is such that the messenger him or herself has lost or will lose the person closest to him or her  in the case of Nathan it is his exwife with whom he reconnects throughout the movie. SPOILER ALERT ENDThe movie is slowly paced and in spite of what has been written in one of the other reviews not confusing at all. The plot is rather straightforward and only occasional flashbacks into Nathan's life take the viewer on a little detour storywise.In my opinion Afterwards features the best acting of John Malkovich since Being John Malkovich and again au contraire to what has been said in one of the earlier reviews a more than solid performance by Romain Duris. Personally I loved his subdued portrayal of Nathan. Evangeline Lilly in the supporting role of his wife is very relatable but not the center of attention in this picture. All in all I do think this movie is not what you would normally call highly entertaining or thoughtprovoking. However while one can always argue about the story basically it says carpe diem it is very moving and may take the viewer certainly me at least on a journey of emotions that takes you out of your daily life and lets you question your own priorities and ways doing things  of living fully if not happily.As a closing remark I also want to congratulate Alexandre Desplat on a very fine soundtrack. It certainly does not compare the likes of Hans Zimmer James Newton Howard etc in terms of force and presence. But for those who appreciate a fine and delicate soundtrack I think it will work even as standalone I bought it. In any case it finely supports the characters and the emotions they experience in this tale about life and death  and love.".

SPOILER ALERTAfterwards is the story of successful New York lawyer Nathan played by Romain Duris who through the acquaintance of Dr. Kay John Malkovich learns of and about his role as a messenger of death. A messenger can see when other people are about to die unexpectedly through sickness or unnatural causes. He or she then ought to enter these peoples' lives in a way such that they may die in peace with themselves and their loved ones. The price for being a messenger is such that the messenger him or herself has lost or will lose the person closest to him or her  in the case of Nathan it is his exwife with whom he reconnects throughout the movie. SPOILER ALERT ENDThe movie is slowly paced and in spite of what has been written in one of the other reviews not confusing at all. The plot is rather straightforward and only occasional flashbacks into Nathan's life take the viewer on a little detour storywise.In my opinion Afterwards features the best acting of John Malkovich since Being John Malkovich and again au contraire to what has been said in one of the earlier reviews a more than solid performance by Romain Duris. Personally I loved his subdued portrayal of Nathan. Evangeline Lilly in the supporting role of his wife is very relatable but not the center of attention in this picture. All in all I do think this movie is not what you would normally call highly entertaining or thoughtprovoking. However while one can always argue about the story basically it says carpe diem it is very moving and may take the viewer certainly me at least on a journey of emotions that takes you out of your daily life and lets you question your own priorities and ways doing things  of living fully if not happily.As a closing remark I also want to congratulate Alexandre Desplat on a very fine soundtrack. It certainly does not compare the likes of Hans Zimmer James Newton Howard etc in terms of force and presence. But for those who appreciate a fine and delicate soundtrack I think it will work even as standalone I bought it. In any case it finely supports the characters and the emotions they experience in this tale about life and death  and love.";

	schema:headline " A mockprofound film about death which fails to ignite";
	schema:reviewBody "When somebody makes a movie about death which suggests survival and features a medical specialist in a lead you expect something serious. But this film's purported profundity is only mockprofundity and no deep thought has gone into this at all. It is just a 'deathsploitation film'. After all everybody is interested in death just as they are interested in sex so why not exploit the genre? You offer the audience a little hope on a platter cover heavily with a dark and mysterious sauce and serve. Somebody thought of getting John Malkovich to look eerie and as if he were possessed of arcane knowledge. That was supposed to get everybody going. Malkovich is always good but he does need a bit of direction now and then if only to know which way to look and why. But this film is chiefly ruined by the French actor Romain Duris who plays Nathan the central character. The reason why he ruins it is that he has two speech impediments as an actor. First of all his accent is so unreasonably thick and impenetrable that with the best will in the world one cannot make out much of what he is supposed to be saying in English. Some serious speech coaching could have cured this! But even worse than that is his infuriating habit of speaking all of his lines in a deathly whisper. This means that about half of his lines are frankly inaudible no matter what the sound man tries to do to enhance them. This affectation has spread like a virus amongst certain vain male actors who all genuinely believe that if they lower their voices to the point where you have to lean forward and strain to hear them at all they are so much sexier and more fascinating. 'It sucks them in' I have heard some of them say about the audiences who cannot hear them properly. Just because Marlon Brando got away with it does not mean that anybody else can. In any case with Brando it was not an affectation. Having met and talked with him I can assure everybody that he had an astonishingly weak voice and did not talk like that just to call attention to himself as so many actors imagine. I have stood right next to him and had to lean forward to strain to hear him despite the fact that he was trying earnestly to make himself understood. We were discussing the American Indians a mutual passion we had. So when people like Duris think they are being Brando they have got it all wrong! Therefore however good or bad the film was to be casting an unrestrained whisperer in the lead automatically condemned this film to failure. A film in which the lead actor cannot be heard might as well not be made. John Malkovich has never made the mistake of failing to articulate every word he has ever spoken in a film as he is a serious professional. Duris should have his vain little beard shaved off in public made to recant and then be publicly spanked by his mother as a bad bad boy. After all somebody had to invest money in this thing and he ruined it. The film is based upon a novel by Guillaume Musso entitled 'Et Aprs ..' Who knows whether it was good or not? The director coscripted the film. He is Gilles Bourdos. I have not seen his two previous features. But I should say that his script was unfocused and ineffective and he failed to control Duris so he struck out despite the fact that there is nothing particularly wrong with his direction in general. This was a French production made in English in America. There really should be many more of those and every time one fails like this it sets back all the others.".

But the interest of the story doesn't explain why the director handled the theme the way he did. What are the images of the Quebec countryside summer and winter in direct contrast with? After all Claire is a photographer of nature who is insisting on photographing in the snow at night a plant that only blooms one day a year. She thinks husband Nathan is a creep for being a natural at his job as a New York City lawyer. Cinematographer Pin Bing Lee and film editor Valerie Deseine have filled a large number of earlier frames with office building windows. All this is woven together by the music of Alexandre Desplat. Surely an intention was for all of us to see a bright white light surrounding each of us in preparation for not knowing when the next NYC 911 will be and how.".

She thinks husband Nathan is a creep for being a natural at his job as a New York City lawyer. Cinematographer Pin Bing Lee and film editor Valerie Deseine have filled a large number of earlier frames with office building windows. All this is woven together by the music of Alexandre Desplat. Surely an intention was for all of us to see a bright white light surrounding each of us in preparation for not knowing when the next NYC 911 will be and how.";

The story is also reminiscent of the Xfiles episode 6.10  Titonus  which proves once more time that this show was just extraordinary releasing one movie each week ! Here the ability is salvaged by a complicated and unbelievable plot! As a french movie the movie is deadly slow with long meaningless scenes. As it happens in America it gets also all the defects of this cinema mobile conversations colorization wealthy characters!! Malkovich is a bad choice because his strange attitude just doesn't fit with being a doctor! The only positive thing here is Romain! He has kept his sensibility and inner fire so he is as great as usual!".

Or you will be reborn in one of six possible realms. The realm of the gods who will survive in bliss one full life to be reborn again when death comes again. The realm of the asura divine again but jealous of the real gods but that will only be for one life. Then in the human realm and that's the only realm where you can hope to improve your karma and envisage the possibility of getting into nirvana. Then the realm of animals and no chance there to improve your karma. Then the realm of hungry ghosts monsters who are thirsty and hungry for blood and fresh human flesh cannibalism and vampirism and the two together werewolves and wolfmen. Finally Hell itself where you will be tortured for a life time in your mental body but be sure that will be just as painful as if it were your physical body except that your mental body never dies and recuperates at once. You just have the pain over and over again.Since our western world has been weaned of any real religious belief and practice since our religious rites are nothing but habitual actions that are part of the backdrop of our life we are totally unarmed in front of that death and we are afraid and we are panicky and we are traumatized. What's more there are two eras in this world of ours.Before when people lived less than fifty years death was an everyday event and most of the time a child saw his or her grandparents die when he or she was less than five and the grandparents he or she knew then were those of other younger children. So we cried a little we celebrated a little bit more than just a little and adults got drunk to forget and then the show had to go on. Religions were there to make us believe that these dead people had only departed to go on the big journey to the other world because there was another world.But after when people live more than eighty years it is not rare to have three or four generations in a family for the parents to retire when their children are still in the process of training for a job one day. Then death has become a lot more unnatural and there is no solace in traditional religions. That's where Tibetan Buddhism comes into the picture and reinvents the JudeoChristian myth of life seen as a valley of tears the world as a sea of lachrymal fluids and our lot as nothing but a sequence of dramatic tragedies. Then life is turned into some kind of permanent mourning not for death but for the death or deaths to come and every single event is seen in its end in its termination in the fact it will not last long. And we will suffer hell and blazes when they come to their end.That is efficacious to prevent depression and to get used or accustomed to the fact that any moment of bliss is a blitzkrieg against doom and suffering and death. It all started when a certain RhysDavids the founder of the Pali Society at Oxford University Great Britain at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century at the time of the British Empire published his first PaliEnglish dictionary giving the false but perfectly Christian translation of 'suffering for the central Buddhist concept of dukkha. That Oxford scholar probably a Don too was wrong and his translation that Buddhism has been dragging behind itself ever since and all the time was just a misinterpretation of the word in canonical Buddhism maybe because RhysDavids was there and then under the strong influence of the only Tibetan tradition. The Chinese Zen tradition would laugh at that naivet. So Nathan who has become a messenger of death because at the age of eight he died and was resuscitated by some doctor knowing that his wife is going to die soon drops his whole life in New York and comes back to his wife from whom he was at least separated just to accompany her into death. That's just the most absurd story I have heard. Any decent human being knowing he or she was going to die would certainly not require anyone close to him or her to drop out of society to become the slave servant of him or her a plain dying relative. In other words we do not see the coming death from the one person who should be concerned Claire herself but only from the point of view of Nathan the messenger who does not deliver the message the coward who does not know anything but submission and acceptance. That is supposed to be equanimity but in fact it is plain absurdity. It is true if he did hand out the message to Claire she would consider he is out of his mind and maybe even harassing her. A court order would be at once called for to keep that dangerous maniac at certain distance of her Claire and their daughter.And yet some scenes are very powerful lost in an ocean of wordy sentimentalism.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU".

	schema:reviewBody "For over 25 years now I have cited Blade Runner as my favorite movie of all time. After seeing Watchmen I may have to reconsider.First I'm glad I went to see the movie alone. I've heard so many comments focused on a blue dick or the length of the movie or some other such nonsense that I'm sure watching it with someone would have been a constant barrage of commentary and complaint. And no that's not Javier Bardem. Yes the movie is long nearly three hours. But unlike the dreadfully insipid Titanic at the end of this movie I wasn't asking for those three hours of my life back. And as with all such movies you must be able to look beyond the literal.Watchmen is iconic and iconoclastic deconstructionist and revisionist laden with allegory and allusion. Consider for example the character Ozymandias. I'm wondering how many people who viewed the film ever even heard of Percy Bysshe Shelley's poem by the same name. The character even quotes the poem on a plinth in his Antarctic lair. The allusion is amazing. Here's the full quoteAnd on the pedestal these words appear  My name is Ozymandias king of kings Look on my works ye Mighty and despair! Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal wreck boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away.'Clearly one must see the allusion to the work in this case of a superhero who hopes to leave mankind a lasting legacy but realizes in the back of his mind that everything is eventually lost in time. Ozymandias was the first poem I ever examined from an expositional point of view and I was blown away. The use of it in this movie is equally impactful.Then there is Dr. Manhattan named of course for the Manhattan Project which yielded the atomic bomb. His character is an allegory for God and his relationship with man mirrors the apparent detachment with which God sees suffering in the world He created. The deity reference is reinforced often and one thinks of Oppenheimer's citation of the BhagavadGita in which Vishnu takes on a godly form and says Now I am become Death the destroyer of worlds.In an expository scene in the second act Dr. Manhattan has a sort of recollection of his life. His account is dizzyingly elliptical since he does not see time as linear the way others do. This scene has the lyrical feel of my favorite piece of fiction Alan Lightman's almost unbearably beautiful Einstein's Dreams and the reference to Einstein cannot be ignored.But the real beauty of Watchmen is the moral diversity of its superheroes. Each is flawed in different ways allowing us to inhabit different ethical perspectives intellectually at least and witness their consequences. Everything from Rorshach's refusal to compromise which makes him a doomed fugitive to the ultimate compromise envisioned by Ozymandias who can dispassionately evaluate scenarios where millions of lives are sacrificed calls into question our most cherished beliefs. Where does it leave you? Well that's for you to decide.From a purely entertainment perspective Watchmen is stunning. The visuals are state of the art and do not suffer from the sort of mental rejection I have for some movies that present too many special effects to swallow at once as reality. And Watchmen doesn't suffer from Hollywood's apparent fascination with camp in comic book movies. Camp works to some degree in Spiderman since he's a somewhat humorous character to begin with. But the excess of camp rendered the Fantastic Four sequel unwatchable. Watchman proves that superheroes can use more subtle forms of humor such as irony without devolving into camp for cheap laughs.And the music oh the music. If you didn't grow up in the 60's and 70's you will surely miss some of the impact but don't worry. Even a second hand recollection of such iconic tunes will suffice. I am reminded of the painfully awful Across the Universe which couldn't even pull together a decent movie built around the greatest catalog in modern music. Watchmen does it in spades.I LOL'd I cried. The people in the theatre applauded at the end. I vowed to wait 24 hours before writing a review to see if my euphoria passed. It hasn't.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before anyone sees this film Zach Snyder should be given a pat on the back. He did what a dozen directors struggled to do for twenty years he made a Watchmen movie. It seems unthinkable that anyone could properly put the greatest graphic novel of all time on the screen. But Snyder has done pretty much that.While it is not Alan Moore's Watchmen it is the closest thing that anyone else could have put on the screen. Snyder approached the material with enough reverence that fans of the comic will appreciate the film. As Snyder has openly declared the final act does include significant changes but the alterations that take place fit better on the big screen than the original ending would have. It works because it cuts down on a lot of the necessary back story which Snyder could not include.Even though many pages of the book were not included Snyder did take the time to try and preserve other information by including short historical sequences in the fantastic opening title sequence. By this point viewers will also have had a chance to appreciate the stellar and time appropriate soundtrack. Unlike the hard rock recordings the Snyder chose for the background of 300 Watchmen's background fits the tone and mood of most of the scenes. The only questionable choice was the selection of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah not because of the recording but rather its awkward placement. Some may also question Snyder's inclusion of gore not present in the book. While the comic does include it's share of violence Snyder did overtly change several scenes to be more violent. These changes while flashy on film may disturb squeamish moviegoers. However changes aside Snyder has captured the essence of the book and packaged it in a beautiful 2 hour and 40 minute delight. Overall it is a satisfying film experience for someone familiar with the source material.But this might be a different experience for anyone who does not know the book. There is a lot to digest and the overwhelming visuals may distract some moviegoers from the bigger picture. The interaction of these unique characters remains an integral point to understanding this film and when the book was pared down for the movie the relationships of the masked adventures became a bit more forced. The best part of the comic was the glimpse of what is beneath the hood and we have less of that in Snyder's adaptation. Additionally the ending while simplified is still a bit convoluted.Fans and those previously unfamiliar with Watchmen should go in with an open mind. Snyder has performed what Doctor Manhattan might deem a miracle so it may take more than one viewing to truly appreciate this unique adaptation.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watchmen is the longawaited graphic novel adaptation that has for a long time been deemed unfilmable. There have been many different points over the years where this movie was supposed to be made which always ended up not happening. But now Watchmen is finally here in all its glory and it's probably the best adaptation possible of this complex graphic novel. The story takes place in an alternative 1985 with Nixon beginning his third term as president and the streets of New York are gritty dark and violent. Within New York lives a group of costumed heroes that used to be loved by society but are now hated by practically everybody. One night a depressed retired hero named The Comedian is murdered by a masked person that breaks into his apartment. Another hero named Rorschach who wears a mask with shifting ink blots believes that someone is picking off costumed heroes to begin their own agenda of destruction. Rorschach begins investigating and hunting down the person that is responsible for The Comedian's death. Meanwhile we meet another hero who glows blue and has almost literally become a God. His name is Dr. Manhattan and although he has the power to save the world he won't do it because he has lost many of his human emotions. The other main costumed heroes are Night Owl and Silk Spectre who begin to fall in love amid the chaos of their secret lives. Any other attempt to describe the complex plot of this movie would be nearly impossible.Watchmen was an extremely complex graphic novel filled with a lot of flawed costumed characters strong plot powerful sense of style and also contained a world that seems a little too close to our own. The movie carries every one of these elements in the best way it possibly could. It stays true to the novel and only changes a few details. The memorable characters are very well portrayed and acted as well. Dr. Manhattan the giant blue guy is played very well by Billy Crudup who manages to keep the character interesting despite his emotionless attitude. Malin Akerman Silk Spectre II Patrick Wilson Night Owl II and Matthew Goode Adrian Veidt are also very good in their roles. However the two actors that truly help add depth and a real sense of anger to the film are Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Rorschach was probably my favorite character because technically he's not really a hero at all. He's a psychopath with harmful and destructive behavior even though in a way he's trying to do what he believes is right for the world. He is a fascinating character with his shapeshifting mask full of ink blots that mirror his personality.The movie takes place in 1985 and mimics what was happening back then. Watchmen's story revolves around the threat of nuclear war and global destruction and the characters mostly try to do the right thing for the world but have trouble seeing the point in doing so. This is a great film that stays true to the original graphic novel while transitioning its style characters chain of events and storyline from pagetoscreen the best it possibly could. However if you're not familiar with the source material you may find yourself confused by this movie. It's not like The Dark Knight where everybody that goes to see it knows who Batman and the Joker are. These characters are not as famous as those types of household name characters and may be hard for someone's whose never read the novel to understand. Personally I only read a few chapters before I saw the movie and I thought the movie was incredible. I always give a movie props for not taking the easy way out by spoonfeeding everything to the audience. The book as well as the movie was daring by taking of the risk of being complex and making you think for a change. Watchmen is a great movie and despite its long running time of 163 minutes I never found it boring at all. Watchmen is a fascinating graphic novel adaptation that deserves to be seen by anybody that likes their movies complex dark and absorbing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Firstly I have not read the graphic novel. This was deliberate since I knew there was going to be a movie and reading any book tends to ruin the movie. I'm sure there are a whole bunch of things in the graphic novel that they left out or changed and it's hard for those who have read it to imagine how people could understand the subtleties of the story without it. But trust me the morally complex multilayered characters and plot were very well delivered by the movie alone. There was nothing that seemed like it didn't make sense or wasn't quite explained. The movie was just about perfect.I'm surprised to hear a lot of reviews saying that this is just an action movie for teenage boys I thought quite the opposite. There was much less action than I expected the movie centered mostly on emotions and ideas conveyed through dialog narration and character flashbacks. The action scenes were all fairly short though when there was action it was delightfully innovative. There were a lot of nasty and unexpected twists like limbs snapping guts sticking to the ceiling bones audibly crunching... Every time something violent happened they made it interesting and shocking rather than recreating the generic hohum violence of every other movie. And there was no obligatory 30minutelong final action scene culminating in the conclusion of the plot... oh joy! Those get so boring. Plus many of the scenes were rather bold for a mainstream film and showed certain things that are normally hidden offscreen or completely avoided. The only example I feel I can give without spoiling anything is the full frontal male nudity something that is rather conspicuously hidden in almost every Hollywood movie. This movie isn't concerned about hiding little things like that just as it isn't concerned about hiding certain subjects that most movies wouldn't show.This movie definitely isn't for everyone. People expecting another Dark Knight will be disappointed or as in my case thrilled as this movie is completely unique. People who want an action movie and don't want all that talking and thinking will be disappointed. But to those looking for a long complicated deeply moving epic that will really make them think about the very concepts of right wrong and heroism and who haven't read the book which based on other reviews seems to ruin it Do NOT miss this movie!".

	schema:headline " We All Watch the Watchmen";
	schema:reviewBody "Let's get this out of the way  Watchmen the movie is not as good as the graphic novel. Zack Snyder's Watchmen is not your average graphic novel adaptation. Unlike with 300 which was short and sharp and shallow and easy to adapt the original Watchmen is incredibly dense and as written unfilmable. So Snyder did something very smart  he didn't even try. What he did instead was to take the world of Watchmen and rebuild it in a way which made a virtue of this new medium film rather than try to cram the graphic novel into a cinematic form.Nowhere is this approach more obvious than in the film's title sequence. A wonderfully composed collage of images depicts scenes from the universe of Watchmen in a way which is only possible in the movies. In this way we are subconsciously introduced to a world where costumed heroes are a part of everyday culture and brought in a stylish and fluid way from the original days of the Minutemen to those of the Watchmen. This introduction is cinematically perfect and is indicative of the heights which the Watchmen movie is perfectly capable of achieving but not quite capable of sustaining.Watchen is a brave film for a major studio to make and without a doubt it would not exist in its present form without the success of 300. It is incredibly dark both in tone as well as shooting style with events that would be anathema to any other superhero story. The less you know about the story the better so there will be no spoilers here but suffice to say Watchmen's version of a happy ending is a far cry from the Hollywood norm.Snyders brings his unique approach to action to bear on Watchmen expanding on the action scenes in the comic without making it feel too redundant. His efforts are ably supported by the incredibly game cast excellent cinematography and near perfect visual effects  this film is incredible to look at but also manages to create an entire world in a way which most superhero stories never do. The attention to detail in even the smallest scenes is commendable and the dense flashback structure means the same attention is paid to the presentation of full and complex characters.Snyder has made a film which is gorgeous to look at agreeably violent well written wonderfully designed and features some of the best small scale action sequences ever committed to celluloid. But naturally not everything is perfect. Most of the performances are excellent with a cast of relative unknowns who manage to distinguish themselves despite constantly competing with overbearing effects and design. Patrick Wilson in particular does great work with a difficult role as Nite Owl while Jackie Earle Hayley is blistering as Rorschach. Unfortunately in a film which could have done with a strong female presence neither Carla Gugino nor Malin Ackerman make much of an impression despite having quite a lot of screen time. Synder's musical cues are another bone of contention  often pushing the tone of the film into the realm of parody. And the ending... well let's just say it cheapens the experience in search of the lowest common denominator and the whole package suffers. On a related note neither of the stories major revelations are handled that well. These moments were genuinely shocking in the graphic novel but are almost glossed over in the film.Don't get the wrong impression Watchmen is a good film sometimes a great film. Snyder has managed to make a movie which is a terrifically well balanced compromise between accessibility and fidelity. That anyone can sit down in the cinema and experience a distillation of the Watchmen universe in just 163 minutes is a marvel. It does not deliver the depth of feeling and connection of the novel but that is more a matter of the differences in the media than a failure on the part of the film.On its own merits Zack Synder's Watchmen is a dark and twisted tale peopled with complex characters whose motivations are not obvious even to themselves. It is a solid film sometimes rising into the extraordinary and deserves to be successful. This is not Alan Moore's Watchmen but it is a competent extension of the universe into another medium and a worthy cinemagoing experience.".

	schema:headline " I'll be watching the Watchmen. Over and over again.";
	schema:reviewBody "After months of anticipation today I was fortunate enough to be able to attend the premiere of Watchmen over here. Together with a friend who hasn't read the book we went to Amsterdam this afternoon. Expectations were ridiculously high and I was kinda afraid to leave disappointed since I wasn't sure how to possibly film the book that people refer to as not filmable. Zack Snyder appears to have been the right choice to take the job. 300 proved that he has an eye for visuals and knows how to adept a book as faithful to its source as possible but faithfulness and nice pictures don't necessarily make for a good movie. In order to achieve this he was forced to cut several subplots and trim sequences now and then. He made some very smart moves here though by making up with detail. Every single frame will please fans with injokes or hints at related characters or plots that the unfamiliar moviegoer won't miss. This gives Watchmen the very much needed depth and heart that fans so very much craved for. The overall story is an exact replica from the book with every single flashback in place and only 1 noticeable change towards the ending. Much discussed by fans but I'm sure that only the very worst nitpickers or haters might think badly of this. It works perfectly well so rest assured it won't disappoint. The movie begins like the novel with the Comedian being killed in a long tense and actionpacked scene that sets the proper mood and makes one long for more which we get plenty of the next 160 minutes. After this scene comes the brilliant intro montage with 'The Times They Are AChangin' in the background which introduces the Minutemen and helps newcomers to pick up on the story. Everything that comes after this is in one word overwhelming. Every character is well cast takes complete hold of your attention and gets the time for a proper and detailed introduction. After watching it it's hard to tell which hero I liked best. Patrick Wilson is perfect as Dan Dreiberg Rorschach a joy to watch and you're watching Dr. Manhatting in awe which makes sense for his character. Also I'm sure everyone will secretly fall in love with Silk Spectre II Malin Akerman. The suits have been beautifully changed wherever necessary and also have the right effect. The Minutemen look kinda stupid which is perfect for the superhero parody element of the book. But not only the heroes impress the fans will have a splendid time recognizing all the smaller characters such as the newsvendor and the reading kid or the shrink with his pills. Although Snyder adapted the book from scene to scene there are not only passages he had to make shorter but also those he slightly enhanced. Fights are longer action sequences leave a bigger impression. He wonderfully uses slow motion effects and fortunately kept the editing at a modest tempo never resulting in unwatchable quick fights. I heard that the UK rated this 18 which makes sense given the amount of violence it has. Be it boiling fat thrown over a man or bones broken in the most horrible ways there's plenty of gore. But the movie also doesn't fall short in nudity. Apart from a short scene involving Malin Akerman it's Billy Crudup who gets to run around naked showing his digital penis the whole time as Dr. Manhattan. It doesn't distract however but gives Watchmen something truly adult very different from the far more gentle 'Knight'. The special effects are really good Dr. Manhattan looks awesome Mars looks like you expect Mars to look and Rorschach's mask remains fun to see from start to finish. Most of the visuals and environments are very colorful and almost drown in atmosphere a very welcome change from the realism that 'Knight' had. This is simply more fun to watch and impresses a whole lot more. The soundtrack is fun picking various songs from that period. I'm sure most wouldn't work as well in other movies but they seem perfectly in place here. Watchmen is without any doubt the film I was so very much hoping for. A perfect adaptation of the novel is impossible but this is the closest Snyder could've possibly gotten. His eye for detail will please fans the visuals are wonderful the characters intrigue and fortunately he hasn't made any wrong choices concerning the story. The 160 minutes flew by and I can't wait to see this for a second time next week. An astonishing movie that impresses in every way possible. I had a wonderful time. I won't hold back here by giving this 9.510. By the way my friend who didn't know the book loved it as much as I did.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watchmen turned out to be an engrossing film one definitely worth seeing. I have to say I wasn't enthusiastic about watching it at first. It's based on the great graphic novel by Alan Moore. It's widely considered to be the best graphic novel ever. Films adapted form great literary works usually don't turn out well. The film also didn't have a big budget. More money was thrown at making Iron Man 2008 and The Dark Knight 2008 for example. This doesn't matter though because Watchmen surpasses all comic book films in terms of professionalism. Zack Snyder is a good action director. Just watch 300 2007 for proof. With Watchmen he demonstrated that he is just a good director overall. He works well with actors. The acting in the film is almost universally excellent. Everyone gets to shine. Even Malin Akerman had her moments. Not one character feels like a throwaway. All this is further complimented by the good choices in costumes. No one can deny that the heroes in Watchmen look cool. The CGI is excellent too. Be it Doctor Manhattan or Nite Owl's airship everything looks just right. Snyder staged some truly impressive dramatic scenes. The use of music is inspired. The score by Tyler Bates is obviously fitting but the choices in songs may surprise some people. I however think that the songs are just right. It was good to hear Bob Dylan's The Times They Are aChanging at the beginning and Leonard Cohen's First We Take Manhattan at the end. What made me like the film even more is its cinematography by Larry Fong. The look of each decade was captured perfectly. The 1980s are somewhat dark in the film's alternate reality though. Nuclear war seems close and society is sick. To all this is added the sweet look that's also present in the graphic novel. There are many images in Watchmen that are memorable even unforgettable. There are so many interesting details that I couldn't wait to watch the film more than once to pick up what I missed on first viewing. Thankfully Snyder didn't change the politics and observations of the graphic novel for the film. Some parts are missing but the endeavour is still a thoughtprovoking twoandahalf hours. Plus it has a clear narrative. This is a comic book film for mature audiences. It stands above other comic book films because it's smart and because it tackles some of the most important issues even mankind's existence. Watchmen was expertly made there is a lot to like about it. I respect it and I like it more than any other superhero motion picture. It gets a high recommendation from me.".

You may like actionpacked toygame inspired or superhero movies like Transformers or XMan where the action has priority over message  or there is no message at all. Do not be alarmed if it is true there is nothing wrong with you. It simply indicates most probably you will not enjoy Watchmen. Stop reading and look somewhere else. Otherwise please continue.I begun to learn English reading comics Superman Spiderman Batman XMen and FF later. But that was more than 40 years ago when I was young. Therefore I had never heard about Watchman phenomenon until I bought a DVD with the theatrical version. Then it begun. I saw the complete movie several times day after day. I became obsessed by its characters and themes. I put away my work for a few days doing research on the Internet. I found out the movie is controversial for many. Not for me. It is a true masterpiece of a rare kind something much more than a sum of all its ingredients. All parts fit together while every part makes others stronger.The story is fascinating the characters are psychologically rich complex and morally ambiguous. If you look deeper you find lots of disturbing and sometimes unanswered questions about politics people and societies. Some of those questions flow from the movie's motto. Who watched President Bush when he launched the Iraqi war to finish the job his father did not ? Who watched Israeli Cabinet when it launched the Gaza Offensive to improve its poll ratings ahead of elections ? Who watches Iranian Ayatollahs and their dreams to create a new Persian Empire no matter what ? Equally intriguing are questions about the human nature. Are dictators who sacrifice millions so easily driven by their lust for power or by a dream of ideal societies envisioned for their nations ? Do they truly believe in their utopias ? What is really behind brutality and triggerhappiness of some of the law enforcement officials ? Do they loose control or enjoy their work too much ? Why some people prefer death to avoid betrayal of their values ? Am I ready to do that ? These are some of the questions I ask myself but there are much more from different perspectives. This movie makes you think hard about the world around.Acting is from satisfactory to very good. The best actor is Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Should get Oscar Nomination. However I found Jeffrey Dean Morgan The Comedian as the most charismatic. He steals every scene he is in. As for the music the original motion picture score is good but it is the incidental music I applaud. The opening sequence the funeral and Dr. Manhattan's Mars monologue are the most powerful scenes in the movie and the music is responsible for such impact. Bob Dylan is a songwriting genius and The Times They Are AChangin' is a perfect background. The Sound of Silence illustrates introductory funeral images in an unforgettable way. As for Dr. Manhattan's Mars monologue music written by Philip Glass is a brilliant choice  particularly as the laboratory where he gains his superpowers is run by Professor Glass. And then comes All Along The Watchtower one of my alltime favorites. I will recall the related movie scene every time I hear it till I die.Some question the 99 Luftballons as the right choice but not me. The decision to use it converted the accompanied scene into a small jewel. I raised the eyebrow only once when I heard Hallelujah. After the second Watchman watch it dropped down however.Needless to say I ordered the novel immediately after my first Watchmen watch. I just completed my first reading and it is certainly not the last one. I had never read a graphic novel before and I am happy it was the first one. Now it is the interaction between Watchmen The Novel and The Movie which makes my amazement and impression so deep and lasting. Watchmen The Novel fills some of the gaps and provides more context for many scenes. Watchmen The Movie enriches the pictures and texts. For me both are perfectly complementary.It seems most of the critics sided with Alan Moore who stated Watchmen The Novel cannot be translated into a movie. That is the writer's right. But if a movie critic does not judge the movie as such but how well  or not well  the book was adopted then he or she should take care of the books. Movies should be judged on their own and Watchmen is a true masterpiece as a standalone work. But even if the book is taken into account the adaptation is at least very good in my view. The changes omissions and additions make sense because of the time frame and other factors Zack Snyder's style included. I understand some of the fans of the book were disappointed by simplifications and the end in particular. Let us be serious shall we ? Watchmen story takes place on an alternate Earth right ? Think of The Movie and The Novel as parallel worlds that overlap mostly and differ in some respects. Such worlds can happily coexist together as an extension of the original Watchman concept. If we accept imaginary worlds why there should be only one ?The movie has some tiny flaws but they disappear without a trace when you look at the whole. Watchman The Movie would not be so great without Watchman The Novel. Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons created a masterpiece in a graphical form. Zack Snyder turned it into a movie masterpiece. If you are still with me see Watchmen The Movie and you should enjoy it as I did do and will. It is not too late. Never has been never will be too late for that.".

	schema:reviewBody "An exsuperhero is thrown through a plate glass window many stories above the city. Was his murder somehow connected to the feared imminent nuclear holocaust between the United States and Russia? Someone seems to want the former dogooders out of the way in this thrilling oneofakind jaded look at superheroes that turns conventional comicbook wisdom on its head.It's an alternate 1985. Richard Nixon has been elected to a fifth presidential term. But the USSR is encroaching on Afghanistan and the US isn't taking too kindly to it. Enter the smartest man in the world Adrian Veidt Matthew Goode formerly known as superhero Ozymandias who is working with the ethereal Dr. Manhattan Billy Crudup a physicist who has achieved immortality and nearomniscience owing to a longago lab mishap. With Dr. Manhattan's help Adrian hopes to dissolve the tension between the two superpowers.But that's not the only conflict not by a long shot. Since the characters here are unfamiliar to most audiences there's plenty of backstory seamlessly edited into the main story as important details that inform the characters. For one thing we get to see the rather graphic  more on that later  origin of Dr. Manhattan. The superheroes have conflict within their own group which has gone its separate ways  with different goals and outlooks. Not only that but the world at large isn't entirely on the side of masked avengers labeling them as vigilantes. By the present most of them have ditched their costumes for traditional lives some tinker with their gadgets in their basements in hiding and some merely blend into society.Here's who's left in 1985 in addition to Ozymandias who's revealed his true identity to the world and Dr. Manhattan Nite Owl II Patrick Wilson Rorschach Jackie Earle Haley Silk Spectre II Malin Akerman and The Comedian Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Others have gone insane or been murdered themselves in years past all suffer as everyday humans now.So how does Watchmen skewer comicbook tropes? Well they're not always good you see. Some are but some maliciously kill albeit for the greater good. Some take delight in the suffering of man if that man is say a child killer. That sort of thing. The truth is no one here is perfect not even the superheroes. Another difference is the high level of violence in the movie. This isn't a comicbook movie where the bad guys fall down when they get slapped no sir. No the heroes beat the stuffing out of them with blood entrails and the like splattering all over the place. Limbs are dislodged brains are exposed. It's wildly violent much like director Zack Snyder's last film 300 but without the detached thiscan'tbereal tone. This isn't a movie in which the bad guys are brought in for questioning or sent to prison to think about what they've done. This is a movie in which the bad guys are annihilated period.In case you're still contemplating taking the kiddies to see this superhero fare here's another caveat there's nudity. No it's not Malin Akerman although you do get a glimpse it's the bluehued Dr. Manhattan himself. Sometimes he's in a thong but often he's just letting it all dangle there. Funny thing is it's not really all that shocking. If it'd been one of the humans perhaps but Dr. Manhattan is more humanoid than human at this point.At 160 minutes the action really doesn't let up. But that's nothing  most movies are fast paced now. This one has a plot that can keep up with the action. In fact the intricacies of the plot are delicious to unwrap this was not a movie  superhero or not  where you can predict the end without just taking a wild stab.I can't understate how tremendous an achievement this movie is. If we're all lucky this will open the door for more adult comicbook films. The good guys don't always have to be about justice and truth and all that junk and the bad guys can sometimes get what's really coming to them. I do want to point out that among the outstanding cast Jackie Earle Haley as the haunted masked Rorschach is tremendous. Wilson who appeared with Haley in Little Children a few years back is also dweebishly strong as the aging Nite Owl II.".

	onyx:emotionText "An exsuperhero is thrown through a plate glass window many stories above the city. Was his murder somehow connected to the feared imminent nuclear holocaust between the United States and Russia? Someone seems to want the former dogooders out of the way in this thrilling oneofakind jaded look at superheroes that turns conventional comicbook wisdom on its head.It's an alternate 1985. Richard Nixon has been elected to a fifth presidential term. But the USSR is encroaching on Afghanistan and the US isn't taking too kindly to it. Enter the smartest man in the world Adrian Veidt Matthew Goode formerly known as superhero Ozymandias who is working with the ethereal Dr. Manhattan Billy Crudup a physicist who has achieved immortality and nearomniscience owing to a longago lab mishap. With Dr. Manhattan's help Adrian hopes to dissolve the tension between the two superpowers.But that's not the only conflict not by a long shot. Since the characters here are unfamiliar to most audiences there's plenty of backstory seamlessly edited into the main story as important details that inform the characters. For one thing we get to see the rather graphic  more on that later  origin of Dr. Manhattan. The superheroes have conflict within their own group which has gone its separate ways  with different goals and outlooks. Not only that but the world at large isn't entirely on the side of masked avengers labeling them as vigilantes. By the present most of them have ditched their costumes for traditional lives some tinker with their gadgets in their basements in hiding and some merely blend into society.Here's who's left in 1985 in addition to Ozymandias who's revealed his true identity to the world and Dr. Manhattan Nite Owl II Patrick Wilson Rorschach Jackie Earle Haley Silk Spectre II Malin Akerman and The Comedian Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Others have gone insane or been murdered themselves in years past all suffer as everyday humans now.So how does Watchmen skewer comicbook tropes? Well they're not always good you see. Some are but some maliciously kill albeit for the greater good. Some take delight in the suffering of man if that man is say a child killer. That sort of thing. The truth is no one here is perfect not even the superheroes. Another difference is the high level of violence in the movie. This isn't a comicbook movie where the bad guys fall down when they get slapped no sir. No the heroes beat the stuffing out of them with blood entrails and the like splattering all over the place.

	schema:reviewBody "No. Not even in the face of Armageddon. Never compromise.Rorschach While Rorschach's Jackie Earle Haley proclamation may be possible to uphold as a superhero the refusal to compromise on behalf of the filmmaker in the process of literary adaptation is impossible. As film theorist Andr Bazin wrote Faithfulness to form literary or otherwise is illusory what matters is the equivalence in meaning of the forms. In other words Bazin is arguing that each medium has its own modes of representation thus the struggle for formal fidelity is a lost cause and that the main objective is that the adaptation should capture the original work's essence. Bazin continues stating All it takes is for the filmmakers to have enough visual imagination to create the cinematic equivalent of the style of the original. Zach Snyder's 300 attempt to adapt Alan Moore and Dave Gibbon's Watchmen 19861987 is compromised but that is the only possible way an adaptation can work as a film. He captures the Bazinian essence of Moore and Gibbon's work a deconstruction of the superhero mythos with an aesthetic that also captures much of the style of the original graphic novel to the degree it is possible in film. Will diehard fans be disappointed? No doubt but quite unjustly. Even with Snyder's compromised ending which ultimately can be interpreted as being more devastating than the climax concocted by Moore and Gibbons although the film lacks a sequence on par with the opening pages of the comic's twelfth volume Snyder's ambitious attempt is the best that could be done in a feature film.For those of you unfamiliar with the story Watchmen takes place on an alternate timeline beginning in late 1985. The United States won the war in Vietnam Richard Nixon has been elected to third presidential term and the only man standing between nuclear war between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. is Dr. Manhattan Billy Crudup a human nuclear bomb who stands on the American side as a nuclear deterrent. The film like the comic begins with the murder of Eddie Blake Jeffrey Dean Morgan a retired superhero formally known as The Comedian. While clues point to robbery the sociopathic Rorschach believes that the death of The Comedian could be the beginning of plot to eliminate former costumed heroes. Hoping to foil such a conspiracy Rorschach warns his former partners in crime fighting Manhattan and his lover the beautiful Silk Specter Malin Ackerman the Batmanesquire Nite Owl Patrick Wilson and the smartest man in the world Ozymandias Matthew Goode. Collectively dubbed the Watchmen the group initially disregards Rorschach's theory. That is until Dr. Manhattan is forced off Earth making the possibility of nuclear war a near certainty.This complex story as readers familiar with the book will attest is existential that the typical comic book and the film is much the same. Much like last summer's The Dark Knight Watchmen is not concerned with action scenes and obligatory fights. As the film's antagonist notes in the film's climax I'm not a comic book villain and like the film he is not treated as being the product of a fantastic world far outside our own. While Snyder does bring an unrealistic edge to the action sequences particularly his manipulation of time via cuts and slow motion these techniques much like those of Sam Peckinpah become a means of deconstructing motion...just like a comic book. Instead Watchmen as both a graphic novel and a film favors the approach of making comic book and superhero fans think about the motives and actions in what becomes a study of ethics. In this study it is only the murderous and sociopathic Rorschach who is able of following any sort of moral code...even if it is demented in its adherence to rejecting compromise.For the most part Snyder's direction is precise. His graphical style captures Gibbon's graphics and layout perfect...right down to the book's fearful symmetry. The framing and camera movements mirror those of the book a treat for avid fans of the book and Gibbon's art. Moreover Snyder's work with the actors is quite accomplished. Jackie Earle Haley continues his streak of embodying sociopaths perfectly. Patrick Wilson captures the sadness and longing for a greater goal in life something all retired heroes must face.The film is not without its flaws. For the most part the film and Snyder do a fantastic job of drawing out the background of the individual characters and the past of masked heroes in general very well particularly during the film's opening ten minutes and the beautifully executed credit sequence. However the one character who seems to receive the short end of the narrativestick is Nite Owl. Snyder establishes his background but not to the degree that the others benefit from. In addition Malin Ackerman's performance while being far from bad seemed to be the weakest out of the leads. However her character is the most clichd in the book so perhaps Ackerman just did not have that much to work with.The most glaring flaw in the film however is in Snyder's choice of end credit music. The film like the book ends on a relatively quiet scene but it is entirely displaced by a terrible cover of Bob Dylan's Desolation Row by My Chemical Romance. While Dylan's version would have been fine and in keeping with the period music used listen for a Musak cover of Everybody Wants to Rule the World in Ozymandia's office throughout the rest of the film the cover is loud and obnoxious and seems like it was fitted for an entirely different film than the one just watched. Snyder has made an adaptation that is as faithful and accessible as possible a compromise that is ultimately successful. Snyder to borrow from Bazin's model not only captures the essence of Moore and Gibbon's novel but also demonstrates a visual imagination that creates the impression of Gibbon's layout and graphical style.".

I was lucky enough to watch this at a preview screening in London last night and came to the film with little knowledge about what to expect. Having seen the posters around the place and perhaps catching one or two of the trailers I was expecting something akin to another XMen movie which frankly I've never found particularly interesting. However it was a very pleasant surprise to find that Zack Snyder has served up something entirely fresh and quite dazzling. Watchmen takes the wellworn superhero format and turns it on its head. As you would expect from a movie of this genre you get a tale of attempted world domination by evil baddies good guys wearing latex costumes fistfuls of action and spectacular special effects. What you would not expect is to have this interwoven with eyewatering violence a scene where one particularly nasty bad guy gets a meat cleaver brought down on his forehead being one example full frontal male nudity albeit computer generated and rampant satire. The US political system military posturing and blind patriotism are all given a bit of a roasting by David Hayter and Alex Tse's script. Add to this a host of compelling performances notably Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach and Patrick Wilson as Nite Owl and you have an exceptional cinematic experience.Watchmen is no ordinary superhero movie and likely to manage the difficult feat of satisfying both the fanboys and the uninitiated punters like myself.

	schema:reviewBody "I recently saw a free oh yes early showing of Watchmen and have to say that it was very good. There have been few movies that I have been this excited for. Some disappointed horribly Spiderman 3 and some far exceeded my expectations Dark Knight. This movie falls somewhere in between leaning closer to exceeded what I thought was going to be a hard book to turn into a movie.The first half of the film is extremely accurate to the book and very well done. While there are some differences from the book for example Dan Dreiberg goes to warn Viedt about the masked killer not Rorschach but almost all of them are excusable and didn't effect the flow of the movie or my ability to enjoy it. Even as far as dialog goes the movie stays true to the book. Towards the middle some of the differences begin to effect the film. The best example I can think of is how Dr. Manhattan acts during his live interview I'll restrain from giving away any scenes. Not only did the course of events change from the book which I can understand given there must be some sort of time limit for a film but some of what he says was pretty much copy and pasted from other scenes in the book. Nevertheless I was able to oversee these differences and enjoy the film.The ending of the movie was the biggest change from the book that I noticed. I think they did this for 2 reasons. 1 I had heard that they were going to include an aspect of energy and where we get it into the film making it more topical. Secondly I think the ending of the book would have been too out there for most viewers and would have required a lot more explaining which the book gives then would have been feasible for the length of the film it was about 2 and a half hours long. I think if you have read the book you will enjoy the movie. You'll probably spend a lot of time making sure the movie stays true to the book like I did but then you'll stop and just enjoy it for being a good movie. I think if you haven't read the book you might enjoy the movie even more. As most readers know it is unlike any comic book and actually answers the question what would the world be like with superheroes? We see even the ones we like have dark sides and the ones we don't have the best intentions. On a closing note there are some things I would have changed had I been to art school and had a gazillion dollar budget for a movie of this magnitude. For one I think making Dr. Manhattan appear nude while keeping true to the book takes away from the movie. I heard a lot of snickers whenever you could see his penis and I even think they may have showed it more than they do in the book if you've read the book take note of the scene were Rorschach comes to visit him and Laurie. I think while it was done with good intentions covering him up would have been acceptable and not have changed anything about the movie. Also while I really enjoyed 300 and all the fight scenes in it the style of slowing down a punch or kick and then speeding it up to real time I felt didn't work for this movie and sort of made it seem corny. 300 the book is written like a comic book. Watchmen isn't. The fight scenes as gritty as they were still felt like I as watching 300 again. Besides these small points I thought the movie was awesome and I recommend it to reader and non reader of Watchmen alike.".

A couple of months ago I watched the first ten minutes and I found it so messy that I decided to watch another DVD. Today a friend of mine has told me that Watchmen is a great movie and I have decided to give a second chance to this film and I found really an excellent bleak and Machiavellian story supported by magnificent landscapes and CGI. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Watchmen  O Filme Watchmen  The Movie";

	schema:headline " Watchmen is a cinematic masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "Amazing film. Bringing a graphic novel as layered and complex as the Watchmen to the screen is no easy task and Snyder did a brilliant job. Watchmen was as unconventional intellectual cerebral and unique to the cinema world as much as the graphic novel was to the comic book world. It's hard to not compare this to the novel but as a film it is brilliant. Zack Snyder truly did the story justice. Look around online at where other filmmakers before him wanted to take the film. There was even one script where they updated it to be in present day and have the threat be from terrorists. Snyder single handedly saved the Watchmen from a cinematic nightmare. He had the script reworked into the closest adaptation of any graphic novel to date. I would like to shake his hand and thank him for being one of the few filmmakers these days that actually cares about being faithful to the source material of film adaptations. Beyond being faithful Snyder brought an amazing style and vision to the project. He brought an independent film sensibility to a big budget picture which not many people have the guts to do. I don't think enough can be said on what a great job he did. I think some of the complaints people have about this movie is interesting because they are very contradictory. Some say the film is too short and some say it's too long. Some say that the movie suffers from sticking too close to the book and others say it's from not sticking close enough to the book. From beginning to end I can't say there wasn't a single moment when I checked the time. I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this film. I also speak from a fan's perspective when I say that this movie is probably the closest adaptation of a comic book to date. Yeah there are some details left out but there are already people complaining about the length. Imagine how many people would complain if this movie actually had every single thing from the book in it. It would be like five hours long! The fact of the matter is that the spirit and the heart of the book is definitely present in every moment of the movie.Some people are also complaining about the music used in the film. With exception of maybe a song or two I loved the soundtrack. Since the film is a period piece and these characters are such a big part of American history from the 1950's on it makes sense to blend the music of the times into these characters lives. This is the story of what would happen in our world if these characters existed in it. In our world music is very tied into our history. I just really don't see the big deal. I think it's just because people aren't used to hearing this sort of music in this genera. Again this just goes to show that this movie dares to be different from the rest. I think the problem for the non fans of the book is that they just thought this was going to be another X Men. THIS IS NOT THE X MEN or is it any other super hero film you have ever seen before. This is risk taking super hero story. It's got the spirit of an independent film. It is truly unique. I saw some parents brought children to see this film. Wow great parenting. This isn't a movie for children. It has extremely graphic and gruesome violence. It has sex and nudity. Watchmen earns it's R rating. Yeah it still has the action and the fight scenes audiences have come to expect from a super hero movie and they are certainly impressive. Unlike other super hero films though the action scenes aren't what drives the story. This is a character piece. The film like the novel takes it's time developing the complex history of the characters and the world they live in. Each character is so rich and unique that it's very hard to find a favorite. The actors are perfectly cast to bring these characters to life. It's as though they are jumping out of the pages of the book. Watchmen is definitely under appreciated and under rated. It's a shame that mainstream audiences didn't really seem to get it. Then again these are the same people that made Transformers 2 one of the biggest hits of the summer so it's almost a compliment that they didn't get it. Like Fight Club Donnie Darko and The Fountain Watchmen will find attention from a more intellectual group of people that can actually appreciate all of the nuances philosophy and social commentary that this film has to offer. Apparently this is too smart and cerebral for the typical audience member. Watchmen dared to be different in a time when most films are afraid to challenge conventions. Films used to be praised for that. Apparently not any more. If this came out ten years ago it probably would have met more success but these days people don't want to think at the movies. They just want conventional and simple. It's a shame but I have a feeling that Watchmen will find a larger audience on DVD. It is an experience that should not be missed. It's the freshest super hero story ever told.".

	schema:headline " When is the good part coming?";
	schema:reviewBody "I have never read any comic or graphic novel yet I have been able to enjoy quite a few movies that were derived from them. This was certainly not the case for Watchmen. Half way through I was left wondering when the good stuff would finally start coming.Maybe you might have some preexisting attachment to the characters if you have read the books but if the movie is all you have the characters are onedimensional dull and unattractive. The Comedian is the only one I loved straight away but he dies within 5 minutes. Rorschach is the next best thing but doesn't get enough focus to really capture my heart. The way he is discarded at the end made me wonder if really he was of any importance. The strength of his character is too strongly diluted by the bad scenes of the Silk Spectre II and Nite Owl II that continuously interrupt the flow. Silk Spectre II was horrible. She seems to have no emotions whatsoever. All she does is have sex with the guys without too much of a pause between them. The fact that the Comedian is her father might have been expected to give her more depth but hardly seems to faze her. Instead the 5 seconds of poorly acted sobbing followed by immediate reconciliation makes it seem like it's no big deal whatsoever. Nite Owl II is a geek devoid of passion and lacking a backbone. He's the kind of classmate who's name you wouldn't remember after 1 year. Dr. Manhattan serves no purpose other than being the eventual deus ex machina that solves everything making the efforts of all the other heroes look totally stupid and pedestrian. He's disconnected from the world and is typically not the kind of character a viewer would connect with. The bad guy Ozzy gets hardly any background or an explanation why he's both smarter than everyone and able to beat up on the Comedian Nite Owl II Rorschach and the Silk Spectre II. Or why he can catch speeding bullets... The movie spends a whole lot of time on flashbacks that take out the whole momentum of the plot. Yet despite all those flashbacks it does not manage to make me feel connected to any of the characters. This is the main weakness to me.The songs were nice individually but many times seemed wrong for the scene. It's one of the first times the soundtrack really bothered me in a movie which says a lot. The CGI was too obvious and in some cases obnoxious and overdone giving no serious added value. Of course they were breathtaking at times but they were awful at other times. I was looking for a dark movie with corrupted morals and realistic heroes who are not perfect. Only Rorschach brings this to the movie. Slow motion fight scenes openbone fractures and blood splattering around just made me sigh. There was no xfactor in any of this. No Sin City effect no 300 adrenaline pace no Dark Knight madness nothing. Part of the reason why so many of the fight scenes couldn't interest me is because they occur in subplots or suddenly pop up in the main plot unexpected.As a movie it failed for me. This says nothing about the graphic novel which I might one day buy to find out what the characters are really about. They sacrificed momentum and continuity in the main plot to narrate partial backgrounds on too many characters. Often times it's hard to connect your audience to 1 or 2 characters. If you're trying to make them care about 5 or 6 of them you're bound to fail especially with mediocre or boring acting. This is why it was probably a hard task to make a movie from this graphic novel.".

	schema:reviewBody "With 300 Zack Snyder had the problem of having not enough meat on the bone  Frank Miller's violent graphic novel was short and inyourface with director Snyder compensating by spending pretty much all of it's two hour runtime in superslow motion. Here the problem is reversed Alan Moore's unfilmable complicated and very very deep graphic novel seemed simply too dense for any director to take by the horns and be successful. Hell even Moore himself deemed it so  so much that he disowned the film entirely.Here Snyder has two audiences those familiar and those who aren't. If you're the latter Watchmen is a masterwork of literature telling the story of a group of masked avengers who since outlawed live empty and lonely lives. When one is killed in his apartment Rorschach who dons the famous evermoving mask takes it upon himself to get to the root of the real reason for the death but stumbles onto something much larger than he could ever have expected.It really is a character piece. Each one filled offscreen with complicated articulate backstories is brought to life on screen by some of the most heartfelt acting I've seen in a long time save perhaps Malin Ackerman as the latexwearing Silk Spectre II particularly from Billy Crudup who plays the blue often naked and wellhung demigod who is the only superhero with real superpowers.Although the star of the show is Rorschach himself. Despite being behind a mask for the large majority of the film Jackie Earle Haley is beyond perfect for the role. His husky voice commands the voiceovers from Rorschach's journal recited in many cases wordforword from the novel and plays the psychopathic paranoid and immensely complex role with such a force that you simply can't tear your eyes away from him.Snyder made himself known with 300  the ultraviolent story of the Spartans who went to war and lost miserably. However Watchmen makes 300 seem like Mary Poppins  this has got to be one of the most violent films I have ever seen. All the book's action sequences are there just bigger. More badass. Gory as hell. And for some reason Snyder decided to place a porny cringy 3 minute sex scene set to Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah slap bang in the middle of the film. Sure it was in the book but it was shorter and the soundtrack was most certainly not this poncy.However this discrepancy is the only gripe and this is a very minor gripe that I have with the film. It's hard to watch in places  a rape scene here a pregnant woman killed there  and even pulls the heartstrings in others Doctor Manhattan's backstory most definitely almost brought me to tears. The book is majorly complex deep and meaningful and in it's transition to screen a lot of that is lost in translation. But what we get is a fantastically artistic fastpaced action epic. Snyder was aiming for two audiences who are polar opposites and comes free with an adaptation of which even writer Alan Moore should be proud.".

Then the hype followed shortly after the official release date. So I finally went to watch it with some anticipation. I didn't read any reviews prior to seeing it. I've heard some comments about it from the radio and that's about it. It started off okay. I was a bit confused w the random flashbacks...but I had hope. It will get better. Then it just goes down hill from there. This movie is about a bunch of washed up HUMANS with no powers and their desire to dress up in silly masks spandex and costumes to go fight crimes. There were all these silly side sub plots that totally confused the storyline! Is the nuclear war gonna happen? I don't know cuz it spent so much time on these subplots! Without ever reading the graphic novel I expected these people to have some powers. They're all quite powerful for not having powers! The sock guy's ink blotch moves...how does he do that?! All in all it's a bunch of boring people who think that they can save the world. The movie jumps around way to much doesn't have a solid plot line bored the hell out of me! The only time I paid attention was when someone's bone popped out or someone's arms got chopped off. Other than those few scenes I cared less about the blue penis...or the fact that some nerd guy can't get it on wo his pseudo superhero costume. The gay man who is supposed to be the smartest man on earth. I ultimately walked out about 2 hours in i think the scene where Blue guy takes Spandex chick to Mars. You can criticize all you want about how I have no place to comment if I didn't finish the film but honestly I couldn't BARE to finish it! It was painful! DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE! I would recommend watching Paul Blart over this anyday!".

	schema:reviewBody "At first it was hard to believe this film was two hours and forty minutes long. It felt more like an eternity. The whole first two hours were nothing more that flashback after flashback. By the time the film reached it's so called climax you really don't care about the characters any longer. For crying out loud half the actors looked bored just making it. Too many subplots most of which come out of nowhere and go no further. The only people I could suggest watching this movie would be the fans of the original graphic novel. Maybe those people will actually have a clue what was going on. As for the directing I'm not going to comment. I don't know what the film was even supposed to be about so I'm not sure if Zack Snyder succeeded in pulling off the original context. As it is he didn't do it for those of us that never read the material. In summary the characters are two dimensional the plot is dizzily boring and confusing at the same time and by the time you get to the end you don't even care if nuclear war happens or not I was rooting for merely to destroy the miserable excuse for Nixon.Just my two cents your opinion might differ.Fuzzy".

	schema:reviewBody "Watchmen is a compelling superhero story that is unlike anything I have ever seen before this was incredibly new and amazing. No other superhero movie is better than this. Here is why It has a plot it's not like a sitcom like Fantastic Four and Ghost Rider it has character development and amazing special effects and visuals. Also I liked the setting.The actors in this movie did a really great job. Jackie Earle Haley plays the angry vengeful Rorschach Matthew Goode plays the wealthy mysterious Ozymandias Patrick Wilson plays the confused Nite Owl Malin Akerman plays the sexual Silk Spectre Billy Crudup plays the godlike Dr. Manhattan who is the only one in the group who has superpowers and Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays the violent Comedian. The violent scenes were awesome the story was very powerful and had plenty of twists and turns the characters were interesting especially the Comedian who was the Watchmen's downfall. Overall this is a masterpiece and one of my alltime favorite movies. If you have any plans in the near future to see this and get to the video store and rent it. I highly recommend this because this isn't your typical superhero movie.Rating1010".

However I did have a few questions mostly concerning plot holes and things of that nature so I immediately watched the parts in question again and found that everything ties in nicely with very few if any plot holes. If there are I can not find them.John Hobbes Denzel Washington is a homicide detective who apprehended a killer named Reese who is put to death for his crimes. Upon witnessing his execution Hobbes continues on with his life until similar murders happen to catch his attention. It turns out that Reese was possessed by the demon Azazel. Azazel is able to transfer himself from human to human simply by touching them in most cases. So Azazel eventually finds himself a human host and begins another murder trail confusing detectives by killing someone and leaving his hosts fingerprints and other evidence then switching bodies and killing his previous host. As you can see this can wreak havoc on a detective trying to solve these murders. Luckily Azazel is more interested in exacting revenge on Hobbes than keeping his game a secret and lets Hobbes in on it which is where the movie really takes off.The directing and camera work in this movie was superb. It was done in such a way where you can see Azazel's spirit go from person to person simply by following the camera up and down the crowd and watching the subtle touches one makes in a normal walk about town.Although this movie does require your full attention it does not go unrewarded and you are not left at the end scratching your head wondering what had happened for the past 2 hours. All the answers to your questions are in there and that is why I think this movie is way above average. Why I have not heard of this movie before is beyond me. I think maybe the title came across as a bit generic which the film is anything but. It comes highly recommended by me. 9.510".

I think maybe the title came across as a bit generic which the film is anything but. It comes highly recommended by me. 9.510";

	schema:reviewBody "Shortly after thinking that he'd brought an end to a series of murders a homicide detective starts to realise that the perpetrator is still at large and is also someone who couldn't possibly be arrested or brought to justice by conventional methods. The way in which his investigation leads him to these findings and the formulation of a highly unconventional plan to end the killings provides Fallen with its extremely offbeat plot. This wellwritten story begins very colourfully in a way that raises a lot of questions and then proceeds through the investigation stage before reaching it brilliantly twisted conclusion.Having been responsible for capturing serial killer Edgar Reese Elias Koteas Detective John Hobbes Denzel Washington visits him on death row immediately prior to his execution. Reese's behaviour at this time is rather strange as he thrusts his hand out strongly to shake hands with Hobbes and sets him a riddle to solve. He then talks loudly in ancient Syrian Aramaic and later in the gas chamber loudly sings Time Is On My Side until he can't anymore.A little while later Hobbes has to investigate a further series of murders which are carried out in the same style as those committed by Reese and a clue he finds at one of the crime scenes leads him to research the case of a wellrespected detective from his department who 30 years earlier had committed suicide at a remote woodland cabin after being accused of crimes he didn't commit. Hobbes' research leads him to the detective's daughter Gretta Milano Embeth Davidtz who's a theology professor. She's initially very reluctant to talk but confirms that her father took his own life because of incriminating evidence against him which he felt he wouldn't be able to disprove.When Hobbes visits the cabin where Milano had killed himself he finds the name Azazel written on one of the walls and Gretta later confirms that it refers to a fallen angel who after being cast out of heaven had been made formless as a punishment and could only continue to exist in the bodies of others. The demon's ability to pass from body to body simply by touch made it extremely dangerous and impossible to stop. Hobbes begins to realise that he's actually in a dual against a very formidable adversary who's determined to destroy him and so when evidence starts to appear which implicates Hobbes in the murders he's investigating he knows that he's rapidly being put in the same situation that detective Milano had been in and so devises a scheme to outwit the demon and bring a permanent end to the havoc he wreaks.Denzel Washington is very natural and believable as the decent detective who has never taken a bribe in his career and believes that cops are the chosen people. This extremely rational man remains typically methodical and professional as he pursues what turns out to be a supernatural serial killer and is confident that his approach will eventually enable him to put a stop to the demon's killing spree. John Goodman James Gandolfini and Donald Sutherland all do well as Hobbes' police colleagues and Elias Koteas makes a powerful impression in his role which gives him tremendous scope to display his abilities.Thrillers which include the type of subject matter featured in Fallen often resort to sensationalism gratuitous violence and endings that use some previously unknown piece of information to bring matters to a close. The fact that Fallen avoids all these pitfalls is very much to its credit especially as its brilliantly twisted conclusion follows on perfectly from all that preceded it and puts an entirely different perspective on what appeared to happen in the movie's opening scenes.".

There are subtle shivers particularly the 'touching' scenes and the sense of something evil hidden behind the everyday. The setting is bleakly autumnal and it is finishes with a nice twist. If you watch the film again knowing the ending it makes more sense.Of the acting Goodman and Sutherland don't have much to play with but it is always good to see them in a film. Washington is very good as his normal cop character grapples with the mystery and Davidtz is excellent as the academic scared and solitary and fallible. The scenes between Washington and Davidtz are well played. Tan Dun's music adds to the atmosphere. Well directed and well written. Well done.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie might appeal to people who like scare themselves by imagining evil threats coming from the supernatural world angels and demons and things that go bump in the night but if you're more realitybased than that you'll probably disappointed. The movie begins as a standard police murdermystery and the circumstances of the murders are peculiar enough to gain your interest. Too bad it couldn't have stayed in that realm. Without spoiling the film completely it's enough to say that once it turned toward the supernatural it fell completely flat for me. I mean how can a serious actor like Denzel Washington speak those lines with a straight face? At least Donald Sutherland who never seems to stop making one movie or another for a single day of the year was given a part he could play straight without having to spout mumbojumbo. John Goodman only had to get himself through a couple of ridiculous lines. But poor Denzel was in the thick of it pretending to be part of some titanic struggle of good vs. evil. Pshaw! The little twist at the ending was just SO cheesy lifted from three hundred previous horror flicks I wanted to spit. Another phony bit borrowed from every horror flick ever made was when Denzel is alone in the basement scary scary suddenly there is a thunderous crash and something huge drops on him from above. Oh never mind it was just the old rotting ceiling falling in nothing to worry about after all. Carry on. We do this in scary movies to keep you from getting bored. Eeyew! I also object to a good deal of the camera work with all its quick cuts and constant shifting of angle and perspective so that you often don't know what you're looking at. To me that sort of thing is a poor man's substitute for a good script. I gave it five stars instead of less because the mystery started off as something interesting and because of some of the thisworld performances such as Goodman's and the other cop played by James Gandolfini I believe. A movie of limited appeal.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is a failure plain and simple on several levels.  It's got a slick look and feel I'll give it that but the story is simplistic and plodding.  The previews for the movie essentially gives the entire plot fallen angels take demonic possession of humans via touch and Denzel Washington has the misfortune of getting the attention of one who then sets out to ruin his life or simply end it.  It ostensibly uses the Bible as an inspiration but this is your standard boogie man fare that just needs a cheap device that can be used to frighten the audience into feeling that it's subject matter is somehow real and substantial.The basic premise holds some promise but the movie's execution of the story annoyed me to no end.  Read no further if you don't want to hear spoilersAzazel the fallen angel that Washington chases throughout the film can possess seemingly just about anyone he wants to by touch although not skintoskin contact as most people consider touchin the movie he simply has to touch somebody's clothes or brush up against them to transfer his spirit so in reality he travels by close proximity I supposebut no one seems to make a point of it.  The only person in the film that apparently is able to resist possession was Denzel presumably because he's pure of spirit and is one of God's chosen to fight these fallen angels.  However the movie later states that once Azazel's host is killed and he is in spirit form no man or woman can resist possession.  So why he doesn't simply possess Washington at the very beginning of the movie when one of his hosts is getting the gas chamber for serial killing with Washington standing about 20 feet away watching is not explainedeven though it is later implied that Azazel indeed tried to take possession when he shakes Denzel's hand from his jail cell.  As is the case with most bad movies I think the most correct explanation is simply if this happened there would be no movie.Of course the audience is let in on the possession angle from the start of the movie but we're forced to sit through a full hour before Denzel pieces it all together and then finally hatches a plan to kill Azazel.  The ending has a nice twist I'll give it that but is also predictablethese fallen angels are very well near omnipotent.  With their powers they truly would have to be stupid to be killed by any mortal especially when their powers of possession seem to have no bounds they could probably possess a cockroach for all we know.  The real problem with movies like these is they never explain the motivation of the killer beyond showing that they are antisocial psychotics.  That we're supposedly talking about a several thousandyear old angel doesn't seem to change it any.  One character states that fallen angle's ultimately seek the fall of civilization but Azazel seems more interested in being a pest and serial killing when he's bored. Can we say Freddy Krueger?  Is the movie implying that serial killing can be partially blamed on fallen angels?  Is that the most creative idea they can come up with?  There is some fertile ground to explore with how the world is possibly affected right under our noses by spiritual forces of good and evil as the saying goes how can God let bad things happen? that movies like this MAY have been able to discuss if there was some intelligence at its core.  But this movie is thin as a pancake.  It offers no deep contemplations on evil or human suffering.   It's a cheap thrill ride devoid of thrills.  There is almost no suspense in the movie it simply plods along predictably as we wait wait wait for the final act.  I give it a D grade if only for the solid production values.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie wasn't horrible ... but it wasn't good. Th writing was great. Every fact was backed up in some way or explained in some way to leave the acts that were going on understood. An outcast angel was thrown out of heaven without a body and so it is able to take the body of humans by touch. The angel turned evil and enjoys death and singing. He or she grows a sort of infatuation with the main character played by Denzel Washington and wants to invade his body next. What keeps this story going is that this angel cannot enter his body which is the only detail not explainedor maybe I missed it but may be able to enter his body if his host carrier dies and he is left floating in the air... The basics of the movie are there good plot good script but fairly boring. There are no real thrills in this movie it feels like more of a supernatural mystery but there's no mystery because we know whats going on. Something's missing there and that's what makes this film only mediocre. There is no filling. To use a really bad metaphor it's like going to eat a piece of pie and all you get is the crust. And the real sinker of the movie is the ending. Denzel figures out that he has to get this being to a secluded area  kill the host and then kill himself in the process because because this thing will die with no host. Little does he know that this being can use animals as hosts it enters a cat's body and that's the end with the Denzel's voice narrating as the angel. It was terrible. The point of the movie seemed to be that this thing has been around for ever and Denzel would be the one to stop it. great idea that they killed with the ending. It made telling the story a waste. So anyway to the good....Denzel was excellent as always maybe not his best acting and I'm not sure he's cut out for narration but he was wonderful none the less. The female character in the moviedidn't write down her name was also excellent. John Goodman was decent as well although I think he's better off sticking to white trash comedy. All in all it was worth seeing but I'm glad I rented it on 1 movie day.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of those films which gets a fair amount of publicity on cinematic release but afterwards is never heard from again. I suppose the main reason is that there isn't much here that we haven't seen before. The concept of a demon passing from one person to another is fresh but the execution is bland and dull. Very hard to engage the mind at first once it grips it soon loses its way following on from one itwasn'tme' event to the next. Shot in an eerie manner it nonetheless doesn't utilise all of the potential it has and the overall effect is deadening. Creepy but shallow underneath the surface. The direction is tense and deeply atmospheric but the script is lacklustre a throwback of bits and pieces of other horror movies combined with the average clichs. The outcome is a neat idea in search of a smart script to boot. What's interesting is the fact that each cast member gets their chance to play a particular character Azazel. And with all this starpower on show they do a good job of playing the demon' along with the given characters. Charismatic leading man Denzel Washington is suitably cast as the protagonist and proves to have range doing these simple roles and the tougher ones with equal vavavoom. John Goodman is okay but greatly underused while the same applies to James Gandalfini who plays almost the exact same character. Donald Sutherland doesn't prove to have any range doing the usual gruff routine that he does in nearly all of his movies. Embeth Davidtz is a talented and totally underrated actress. She delivers a good performance and shows great potential for the future. I could go on for a while about all the flaws of the film but there isn't much point. Far from the worst of its type the only major problem is the fact that it is so unrewarding. It promises big and strongly requests that you stick with it to the end but you'll be left wondering why they make evil seem like such a good thing. The outlook keeps getting gloomier and gloomier until there is absolutely no hope of revival. Overall not disastrous but very little to recommend here. If you want a supernatural chiller its worth consideration but you should try What Lies Beneath' or The Sixth Sense' instead. My IMDb rating is just a 4.910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fallen 1998  Gregory HoblitThis eerie physiological thriller follows a man in his discovery of acceptance for and attempt to destroy a spirit who's one aim is to travel from body to body and to watch people try and solve the deaths it leaves behind. This film left me thinking about the narrative for days being written perfectly it kept me intrigued the whole way through. This isn't a film where you could sit back and enjoy the story it is one that keeps you on the edge of your seat questioning characters and messages the whole way through. It is everything you want with a good psychological thriller containing anagrams riddles plot twists 'serial killers' a demon and a weird backwards language.For those of you who enjoy gore this film wouldn't satisfy  but what it lacks in gore it makes up for in beautiful cinematography and an intellectual approach to a plot line that could have so easily faltered. I have to say the ending of the film left me feeling a little less than happy although it rounded off the story well and had no faults I hadn't worked 'it' out  leaving me annoyed with the film whilst loving it at the same time.The main character Hobbes played by Denzel Washington is a wellportrayed detective. He has a troubled family back home which we don't find out about  we simply have to infer from the information Hoblit has allowed us. This theme of not being spoonfed information carries throughout the story with major events being left down to us to analyse and try to find an answer for. This simply adds to the effectiveness of the film. John Goodman playing Jonesy was surprisingly good at his role.

	onyx:emotionText "Fallen 1998  Gregory HoblitThis eerie physiological thriller follows a man in his discovery of acceptance for and attempt to destroy a spirit who's one aim is to travel from body to body and to watch people try and solve the deaths it leaves behind. This film left me thinking about the narrative for days being written perfectly it kept me intrigued the whole way through. This isn't a film where you could sit back and enjoy the story it is one that keeps you on the edge of your seat questioning characters and messages the whole way through. It is everything you want with a good psychological thriller containing anagrams riddles plot twists 'serial killers' a demon and a weird backwards language.For those of you who enjoy gore this film wouldn't satisfy  but what it lacks in gore it makes up for in beautiful cinematography and an intellectual approach to a plot line that could have so easily faltered. I have to say the ending of the film left me feeling a little less than happy although it rounded off the story well and had no faults I hadn't worked 'it' out  leaving me annoyed with the film whilst loving it at the same time.The main character Hobbes played by Denzel Washington is a wellportrayed detective. He has a troubled family back home which we don't find out about  we simply have to infer from the information Hoblit has allowed us. This theme of not being spoonfed information carries throughout the story with major events being left down to us to analyse and try to find an answer for. This simply adds to the effectiveness of the film. John Goodman playing Jonesy was surprisingly good at his role. When we were first introduced to this character I had my doubts about how well he would be played and how well he would fit into the storyline however he did fit in and especially at the end he played a key part in the story a.k.a he wasn't just the fat friend there to prove Hobbes' humanity";

	schema:headline " The ultimate blend of Orwell and action";
	schema:reviewBody "Even in this postMatrix era this movie is still the ultimate blend of Orwell and action. If the definition of a classic is a movie that's often imitated but never equaled then The Terminator is definitely a classic because the increasing redundancy of its sequels and imitations merely demonstrates how good the original is.I wasn't fortunate enough to see this movie in the year of its release the year predicted by Orwell's classic novel as a time when technology would be used to enslave people but I did see it in about 1992 when the blockbuster success of the first sequel made me curious to watch the first film. At that time I preferred the second Terminator movie for being technically superior but after all these years I now prefer the first film's raw intensity and kinetic energy.The Terminator was of course the breakthrough movie for James Cameron and even after Aliens and Titanic it's still arguably his bestdirected film. I challenge anybody to watch this movie and point out one single shot that needs improvement because the direction of this movie is so fluid and precise that I can't think of one moment in the whole 100minute running time that I would want to change.Cameron was and of course still is a notorious perfectionist who's very difficult to work with but his perfectionism really paid off with this movie because it can be watched again and again without losing its entertainment value. He's a master of the small touch as when the cop at the desk is filling out his paperwork with a small pencil and pauses in midsentence to look up and see the headlights coming towards him through the doors.Cameron also cowrote the story so this movie meant even more to him personally than merely a directing triumph. Supposedly he drew his inspiration from a nightmare in which he was being chased by a humanoid with one glowing red eye and indeed the whole film has the urgent oppressive atmosphere and calm logic characteristic of a nightmare. But of course he was probably also remembering subconsciously a couple episodes of The Outer Limits that he saw as a kid which explains why he had to acknowledge the writer Ellison in the credits.Besides Cameron this movie really belongs to the three lead actors. Arnold of course gives the performance of his career in this movie but then so do Linda and Michael. Arnold's physical presence and harsh accent have never been put to better use in a movie while Linda never had another role that required her to run through such a full range of emotionssweetness and vulnerability toughness and despair etc.Michael has always been a B actor but since The Terminator is essentially a B movie he fits in perfectly. His performance proves that an action hero is much more compelling when he's vulnerable not only to physical pain but emotional difficulties to which his big haunted eyes are put to good use. Watch him in this movie as a man thrown out of his time but with a mission and you'll see a perfect match of actor and character.In a typical action film the amount of violence and bloodshed in The Terminator would be excessive but in a movie about an unstoppable killing machine the envelope can be pushed. In one of the more memorable setpieces the Terminator takes on an entire police station full of thirty cops and although I didn't exactly count them the viewer gets the sense of watching every single cop being gunned down.Ordinarily I wouldn't describe such a scene of slaughter as cool and yet there is something undeniably cool about Arnold with his sunglasses and leather jacket going through the station with a shotgun and assault rifle and taking on everybody. Arnold's charisma helps the audience stomach the coldblooded determination of the Terminator but also the character's singlemindedness invites admiration even as we're appalled by all the killing we have to admit he does it rather well.This movie has more than enough gunfire explosions and stuntwork including some especially good stunt driving to work purely as an action picture but it's the film's antitechnology paranoia that makes it more than just an exciting ride. Notice for example the subtle role that Sarah's answering machine plays in the story the cops can't get into touch with her because of it while the message she leaves on it brings the Terminator right to her.In one memorable shot the tracks of a construction crane become those of a killing machine in the future crushing an endless row of skulls which you can interpret any number of ways is it a crack against urban renewal?. Also note that the criminal psychologist is enslaved by his beeper and that even in the postapocalyptic future in which machines have destroyed the world children still huddle around a television set in a desperate effort to be entertained.Some viewers may be turned off by this movie's preaching but one quality that distinguishes The Terminator from its countless imitations is the strength of its convictions. Too many sciencefictionaction movies fail under the weight of their own camp but The Terminator is an exception because it actually has the nerve to take itself seriously. The bickering between seasoned cops Paul and Lance provides some levity but at no point does the film make fun of itself.The only reason I'm not giving this movie a perfect 10 is because it is after all The Terminator and not Casablanca. If people still remember it in forty years then I'll give it a 10.".

But of course he was probably also remembering subconsciously a couple episodes of The Outer Limits that he saw as a kid which explains why he had to acknowledge the writer Ellison in the credits.Besides Cameron this movie really belongs to the three lead actors. Arnold of course gives the performance of his career in this movie but then so do Linda and Michael. Arnold's physical presence and harsh accent have never been put to better use in a movie while Linda never had another role that required her to run through such a full range of emotionssweetness and vulnerability toughness and despair etc.Michael has always been a B actor but since The Terminator is essentially a B movie he fits in perfectly. His performance proves that an action hero is much more compelling when he's vulnerable not only to physical pain but emotional difficulties to which his big haunted eyes are put to good use. Watch him in this movie as a man thrown out of his time but with a mission and you'll see a perfect match of actor and character.In a typical action film the amount of violence and bloodshed in The Terminator would be excessive but in a movie about an unstoppable killing machine the envelope can be pushed. In one of the more memorable setpieces the Terminator takes on an entire police station full of thirty cops and although I didn't exactly count them the viewer gets the sense of watching every single cop being gunned down.Ordinarily I wouldn't describe such a scene of slaughter as cool and yet there is something undeniably cool about Arnold with his sunglasses and leather jacket going through the station with a shotgun and assault rifle and taking on everybody. Arnold's charisma helps the audience stomach the coldblooded determination of the Terminator but also the character's singlemindedness invites admiration even as we're appalled by all the killing we have to admit he does it rather well.This movie has more than enough gunfire explosions and stuntwork including some especially good stunt driving to work purely as an action picture but it's the film's antitechnology paranoia that makes it more than just an exciting ride. Notice for example the subtle role that Sarah's answering machine plays in the story the cops can't get into touch with her because of it while the message she leaves on it brings the Terminator right to her.In one memorable shot the tracks of a construction crane become those of a killing machine in the future crushing an endless row of skulls which you can interpret any number of ways is it a crack against urban renewal?. Also note that the criminal psychologist is enslaved by his beeper and that even in the postapocalyptic future in which machines have destroyed the world children still huddle around a television set in a desperate effort to be entertained.Some viewers may be turned off by this movie's preaching but one quality that distinguishes The Terminator from its countless imitations is the strength of its convictions. Too many sciencefictionaction movies fail under the weight of their own camp but The Terminator is an exception because it actually has the nerve to take itself seriously. The bickering between seasoned cops Paul and Lance provides some levity but at no point does the film make fun of itself.The only reason I'm not giving this movie a perfect 10 is because it is after all The Terminator and not Casablanca. If people still remember it in forty years then I'll give it a 10.";

	schema:headline " Schwarzenegger's my personal favorite best action classic masterpiece of all time";
	schema:reviewBody "The Terminator 1984 is a masterpiece the best scifi action classics horror movie that started all the Terminator movies. This is Schwarzenegger's best movie and my personal favorite action film. I love this film to death it is my childhood film I grew up with it. Arnold Schwarzenegger was The Terminator T800 Model 101 indestructible killing machine cyborg. This movie is brilliant it has brilliant story brilliant plot excellent additional cast brilliant director and writers good special effects it is mixed with scifi action and horror. This movie deals with the war that was set in the future but the battle will be fought in the present. It deals with paradox travel trough time.It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear. And it absolutely will not stop... ever until you are dead! This is the perfect action film of all time and still even today over 30 years it is a cult classic. The plot and the script provides excellent dialogues. Why it is brilliant? Imagine someone did something in the future and didn't know about it and becomes a primal target for extermination from a killer cyborg from the future now in the present. That is brilliant and excellent idea and story.Two naked men appear in different locations in los Angeles trough flash blue light and electricity they were both set in time from the year 2029 to the present year 1984. One is a human the other is an indestructible cyborg reprogramed to find and kill Sarah Connor Linda Hamilton the woman whose unborn son will become humanity's only hope in the future war against the machines. The other men is a human being a soldier from the future who has to find Sarah Connor and protect her at all cost. That's the basically plot for this film.James Cameron writes and directs this film with his than wife Gale Anne Hurd who also produced this film and they both does that brilliantly. The script with the story provides a perfect action entertainment trough whole film.Brad Fiedel does a wonderful music theme for The Terminator character and action sequences car chases and does a drama in which Sarah and Kyle have sex together in the motel room. That's how John was later in the sequel born. Great music score for the film. I love the soundtracks from this film Photoplay  and Burnin' in the Third Degree by Tryanglz.Arnold Schwarzenegger was at the top of his career. This movie bring his career at top of the action stars. Arnold is excellent and he performs excellent and acts brilliant as The Terminator. At one time his agent pursued Schwarzenegger to play the action hero but Schwarzenegger wasn't interested to be an action hero he was interested to be The Terminator and he played brilliantly well and believable enough. Before Sarah Connor was a tough badass gun guerilla squad in the sequels here she was a scared victim. A beautiful young woman who was a waitress at the diner and was just a human being leaving a teenage normal life in Los Angeles. Linda Hamilton is the only Sarah Connor no else can replace her. She is beautiful and smart and it is my favorite Linda Hamilton movie. She acts very realistic brilliant and perfectly as the scared victim. Linda Hamilton is the best of the film.Michael Biehn is the only Sgt. Kyle Reese no one else is or can replace him. He is excellent and brilliant I still prefer Corporal Dwayne Hicks but Kyle Reese is my favorite character from Michael Biehn he is a perfect action hero. I love Kyle Reese because he doesn't kill any human being. Lance Henriksen from Aliens and Hard Target is in here and he plays Detective Hal Vukovich and he is very good and realistic as the detective.Paul Winfield is Lieutenant Ed Traxler first he doesn't believe Kyle Reese story but later he witness it him self. I wish there wouldn't be deleted scene in which Kyle and Sarah finds Traxler dying and he gives Kyle a gun. This movie has ton's of action You see a lot of automatic weapons shotguns and handguns used in this film and they are used well. You have a car chase between The Terminator and Kyle Reese with Sarah and both men are shooting at each other. Terminator has a stolen Police car and Kyle fires his shotgun and hits twice the Terminator once in the eye. The Terminator than crashes with the car in the wall. In the next scene you see Terminator's eye bloody. You have a great car chase by the end of the film Terminator with truck tries to kill Sarah but Kyle put's a pipe bomb in the truck and you see a huge explosion the truck explodes great special effect. Terminator shoot's with an IMI Uzi in Tech Noir night club. Killing bunch of people in which Kyle stops him with a shotgun. Terminator crash with the car in the police station and kills almost 19 cops.When we see The Terminator been all burned out without flesh with only been endoskeleton covered with steel with his red eyes glowing that is scary when he chases Sarah is scary when I was 6 years old I screamed when I saw that skeleton cyborg attacking Kyle and Sarah. The Terminator is a 1984 American sciencefiction action film directed by James Cameron.1010 BadAss Seal Of Approval The Terminator is a masterpiece a science fiction action horror film a film I love to death and it is my personal favorite Schwarzenegger film. This is Schwarzenegger's best film with Predator and Terminator 2 Judgment Day I highly recommend those three films.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Terminator is one of those films that no matter if you've seen it or not you've heard of it heck you know at least one or two lines without seeing it! This is the movie that blasted then new comer's Arnold Schwartzeneggerr's career made James Cameron a name in Hollywood and gave new meaning to a possible dark future that gave us nightmares. I remember the first time I saw this movie I was just 8 years old and my dad of course walks in saying to cover my eyes at every bad scene with violence or nudity needless to say about 70 of the movie he covered my eyes. Finally I got to see it with my mom and I was in love this wasn't just an action movie though it is one of the best it had a story. To think this was all based upon just a quick nightmare that James Cameron had he didn't have much money but he had a good script a great crew on his side to make one of cinema's greatest movies of all time.Two men appear in Los Angeles in separate locations manifesting in sudden blinding flashstorms of electricity. One is heavily muscular the other man slim and wiry. The mysterious muscular man obtains weapons and begins hunting down all women named Sarah Connor using a phone book to track his targets. He successfully kills the first two of the three listed women. When he attempts to kill the last Sarah Connor he is stopped by the other man Kyle Reese who has been sent back in time to protect her. While hiding in a parking garage Reese explains that the man hunting Sarah is actually a cyborg assassin called a Terminator built by Skynet an artificial intelligence network created by Cyberdyne Systems. In the near future Reese explains Skynet gained selfawareness initiated a global takeover of military hardware and launched a nuclear war against humanity. Skynet ordered that a scant number of humans were to be kept alive in order to be used as slave labor. John Connor Sarah's son rallied the few remaining humans and led a resistance movement against the machines. After a grinding campaign the human resistance was on the verge of victory in a lastditch effort Skynet sent the Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John was born preventing the resistance from ever being founded and allowing the machines to win by default. Reese volunteered to follow the Terminator back in time to protect Sarah after his use of the time transportation equipment it was to be destroyed by the resistance in order to prevent further Terminators from going back in time. The Terminator feels no pain has no emotions and will stop at nothing to accomplish its mission.The Terminator is personally one of my favorite movies of all time I think because this movie really is something special. Yeah the effects are very 80's but for the time and even to this day I think the special effects are much better than the CGI crud we get in today's cinema. This has everything action romance horror scifi and even some dark humor. The reason why Arnold's I'll be back is so famous is not just because of his accent but because you knew that something bad was coming. Kyle Reese's Come with me if you want to live is classic as well. If you haven't seen The Terminator I highly recommend this movie it's an incredible one that is sure to deliver entertainment to the fullest. This is one of the greatest movies of all time and I'm sure that you will not be disappointed if you are get a CAT scan.1010".

After its release in 1984 the extremely lowbudget scifi actioner broke box office records and gave audiences something more to fear. Through the years there have been stories of nature's beasts of creatures from another world and so on and so forth. Jaws was terrifying because it seemed so possible. And if Jaws is terrifying The Terminator is horrific. The realization of this hitman machine dawned on everyone watching the film. In a time of exceeding technology how long will it be before man is overtaken by the very things he created? And that is what is particularly scary about a film like The Terminator. In The Terminator Arnold plays a cyborg Cyberdyne system model 101 a T800 whatever that means. He has been sent back in time to assassinate the soontobemother of the future world leader John Connor who battles the machines in the future and leads an uprising. If Connor is killed then there will be no one to oppose the machines of the future and they will triumph. This would be pretty bad. So the future John Connor has sent a protector back in time to help save his mother. Kyle Reese Michael Biehn tells Sarah Connor Linda Hamilton about the machine that is trying to kill her. It can't be bargained with it can't feel pain or mercy and it will stop at absolutely nothing until you are dead! Talk about a bad day.The Terminator hunts them down time after time including the famous police station scene where Arnie says I'll be back and returns moments later crashing through the wall in a car. He then takes on a whole squad of cops but don't worry Sarah and Reese escape slightly unscathed.There are countless classic scenes in The Terminator. You will see them spoofed your entire life. From the image of the Terminator to the lines they speak to the scenes they act out. Everything is spoofed. And the film is worthy of its fame.On the special edition T2 DVD the second one there is an onset documentary for the making of the Terminator 2 3D ride at Universal Studios. As the camera moves around it shows Cameron detailing what he wants in this scene. Some guy suggests something else and Cameron gets a tone. No no that won't work. You do it like this  we come off here he walks around... etc. The point is he's a perfectionist and a demanding director. Some directors are a bit too easy and don't really care where their films are going. But James Cameron seems to have a clear vision of what he wants and he goes around making sure it gets done exactly the way he wants it to be done. And it shows in his work. It's hard to find any mistakes in a James Cameron film. And it's even harder to find plot holes.Some people say Terminator 2  Judgment Day is better than the original. It's hard to choose because the two films are very different. I view The Terminator as more of a deep intellectuallyconsuming dark thriller. I view Judgment Day as an action film with a more or less recycled plot. The plot is still good but it's still the same too. It's hard to choose a favorite because they are so different. On T2 the budget is ten times larger probably even more than that. But if you want a horrorthriller The Terminator is better for you. If you want specialeffects and a really fun time see T2. They're both excellent films.The Terminator is a great movie. It is one of my favorites it is terrifying horrifying and 100  entertaining. And unlike a lot of other cheap actioners out there The Terminator has some thought put into its plot and that is what separates it from the rest of its kind.".

	schema:reviewBody "Is there a better person to play a cyborg than Arnold?  For this movie he was a massively built oak tree of a man.  His strange accent makes for a perfect callous robotic sounding killing machine.  It's almost like his voice is a computer read out  which I guess it is in one sense . Terminator is one of those films that started something huge.  People didn't realize it at the time but the careers of Arnold Cameron and perhaps even guys like Micahel Biehn Lance Henriksen and even Bill Paxton were substantially started because of this film.  And Cameron must have liked working with them so much that he gave all of them substantial roles in his next film  Aliens .As we all know what the story is I'll just tell you a bit about what is so fascinating about it.  First I have to mention Michael Biehn.  He has the real starring role.  He is the character that has to explain everything to the audience.  He has to explain this complicated story so that we know what is happening and why.  It is not an easy job to do something like that and still come off looking all right.  But Biehn is simply awesome in this film. A microcosm of his performance can be seen when Sara bites him.  Biehn  Kyle Reese  replies  Terminator's don't feel pain.  I do.  Don't do that again.   That is such a great line delivered with the perfect expression the perfect tone and the perfect timing.  Biehn is perfect for the role.This is also the first film that I saw as a youngster that ever warned me of the dangers of nuclear war and of the rapid advancements of machinery. Perhaps I was too young and naive to fully understand all that James Cameron was trying to say but now that I am older I can honestly say that the two Terminators are perfect anti nuke films.  And they are so passionate with what they have to say.  I like it when a film has something to say.  I enjoy being entertained in the process but if you can manage both then you have a masterpiece.  This is a masterpiece.Finally. there are two other reasons to enjoy this film.  One this is the first film where I'll be back was spoken.  Now it is part of Arnolds vernacular.  Secondly Bill Paxton is in it.  And he adds spark to any film that he's in.  Especially here as the idiot punk leader that really gets the hell beat out of him he has some great lines.A great film.".

	onyx:emotionText "Is there a better person to play a cyborg than Arnold?  For this movie he was a massively built oak tree of a man.  His strange accent makes for a perfect callous robotic sounding killing machine.  It's almost like his voice is a computer read out  which I guess it is in one sense . Terminator is one of those films that started something huge.  People didn't realize it at the time but the careers of Arnold Cameron and perhaps even guys like Micahel Biehn Lance Henriksen and even Bill Paxton were substantially started because of this film.  And Cameron must have liked working with them so much that he gave all of them substantial roles in his next film  Aliens .As we all know what the story is I'll just tell you a bit about what is so fascinating about it.  First I have to mention Michael Biehn.  He has the real starring role.  He is the character that has to explain everything to the audience.  He has to explain this complicated story so that we know what is happening and why.  It is not an easy job to do something like that and still come off looking all right.  But Biehn is simply awesome in this film. A microcosm of his performance can be seen when Sara bites him.  Biehn  Kyle Reese  replies  Terminator's don't feel pain.  I do.  Don't do that again.   That is such a great line delivered with the perfect expression the perfect tone and the perfect timing.  Biehn is perfect for the role.This is also the first film that I saw as a youngster that ever warned me of the dangers of nuclear war and of the rapid advancements of machinery. Perhaps I was too young and naive to fully understand all that James Cameron was trying to say but now that I am older I can honestly say that the two Terminators are perfect anti nuke films.  And they are so passionate with what they have to say.  I like it when a film has something to say.  I enjoy being entertained in the process but if you can manage both then you have a masterpiece.

	schema:headline " Arnie is cool as the bad guy in this classic 80's action film!";
	schema:reviewBody "It was funny to read that this film nearly avoided coming to our screens. With many number of studios rejecting the script and story Terminator was nearly terminated before getting of the ground. However one company ORION pictures the last resort for this movie loved the premise of a robot running around as a man trying to kill the mother of the savior of planet earth. Thank goodness they saw that it was a good script because it become one of the great films of the 1980's.In 2029 giant super computers dominate the planet hell bent on exterminating the human race! And to destroy man's future by changing the past they send an indestructible cyborg  a terminator  back in time to kill Sarah Connor the woman who's unborn son will become mankind's only hope. Can Sarah protect herself from this unstoppable menace to save the life of her unborn child? Or will the human race be extinguished by one mean hunk of mutant metal?Well this film is a real blast. The cast is extraordinary. This is probably Arnold Schwarzenegger's most popular role. I cannot see why it isn't. He was great as the Cyborg that was walking around as a killing machine. His facial expressions are sketched in my memory for life. I love the scene where see a close of his face in the police car it was brilliant. Schwarzenegger originally a body builder he has had a wonderful career in the movie industry. His other great films include Predator End Of Days Total Recall Eraser and was impressive in his role as Mr. Freeze in Batman and Robin. His career was on hold for sometime a while back due to injury but he is back and I hope we get to see more of his acting talents.Then you have the others in the cast. The other stand out in this film for me is Linda Hamilton. She was suited perfectly to the role of the feeble Sarah Connor who is going to be the mother of the child who is going to save the world. Hamilton has had a mixed career with her filmography including the enjoyable Dante's Peak. The good guy in Terminator was Michael Biehn who played out the role of Sarah Connor's protector Reese Kyle. He was very good in his role. His other movies include Aliens The Rock Crash and an uncredited role in the great musical Grease. The director of Terminator namely James Cameron did a great job with this film. Considering he thought up the idea from a sick bed had it rejected that many times it is a great credit to him. Most directors would have given up on it but he stuck with it till he got to our screens. Thank goodness he did. The story of the Terminator is an interesting one. It has a very biblical feel to it. One man sent to help save the world with the initials J.C. fascinated me immensely. Cameron and Co writer Gale Anne Hurd did a fantastic script for this film. There are some unbelievable scenes in this movie. None more so then the vision we see of the metal Cyborg walking from the truck fire. The vision we see from this scene is one of the main reasons why we have the Terminator. James Cameron explained that he wanted a scene in a movie that has a machine walking from a fire in menacing fashion. He got this spot on if you ask me. Then there are some other great scenes such as the tense stand offs that the evil cyborg has with all the humans he comes into contact with including the first confrontation with Sarah in addition to the meeting he has with Reese. I also enjoyed the scene where he goes through the police station. Of course this scene has one of Hollywood's most famous lines in it that of Arnie's 'I'll be back' a classic. The final confrontation between Sarah and the Cyborg is another tension filled scene of this great movie.So what more can I say about this movie? It is simply brilliant. I have asked many people their opinion on this film. One such response about it was that is too 'eightish' and that comment is fair enough. If you have the chance grab a copy of Terminator on DVD as it is a great 2 disc set. I must admit the first time I saw it I did not appreciate Terminator like I do now. Perhaps I found it a tad violent but that is to be expected of a film that is called Terminator. This movie was a great success and deserved to be with all the great work that was put into it. However more was to come a film that was to become one of the greatest sequels in movie history. Arnie was to deliver on his promise of 'I'll be back'!Rating 4.5 stars or 910".

	schema:headline " The wonderful action movie which started a wonderful action saga";
	schema:reviewBody "The Terminator is one of the best action movies of all time in my opinion. It doesn't set a single foot wrong and it also kicked off a wonderful saga. Without this there would be no Terminator 2. Think about that. As such this movie is fondly remembered by many people and it has been the subject of many quotes and spoofs over the years. Why doesn't it set a foot wrong? It is thrilling almost always entertaining and filled with insane explosions which more or less makes a good action movie. But 'The Terminator' stands head and shoulders above the rest of it's genre because of it's well thoughtout plot splendid acting and an eerily memorable music score which gives you a reason to watch the credits at the end.Now to analysing why the plot is so wellthought out. Well for one thing the concept of preventing or setting in stone the future by going back in time was one which wasn't really explored in those days. By exploring it the Terminator was offering something different something which has inspired films such as Back to the Future read the plot synopsis for that film there are a few similarities. The notion of the final battle of a future war being fought in 'our present' not in the future between one member of opposing sides in this case a man and a machine is also an intriguing one and sets the stage for an exciting battle royale.I'll run down the plot while I'm here. Sarah Connor a young woman in her 20's is the protagonist of the film and our two from the future Kyle Reese and the Terminator revolve around her. Reese who is a battlehardened soldier who has led a hard life in the wasteland which is the future must protect Sarah while the Terminator an unstoppable cyborg must kill her in order to kill her unborn son the leader of the future resistance.All of this leads to some thrilling action scenes and insane explosions topped off by music scores which add to the tension and excitement. The movie purrs into action quickly but really kicks off at a disco where Reese and the Terminator have a shootout resulting in a citywide driveby chase involving the police which doesn't really let up until Reese and Sarah are arrested. During the lull in the chase scene Reese tells Sarah about himself the Terminator and their general predicament which is fairly realistic. The next action scene is the infamous police station massacre which everyone seems to talk about whenever they discuss this movie. I can understand why too. The Terminator pretty much kills every cop in his path with the greatest of ease either with the AK47 his shotgun or both. He also ends up cutting the power and setting the station on fire again adding to the tension and excitement. The last action scene which like the one in T2 is a chase which leads to a final showdown in a building. It is a slight letdown but it is still an intense scene. I will refrain from spoiling the ending as this is too good a movie to be spoiled.All of the acting fits the bill perfectly. As in T2 there is not a single bad performance to be found. Michael Biehn delivers a remarkably intense performance as Kyle Reese acting like a typical human would in his situation. He displays his range of emotions at the right times from passionate to worried to unyielding. It is a wonder that his only other major movie is 'Aliens' and that he is starring in stuff like 'Clockstoppers' these days. Linda Hamilton again does well as Sarah Connor displaying an innocent woman who shows over the course of the film why she is John Connor's mother displaying previously unheralded steel at the crunch. The support cast isn't too bad either Dr. Silberman makes his first appearance. But again the best performance in the film belongs to the bad guy in this case Arnold Schwarzenegger. He acts like a killing machine should incredibly cold sterile soulless and unyielding. His facial expression never changes throughout the film and his physical appearance makes him slightly more imposing and intimidating than the Liquid Terminator. He also commences his famous oneliners which have been the subject of many a spoof including no especially I'll be back. This is undoubtedly his best performance even though it is not his only good one.I will compliment all involved on making a movie which still manages to look good despite having a low budget. I've seen pretty badlooking movies with fairly high budgets read ScoobyDoo but never goodlooking movies with low budgets.In the end The Terminator is a masterful action movie which laid the groundwork for the equally brilliant Terminator 2. If you asked me whether I preferred The Terminator or T2 I would say T2 because I am more familiar with it otherwise these two would be on a level footing. If you haven't seen this movie and are an action movie fan then see it immediately. You won't be disappointed. Trust me.55 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "For the gift of Aliens' and The Terminator' I am willing to forgive Cameron's Titanic'. The key plot concept is beautifully simple  machines take over the earth in the future. Machines are eventually over thrown by one man. Machines travel back in time to kill man's mother thus preventing him being born and stopping their own defeat.  One human also travels back to stop the machines from killing his leader's mother.The Terminator' is a classic good versus evil struggle with little in the way of greys clouding the issue. The terminator is an unstoppable brutal remorseless killer and it perfectly suits Arnold Schwarzenegger's limited acting abilities. His few lines including the infamous I'll be back' are all well judged and timed and give a great feeling of precision and inhumanity to his character. Coupled with his chiselled features he's the best choice for the role. Michael Biehn is playing a character type that he'd reprise two years later in Cameron's Aliens'  the human tough guy he's got the fight but still the ability to love and care for people. His features are well chosen for this and although his delivery of lines is hardly exceptional  they tend to come out in the same tone of voice  he's able to carry his part. Linda Hamilton is the womanthrownintochaos somewhat reminiscent of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley character in Alien' although Hamilton doesn't have Weaver's strength of presence. All the actors are for an action science fiction above average and so never distract.It's the script with Cameron's force behind it that lifts the movie from mediocrity. Yes there's a certain amount of corniness  the we loved a life time' element for example  but the movie has a real sense of conviction present. The movie believes in itself and through its passion will make you believe too. There's a general sense of darkness in the movie  rarely do we see daylight and when we do it's often the soft light of dawn. There's a nice sense of tension in the action scenes helped not only by Cameron's camera work but also by an excellent electronic score including a fantastic brooding credit sequence. Sure some of the SFX look clunky in these days of Attack of the Clones' and The Fellowship of the Ring' but they still work. There's a certain sense of inevitability intertwined with hope permeating the picture that creates a mood I particularly enjoyed and that's harder to find in the current crop of science fiction movies.The Terminator' is not a perfect picture. The movie lags in some parts and the romance element is fairly contrived. Despite all that the movie brims with energy and promise a script that mostly delivers characters you can enjoy and the ultimate Arnie role. Well worth catching. 810.".

The entire message of The Terminator is an anti nuclear war message.Many people think that a few parts in the beginning of the movie are just some random things thrown in. I can understand why but these seemingly random scenes actually do have a lot to do with the story.Arnold does a great job as the cyborg who is programmed to kill without mercy or remorse. For those who don't know this is the movie where the line I'll be back was spoken. The other actors do a good job in this. Linda Hamilton made a great choice doing this movie and she really improved her career through itthe movie she made before this was the horrible Children Of The Corn.This is better than Terminator 2which is still great by the way because this movie has more of a story and is more involved. I would recommend watching this movie at any time it is very well paced and never gets boring and if you have the time watch T2 right after this.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've reviewed this classic movie before but now I'm gonna review the DVD. To start I must say that although they had their rationale for deleting the terminated scenes as they were called I think they definitely should have left that one scene in where Sarah Connor calls her mom and tells her to hide in the cabin and where she finds the listing of Cyberdyne Corp. in the phone book. This scene established Sarah as one who is willing to try to take matters into her hands to stop a nuclear war and a horrible future. She talks to Reese about getting rid of Cyberdyne and they get into an arguement about whether or not that is a mission objective and Reese ends up chasing Sarah into a wooded area. I think the beauty of the woods flowers and waterfalls was important too because Reese starts crying and saying how all of this is destroyed and the future is nothing but blackened charred ruins littered with the skulls of attempted human genocide. What a terrific powerful scene. I adore Michael Biehn and I didn't realize what a great actor and crier he is!!! Maybe the other terminated scenes were okay to delete although they were all delightful. The one where Sarah practices her wholesome waitress routine was cute. The one where she talks about Disneyland and hot dogs might have seemed silly but it really brought home how foreign our world is to Reese as did the crying scene. The tickling scene might have seemed silly to the editor but I thought it really made a point after all the violence and bleakness Reese lived through to be with the woman he's always loved and idolized to lay in a cozy warm bed with her experiencing the simple joys of life for the first time I still wonder if Sarah devirginized him since he said he'd never had any special someone in his life seemed to bring everything into perspective. The scene where you discover that the factory was Cyberdyne Systems was important too but I'll let these scenes slide. I really think they should consider releasing a TERMINATOR with the scene in the wooded area included. Nevertheless I still consider this film as one of my favorite scifi films and my favorite James Cameron film. I still admire who he infuses humanity with action and adrenaline and the missing scenes were wonderful.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Terminator simply has to be my number 1 favourite movie of all time. When the first time I saw the film I fell in love with it about 15 years ago. The truly original idea of the storyline is amazing about a cyborg is sent from the future on a deadly mission. He has to kill Sarah Connor a young woman whose life will have a great significance in years to come. Sarah has only one protector  Kyle Reese  also sent from the future. The Terminator uses his exceptional intelligence and strength to find Sarah. The movie was emotionally  psychologically thrilling and made so dark  sinister that give the tensive mood for the film. A well made for 80's film and I was surprised when I heard that it made with a budget of 6.4 million because it looks more expensive e.g. the nuclear war in Los Angeles 2029. I loved every second of it and the best scenes are1. When the terminator killed Ginger  her boyfriend.2. Shootout at the nightclub A classic scene in film history.3. Self surgery on his wrist  eye.4. Shootout at the police station.5. When the terminator was driving the lorry.6. When he unexpectedly rose from the fire as an endoskeleton after that it was a nail biting experience to the end.The line I'll be back is simply the best quote for any film because the audience never expected his position of coming back. Although it is on the IMDb top 250 but it should have been No 1 top place because I have never seen a better movie than this. I've seen it about 100 times and I'm still not fed up. The Terminator gave me the passion about films and my verdict is 1000 00010. It's nearly about 25 years old and people still watch it. The 80's was the best decade for movies e.g. An American Werewolf in London Gremlins A Nightmare in Elm Street  Predator the list is endless. Anyway no matter whatever happens there will never be a better film than The Terminator.".

	schema:reviewBody "Raise your hand if you've seen The Terminator.Okay.So people of Earth how many of you recall the last time you caught Arnold's breakout performance?Who were you with? Were you conveyed by carriage or dirigible?Put your hand down if you can't remember.I only ask because revisiting's worthwhile.This was my first time watching the movie so my Dad and I instantstreamed T1 via Netflix. And it's glorious lemme tell ya.Soon as Arnold starts killing innocent people my Dad says I don't remember him being the bad guy.We realize he's never seen the first installment before. He only thinks he remembers. And I bet that's the case for many folks not raising their hand.It's been thirty years since release but it holds up like you wouldn't believe.Seriously. The Terminator's a smart movie.Every character is watertight. Prominent or minor the acting's often what retains the captivation in between gunplay and chase scenes.The cops are Traxler and Vukovich played by Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen a.k.a. Bishop from Aliens and have a humorous dynamic. Sarah's roommate Bess Motta as Ginger is the sexy bouncy type and her boyfriend's a wellmeaning dummy. Kyle Reese played by Michael Biehn is withdrawn and serious.How about Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor? She's such an asskicking delight her likeness is still utilized twentyfour years later in Fox's Terminator The Sarah Connor Chronicles. The show ran for two seasons and stars the pinnacle of underrated actresses Lena Headey.Talk about a crowning accolade for Hamilton's performance.As a standalone the story is very good and there's almost no need for a sequel. Although the ending lends itself to continuation it's not necessary.The movie's greatest weakness is the same mistake made by other science fiction films like Escape from New York and Event Horizon meaning a drastic underestimation in regards to the timeframe. The scenes that take place in the future are supposed to be set in 2029. I don't think laser ammunition synthetic skin cells and advanced artificial intelligence are around the corner.Oh. And there's time travel.But this is a silly topic of discussion because the plot's 'selfcontained' the rules allotted to the story's universe are adequate enough. An artificial intelligence develops in 1997 that learns at an exponential rate making allowances for the suspension of disbelief.The irony is the film unfolds a lot like a horror movie.For now all I'll say is that The Terminator is a classic mustsee film in the same manner The Great Gatsby's a mustread novel.Those without a hand in the air should stop reading here because the rest of the review will contain spoilerheavy analysis.Nuance abounds in this movie and it's illustrative of the intelligence packed into every detail. Much of what occurs resonates thematically with the overall narrative.For example the recording on the girls' answering machine states machines need love to which obviously foreshadows Sarah's eventual encounter with the Terminator. It's also ironically commenting on the relationship between man and machine and the eventual fate of humanity.Another detail akin to this is the name of the club where the Terminator finally locates Sarah. The name is TechNoir which is a touch of selfreferential humor. The filmmaking resonates with noir themes and the subject matter's heavily rooted in science fiction.It's selfcontained because of the limits established by the timeframe. In 1984 a Terminator would indeed have to look through the phone book for every 'Sarah Connor' and kill them off to ensure its mission's accomplished. It also establishes conceivable distance between the protagonist and the pursuing threat.The audience can accept humanity's resistance to obliteration against seemingly insurmountable odds when considering ideas like utilizing dogs to detect terminators.As for the special effects most hold up quite nicely. And there shouldn't be any problem for a sophisticated viewer given the context in which it's made. There is obvious use of green screen on set and some devolved CGI but for the most part everything's on the upandup.Okay let's dive in.Timeline A is the history Reese returns from which includes all events up until 2029. Timeline B is the realm in which the film unfolds Earth in 1984.Presumably the John Connor of Timeline A didn't descend from Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor right? A terminator didn't arrive in Timeframe A's 1984 to attempt the same assassination?I'm assuming Timeframe A becomes separate from reality and Timeframe B will continue to unfold into an altered future.There appears to be no residual effects from the changing of history yet. No chaos or collapse which is nice.I wonder if the sequel will cover the issue of reconnecting the loop specifically when history B reaches 2029 even if there's no such thing as terminators will Reese have to travel back in time to impregnate Sarah again?Anyway the reason I say it unfolds like a horror movie is the impending doom that's constant throughout. Sarah encounters terrifying scrapes with death around every turn. Consider the odds constantly stacked against her.After escaping the police station and literally everyone dies Reese blasts the membrane off the Terminator's metal skeleton and dies to blow its legs off.Yet its torso continues to crawl after Sarah and is only crushed by the pneumatic press as his fingers claw at her face.The protagonist's terror is stretched to the utter limit time and time again.For those of you still holding an arm in the air feel free to lower it now.If nothing else you burnt some calories today and learned two things about yourself.1. You're easily manipulated. And 2. You have exquisite taste in movie reviews.".

	onyx:emotionText "Raise your hand if you've seen The Terminator.Okay.So people of Earth how many of you recall the last time you caught Arnold's breakout performance?Who were you with? Were you conveyed by carriage or dirigible?Put your hand down if you can't remember.I only ask because revisiting's worthwhile.This was my first time watching the movie so my Dad and I instantstreamed T1 via Netflix. And it's glorious lemme tell ya.Soon as Arnold starts killing innocent people my Dad says I don't remember him being the bad guy.We realize he's never seen the first installment before. He only thinks he remembers. And I bet that's the case for many folks not raising their hand.It's been thirty years since release but it holds up like you wouldn't believe.Seriously. The Terminator's a smart movie.Every character is watertight. Prominent or minor the acting's often what retains the captivation in between gunplay and chase scenes.The cops are Traxler and Vukovich played by Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen a.k.a. Bishop from Aliens and have a humorous dynamic. Sarah's roommate Bess Motta as Ginger is the sexy bouncy type and her boyfriend's a wellmeaning dummy. Kyle Reese played by Michael Biehn is withdrawn and serious.How about Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor? She's such an asskicking delight her likeness is still utilized twentyfour years later in Fox's Terminator The Sarah Connor Chronicles. The show ran for two seasons and stars the pinnacle of underrated actresses Lena Headey.Talk about a crowning accolade for Hamilton's performance.As a standalone the story is very good and there's almost no need for a sequel. Although the ending lends itself to continuation it's not necessary.The movie's greatest weakness is the same mistake made by other science fiction films like Escape from New York and Event Horizon meaning a drastic underestimation in regards to the timeframe. The scenes that take place in the future are supposed to be set in 2029. I don't think laser ammunition synthetic skin cells and advanced artificial intelligence are around the corner.Oh. And there's time travel.But this is a silly topic of discussion because the plot's 'selfcontained' the rules allotted to the story's universe are adequate enough. An artificial intelligence develops in 1997 that learns at an exponential rate making allowances for the suspension of disbelief.The irony is the film unfolds a lot like a horror movie.For now all I'll say is that The Terminator is a classic mustsee film in the same manner The Great Gatsby's a mustread novel.Those without a hand in the air should stop reading here because the rest of the review will contain spoilerheavy analysis.Nuance abounds in this movie and it's illustrative of the intelligence packed into every detail. Much of what occurs resonates thematically with the overall narrative.For example the recording on the girls' answering machine states machines need love to which obviously foreshadows Sarah's eventual encounter with the Terminator. It's also ironically commenting on the relationship between man and machine and the eventual fate of humanity.Another detail akin to this is the name of the club where the Terminator finally locates Sarah. The name is TechNoir which is a touch of selfreferential humor.

In their short roles Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson were cool! Look for Dick Miller! The acting by the cast is very good! The action scenes are very exciting with lots of gun fire and the special effects are awesome! The music is great! Out of the three Terminator films it is hard to decide which is the best but this one is damn good! In fact its one of the best movies ever! I strongly recommend anyone who loves Arnold and the other cast members I mentioned and especially if you love action scifi or even horror movies to not rent but buy this classic! I recommend The Terminator!Movie Nuttball's NOTESThere is one scene that I really like in the Terminator! It is when Sarah Connor is at the dance club. What I love about it is the song and the excellent slow motion camera. Its when Sarah drops something she goes to pick it up and while she is bending over The Terminator comes walking through the dance floor! Its a classic moment!Bill Paxton has been a part of three huge franchises! Being The Terminator as The Punk Leader Aliens as Pvt. W. Hudson and Predator 2 as Jerry Lambert! Lance Hendrickson has had a similar way of being in epics like Paxton being in The Terminator as Detective Vukovich in Aliens as Bishop Alien 3 as Bishop II and as Charles Weyland in the upcoming 2004 movie Alien vs. Predator! Hendrickson believe it or not was the original choice to play The Terminator! It is so amazing about this!By Paxton and Hendrickson being in these films and that Alien Vs. Predator is finally going to invade the theaters in 2004 could it be that this has happened for a reason? The reason possibly being this In the great Dark Horse comic books there are many editions of Alien Vs. Predator and a edition of Alien vs. Predator vs. The Terminator! What I am saying is could this mean that Alien vs. Predator vs. The Terminator will be made into a huge motion picture or a Alien vs. The Terminator or even a Predator vs. The Terminator movie in the future? Its just a thought but what if? I am sure some writers andor directors have talked about these subjects! I am also sure big fans of these films and of The Terminator would love to watch these icons battle it out!".

While desperately trying to protect her and everything human in human beings from forces so overwhelmingly destructive that they seem to be on par with the will of the gods in Greek tragedies. And the powerful background permeated with a sense of impending fate against which this drama is unfolding apart from helping to deliver a serious and convincing message somewhat unexpectedly turns it into one of the most poignant and poetic love stories  where love conquers time and space and the moment becomes eternal. So this picture should be named among very few actually substantial and emotional fables produced by the department of mainstream entertainment  as it sets off on an infinite journey far beyond the confines of a genre  and beyond the infinite.".

Michael Biehn also does a great performance and Arnold Schwarzenegger does a good job he may of had very few lines but his physical acting is very well done. Schwarzenegger did a good job at portraying a cyborg with use of movements.

	schema:headline " Greatest scifiaction movie ever?";
	schema:reviewBody "I don't know if The Terminator is the best scifiaction film ever made by anyone but if it's not...then I don't know what is.I have seen this movie several dozen times since the age of 4 and it just gets better every time. It does have a special place in my heart so I'll try and be as objective as possible in my review.The plot is not as complicated as it seems. A man from the future is sent to 1984 Los Angeles to protect the mother of the unborn man who will lead the human race in resistance to the machines who have also sent back a terminator to kill this woman named Sarah Conner.What makes this movie so much fun to watch is the fact that it starts going from frame one and doesn't stop until the very end. We first see the terminator come back kill some punks Bill Paxon is one of them! rob a gun store and proceed to kill everyone in the phone book who has the name Sarah Conner. In the meantime the man is sent back chased by the police steals a shotgun and some homeless guy's clothes and then looks for Sarah Conner. And when we first see Sarah she is a fumbling waitress...not the mother of the future.When the terminator the man named Kyle Reese and Sarah Conner all come together we are treated to one of the paramount action scenes of all time. All three people in the same location and the slowmotion and cheesy 80's music starts up. At this point anyone who is watching the movie for the first time has no idea who's on who's side. Then the terminator targets Sarah and Kyle interrupts the slow motion with gunfire. After that is a short but effective shootout Uzi 9mm absolutely MUST be used in every 80's action movie then a vehicle chase while Kyle lays down the exposition.The thing that makes this movie so effective is the antagonist...the terminator. He is shot several times thrown through a window hit by a car...and he keeps on going. And I'm sure everyone even some who have not see the movie knows the famous line I'll be back which is said just before the terminator visits the police station if you know what I mean. At this point Sarah and Kyle are at the police station so they're safe right? There's thirty cops in this building so they must be safe. Wrong. Five minutes later everyone is dead and the building is burning to the ground...and the terminator keeps on going.James Cameron's directing is outstanding especially considering the 6400000 budget and the primitive yet effective special effects which deserve special mention. The effects in this movie are in parts better than anything that can be done by today's cgi. Sure there's many parts which are outdated as hell but there's still certain effects that look real enough to believe. The gas truck exploding at the end was a miniature actually exploding not some fake cgi crap done on a computer. The metal terminator skeleton at the end is real not a cgi effect but the stopmotion scenes look AWFUL.Considering the budget in relation to what was accomplished in this film it's truly a remarkable effort that could probably not have been pulled off by anybody other than James Cameron. Add a script that is commonly used as a teaching tool for upcoming screenwriters and you have a spectacular film.The only bad thing about this movie is that after watching it today it makes you sad that nobody working today can make anything as good.".

	onyx:emotionText "I don't know if The Terminator is the best scifiaction film ever made by anyone but if it's not...then I don't know what is.I have seen this movie several dozen times since the age of 4 and it just gets better every time. It does have a special place in my heart so I'll try and be as objective as possible in my review.The plot is not as complicated as it seems. A man from the future is sent to 1984 Los Angeles to protect the mother of the unborn man who will lead the human race in resistance to the machines who have also sent back a terminator to kill this woman named Sarah Conner.What makes this movie so much fun to watch is the fact that it starts going from frame one and doesn't stop until the very end. We first see the terminator come back kill some punks Bill Paxon is one of them! rob a gun store and proceed to kill everyone in the phone book who has the name Sarah Conner. In the meantime the man is sent back chased by the police steals a shotgun and some homeless guy's clothes and then looks for Sarah Conner. And when we first see Sarah she is a fumbling waitress...not the mother of the future.When the terminator the man named Kyle Reese and Sarah Conner all come together we are treated to one of the paramount action scenes of all time. All three people in the same location and the slowmotion and cheesy 80's music starts up. At this point anyone who is watching the movie for the first time has no idea who's on who's side. Then the terminator targets Sarah and Kyle interrupts the slow motion with gunfire. After that is a short but effective shootout Uzi 9mm absolutely MUST be used in every 80's action movie then a vehicle chase while Kyle lays down the exposition.The thing that makes this movie so effective is the antagonist...the terminator. He is shot several times thrown through a window hit by a car...and he keeps on going. And I'm sure everyone even some who have not see the movie knows the famous line I'll be back which is said just before the terminator visits the police station if you know what I mean. At this point Sarah and Kyle are at the police station so they're safe right? There's thirty cops in this building so they must be safe. Wrong. Five minutes later everyone is dead and the building is burning to the ground...and the terminator keeps on going.James Cameron's directing is outstanding especially considering the 6400000 budget and the primitive yet effective special effects which deserve special mention. The effects in this movie are in parts better than anything that can be done by today's cgi. Sure there's many parts which are outdated as hell but there's still certain effects that look real enough to believe. The gas truck exploding at the end was a miniature actually exploding not some fake cgi crap done on a computer. The metal terminator skeleton at the end is real not a cgi effect but the stopmotion scenes look AWFUL.Considering the budget in relation to what was accomplished in this film it's truly a remarkable effort that could probably not have been pulled off by anybody other than James Cameron.

	schema:reviewBody "At first I didn't feel much of a need to comment on the film since so many others have written and have said so many things. But I think there are some really important points to made and I haven't seen anyone make them. So here I am writing.In my opinion almost everyone misunderstood the relationship between Hephaistion and Alexander. In the modern world especially in the West two men are either very close to each other sleep together and have sex or they keep a good comfortable distance from each other and if they're friendly might punch each other on the arm. In this film we see a relationship that is hard for most people today to understand namely a passionate love relationship between two men in which sex is not very important and possibly even absent.Aristotle essentially explained the whole film near the beginning when he told the young couple something like the following as best I can remember it When two men lie together in lust it is over indulgence. But when two men lie together in purity they can perform wonders. Or something like that. Given what I know of that culture I am sure that in purity means no sex or at least very little. That's why we never see them kiss. In the film as in many older films kissing is a metaphor for sex. Even when Alexander kisses his mother it refers to the idea of sex. That's why Alexander kisses Bagoas but not Hephaistion.Now I'm not sure if the real historical Aristotle would have made that remark. That's not exactly what he says about homosexuality in the Nicomachean Ethics. But the remark is plausible enough since Alexander could easily have heard such an idea during his youth. Plato before Aristotle expressed that idea and Zeno of Citium after Aristotle did too. So even if Aristotle never said this to Alexander it is plausible enough that the idea was in the air and that Alexander heard it from someone or other.Some have complained that the homosexuality assuming that A's relationship with Heph. should even be called that was thrown in their faces too much. But it's crucial to the plot. Stone is hypothesizing that Hephaistion was essential for what Alexander did. Further it's a standard Hollywood convention to juxtapose a love story with some great political military or otherwise grand event. There are tons of examples. Titanic Enemy at the Gates Gone with the Wind ... the list could go on forever. It really is homophobic to complain about Stone continually going back to this theme because he has a perfectly good artistic reason to do it.A few more details Alexander's hair. I think that Stone was trying to make Alexander look like Martin Potter in Satyricon  a nod to Fellini.Alexander's accent and soft appearance. Another nod to a great director passed on this time Stanley Kubrick. Farrel really looks a lot like Ryan O'Neil in Barry Lyndon. In fact he really looks like a Ryan O'Neill  Martin Potter coalescence. I think it's deliberate.The softness of Alexander's personality. In a lot of scenes it made sense. He was gentle enough to know how to approach Bucephalus and tame him without scaring him. He was open minded enough to adopt a lot of Persian culture and encourage intermarriage while the other more heman folks around him were less comfortable with the idea.Yes if you haven't figured it out by now I do like the film. People's hatred of the film is hard for me to understand.".

	schema:reviewBody "The critic and film historian Robert Sarris said of Robert Rossen's 1956 epic 'Alexander the Great' featuring Richard Burton as our titular hero that it aimed for greatness and lost honourably. Oliver Stone's current offering to the Dionysian gods of cinematic excess 'Alexander' has much in common with it's predecessor but sadly honour isn't one of them.Like the earlier film and for that matter every film Stone has ever made it's  at knocking on three hours  seriously in need of a good editor. It has an allstar cast mostly drawn  in the great Hollywood tradition of the Classical world being populated by British character actors  from current Equity rosters the likes of Olivier Barry Jones and Michael Hordern are replaced by rather more lowrent personages as Tim PiggotSmith Brian Blessed and that big fella from the Scots Porridge Oats advert. Also like the original movie it features a dark and hairy Celtictype who can't do accents as the blond blueeyed Hellenic hero. With Burton  a man with natural presence and authority  this latter incongruity is more easily overlooked than is the case with Colin Farrell who has the general demeanour of a bleached and strategically shaved Gremlin. Hairy Col's verbal limitations have also it seems led Stone to populate Macedonia with Irishmen  with a token Welshman and Scotsman thrown in for good measure Greeks are all Englishmen by the way. This means that Val Kilmer as Alexander's dear old dad Philip has to adopt a brogue almost as astonishingly unconvincing as his wig and that unintentional titters abound in the auditoria as hairy Hibernian's slap each other manfully on the back proclaiming such classic lines as In t' name o' Zeus Alexander d'ye t'ink I'm a daft auld sod? Foreigners are granted a variety of curious accents. Angelina Jolie sounds Russian and Athena alone knows where in Hades Rosario Dawson is supposed to come from.This coming from Laughin' Ollie Stone it's a pokerfaced presentation offering conspiracies aplenty. I wouldn't have been surprised if there had been talk of a Lone Swordsman on a grassy Grecian knoll when Philip was offed. The main difference between this film and the 1956 offering comes in its treatment of Alexander's homosexuality. Nary a mention was made of Big Gay Al's rather more than Platonic relationships in Rossen's film. Here it's evident but is the object of knowing disdainful frowns from his contemporaries  which shows a pitiful understanding on the part of Stone of Hellenic sexual politics. Here it's clearly presented as a character flaw showing nothing more clearly than the director's cowardice in addressing the issue in a film notable for it's visceral excess and which requires nudity from Rosario Dawson in a nearrape scene Stone limit's Alexander's 'unnatural' appetites to precisely three hugs and two pecks on the lips. The film is a muddled hotchpotch of incidents from Alexander's life. This would be less of a muddle admittedly if a fifteen minute flashback twothirds of the way through the film was presented as part of the otherwise straightforward linear narrative. There are a few parallels between the lifechoices and characters of Alexander and Philip but these appear almost to have been afterthoughts. The greatest impediments though are that  despite it's great length  characters are not permitted to evolve beyond onenote caricatures though Kilmer an actor I have little time for normally tries harder than most with what little screen time he has and that Farrell has no authority whatever on screen. Thus sorry though I am to have to say it I am forced to confirm the critical evaluation of 'Alexander' offered by the Chavs whose departure from the cinema preceded my own. One succinctly noted That was rotten. Aye said the other referring to the pulchritudinous Ms Dawson But that coloured bird is kinda fit! Indeed she is boys. Indeed she is.".

	schema:reviewBody "When Gladiator stirred a latent interest in films about the ancient world I was so hopeful we would finally be able to enjoy some exciting cinema about my favorite time period. I have not been totally disappointed. USA Television network has given us Attila Caesar and Helen of Troy  not without flaws but solid efforts. Wolfgang Peterson's Troy did not resemble the Iliad I had studied but I appreciated the performances of Eric Bana and Brad Pitt. Brukheimer's King Arthur could have used more experienced epic direction but was loosely based on historical accounts of Sarmatian auxiliaries and their commanders in late Roman Britain and I liked the grittier result to the fairy tale legends of my childhood. Then I heard about Oliver Stone's production of Alexander and I was sure we would have a film of the caliber of Ben Hur. Unfortunately Stone managed to take what should have been a readymade screenplay and solid performances by Angelina Jolie Val Kilmer and Colin Farrel and imparted as much insight into the character and charisma of the world's most famous conqueror and military genius as the images of shadowy figures thrashing about in the blinding dust of Stone's Gaugamela.His opening sequence with Anthony Hopkins as Ptolemy I droning on about his memories of Alexander was more protracted than a prologue to a History Channel documentary. In fact I heard a man behind me mutter something like I came to watch a movie not the History Channel! Stone's next major error was to omit any scenes of Philip's military prowess. The Lion of Macedon was as much a military genius as his celebrated son but Stone leaves us with little more than an impression he was a drunken lout. The omission of the battle of Charonea was nothing short of a blunder since it epitomized the sharing of military experience between father and son with Philip masterminding the battle and Alexander a mere 18years old leading the cavalry in a critical maneuver to assure the victory. Stone handles Alexander's tutelage by Aristotle clumsily as well. Instead of focusing on Alexander's insatiable curiosity about the world around him and how Aristotle nurtured his intellect we see a brief scene where Aristotle is essentially defending Alexander's friendship with Hephaistion to a sneering Cassander. During Alexander's brief lifetime Alexander maintained his relationship with his tutor for years sending examples of plants and animals from the lands he conquered back to Aristotle for study.Then to skip both the battles of the Granicus River and Issus totally left me aghast. I think the most damaging omission was the battle of Issus. It is at Issus that Alexander first confronts Darius himself and Darius flees from the Macedonian onslaught leaving his wife and daughters to Alexander's mercy. When Stone depicts Darius running from Alexander at Gaugamela it is done in such a way that the audience doesn't perceive it to be a lack of personal courage but just an escape especially without the knowledge that Darius had broken and run from Alexander before.Furthermore Gaugamela was not executed in a way that illuminated Alexander's strategy and daring. Stone should have watched Alexander The Art of War produced by the Discovery Channel for better insight.Stone treats us to only one last battle scene in India at the Hydapses River. Again it looks more like a running jungle battle visavis Vietnam than a carefully strategized battle where Alexander had to execute a tenuous river crossing below the expected battle site to draw some of King Porus' forces away from the center and enable Alexander's infantry to be effective. As for the near mortal wound Alexander was wounded at the siege of Malia a fortified town on the way back to the Indian Ocean. He dashed over the ramparts of the town before his main force could catch up to him and he wound up cut off and with three other companions cornered and fighting for his life. Two of his companions were killed and a severely wounded Alexander is protected by the last remaining companion bearing the shield Alexander had supposedly taken from the grave of Achilles at Troy  another missed cinematic opportunity!As for Alexander's bisexuality I objected to Stone's portrayal of Hephaistion as an eyelinered catamite walking around in billowing robes. Hephaistion was as skilled a warrior as Alexander and a successful commander in his own right. Maybe Stone could not bring himself to accept a deep relationship between two very masculine men.Now I can only hope that the vehicle starring Leonardo diCaprio is produced or HBO gives Alexander the treatment he deserves with a blockbuster miniseries like Band of Brothers.".

During Alexander's brief lifetime Alexander maintained his relationship with his tutor for years sending examples of plants and animals from the lands he conquered back to Aristotle for study.Then to skip both the battles of the Granicus River and Issus totally left me aghast. I think the most damaging omission was the battle of Issus. It is at Issus that Alexander first confronts Darius himself and Darius flees from the Macedonian onslaught leaving his wife and daughters to Alexander's mercy. When Stone depicts Darius running from Alexander at Gaugamela it is done in such a way that the audience doesn't perceive it to be a lack of personal courage but just an escape especially without the knowledge that Darius had broken and run from Alexander before.Furthermore Gaugamela was not executed in a way that illuminated Alexander's strategy and daring. Stone should have watched Alexander The Art of War produced by the Discovery Channel for better insight.Stone treats us to only one last battle scene in India at the Hydapses River. Again it looks more like a running jungle battle visavis Vietnam than a carefully strategized battle where Alexander had to execute a tenuous river crossing below the expected battle site to draw some of King Porus' forces away from the center and enable Alexander's infantry to be effective. As for the near mortal wound Alexander was wounded at the siege of Malia a fortified town on the way back to the Indian Ocean. He dashed over the ramparts of the town before his main force could catch up to him and he wound up cut off and with three other companions cornered and fighting for his life. Two of his companions were killed and a severely wounded Alexander is protected by the last remaining companion bearing the shield Alexander had supposedly taken from the grave of Achilles at Troy  another missed cinematic opportunity!As for Alexander's bisexuality I objected to Stone's portrayal of Hephaistion as an eyelinered catamite walking around in billowing robes. Hephaistion was as skilled a warrior as Alexander and a successful commander in his own right. Maybe Stone could not bring himself to accept a deep relationship between two very masculine men.Now I can only hope that the vehicle starring Leonardo diCaprio is produced or HBO gives Alexander the treatment he deserves with a blockbuster miniseries like Band of Brothers.";

Some may love the issues it touches on but be warned you may just find yourself spending far more time than you would ever wish trying to tell everyone you know just how absolutely terrible you thought it was. The actors although mostly multimillion dollar heroes of Hollywood are made to look like children in a bad school play by a uniquely hollow script. Even the apparent historical accuracy which Oliver Stone so readily tells us of is poorly executed and occasionally misleading. The Persian army are not a collection of braindead simpletons running randomly around the field of battle like they're being told to go in two directions at once i mean really Oliver wtf was that opening shot of them all about? To further add to the humour value Colin Farrell's prebattle chat to his generals mostly a collection of modelturnedactor brainless pouters is filled with a marvellous moment when Mr.Farrel lists off every single Greek name of every general in the room and a summary of what they're good at in battle. The scene is so leaden you wonder if Farrell found a copy of Stone's notes on who was supposed to be in the shot and just read them out. It was like bulletpoint history with no character or life. Every second moment in this film heightens it's own tension to the Nth degree as if to cry out to the audience watching BUT LOOK CAN YOU NOT SEE WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE?!? I hardly think Stone's assumption that his film i think moooveee is more accurate plays well with intelligent audiences is anywhere near the truth. I don't know maybe his Mom likes it.

	schema:headline " A muddled story of what could have been an epic";
	schema:reviewBody "Alexander is one of those movies that people either love or hate and while I see a few glimmers of what could have been a great epic in summary it's a mess. I could write a small book about the issues I had with the movie but here's the highlights Alexander's motivation Why did he want to conquer? In Stone's view it was his mother pushing him to be accepted after death by his father to avenge his father to reach the end of the earth and conquer anyone in his way and to unite Asia and Greece. Any of these would have sufficed instead we have too many to see a strong influence. Of them all the uniting of Greece and Asia was perhaps the most profound and the one he most likely was unaware of in real life. A lot of the audience probably didn't know that Babylon was in modern Iraq and Bactria was in Afghanistan. If they had truly been united in one empire the world would be a very different place.Alexander and Hephaestion's relationship Depending on who's talking they were either lovers or the truest of friends. I won't step into the argument over which version was most likely true just that you never really see the two being friends or particularly close until a scene where they start professing their undying....verygoodfriendship to each other. Hephaestion is instead one of many lovers Alexander takes male and female and it was hard to see any real bond between them.Historical trimming Alexander did an awful lot in a short time still Stone left out some parts that were essential such as the untying of the Gordian Knot. Bagoas was a manipulator in Darius's court and a power behind the throne. He was also the only person named as a beloved of Alexander and was eventually suspected of being involved in Philip's murder. Instead Stone presents Bagoas as another pretty face lounging in the harem.General inaccuraciesstupidity In Stone's view of the ancient world Greeks spoke with Irish accents assassins would always stand before their victims and give long and guilty looks and Macedonian kings would casually toss servant boys at their wedding over the table and rape them. I've usually heard that Alexander was dark haired but if Stone wanted to make him blonde why a color that looks deliberately dyed? Who are you supposed to like? True the ancient world was another place where views on sexuality and the male use of eyeliner were seen differently. Stone revels in trying to push these differences in our face many of which are debatable but never gives us characters we identify with or root for. Gladiator took even more liberties with history yet the character of Maximus was very sympathetic. Alexander is presented by Stone as amoral destructive and more than a little weird.Even more ironic is that the story arc of Alexander is despite the trappings incredibly conventional. Boy is born seeming destined for greatness rises high falters loses friends and ends in tragedy. That pretty much describes most of the hero epics out there. If all of us who don't like the persona of Alexander Stone presented just don't get it or aren't open minded enough that's more Stone's failure as a director than our lack of appreciation for his work.".

	onyx:emotionText "Alexander is one of those movies that people either love or hate and while I see a few glimmers of what could have been a great epic in summary it's a mess. I could write a small book about the issues I had with the movie but here's the highlights Alexander's motivation Why did he want to conquer? In Stone's view it was his mother pushing him to be accepted after death by his father to avenge his father to reach the end of the earth and conquer anyone in his way and to unite Asia and Greece. Any of these would have sufficed instead we have too many to see a strong influence. Of them all the uniting of Greece and Asia was perhaps the most profound and the one he most likely was unaware of in real life. A lot of the audience probably didn't know that Babylon was in modern Iraq and Bactria was in Afghanistan. If they had truly been united in one empire the world would be a very different place.Alexander and Hephaestion's relationship Depending on who's talking they were either lovers or the truest of friends. I won't step into the argument over which version was most likely true just that you never really see the two being friends or particularly close until a scene where they start professing their undying....verygoodfriendship to each other. Hephaestion is instead one of many lovers Alexander takes male and female and it was hard to see any real bond between them.Historical trimming Alexander did an awful lot in a short time still Stone left out some parts that were essential such as the untying of the Gordian Knot. Bagoas was a manipulator in Darius's court and a power behind the throne. He was also the only person named as a beloved of Alexander and was eventually suspected of being involved in Philip's murder. Instead Stone presents Bagoas as another pretty face lounging in the harem.General inaccuraciesstupidity In Stone's view of the ancient world Greeks spoke with Irish accents assassins would always stand before their victims and give long and guilty looks and Macedonian kings would casually toss servant boys at their wedding over the table and rape them. I've usually heard that Alexander was dark haired but if Stone wanted to make him blonde why a color that looks deliberately dyed? Who are you supposed to like? True the ancient world was another place where views on sexuality and the male use of eyeliner were seen differently. Stone revels in trying to push these differences in our face many of which are debatable but never gives us characters we identify with or root for. Gladiator took even more liberties with history yet the character of Maximus was very sympathetic. Alexander is presented by Stone as amoral destructive and more than a little weird.Even more ironic is that the story arc of Alexander is despite the trappings incredibly conventional.

The average age of the audience was about 3545 with not too many teens in there. And guess what? Besides the fact that the entire theatre was PACKED there was absolutely not a sound from the audience...like they were breathless. No snickering at blond hair eyeliner sultry looks from Bagoas or any of the things that drew slight laughs when I saw it for the first time. It bolstered my hope that as time goes on and more people see it there will be a more favorable opinion of it. I myself liked the movie a whole lot more the second time around. I watched different things this time...paid more attention to the sets and the other characters behind and around whoever was the primary action of the moment. I listened to the narration more closely and enjoyed the film much more this time.Response from my 20 year old son who wasn't just trying to be nice to his old mom was very positive. He even thought that the assassination scene was fine where it was because it related better to what was going on in Alexander's head at the time. I highly recommend a second at least viewing at a theatre with a very good sound system. I realized I had missed some of the dialogue and narration because the 1st theatre's sound system was horrible.P.S. Kudos to Mr. Stone for his lifetime achievement award in Sweden.

The scenery and sets are very grand and lavish and the costumes are wonderful too. The cinematography editing and symbolism are nice too but strictly speaking they verge on being too flashy and don't add anything.Production values aside everything else simply doesn't work. Vangelis's music is disappointing it does have its epic parts but it overall is too grandiose and overpowering for my liking. The story benefits from a great idea and if explored wonderfully could have given us a thorough insight into Alexander the Great. However the storytelling told in meandering flashback structure is stodgily told and any parts that could have been so interesting are instead superfluously explored especially Alexander and the battlefield and I would say the same for the sketchy characterisation too. The battle scenes are beautifully shot but uncompelling.Alexander also has some pretty dreadful acting which is disappointing considering how good some of the actors are. Colin Farrell tries but is somewhat too effeminate and he does have too many moments where he is not charismatic enough. Angelina Jolie looks beautiful and she actually has given some good performances despite what has been said about her but she being too young is hopelessly miscast as is Val Kilmer while the normally reliablein many cases even wonderful Anthony Hopkins is the only one who gives anything close to a good performance. I was really disappointed at how woefully underused Brian Blessed Christopher Plummer and Rosario Dawson were as well. Worst of the lot is Jared Leto whose acting and presence is so wooden and lifeless it makes a wooden plank much more animated.The acting and superfluous storytelling are big problems but it is nothing compared to the script which is toecurlingly bad. There is also the cumbersome length pedestrian pace and Oliver Stone's direction which is rather pretentiousa term I try to avoid like the plague but the term applies when talking about the direction here.In conclusion it may have great spectacle but there are too many poor assets that made Alexander in all honesty a chore to watch. 210 Betahny Cox".

	schema:headline " An Epic Hubris";
	schema:reviewBody "Viewers who expect an epic display of world conquest will be extremely disappointed in Oliver Stone's Alexander which includes exactly two fairly brief battle sequences in its three hour running time. The film is not about conquest it is an attempt to create a character study of one of history's most selfcontradictory and enigmatic figures.The emphasis however should be on the word attempt. Alexander fails in three basic ways in its cast in its refusal to meet certain character issues headon and in a directorial decision that easily ranks among the most serious misfires in recent memory.Alexander the Great was a charismatic selfcontradictory and enigmatic leader who led and inspired the largest army the world had seen up to that point. He was a battletested killing machine by age sixteen King of Macedonia by twenty conqueror of the known world by thirtyand above all one of the great military geniuses of his or any other age. Colin Farrell plays the character as a weakminded emotionally distraught entity going through the entire film with a series of facial expressions that would lead to believe he is desperate need of a dose of salts. It is completely impossible to accept him in the role.Although Val Kilmer and Angelina Jolie give acceptable if not particularly memorable performances as King Philip and Queen Olympias the remaining performances are equally impossible. Jared Leto's Hephaistion looks for all the world like a Malibu hooker afflicted by an eyeliner addiction it is impossible to perceive him as Alexander's military whip. Franciso Bosch's Bagoas could be an ancientworld version of Cher after a particularly thick night albeit with better cleavage. As for Queen Roxane history notes that she was an unattractive minor tribal princess that Alexander found annoying but whom he married in order to secure military aid from her father. The role however is considerably revised and while Rosario Dawson gives it all she has the part plays like something out of bondage skin flick.During the film's theatrical release some audiences complained that Alexander was portrayed as a homosexual. Unfortunately you cannot offer a psychological portrait of Alexander without indicating his general indifference to women and putting him in bed with at least two men the general Hepaistion and the eunuch and sex slave Bagoas. That is who Alexander was that was what the ancient world was like. But instead of meeting this issue headon the film attempts to indicate the relationships through a series of longing gazes the occasional caress and some of the most embarrassingly bad dialogue ever written for the screen. The resulting relationships read like something off a television soap opera that has been canceled halfway into the first season.For the sexually insecure there is a DVD issue that deletes some eight minutes of this footage although I went with the unedited version and although the scenes in question are very badly done I cannot imagine the deletion of these largely cringeinducing scenes improves the film to any significant degreelargely because virtually everything about the film is no less awkward.The script is at best mediocre and the story line so incoherent that Anthony Hopkins is required to provide constant narrationsomething that has the effect of telling us what happened rather than allowing us to see it happen. But by far the greatest failing of the script and story line is Oliver Stone's decision to present a chunk of the story such as it is out of sequence.In essence the first half hour of the film establishes the trifold conflict between King Philip Queen Olympias and the young Alexander and runs up to a major confrontation. At this point the film suddenly jumps eight years ahead to the invasion of Persia and the jump does not read as intentional but as an outrageous unexpected and disastrous flaw in the film. Approximately two hours later the film presents this lost time in the form of a flashbackbut by this point of the scenes have been lost and we've all figured out the details anyway. Oliver Stone is a master of creating parallel story lines and time lines. One need look no further than JFK to see his skill. It is astonishing utterly astonishing that he could do no better than this and not being able to do better did not find a better way entirely.When all is said and done Alexander is presented as an outofcontrol weakling his psychological motivations are hilariously pat at best and it is utterly impossible to imagine that this person could command such a large force much less lead it to a single victory much less conquer the known world. Clearly Stone was attempting to reach a new height in epic cinema but the Greeks had a word for illadvised ambition founded on a godlike arrogance hubris. It was a sin they believed was never left unpunished and in this instance the punishment is a careercrippling if not entirely careerkilling film.As noted there are several DVD versions including a director's cut that removes approximately fifteen minutes eight of them dealing with Alexander's sexuality. Bonuses include documentaries on the making of the film and on composer Vangelis who scored it as well as an amazingly besidethepoint commentary by director Stone and historian Robin Lane Fox.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

Maybe the most important aspect that in Colin Farrell's portrayal there isn't a hint of greatness. If this was really Alexander he wouldn't have made it into the history books as The Great but as The Queen who wanted to be King. With this I'm not attacking the gay portrayal. That was a fact present in every serious biography of the man. I remember the Robert Rossen version of the story with a moody Richard Burton as Alexander and a great Danielle Darrieux as his mother. The problem there was quite different. We had hints of what made Alexander great but the film was a plodding solemn unexciting little epic. Maybe this is one of those subjects that mere mortals shouldn't attempt. Not even Oliver The Great.".

It would have been a very low budget porn film to use such poor wigs...The film's historical accuracy is better than Stone's version of the Kennedy story but it completely misses in its attempt to capture the true sense of scale and ambition in Alexander's quests. It similarly fails to adequately address the source of that ambition.In summary this film utilises the talents of a dozen or so stars and Colin Farrell millions of dollars of very obvious production costs and is based on one of the most epic stories of individual ambition in the history of the world.

	schema:reviewBody "It seems as if the whole movie was restricted on different levels. Some of it looked totally spontaneous and wild and sometimes it looked totally restricted.The casting was horrendous here and I think it has nothing to do with Stone. Stone said his dream pick was Russell Crowe so then why didn't he get him. Obviously the movie required a big budget so it can't have anything to do with money issues. This probably had to do with Warner Brothers Studios. Despite having a star cast the chemistry between the actors was horrible. Usually Stone does a better job of this. Angelina Jolie played the mother and she is a year younger than Farrell. This probably would not have been so big of a deal if the movie was better. Some of the most basic things were not accomplished in this movie and that probably has to do with in large part of wanting to make good money.The directing if there was any was horrible together with the editing. Everything seemed to be all over the place. No effort seemed to come out of the directing or editing. The battle scenes were horrible not having the slightest idea of what is happening. The writing was OK but nothing special and probably once again restricted.The acting was over the top. Colin Farrell just perfectly describes this. The role of Alexander was too big for him too handle. As previously mentioned before the fact that Farrell was picked for this is a disgrace. Everything in here seemed so over the top and clich that it frustrated me. Especially with all these talented actors.I would not recommend this movie at all. It is clearly influenced by money and sponsors and is a horrible movie to top it off. This was made to make money not be a good film and that just sums everything up here and that is just unlike Stone who didn't write it nor did he produce it. The worst of it though is that there is no point or message whatsoever and that is definitely not like Oliver Stone.".

I'm such a history buff now if a movie isn't true to history it does irritate me a little but I just think it's a movie if it's entertaining give it a break. Trust me Alexander is just a bad movie and is an insult to one of the greatest warriors of our time.Based on the story of Alexander the Great we see him grow as a boy who isn't accepted by his father is admired by his mother and is slowly learning the power of being a king being a strong warrior. His father is murdered leaving him the throne and going into battle to conquer lands own whoever he wants make decisions that will effect his country having to figure out who are his true friends questioning his sexuality discovering the true difficulty of being a good king to his people.I seriously had the neuce around my neck by the end of this film I just couldn't believe how long it was I don't mind long movies at all if they are worth your time and are very well put together but Alexander is just a mess. The film jumps time back and forth and gets you all confused. Not to mention please what the heck was with Angelina Jolie's accent?! Did she watch Bram Stroker's Dracula too much? Believe me I love movies I mean I really love movies I will always say if this movie is meant for a certain crowd but trust me when I say that this just a plain bad movie you'd expect better from Oliver Stone but he went way over his head and really went overboard with Alexander.110".

	schema:headline " Alexander the dud";
	schema:reviewBody "There is a scene between Alexander and his wife Roxanne in which Alexander violently rips off Roxanne's clothes against her will she responds by putting a knife to his throat and things are only resolved when Alexander speaks some gentler words and they end up making passionate love.This no doubt is director Oliver Stone's and his writers view of Western involvement in the middle East from Alexander through the Crusades to Bush and their hopes for the future. The metaphor simplistic and unhistorical as it is may have worked too had this whole scene not been shot as soft porn which tends to undermine its message.Much the same could be said of the whole film an oddly constructed and badly written farrago of ideas mostly nonhistorical. A lot has been made of the homoeroticism but that is somewhat more accurate than many other aspects of the film. Alexander is portrayed as the world's first multiculturalist something which would surprise Arabs who still invoke his name to frighten children even to this day. Stone and his writers are more interested in Alex spouting platitudes about respecting the Persians ancient culture rather than his belief in the superiority of Greece over the barbarians.Alexander's wife Roxanne when she is not required to do full frontals contributes very little to the film apart from a few pouty looks. Since the story is light on females Alex's mother played by Angelina Jolie is drafted in her contribution being to read a few letters written to Alex from Macedonia. It sounds unconvincing and it is.Jolie speaks in an odd Russian accent for some unexplained reason and the whole matter of accents in this film is a strange one. The Macedonians are all Irish and the Greeks English. This is surprising but not the worst sin in this film.The main narrative thread is given to Anthony Hopkins to read in a an unconvincing voice over.

A small point but one among very many which leaves you to ask why the director has made the decisions he has.Despite all these devices the film is still inordinately long and slow rather like the constant snake imagery used through out and which is clearly meant to be a metaphor for something. but what?It is not surprising given such a duff script that the actors are reduced to giving a lot of meaningful looks reminiscent of daytime soapoperas.

	onyx:emotionText "There is a scene between Alexander and his wife Roxanne in which Alexander violently rips off Roxanne's clothes against her will she responds by putting a knife to his throat and things are only resolved when Alexander speaks some gentler words and they end up making passionate love.This no doubt is director Oliver Stone's and his writers view of Western involvement in the middle East from Alexander through the Crusades to Bush and their hopes for the future. The metaphor simplistic and unhistorical as it is may have worked too had this whole scene not been shot as soft porn which tends to undermine its message.Much the same could be said of the whole film an oddly constructed and badly written farrago of ideas mostly nonhistorical. A lot has been made of the homoeroticism but that is somewhat more accurate than many other aspects of the film. Alexander is portrayed as the world's first multiculturalist something which would surprise Arabs who still invoke his name to frighten children even to this day. Stone and his writers are more interested in Alex spouting platitudes about respecting the Persians ancient culture rather than his belief in the superiority of Greece over the barbarians.Alexander's wife Roxanne when she is not required to do full frontals contributes very little to the film apart from a few pouty looks. Since the story is light on females Alex's mother played by Angelina Jolie is drafted in her contribution being to read a few letters written to Alex from Macedonia. It sounds unconvincing and it is.Jolie speaks in an odd Russian accent for some unexplained reason and the whole matter of accents in this film is a strange one. The Macedonians are all Irish and the Greeks English. This is surprising but not the worst sin in this film.The main narrative thread is given to Anthony Hopkins to read in a an unconvincing voice over. This seems more designed to paper over awkward historical facts than to be organically part of the film.

I mean sitting through all three hours of the director's cut the best I could come up with was that it's cool to conquer the world. Alexander the Great's feats make for impressive history books but the movie seems as shallow as the Hollywood setting it spawns from because of so little selfsacrifice and true meaning to Alexander's life. I guess I should give Oliver Stone some props for sticking with historical fact and giving Alexander a feminine male friend but I admit my 21st century American bias made it difficult to accept that a man who led thousands of brave soldiers also enjoyed having his nails manicured by transvestites. Speaking of Oliver Stone I think the biggest lesson of this movie is to stay off drugs. Stone made notorious headlines lately for his many drug escapades and after watching classics like Platoon and Wall Street and then viewing his contemporary stuff such as Alexander it makes me realize that too many drugs will affect any brilliant mind.".

	schema:reviewBody "So here it is the landmark film which ushered in the Nouvelle Vague introduced Francois Truffaut and his screen persona Antoine Doinel to the world and changed the direction of cinema for ever.  And an impressive piece of work it is too.     By 1959 the process of filmmaking had atrophied artistically at any rate.  Stale and stagey artifice was the norm and for the upcoming generation of filmmakers and critics Truffaut was both a new way of conceiving cinematic art had to be found.  In this his feature film debut Truffaut found it.     This is cinema verite at its freshest and best.  The film looks like a documentary and absolutely drips with kitchensink candour.  A handheld camera follows Antoine around his parents' flat and we get to peer in on the grimy cramped and ohsoordinary minutiae of a humble little life.  Don't forget the garbage Antoine is repeatedly told and Truffaut certainly doesn't.  He pulls off with resounding success the seemingly impossible feat of making the mundane seem entirely absorbing.     C'est peutetre un question de glandes suggests a teacher as we see the adolescent Antoine go quietly off the rails.  Paris or more accurately that part of Paris bounded by Montmartre and the Gare du Nord is wintry and stark the unlovely and prosaic environment in which Antoine functions  or fails to function.  Truffaut wants inter alia to deflate the April In Paris myth so virulent in the 1950's.  He succeeds mightily.  Antoine is disaffected.  Parents home and school are all inhospitable and the sleety foggy streets south of Pigalle convey Antoine's alienation admirably.     Deadpan humour is a powerful weapon in Truffaut's armoury.  Antoine's inept noteforging the outlandish excuse which he gives for his absence and his longsuffering look during his mother's reminiscences are all nicely done and raise a chuckle.  The bird'seye view of the P.T. class shot with a rooftop camera conveys wordlessly the comedy of the rapidly diminishing line of pupils.     A punch and judy show is filmed from inside the performance canopy looking out onto the audience of small children.  Their total lack of artifice is delightful to see and underscores Truffaut's point  candour is beautiful staginess is unacceptable.  As Antoine's father frogmarches him along the street after the typewriter debacle bemused passersby stop to stare at the camera.  Not only is this disarmingly honest it is also profound.  Cinema should exist as it were inside the camera not in elaborate sets.  Antoine rides in the spinning drum at the fairground the camera fixed rigidly on him allowing the onlookers to dissolve into an undistinguished blur.  The camera IS Antoine's subjective self.     The performance of 15yearold JeanPierre Leaud as Antoine is astonishingly good.  He is natural and engaging and his soliloquy delivered to the psychologist seems an incredible piece of work for so young an actor.     A long long tracking shot accompanies Antoine as he runs away from it all and is intended to convey by the very rhythm of his breathing the internal subjectivity of a child who has been let down by his parents and his society.  The final freezeframe with no histrionic fireworks no resounding words and no tidy denouement closes the film on a note of immense emotional power.  Antoine is alone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Every day life however 'real' and gritty it may be is rarely portrayed on film and was certainly a rarity in the 1950's. In Europe however there was a movement in filmmaking that embraced this realism and searched for the deeper meaning in the 'here and now'. This is about the most basic and miniscule portion of the meaning behind the French New Wave of the 1950's  films that explored the filmmaker's surroundings and eventually became an inspiration for filmmakers around the world. Francois Truffaut's 'The 400 Blows' is one of the most wellknown films of this movement and has been embraced and hailed as one of the greatest films of all time.After viewing Truffaut's 'The 400 Blows' I have been ruminating over the deeper meaning behind his story of Antoine Doinel a 14 year old boy in Paris who is having trouble in school and trouble at home. In school he is marginalized as a troublemaker yet it is obvious that it is more a matter of him causing trouble by expressing himself creatively rather than following along with mundane assignments. At home Doinel has to deal with an adulterous mother who only pays attention to him when it suits her needs and a father who is barely present. Doinel responds by doing the only thing he feels he can do and that is by acting up eventually earning an expulsion from school and being sent to a juvenile prison camp by his parents. Nothing is cut and dry in 'The 400 Blows'. If one were to take the film at face value there would be a 'so what' feeling. What the film subtly explores is the disenfranchisement of youth. There is no joy in Doinel's life  anytime he tries to express himself creatively or acts up in a playful way he is shot down and metaphorically forced back into line. This is not a typical Paris street kid either this is one who reads Balzac for pleasure and conveys intense emotion. The problem is that no one is there to notice or care. Another aspect of the French New Wave was that the films were not merely a product of a Hollywood factory these were intensely personal films to the writers and directors. In the case of 'The 400 Blows' it is certain that Doinel is based on Truffaut himself only 28 when he made the film. Truffaut's cinematography in 'The 400 Blows' is exquisite. We see a Paris that is not in Technicolor with colorful fountains like 'An American in Paris'. This is Paris from a Parisian's perspective  and the difference is breathtaking and intense. These are not Louis XVI style houses they are tiny flats where people have to sleep in closets and walk up and down six flights of stairs. The city views are those of a native Parisian  the kind of tour one would get if they asked the average Parisian for nontourist attractions.There is still a lot that I have to learn and think about 'The 400 Blows' and French New Wave in general but with the minute amount of understanding I have of it I found it to be an intense film one that left me emotional and craving enlightenment. Rarely is there a film that leaves that kind of impact on me but Truffaut managed to leave me speechless and deep in thought with 'The Four Hundred Blows'.Shel".

Ignored and neglected by his parents his relationship with his mother is further strained when he discovers that she has taken a secret lover. Added to this his school teachers have written him off as a trouble maker and with luck seemingly never on his side it is Antoine who ends up getting the blame for bad behaviour. Finding refuge only in his love of cinema Antoine soon finds it necessary to break free and discover what the world can offer outside the confines of everyday life. I have always struggled with the labeling of this film as one of the pivotal entrances in the Nouvelle Vague. Since JeanLuc Godard's Au Bout de Souffl who uses a completely different approach to filmmaking with his restless jumpcutting and endless references to pop culture Truffaut presents his case clear cut as realistic as possible. But this was something completely different from the way American films portrayed juvenile delinquency so far. No iconic trouble makers like James Dean or Marlon Brando just a realistic portrait of a twelveyear old boy sliding into isolation. The very idea alone was something novel seldom depicted in a way like this. Much of the praise must go to JeanPierre Laud who never even seems to be acting. His every movement thought expression come across as completely natural. Truly one of the most remarkable performances of such a young actor I've ever seen. Watching this over 40 years after it was made it all looks deceptively simple with Truffaut's perfect integration of music and image location shooting on the streets of Paris and the naturalistic performances. Truffaut used many innovations but they are not easily noticeable as in Godard's work. This was for instance the first French film to be shot in widescreen aspect ratio 2.351 which required much planning on Truffaut's part with some surprising results. In many scenes we don't see the other person Antoine is talking to which gives the viewer the illusion as if Antoine is almost talking directly to the camera. JeanPierre Laud would continue his role as Antoine in four more films by Truffaut Love at Twenty 1962 Stolen Kisses 1968 Bed and Board 1970 and Love on the Run 1979.Camera Obscura  910".

	schema:reviewBody "Les quatrecents coups is the film that opens up the New Wave movement. I think many of the characteristics of the New Wave as pointed out in class can be inferred form the differences between the last film we saw in class Carn's Les enfants du paradis and this work by Truffaut real life situations no sets everyday people. I have found in Les quatrecents coups a brand new refreshing and overwhelming cinema. But Les quatrecents coups is also a dense complicated film. Its autobiographical character makes it an encyclopedia of personal feelings opinions and nuances of an introspection by Truffaut.Technically the main differences between Truffaut and the previous cinema is the use of camera movements and angles. Although Renoir had made a witty and fresh use of traveling and long takes Truffaut masters this technique as anyone else does. The camera moves smoothly it nearly swings or floats from angle to angle following an action as if the spectator was a ghost amid real life. Truffaut enjoys playing around with the camera extremely long takes as we have never seen in any of the previous films some of them in the classroom other in Antoine's friend house or a magnificent take at the end of the film in which we see Antoine then a panoramic view and then Antoine again running towards the sea. He also shoots from impossible angles like those at the beginning from below the Tour Eiffel or the nearly zenithal take following the jogging students in the streets. Or he teases us with the fake black out when Antoine goes down the stairs to throw away garbage. Or shows us inner feelings through closeups the scene in which Antoine lies to his father telling him he did not take his map.However I think that the most important difference between previous films and this one is the treatment of action. Truffaut is an observer a photographer of soul. He takes a fiendish delight in shooting casual long scenes the boy tearing away his notebook pages the whole sequence of Antoine's arrival at his empty home is excellent the three reflexes in his mother's mirror in which she will look afterwards or Antoine combing his hair laying the table. Also the spinning ride or the long traveling following the escape of Antoine. They are long but not slow. They keep tension up as if everyday acts and decisions could be heroic and transmit the greatest interest and attraction. It looks like a documentary on human life! Some comments could be made about Antoine Doinel alter ego of Truffaut. He is a very complicated character. The most curious thing about him is that he behaves like an adult he acts walks and talks like a man especially if we compare him to his teachers or his father! However at some times I think Truffaut describes himself as being not too witty remember the candle in the hole on the wall or how his friend convinces him to steal the typewriter and then makes him give it back or how he innocently copies a whole paragraph from Balzac. He wants to be an artist but he is not not yet. This lack of wit and fatality he is caught but everyone around him cheats as he does leads him to a rebellion that grows stronger and stronger. This explain why he is such a rebel and not his friend or the other children in the class who live in the same social group.The main topic in Les quatrecents coups is the quest for freedom but not in the way Renoir  looked at it in fact is closer to L'Atalante by Vigo than to Renoir's La grande illusion for example. Renoir is more concerned by social struggle and the liberty of the people. But Truffaut is more introspective more intimate indeed this film is the description of life attitude of an independent spirit through the autobiographical look of the author this is cinma d'auteur. We can find many elements from Truffaut's life in the film a difficult family situation problems at school the Army etc. These elements will appear throughout the film. Antoine alter ego of Truffaut lives in the school in his house in the streets and finally in the juvenile detention center. In each one of these places he will find adverse situations he will have to overcome.The school The school is the first oppressing environment for Antoine. At the very beginning he is caught by chance with a pinup calendar. This fatality will be recalled in Antoine's life later or when he is caught by the porter giving the typewriter back having been his friend's idea to steal it. He is a rebel and nothing will refrain him from being so. He is punished and he misbehaves again writing in the wall an inspired poem. The school is the only place in which Truffaut makes a little bit of criticism in this case against the education system the three teachers are either cruel the French teacher or stupid the English and Physical Education teachers.The house The house situation might be similar to that lived by Truffaut in real life. Her mother a beautiful egocentric and unscrupulous woman sometimes sad and old looking who hates him. At the end of the film we discover that she did not want that child. This hatred and the attitude of his father a smiley and cheerful but weak man will add to the necessity of Antoine to flee. Truffaut gives us a Freudian wink when his teacher asks him why he missed school Antoine will sharply answer 'My mom died!'The streets In the streets Antoine will find freedom challenge adulthood but also perversion he becomes a man in a 13year old boy body little by little. But he will also become a criminal together with his friend they will climb up in the scale of crime. He first skips classes. He and his friend stroll around the city innocently. Then they begin an adult abnormally rebel behavior they make cars stop in the middle of the street for example. The spinning ride is one of the few symbolic images in the film that is another difference with Vigo and Renoir filmmaking. The scene of Antoine trying without success to fight against centrifuge force in a mad spinning trip really shocked me he fights against reality and he is suffering but he also has fun in it. Afterwards he leaves home. . He will learn about solitude and indeed not a single word is heard in a long sequence. I really enjoyed the long silent scene of the milk robbery. Antoine runs outlaw like an animal we can feel loneliness cold hunger sleepiness. It is another of those long slow but at the same time agile scenes about casual acts drinking a bottle of milk. At the end the streets will make him a criminal. From the moment he is caught on he is not treated as a child anymore. He wants to be an adult and a spell will sort of be cast on him he will be treated as such. It is significant when he is caught by the porter. He is told not to take off the hat which made him look like an adult. From then on he is treated roughly as if he was a man especially in the police station.The prison And finally he arrives at the prison which I think is the climax of oppression we must remember the comparisons to the Army Truffaut detests. It is maybe the simplest of the scenarios he find himself facing what he hates with no other possibility. The ending is a sublime anticlimax. After being punished for eating the bread Antoine goes on 'normal' life within the detention center he visits the psychologist an ultimate introspection by Truffaut receives his mother and talk to his new friends and plays soccer. And suddenly when we least expect it he flees. He runs runs runs the longest run I have ever seen and the most exciting. He reaches the sea his dream and a symbol for eternity and absolute in poetry. He splashes into the water he stops and looks back the first time he looks right into the camera. This has got undoubtedly a deep and very personal meaning that maybe only the author knows. It is a pessimistic or an optimistic ending? I think it is above all an outofthisworld ending. If the simple presence of the sea Antoine's object of liberty is overwhelming for the spectator how should the character feel? I really liked the final traveling we follow Antoine's run over the sand but the camera is facing the inland we are waiting to see the sea as much as Antoine is waiting to wet his feet. I do not really think that he is deceived although his look into the camera is ambiguous. I think he stares at the spectator because he has realized what the truth is the character is now out of the film. And the truth for him I think is this I can reach freedom whenever I want but absolute freedom is impossible to achieve. He is staring at us but he is also looking back with a grave look he might have seen his pursuer in the distance.".

	schema:reviewBody "In viewing Franois Truffaut's The 400 Blows for perhaps the fifth time I finally began to realize its true greatness. Inspired by the director's childhood The 400 Blows Truffaut's first film is primarily about a young boy growing up with his mother and stepfather in Paris and apparently heading into a life of crime. Most adults see the boy as a troublemaker but in the film he is meant to be the protagonist.Antoine Doinel JeanPierre Laud is the boy's name. He is resourceful quiet and does what he can to get by. At home he has a struggling relationship with his parents especially his mother. She is a woman of curious interests always distracted by her incommodious son and a secret affair with a man from her job. Antoine's stepfather appears nice enough while treating his son as an equal in a good manner although he is not really attached to him. However both parents share common traits they are away from home quite a bit and do not pay close enough attention to their son. Sadly enough they only judge him by his behavior and by reports they get from other people.At school Antoine's teacher classifies him as a menacing troublemaker. Not that it is entirely Antoine's fault he just has terrible luck. In the opening scene of the film we see a poster with a halfnaked woman on the front being passed around quietly by the students. The teacher is sitting at his desk with his head down grading papers until the poster comes to Antoine and he finds it. He sends Antoine to the corner of the room where he writes a note of resentment on the wall. As punishment for that he is to diagram the exact words that he wrote. At home that night Antoine's homework is interrupted. Because he did not complete it his good friend Ren convinces him to skip school the next day although Antoine is reluctant at first. They walk around France and notice Antoine's mother kissing a man that is not her husband. She and her son make eye contact but Ren assures his friend that everything will be alright. The next morning as the boys return to school Antoine lies to his teacher and says the reason he missed school was that his mother died. Everything is alright until his mother furious arrives at school and her son is immediately identified as a liar.And yet we see Antoine alone at home in some private subtle and hopeful moments. One of them being his love for Balzac. He adores him and we see him reading his biography and lighting a candle in a shrine in his honor at home. One day at school the students are proposed to write an essay on an important event in their life and Antoine chooses the topic of his grandfather's death in which he incorporates a phrase from his Balzac book. Alas the teacher identifies this as plagiarism and sends Antoine out of the classroom along with Ren. The two boys stay at Ren's house for quite some time living up to the expectations of a life of crime until they steal a typewriter leaving Antoine caught trying to return it. He is later sent to a juvenile delinquent detention home.The 400 Blows is not meant to be a tragedy. Rather it is a character study following Antoine Doinel's life and decisions he makes as a direct result of the many things going on in it. Even The 400 Blows captures a few moments of happiness joy. One of these is a priceless sequence in which a gym teacher is leading Antoine's class for a jog through Paris not realizing that the boys are peeling off and running away two by two. There is another scene after Antoine's shrine for Balzac catches on fire and his parents are stressing and yelling at him. His mother suggests an outing to a movie theater where they end up going. After the film we see the trio in the car laughing and reflecting on what they had seen. We see this as a moment of hope for Antoine and his family for this being the only time they are all happy together.There are many poignant moments however emerging late in the film after Antoine is caught for stealing the typewriter. His father is fed up with his behavior and escorts him to a police station where he is sent to a jail cell and later in a police wagon full of prostitutes and thieves with his face peering through the bars full of tears. His parents discuss with the authorities that they cannot not take him back because they believe he will only run away again. So in turn their son is taken to the juvenile delinquent school. These sequences express a reality of Antoine's life in tune with the outcome of himself. He remains quiet and reserved towards the end of the film as if he has nothing to say. The story of Antoine Doinel and his many experiences allow a life to be filled with curiosity and exploration. Every second of the ninetynine minutes of the film is not wasted. Truffaut allows every minute to be overflowing with creativity while still maintaining the central story of the protagonist. It is not a film that can be taken lightly as a family movie to be watched every Saturday night. It is a film to be given plenty of thought carefully examined and given a conclusion. The genius of the film does not rely on that moreover it relies on how much is put into the film. Down to the smallest detail the film is able to maneuver and progress. The story contains elements of sadness regret family warmth happiness humor values and choices. Just like life itself.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Four Hundred Blows is the semiautobiographical story of Antoine Doinel a boy trapped in a life of contemtptuous authority who turns to outward rebellion.  Truffaut shows his mastery of the cinema in this his freshman attempt.The film is perfectly cast with Dionel relaying neutral facial expressions for the majority of the film.  The boy although not necessarily evoking sympathy from the audience definitely evokes empathy.

	schema:headline " Deserved Truffaut Classic Benefits Significantly from Criterion's New DVD Package";
	schema:reviewBody "As the seminal work of the French New Wave the 1959 directorial debut of 27year old Francois Truffaut has such a vaunted reputation that the final film is bound to disappoint. However the pristine print that comes with the new Criterion Collection DVD really makes me realize what a brave and emotionally resonant film he made ostensibly about his own troubled adolescence. It's worth seeing twice  once for the film itself and a second time to listen to the newly recorded commentary by Truffaut's childhood friend Robert Lachenay the truelife inspiration for Rene in the film. Speaking in French but subtitled in English he provides insights into the story and context of the film that no film scholar or even production associate could possibly provide. As a point of comparison listen to the bythenumbers commentary by film scholar Brian Stonehill recorded back in 1992 which is thoughtful and well researched but devoid of the human factor.The film's title comes from a French colloquialism that translates into raising hell an appropriate reference since the story focuses on a thirteenyear old hellion named Antoine living in a poor section of Paris and neglected by parents downright arrogant in their dysfunctional nature. Antoine consequently lives a street urchin's life as he lies to people in authority  his parents his teachers and the police  since he admits rather sadly that the truth doesn't make any difference. Truffaut tracks Antoine's life through a series of dispiriting episodes that ultimately lead him to be sent away to a reformatory after he gets caught returning a stolen typewriter and his mother and stepfather tire of their responsibility over him. To Truffaut's immense credit the film feels stark and naturalistic without resorting to dramatic manipulation and he finds the ideal Antoine in JeanPierre Leaud who brings out the confusion angst and wandering attention of his character in realistic terms. He is especially impressive in an apparently improvised scene where he is interviewed by the school authorities about why his life has come to this. It is heartbreaking to see how bleak his life becomes yet Leaud imbues the incorrigible often intolerable side of Antoine with fervor.There are several interesting extras included with the 2006 DVD package starting with two separate interviews with Truffaut the first a year after the film's release discussing he film's impact and the second five years later when we see the filmmaker in a more reflective mood about his cinematic influences. Leaud is featured in 16mm screen test footage where his naturally ebullient personality emerges and then after the 1959 Cannes Film Festival where puberty has apparently kicked in and then in 1965 as a comparatively reserved twentyyear old. The screen test of Richard Kanayan who has a minor role as a schoolmate is amusing for his Satchmoinspired rendition of When the Saints Go Marching In and his eerie resemblance to Fantasy Island's Tattoo Herve Villechaize. Be forewarned that the film is relentlessly downbeat but Truffaut's emotional investment and consummate abilities as a filmmaker even at this stage of his career make this essential viewing.".

It stands out from most other movies about troubled youths both in the way that it portrays the main character and in making such good use of seemingly minor events in showing how they shape Antoine's life.As Antoine JeanPierre Laud in the role with which he would always be identified strikes a nice balance in making his character come to life without making any of his actions seem forced or overdramatic. Truffaut sets things up for him perfectly by presenting a great variety of situations in his life that allow Antoine's character to come out naturally. Many of the settings are in themselves interesting and creative despite being located in familiar types of places.The story is written carefully so as to allow the viewer to identify with and sympathize with Antoine while still seeing his faults clearly. What is often the most affecting thing about it is the way that Truffaut shows how even the most commonplace kinds of events can have such an effect on a maturing person if they are a source of disappointed expectations or misunderstood intentions. To make this kind of movie so effectively without relying on violent or shocking material is an admirable achievement and it repays careful thought and attention while watching it.".

The script is fairly loose and strives for realism above all else.Enforcing Truffaut's aim of realism is the group of actors that he assembled. Laud indisputably carries the film at once delivering an authentic performance while also showing a maturity beyond his years. While not quite as impressive the supporting cast is nevertheless uniformly solid perhaps none moreso than Guy Decomble as Antoine's antagonist at school.Truffaut's direction is exceedingly wellhandled not to mention impressive for a debut feature. The film also sports attractive cinematography and a lively score by Jean Constantin.Indeed the film can scarcely be faulted for any flaw in its construction or execution.

He takes it upon himself to run away from home for little reason and when returning steals money and other objects.Firstly there is not one character to sympathize with. Antoine was clearly someone to feel sympathy for but who feels sympathy for someone who skips school only to arrive the next day and say his mother died. I couldn't see him as anything other than a petty criminal who couldn't take the punishment he was given.Then there are parts of this movie that are just weird in terms of action and reaction. If a child almost burns down your house by accident what would be a logical move? a punish the kid and move the matches to a place where he couldn't find them or b go watch a movie at the cinema. If you thought a then you would be wrong. I know they're negligent but this is just ridiculous.So that is the 400 Blows. In my eyes it is not a good movie but in most others it is a classic. If you want to watch it then that is fine. If you have a problem with stuff like what I said above then don't watch it.".

However it was mostly the way the film was shot that ruined it for me. It's full of long metaphoric unimportant shots that really just confused me rather than appealed to me. I often wondered just when is Truffaut going to end this overlylong shot not out of suspense but out of frustrated boredom. Overall it's a simple sad story that will leave you sad and confused. I respect it for it's craftsmenship but it's not even remotely entertaining or thoughtprovoking. I'm sure people would accuse me for being shallow but this is an honest opinion and I have studied and read about this film. I have thought much about it and I'm still of the same opinion.".

It is a magnet  wherever you go you move towards it  and a totem.  This sequence is transposed later when Antoine goes to the funfair and rides on one of those moving cylinders like a zoetrope.  The comparison is deliberate  Truffaut is situating his film in film history declaring his intention to start again to get back to first principles to a time when moving pictures was a medium of possibility before it was bogged down by genre and the studio system.  this zoetrope has a transformative power  it takes a character from neorealism and abstracts him turning him into a figure in a Grand Guignol crawling in eternal circles.  But from his point of view it completely transforms the outside world from a thing of oppressive solidity content to stare in powerful distance to a formless unstable mass.  This sequence crystallises the power of Truffaut's film its freedom and its concern with entrapment.  It charts the decline into imprisonment of its main character with a style of buoyant liberation.  So while Antoine is trapped in this barrel he is also offered a new way of looking beyond those merely content to look on from the outside.'The 400 Blows' is the first masterpiece of the nouvelle vague that iconoclastic movement that briefly saved cinema from stagnation as an artform just as it declared that it was an artform hmm a connection?. It's a cliche now that Truffaut was the least innovative of the New Wavers and yet it's still surprising that a film built so classically moving from Paris to the countryside balancing the opening school scene with its barred doors with the closing borstal scene etc. still achieves that tingling spontaneity so rare in the cinema e.g. JeanPierre Leaud as an actor laughing with the crew as Albert Remy breaks an egg.  The first viewing of '400' is such a rush you'd be forgiven for thinking that it like 'A Bout de souffle' was made up on the spot and it is only on subsequent viewings that you marvel at Truffaut's formal control the rhythm of his camera movements and editing the consideration of his compositions. That image of spinning round a fixed pole is the one that haunts me.  Just as the decline of Michel Poiccard in the Truffautscripted 'A Bout de souffle' is figured as a car running out of steam so Antoine is forever running in circles brought back to a fixed point having gotten nowhere. To move is to live  that is why the final freezeframe is so frightening Antoine has usurped the Eiffel Tower has become the centre of the spinning top  he dominates the closing frame just as the opening ones were empty of humans.  But at what cost?  has he simply wound down into inertia? the subsequent Doinel films would suggest so.  that closing beach scene in which Antoine seems to be running against moving phosphorescent sand also alludes to another great work about a young artist and his city Joyce's 'Ulysses' and its chapter 'Proteus'Although the film rarely shoots directly from his point of view the style is an exuberant expression of Antoine's sensibility.  Antoine is ambisexual still seeking his identity just before seeking sexuality  early on he sits at his mother's dressing table his face splintered by the triptych mirrors later he steals supplies from the ladies' toilet.  This embodying of subjectivity in objective style is what saves the closing third from de Sicalike sentimentality and manipulation we are rarely outside Antoine's head people are wonderful or horrible as he experiences them.  Only twice is his sensibility intruded on  when he is caught bringing back the typewriter the captor creeping his point of view and the interview with the faceless psychologist at the borstal filmed as if behind a doublesided mirror the feral animal penned at last.'The 400 blows' is revered as a moving melancholy picture of misdirected adolescence.  It is sometimes forgotten that most of the film is pure comedy delighting in gags digressions bits of business.  For much of the running time you envy Antoine  what joy it must be to be young and in Paris swashbuckling in the schoolyard truanting in the city smoking cigars his family situation is no worse that most at least he has friends a roof over his head and can read Balzac. Antoine is a bit of a clown all clowns eventually settle down make the right choices at crucial moments in their lives.  Antoine somehow misses those rarely visible choices and finds himself locked up descending the various levels of institutional hell.  His often amiable andor witty parents are no more evil than he is a saint although an educational system that asks kids to simply copy down 'great' poems a Sisyphean task in one inkblotted case is clearly wrong.  Georges Delerue's score  romantic exuberant tragic bittersweet  ranks with the three greats 'Vertigo' 'Taxi Driver' 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'.".

It is a depressing picture of a twelveyearold boy who is trapped by parents and teachers by public school and by reform school.  An American film about this subject in 1959the year of this filmwould either have tried to squeeze a tear from the audience's eye or would have tried to arouse the audience to action and would have been presented to the audience as a sensational expose of juvenile delinquency.  This film just presents its story in a straightforward objective sliceoflife manner.  I think that's why it's so depressing.Since I know Truffaut is a fan of Hitchcock I thought some of the narrative line might have grown out of an episode Hitchcock often relatedhow his father had him locked up in jail overnight as a youth to teach him a lesson.I feel this film is worth more as an historical item than as entertainment. For this reason it should be taught in film courses and will have a certain impact on young firsttime viewers.  Historically it's important 1 as a film that helped form the French New Wave 2 because Truffaut went on to become an important film director and this film is autobiographical 3 as the first of the Antoine Doinel series Doinel being a cinematic semiautobiographical figure for Truffaut.  Actually I have been bored to varying degrees by all the Doinel films and find JeanPierre Leaud who plays Doniel in The 400 Blows as well as the other films in the series to be a nincompoop.The technique in this film is very like the Italian neorealist films especially a film like Open City.  It's shot in lowcontrast black and white it's shot in actual locations around Paris it presents a slice of life.Despite all I've written above I've seen many Truffaut films that I've liked very much Shoot the Piano Player Jules and Jim The Soft Skin The Bride Wore Black Mississippi Mermaid complete version The Woman Next Door among others but not the Antoine Doniel films.".

Perhaps it's also due to the fact that it is of course being placed in a totally different time period at also a different country and culture but personally I couldn't really place myself in his shoes because throughout the movie he's doing some things that I can't see myself ever doing or saying to someone.But this is perhaps also one of the powers of the movie at the same time. It's not showing things and people as just black and white good or bad but it more shows that nobody is truly a good or a bad person. Sometimes it are certain circumstances that force us to do things in order to 'survive' in this world. Whether or not you like it you sometimes have to do things you know you're later going to regret.In that regard this is a quite good random slice of life or a coming of age movie. You could take the movie both these ways really since it for a change is a movie that entirely focuses on its young main character and tells the entire story from his perspective. It's an original but also risky approach to the genre that in this case did work out also really thanks to JeanPierre Laud who plays the young boy.So it all in all really remains a well put together movie by Franois Truffaut that just didn't really ever got to me at a more emotional level. Extra praise should be send Truffaut's way though since this movie actually was his first full length movie and he made at a quite a young age as well. Definitely not a bad first movie by him though thankfully still he and his movies grew better over the years.710httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "The Four Hundred Blows Quatre cents coups Les   .  1959 French R 94 min Directed and cowritten by Franois Truffaut with JeanPierre Laud Claire Maurier Albert Rmy. The Four Hundred Blows' is idiomatic French for raising hell.  Which I found to be a strange title after someone explained the meaning.  No one in this movie is really raising hell nor forcing hell on others.  Antoine Doinel Laud is a 14 yearold Parisian boy and a superficial view of his life is not idyllic but hardly hellish. His mom Maurier isn't the most attentive person in the world.  She is busy with a lot of things besides being a mom.  She has a lover a fact about his mom that isn't a point of pride with Antoine.  Antoine has a stepfather Rmy.  Again not the most attentive of parents.  Antoine isn't a good student.  All in all it's not the easiest of lives but nothing worth raising hell about.  And the hell he raises isn't that big a deal.  He skips school.  He gets caught stealing a typewriter.  Actually he gets caught returning the typewriter when he finds out he can't fence it.  Antoine ends up in a reformatory and escapes ending up on the shores of the North Sea. In what has become a relatively famous scene from French cinema Antoine turns back from the sea and looks straight into the camera. What's intriguing and very good about The Four Hundred Blows' is Truffaut's story telling techniques.  It is a very straightforward telling of a few events.  The camera often holds on a subject for a very long time.  In one scene a police or school psychiatrist is questioning Antoine and the camera never moves from his face. Truffaut is very matter of fact about the events of Antoine life.  There are no really bad people in Antoine's life.  It doesn't seem overly traumatic that he skips school sees his mother with her lover or that his parents agree to send him to a reform school.  In the final scene on the shores of the North Sea we see a confused and sad young kid.  Is he going to lead a life of raising hell a life of stifling boredom or will he accomplish greatness?  Truffaut doesn't tell us and it made me want to see the sequel.  Luckily Truffaut didn't stop with The Four Hundred Blows.' Love at Twenty' Stolen Kisses' Bed and Board' and Love on the Run' continue this semiautobiographical story of the young Parisian.The Four Hundred Blows' is available on video.  I recommend you rent it.".

And the hell he raises isn't that big a deal.  He skips school.  He gets caught stealing a typewriter.  Actually he gets caught returning the typewriter when he finds out he can't fence it.  Antoine ends up in a reformatory and escapes ending up on the shores of the North Sea. In what has become a relatively famous scene from French cinema Antoine turns back from the sea and looks straight into the camera. What's intriguing and very good about The Four Hundred Blows' is Truffaut's story telling techniques.  It is a very straightforward telling of a few events.  The camera often holds on a subject for a very long time.  In one scene a police or school psychiatrist is questioning Antoine and the camera never moves from his face. Truffaut is very matter of fact about the events of Antoine life.  There are no really bad people in Antoine's life.  It doesn't seem overly traumatic that he skips school sees his mother with her lover or that his parents agree to send him to a reform school.  In the final scene on the shores of the North Sea we see a confused and sad young kid.  Is he going to lead a life of raising hell a life of stifling boredom or will he accomplish greatness?  Truffaut doesn't tell us and it made me want to see the sequel.  Luckily Truffaut didn't stop with The Four Hundred Blows.' Love at Twenty' Stolen Kisses' Bed and Board' and Love on the Run' continue this semiautobiographical story of the young Parisian.The Four Hundred Blows' is available on video.  I recommend you rent it.";

	schema:reviewBody "The title of the film is The 400 Blows but its actually an expression for 'Raising Hell.'Made in 1959 in a cinema verite style. This is the full screen debut of Francois Truffaut and an example of the French New Wave. It was a critical hit.JeanPierre Leaud plays Antoine Doinel a misunderstood teenager in Paris who constantly gets into trouble at school and an at home. Doinel is based partly on Truffaut himself.Doinel finds school boring does not get on with his teachers who usually catch him telling lies including an embarrassing one where in a panic he tells that one of his parent has died. At home he is alone a lot as both parents are working. His glamorous mother Claire Maurier seems to have little time for him. He gets on better with his father Albert Remy who is more playful but as the film progresses he is actually the stepfather and you also learn that his mother is having an affair. Doinel wants love but his step father seems too weak he suspects his wife is cheating his mother too busy but he seems happiest when she does give him attention such as towelling him down after a bath.Doinel and his best friend Rene get into all sorts of scrapes and petty crime. Several times Doinel runs away from home and sleeps rough. He gets caught stealing a typewriter from his stepfather's workplace and comes into the attention of the police social services and the judiciary. At the end he is sent to a young offender's institute that he also runs away from and onto a beach to what looks like an uncertain future.However Truffaut would revisit Doinel over the course of his directing career.Watching this film it becomes apparent how much this influenced the British New Wave in the 1960s. So much of this film reminded me of Kes by Ken Loach with its naturalistic acting styles. Just look at the mischievous scene where the sports teacher takes the class for a walk around the streets of Paris and the kids disappear few at a time. Then there is the very naturalistic scene at the Punch  Judy show where the much younger kids are enjoying themselves. The city is a playground but when Doinel is living rough it is also oppressive and scary.Of course as time has gone on the shock value of the out of control adolescent has been lost with newer more franker films. The French New Wave also had a different way of telling stories in the cinema that someone like me brought up on a diet of junk Hollywood blockbusters might not always appreciate. The film can be a little too wayward and loose.However the final freeze frame of a boy fulfilling his dream of seeing the sea but still alone and lost is regarded as a classic. Apparently this is the first time a film ends in a freeze frame.".

I'm sure that it was as revolutionary in filmmaking as all the critics say but when it boils right down to it it's just really really boring. Maybe it's the language barrier may I'm just not sensitive or artsy enough but whatever the case is I hated this movie. The story itself isn't bad it's about a young French boy who is treated unfairly by his parents and his teachers and eventually he ends up in a juvenile facility. That in itself ought to be interesting and it was at first. There was nothing wrong with the dialogue but then again it's hard to say because half of the conversations weren't subtitled and for no apparent reason so I didn't always know what was going on. But for the dialogue we could understand it made enough sense. The actors were believable enough but it's hard to say what a real person would do in these situations. So you feel for the main character but only in the sense that when he gets into trouble you think well that sucks. The plot isn't even your typical plot. Each time he gets in trouble he gets into more trouble than the last time but the reasons never vary too much. And through the entire film you realize that there's nothing the main character can really do about it. So it's more like just waiting to see how it ends. The ending by the way was completely over my head. It's way too artsy for me and I just didn't get it. Leading up to the end was easy enough to follow. The structure was certainly there and it made sense as well but everything was really drawn out. For the amount of dialogue and significant moments the movie could have been an hour shorter. It just didn't end. Part of it was the unnecessarily long shots none of which were especially memorable for example the ending was a clip of the main character running down a country road that lasted a good thirty seconds. Now I'm sure that had some deeper meaning in it somewhere but for the average viewer I'd rather have gotten up to get some more food during that time. Or at least done something a little more useful than sit and watch this boy running like doing my laundry or taking a nap. Final Verdict The feeling throughout the whole movie was that this probably would be very moving and just amazing and that it would teach me some great life lesson if I could only get what the director was trying to say by his unique decisions. As it was I just felt cheated out of a good two hours of my life.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've been a fan of Walden Robert Cassotto's for a long long time and I've been following the progress or nonprogress of the biopic based on his life for an equally long time couldn't have been any more pleased when I learned that Kevin Spacey was going to be the one to finally bring the project to the proverbial light of day. I'm mentioning this because I realize it's impossible for me to be completely objective about the movie feeling about its subject as strongly as I do I think that anyone who loved Bobby Darin cannot be thoroughly objective regarding Spacey's film.That having been said I can tell you that I was profoundly affected by Beyond The Sea. Spacey lives up to his surname in spades with this project by tossing out all the 'normal' biopic storytelling tools instead resorting to a spacedout show biz fantasytype structure which does work because Bobby himself did use his career as an antidote against the reality of his everfailing health and inevitable early death  his overwhelming drive and beyondintense focus stemmed from the fact that he knew he had only so much time to do anything with his life this is what made him so great on stage and this immediacy and strength of purpose is conveyed brilliantly in the movie not through the usual talking and explaining sequences but rather through Darin's actions. So the liberties that Spacey takes with Bobby's life pay off  the songanddance numbers and the plot devices the best one being Darin's younger self having a simultaneous part in the proceedings with the older Darin.So much has been written about Spacey being too old to play Bobby how Spacey shouldn't have actually sung the songs himself how this is a vanity project on Spacey's part blah blah blah. All untrue.The clever way in which he stages the film acknowledges the fact that he knows he's chronologically older than the perfect age to play this part and he sings the songs himself because he CAN  his voice is more than serviceable in fact when I saw the trailer for the first time a few months back and heard him singing Mack The Knife I was in the theatre telling the person I'd come with That's Bobby that can't possibly be Kevin Spacey  this from a person who has listened to Darin's recording of that song literally hundreds and hundreds of times.The thing that is most interesting about the negative criticism is the one about this being a vanity project for Spacey his desire and enthusiasm to share his feeling for Darin via this project is being interpreted as an ego trip when in reality it's an unabashed and pure labor of love. The film is being misunderstood by a lot of people and I see this as being unbelievably ironic and ultimately proof that the film works because Darin himself was constantly misunderstood constantly having his hellbentforleather notimetowaste desperation perceived as arrogance. So Spacey succeeded on that level alone.It also doesn't hurt that from the back he manages to bear an uncanny resemblance to Bobby he captures the physicality perfectly and in all the shots that are not too close up you'd swear it was Bobby that you were seeing and not Spacey. It's only in the closeups that I was reminded it wasn't actually Bobby on the screen and in the later scenes when he becomes politically aware grows the mustache and bills himself as Bob Darin Spacey looks like him even in the closeups.By the end of the film I found myself feeling profoundly moved by what I was experiencing even though oddly enough I didn't feel up to that point that the film was particularly profound and so my reaction was very surprising to me. There's a scene where  POSSIBLE SPOILER  Darin is in his hospital bed right before he dies and Sandra Dee who was no longer with him at that time but still loved him is in the bed cuddled up beside him  that image was to me by far the single most powerful one in the movie and it has stayed with me long after the movie's final credits. END OF POSSIBLE SPOILER I want to include this the person I saw the film with hadn't been a fan of Bobby's the way I had for years and I asked her after we'd left the theatre if she'd felt moved by what she'd experienced  I was trying to get a more objective idea how the movie would play to someone who wasn't so emotionally connected to the material. She said that after seeing it she wanted to know more about Bobby how she'd had no idea what he'd gone through in his life and how she felt tremendous compassion and respect for him.Spacey has said that his motivation in doing the movie was to remind people who hardly remembered him what a monumental talent Bobby Darin was and to hopefully introduce a new generation to the man. I think he's succeeded on that level too at least with people who go to see this movie with an open mind and a receptive heart.".

	onyx:emotionText "I've been a fan of Walden Robert Cassotto's for a long long time and I've been following the progress or nonprogress of the biopic based on his life for an equally long time couldn't have been any more pleased when I learned that Kevin Spacey was going to be the one to finally bring the project to the proverbial light of day. I'm mentioning this because I realize it's impossible for me to be completely objective about the movie feeling about its subject as strongly as I do I think that anyone who loved Bobby Darin cannot be thoroughly objective regarding Spacey's film.That having been said I can tell you that I was profoundly affected by Beyond The Sea. Spacey lives up to his surname in spades with this project by tossing out all the 'normal' biopic storytelling tools instead resorting to a spacedout show biz fantasytype structure which does work because Bobby himself did use his career as an antidote against the reality of his everfailing health and inevitable early death  his overwhelming drive and beyondintense focus stemmed from the fact that he knew he had only so much time to do anything with his life this is what made him so great on stage and this immediacy and strength of purpose is conveyed brilliantly in the movie not through the usual talking and explaining sequences but rather through Darin's actions. So the liberties that Spacey takes with Bobby's life pay off  the songanddance numbers and the plot devices the best one being Darin's younger self having a simultaneous part in the proceedings with the older Darin.So much has been written about Spacey being too old to play Bobby how Spacey shouldn't have actually sung the songs himself how this is a vanity project on Spacey's part blah blah blah.

	schema:reviewBody "This film just premiered a few hours ago at the film festival here in Toronto. Kevin Spacey Bob Hoskins and Kate Bosworth were in attendance. It was a gala event. Having said that I was very nervous about the success of a film where one guy not only produces stars in directs cowrites but also does his own singing. Well the guy pulled it off beautifully. The structure takes a little getting used to. It opens with Spacey playing Darin starring in a biopic of his own life. When a reporter walks up to him and says Don't you think you are a little old to be playing a guy in his twenties? I started to feel relieved. Spacey obviously was aware that this was a potential problem in the way viewers might view his starring role and he chose to deal with it straight on instead of avoiding it. The plot is not important in this film. Rather what the movie is about is capturing the energy and drive of Darin himself and perhaps most important the urgency with which he lived his life. Darin knew from a very young age that his life would likely be cut short due to a heart condition. And that simply drove him to do the best he could and to do it as quickly as possible. Spacey's singing talent is a wonder to behold. Without actually imitating Darin he manages to capture Darin's charisma and stage presence and well as his singing characteristics and mannerisms. While I never forgot that it was Spacey I was watching I found his performance to be entirely believable. It was obvious that Spacey the actor thoroughly loved what he was doing and that every ounce of his being and all of his energy had been invested into this role. This man is a multitalented individual who tackled a very difficult project and somehow managed to pull it off  beautifully. Highly recommended!".

At times Spacey is playing Darin in his twenties when no matter how you tighten and pin Spacey's face he is still a 44year old man with all the lovely creases and bags time awards. The dislocation bothered me so that I couldn't fully appreciate what is otherwise an outstanding performance.But then Spacey is the director so he has to be responsible for miscasting or put another way why didn't he do this 10 years ago when no one on this planet could have denied that he is the perfect Darin?. As John Irving said in My Movie Business about the choice of actors Looks do count. Although others have criticized Beyond the Sea as a Spacey vanity project I found his performance believable and engaging with style appropriate to the best lounge singers of the time Sinatra included and spoton perfect for Darin if not better than the original. I've heard Spacey is touring with his band to promote this biopic I'd go just to enjoy Spacey as a gifted singer.The only moments to get past the many Darin songs and into his life are those centering on the influence of his mother Brenda Blethyn Secrets and Lies and his marriage to Sandra Dee Kate Bosworth. In the former Blethyn does a bit of singing and dancing to show that Spacey is not the only multitalent on the set. In the latter the pop culture lite of their romance is handled believably as one might try to do David Beckham and his spicey love a marriage just a vacuous and emblematic as the Darins'.The irony of Sandra's mother wanting her to go after Rock Hudson rather than Darin brings laughter intended for sure as the audience is aware of Spacey's contending with rumors about being gay. Even jokes about Darin's toupee resonate with Spacey's own rugs in real life and for this part. Spacey doesn't take himself as seriously as critics do witness an early scene where in the framing device of Darin filming his own life he is accused of being too old to play himself.The conjunction of subject and biographer is challenging at best. Paul Murray Kendall in The Art of Biography says On the trail of another man the biographer must put up with finding himself at every turn any biography uneasily shelters an autobiography within it. In that sense Beyond the Sea is as much about Kevin Spacey as it is Bonny Darin.This biopic ranks third next to Ray and DeLovely in another lessfull year it would be the best.".

Kevin Spacey's acting captures the essence of BD after the first ten minutes of the movie it seemed that Kevin Spacey WAS Bobby Darin irrespective of age. I also read critics who said Spacey's dancing was stiff and awkward. Wrong! The production numbers were fabulous. His singing acting dancing were awesome and it's a performance that should not be shortchanged in this year's awards' season although I fear it might be overlooked.Kate Blodgett too did a great job of portraying Sandra Dee but I wish they had kept her hairstyles more true to Sandra Dee of the 1960's.My only disappointment is that so many important details about Bobby Darin's life were quickly glossed over or totally omitted. For example there was no mention of his early years in the Pocono's his unfulfilled romance with Connie Francis his friendship with Dick Clark his songwriting collaboration with Don Kirshner and his subsequent marriage after divorcing Sandra Dee.Nevertheless I loved Beyond the Sea and plan to see it again this week. I'm afraid it won't still be in the theaters next week. It almost appears as though some of Hollywood and the newsprint critics have dissed it with almost a jealousy toward Kevin Spacey's Herculean efforts to bring this to the screen not to mention his compelling performance.I don't know if it will attract a younger viewing audience but if you're a Baby Boomer this is a mustsee.".

	schema:headline " Kevin Spacey is the actor that seems to be able to do anything.";
	schema:reviewBody "Even though he's been making movies since Heartburn in 1986 and most of us have probably heard of See No Evil Hear No Evil from 1989 Seven and The Usual Suspects from 1995 but it wasn't until American Beauty came in 1999 that he became a familiar name amongst movie critics. The role also won him an Oscar. I've been a swingjazz fan for a long time and I'm being hit my minor anxiety attacks when artists like Robbie Williams and recently Westlife decide to do a swing thing and miss the whole point about the genre. Those who call Robbie Williams a crooner know just about as much about the genre as he does. So when I heard about Kevin Spacey's project a couple of years ago I was automatically skeptical. By then I'd already heard him sing That Old Black Magic from the Clint Eastwood production Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil 1997 and he had a good voice but performed the song like a pop song. Something the above mentioned artists also have a tendency to do.Kevin showed up at the Michael Parkinson show last month to promote the movie and announced he'd also be singing two songs Beyond The Sea and Mack The Knife with a live orchestra. I was nervous. Up until the point where he started singing that was. He's spent the last 12 years making this project perfect and has received blessings from both Sandra Dee and her son with Bobby Dodd. Beyond The Sea  the movie It all kicks off when Bobby Darin Spacey enters the stage and sings Mack The Knife. If you've had any preconceptions of his ability to sing or perform this will disappear before he's reached ...pearly white... He nearly performs the whole song but interrupts and a director shouts cut. In the break a journalist shouts isn't he too old to play this role?! after him upon where his manager sneers Don't listen to him Bobby. How can you be too old to play yourself? It appears we're on the set of the movie where Bobby Darin plays himself. Which makes it okay that he doesn't look 20 in the early scenes.Not far into the movie he meets Sandra Dee Kate Bosworth on the set of the Rock Hudson movie Come September in 1961 and a romance blossoms. A bit of back and forth later particularly with Sandra's mother they become a couple and marry within two months. The fact that they hardly know each other adds up to certain problems but even though they fight like cat and dog at points there's always the underlying affection for each other. You get the feeling that it's the ultimate romance. It's eventually this turbulent  but heartwarming  love affair and Bobby's performances where the focus of the movie lies with a glimpse into his political phase during the Vietnam war when he lived in the middle of nowhere on his own. This bred the song Simple Song Of Freedom and an attempt at a comeback with a new image. We follow him all the way up to his last performance and an alternative ending that's very well swing.The Soundtrack Not only is the movie a work of art Kevin shows an almost unbelievable talent for the genre. He's been taking singing lessons since the late 90's and has studies every little detail in Bobby Darin's voice and being most on and off stage. Everything looks and sounds right.Kevin's vibrato is perfect. Smooth subtle and last but not least... it's done properly. Some singers don't have a clue how to do a proper vibrato and sound like they've got something stuck in their throat when attempting one but Kevin does it brilliantly. His phrasing is also spoton and he's got a lungcapacity that even professional singers can envy him. Bobby Darin went through different stages from swing to light country and Spacey says he's spent years with Darin songs on his iPod and kept hotel guests awake at night singing his songs. Just to get it right. He's done everything and then some to make everything sound as perfect as possible and succeeded. The orchestra also sounds amazing and it's wonderful to hear real instruments on a 2004 album. He recorded all songs at the Abbey Road Studios  where the Beatles put down 172 songs  with the legendary Phil Ramone producing. Conclusion Kevin Spacey once said that 'the less you know about me as a person the easier it is to believe I am that person on the screen' and he's right. I don't know anything about him and I don't want to know because when I watch Beyond The Sea it's not Kevin Spacey I see  but Bobby Darin.".

	onyx:emotionText "Even though he's been making movies since Heartburn in 1986 and most of us have probably heard of See No Evil Hear No Evil from 1989 Seven and The Usual Suspects from 1995 but it wasn't until American Beauty came in 1999 that he became a familiar name amongst movie critics. The role also won him an Oscar. I've been a swingjazz fan for a long time and I'm being hit my minor anxiety attacks when artists like Robbie Williams and recently Westlife decide to do a swing thing and miss the whole point about the genre. Those who call Robbie Williams a crooner know just about as much about the genre as he does. So when I heard about Kevin Spacey's project a couple of years ago I was automatically skeptical. By then I'd already heard him sing That Old Black Magic from the Clint Eastwood production Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil 1997 and he had a good voice but performed the song like a pop song. Something the above mentioned artists also have a tendency to do.Kevin showed up at the Michael Parkinson show last month to promote the movie and announced he'd also be singing two songs Beyond The Sea and Mack The Knife with a live orchestra. I was nervous. Up until the point where he started singing that was. He's spent the last 12 years making this project perfect and has received blessings from both Sandra Dee and her son with Bobby Dodd. Beyond The Sea  the movie It all kicks off when Bobby Darin Spacey enters the stage and sings Mack The Knife. If you've had any preconceptions of his ability to sing or perform this will disappear before he's reached ...pearly white... He nearly performs the whole song but interrupts and a director shouts cut. In the break a journalist shouts isn't he too old to play this role?! after him upon where his manager sneers Don't listen to him Bobby. How can you be too old to play yourself? It appears we're on the set of the movie where Bobby Darin plays himself. Which makes it okay that he doesn't look 20 in the early scenes.Not far into the movie he meets Sandra Dee Kate Bosworth on the set of the Rock Hudson movie Come September in 1961 and a romance blossoms. A bit of back and forth later particularly with Sandra's mother they become a couple and marry within two months. The fact that they hardly know each other adds up to certain problems but even though they fight like cat and dog at points there's always the underlying affection for each other. You get the feeling that it's the ultimate romance. It's eventually this turbulent  but heartwarming  love affair and Bobby's performances where the focus of the movie lies with a glimpse into his political phase during the Vietnam war when he lived in the middle of nowhere on his own. This bred the song Simple Song Of Freedom and an attempt at a comeback with a new image. We follow him all the way up to his last performance and an alternative ending that's very well swing.The Soundtrack Not only is the movie a work of art Kevin shows an almost unbelievable talent for the genre. He's been taking singing lessons since the late 90's and has studies every little detail in Bobby Darin's voice and being most on and off stage. Everything looks and sounds right.Kevin's vibrato is perfect. Smooth subtle and last but not least... it's done properly. Some singers don't have a clue how to do a proper vibrato and sound like they've got something stuck in their throat when attempting one but Kevin does it brilliantly. His phrasing is also spoton and he's got a lungcapacity that even professional singers can envy him. Bobby Darin went through different stages from swing to light country and Spacey says he's spent years with Darin songs on his iPod and kept hotel guests awake at night singing his songs. Just to get it right. He's done everything and then some to make everything sound as perfect as possible and succeeded.

	schema:reviewBody "Spacey sings. Spacey dances. Spacey wears a succession of ghastly outfits.This biopic of Bobby Darin splits cleanly into two modes. In the first Kevin Spacey does highly watchable singing and dancing routines. In the second he portrays a rheumatic singer who defied doctors and malepattern baldness to become a star.Although the film flicks back and forth between the two modes they never gel as one seamless story which is a problem for a biopic of a man whose life contained only a handful of interesting events.It doesn't help that Spacey's Darin interrupts the plot every so often by stepping back from the narrative and discussing the film with his younger self. It is a device that does little more than remind you that you are watching a film  a fact that is never far from your thoughts anyway because of the large number of somewhat contrived dance numbers.Nor are the biographical sections very convincing. It is clear well before the extensive precredits disclaimer that the director has taken some diabolical liberties with Darin's life making you wonder what you have learnt from the film. Did Darin really take his name from a half lit neon Mandarin sign outside a Chinese restaurant? Did he really die after a successful comeback gig in Las Vegas or was that just a narrative invention to end on a high note?The upshot is a film that is more a celebration of Kevin Spacey's impression of a worldrenowned entertainer than a celebration of the entertainer himself.It is a tribute to Spacey's talent as an actor that the film remains likable not least because he doesn't have the polish of an accomplished director. Too many scenes feel as though he was too shy to make his fellow cast members do one more take.There is enough energy on display to allow most Darin fans forgive the film's weaknesses but the more picky viewer will feel slightly disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching Kevin Spacey's new film musical biography about the life of Bobby Darin Beyond the Sea I couldn't help but think of the great film critic Pauline Kael's assessment of Diana Ross in the film version of the 70's Black retelling of The Wizard of Oz The Wiz. Ms. Ross's insistence at the age of thirty nine of playing Dorothy age twelve in 'The Wiz' wrote Ms. Kael amounts to a whim of iron. That's not to say that Beyond the Sea does not have merit. It does and a lot of it. Or that Kevin Spacey is inappropriately cast. Finally he's not. In fact it's hard to imagine anyone else who could bring to this part what Spacey does. But having directed as well as coproduced cowritten starred and done all of his own singing one cannot escape that Beyond the Sea is ultimately much about Spacey as it is Bobby Darinin the same manner that Citizen Kane is about Orson Welles as William Randolph Heart or a.k.a. Charles Foster Kane. Spacey's strong ties to his own mother have been reported and Bobby Darin's relationship with his mother is at the focal point of the story as well as Sandra Dee's Darin's wife. Both appear as intellectuals with an artist's arrogance and both relish in an often droll delivery. And both clearly know how to sing.Owing some stylish influence to Fosse's All That Jazz and even Coppola's One From the Heart Beyond the Sea shows off Spacey's strong grasp of cinematic story telling moving between surrealism and reality and his even stronger vocalizing ability in sounding about as close to Darin as you could expect. He moves he struts and there are moments when he quietly strikes an uncanny pose that looks just like some of those famous record covers. What Spacey can't escape is that at forty five he is eight years older than when Darin died. Because we are so familiar with Darin's face the difference is noticeable. For some this may amount to an impossible suspension of disbelief much in the same manner of last year's The Human Stain where many found it impossible to buy Anthony Hopkins as a fair skinned Negro.This is a shame because Spacey's work is formidable and an impact is made. A life is realized and rendered effectively often brilliantly and I was moved at the end. If nothing else one looks forward to what Spacey does next both in front of and behind the camera. No doubt his production of Oedipus Rex would be spectacular.".

Combined with the drive and emotional dexterity it took to deliver a fresh face in a dying breed of crooning and turn it into success. These two factual tidbits of information is legitimate reason to create a film regarding the aforementioned. Combined with the talents of acting debonaires like Spacey Hoskins and Goodman intertwined with Kevin's uncanny ability at certain times to take the directorial reigns this film had the initial potential to compare itself to the likes of Ray and Walk the Line.Unfortunately for everyone involved this movie falls completely flat on a number of levels.First of all there is a distinct difference in performing your characters songs during times when your character would actually have performed them I.E. during a live show and singing your character's songs in hopes to help tell the story. Beyond the Sea chooses the latter and for no reason whatsoever spontaneously breaks out into song and dance whenever Spacey feels the need to kill about 10 minutes. I would have understood the logic behind this approach if Spacey opted to title this film Beyond the Sea.....THE MUSICAL! That would have at least justified his actions. However as it stands the movie passes through different phases of Darin's life with unexplainable frequent interruptions of sonic cheese and corny choreography. Is this how the real Bobby Darin lead his life? While spending years of his childhood on the brink of death only to lapse every now and then into an uncontrollable urge to arise from his bed and whimsically prance in unison with his family and neighborhood yokels? I think not.Secondly Kate Bosworth as Sandra Dee is a perfect example of how an inappropriate casting decision leads to disaster. Just picturing her slowly warming up to erotic affection with a man literally old enough to be her father is absolutely grotesque. Watching these two falling in love can concisely be compared to accidentally discovering your 40 year old next door neighbor is having intercourse with your teenage daughter....Yes it's that disgusting. Not to mention the fact that Bosworth's acting capabilities are simply not honed enough to capture the fiery personality that the real Sandra Dee possessed. To put it bluntly it's a sure fire miss....A distinct error by the casting department and by Kevin Spacey.In conclusion there isn't any question that Kevin Spacey is a true fan of Bobby Darin some may even applaud his efforts to tell his story using this decisively different approach. But when it comes down to it the only thing redeeming about this picture is a few brief moments of comic relief from Goodman and the everpresent fact that Bosworth is easy on the eyes. Even with a beehive hairdo Other than that I truly hope the written critique I have given is enough to at least warn you about what you're getting yourself into if you decide to invest 2 hours of your life to watch this bloatedmessofafilm. I mean that with utmost sincerity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Beyond the Sea is one of the worst films i have seen in a long while. The characters are all completely one dimensional there isn't a shred of credible honest dialog in the entire film Bobby Darin is not shown to have a single redeeming quality until 45 minutes into the film when the writer decided to throw in a schmaltzy pointless one minute scene about him defending a black comedian.Good scripts are built through positive and negative events that eventually lead to a climax. This film goes virtually an hour with only a couple of negative events. His mother dies and it is sluffed off and never dealt with. We never see any unconscious desire from Bobby Darin. His character just prances about egotistically getting whatever he wants during the first half of this film. Good characters have a weak spot they draw you in and create empathy or at least sympathy. This character had none of that. There are so many clichs and obvious turns in this film but what makes them even worse is the fact that they are never dealt with. We find out Sandra Dee has a drinking problem....Thats talked about for all of 5 seconds!! also at one point the story seems to be leading to the obvious tension of her being jealous of his career but again they never bother to explore it they just shelf the idea and move on to another positive beat regarding bobby darins' career.To top it all off in the middle of this boring story we have to put up with 5 different song interludes that stop the plot dead. 15 minutes of just sitting there in the theatre waiting for them to get on with it.I cant for the life of me see how anyone could defend this film technically.".

The cast is spectacular gotta love Bob Hoskins Brenda Blethyn Kevin Spacey John Goodman... and I was amused and impressed by the dance numbers. Kevin Spacey can carry a tune but he just isn't Bobby Darin but then no one is.... I was listening to Bobby Darin Swings a couple of weeks ago and decided to go ahead and see this even though I think I was talked out of it by its bad reviews in 2004.Well. The story was rather hard to follow because of the plot device used adult Bobby keeps in touch with his younger self throughout the movie..to the point where it was impossible to know things like SPOILERhow old was young Bobby when his mother died? We don't know for sure because both the adult Bobby and the kid Bobby were at the funeral. I know it's supposed to be artsy. IT's not meant to be a truthful retelling of the story just kind of an image of kind of what happened...in a roundabout way that leaves the audience going HUH? IF that was Spacey's intent he directed and wrote this I think then he succeeded. It was all just a bit weird.Where this film SPOILER really goes off the rails is its portrayal of Mr. Darin's descent into wacko war protestation as some kind of heroic time in his life instead of what it was. It seems to me that that was the low point of his life and career yet this film would have you believe that he was triumphant in his career as a result. It just doesn't seem that way to me and probably to most rational people.This was a mixed bag for me. It could have been good but instead was an okay flick with some cringe inducing scenes that were painful to watch. See it if you love Bobby Darin. At least there's some nice music and you'll want to come home and listen to the real thing!".

	schema:headline " Enjoyed it!";
	schema:reviewBody "I had some misgivings about two entertainers whose work I enjoy so much Bobby Darin and Kevin Spacey being combined in this biopic. Let me say up front however that this film exceeded my expectations by several miles. In answer to some of the standard complaints 1 If you think Spacey is too old to play this role you should reconsider what the film is depicting. This film is a retrospective which looks back from the latter part of Darin's career reminiscent of his selfreferential comments in The Bobby Darin Story. He is not supposed to be young. This is also one of the reasons why so much of the narrative keys on his relationship with his younger self embodied by the actor he has picked to play himself in his autobiography. 2 If you believe Spacey can't sing.... well.... I give up. People tend to have very narrow and hardened opinions about music  regardless of how tone deaf they may be. Spacey may not bring much originality to the singing style of Bobby Darin but in my opinion he pretty much nails Darin's voice and overall style. 3 The characters are shallow? What film did you watch? OK Darin lead a charmed existence compared to Johnny Cash and Ray Charles. After all he never developed a serious drug addiction nor did he have to go through a painful divorce. And he wasn't blind. The only real tragedy in Bobby's life was being diagnosed with a terminal illness in his early teens not knowing his parents throughout most of his life and never living up to his own standards... minor problems compared to the deeper ones portrayed in other more serious biopics? Ya whatever. Depth does not equal selfdestructiveness and depression IMO.This film stands as a great achievement for Kevin Spacey Kate Bosworth and others. The cast is excellent and the writing and directing are superb. The music is as entertaining as the action of the narrative and very well blended into the story. The film achieves a powerful surrealism which is very rare for biopics and has unfortunately been neglected in most contemporary musicals as it portrays Darin's inner and outer worlds with equal weight. Although the subject matter is very very different Beyond the Sea's musical method reminded me of the beautiful Dancer in the Dark.Darin's story is a story of the profound love dedication to craft and the desire to be the best which allowed a dying man to miraculously prolong his time with us for decades and way beyond his time of death.".

Thank you Kevin for making this movie.

He dances and I'd have to look at the credits again but I believe that is his voice on all of the numbers. Kevin Spacey might not be able to fool anyone that he is Bobby Darin but he can sing and dance as well as anyone I've ever seen!

	schema:reviewBody "Kevin Spacey has directed one movie prior to his direction of Beyond the Sea Albino Aligator and this one is worth a viewing.Beyond the Sea starring Kevin Spacey as the legendary vocalist Bobby Darin is a well done biopic of the singers life. His rise to stardom from life in the Bronx to his new life on the stage. Along with him are his brother inlaw Charlie played by Bob Hoskins his wife and Darin's sister Nina played by Caroline Aaron wife Sandra Dee performed by Kate Bosworth and John Goodman as manager Boom Boom Steve Blauner.Darin struggles with a serious ailment since his childhood and continues to fight his heart problem throughout his singing career. This motivates him to live longer and pursue happiness like Sandra Dee. No matter what the challenge Bobby is ready to tackle it. He broke out onto the billboards with Splish Splash. He wanted to go onto better things...like the Copacabana.Bobby would star in 10 movies an Oscar nomination seven Top10 songs and a family all in a span of 10 years. He had it all.Although some parts of the movie are a little strange like some of the random dance sequences it it tied nicely together with the making of a movie and how he interacts with the memory of his childhood.What Spacey has given us is an enjoyable film that tells a story of a man once considered to be the greatest singer in the world.

	onyx:emotionText "Kevin Spacey has directed one movie prior to his direction of Beyond the Sea Albino Aligator and this one is worth a viewing.Beyond the Sea starring Kevin Spacey as the legendary vocalist Bobby Darin is a well done biopic of the singers life. His rise to stardom from life in the Bronx to his new life on the stage. Along with him are his brother inlaw Charlie played by Bob Hoskins his wife and Darin's sister Nina played by Caroline Aaron wife Sandra Dee performed by Kate Bosworth and John Goodman as manager Boom Boom Steve Blauner.Darin struggles with a serious ailment since his childhood and continues to fight his heart problem throughout his singing career. This motivates him to live longer and pursue happiness like Sandra Dee. No matter what the challenge Bobby is ready to tackle it. He broke out onto the billboards with Splish Splash. He wanted to go onto better things...like the Copacabana.Bobby would star in 10 movies an Oscar nomination seven Top10 songs and a family all in a span of 10 years. He had it all.Although some parts of the movie are a little strange like some of the random dance sequences it it tied nicely together with the making of a movie and how he interacts with the memory of his childhood.What Spacey has given us is an enjoyable film that tells a story of a man once considered to be the greatest singer in the world. Spacey's passion for Darin goes way back to his childhood when he would listen to his parents records see making of the movie on DVD. Spacey sings every song in the picture dances every step directs every scene and even writes the script with Lewis Colick Ladder 49 October Sky.

I had the opportunity to see Bobby Darin perform in Vegas and while he was a spectacular performer and exhibited a bigger than life persona there was some little thing missing that could have made him another Sinatra. Spacey must be Darin's soul brother because he manages to breathe life into the real Bobby allowing him to be the warm and caring person he was. He always seemed to be a bit standoffish and perhaps for good reason. Spacey peels away the layers of anxiety sadness and aloneness in a man who was more of himself than he really needed to be. It was something that Darin tried to do but didn't do it near as well as Spacey. Excellent directing. Excellent musical performance. Excellent acting. It should have received a Golden Globe nomination for best movie in a musical category.".

Music was excellent Spacey sounds so very much like BD maybe better in some cases. Only wish that more of movie had had to do with his other talents piano he had a top 10 solo piano hit in 1960 forget the song's name guitar saw him at Lake Tahoe in 1973 phenomenal guitar player Cornet used to include solos in all his shows drums would also do solos said to be better than his own drummer by a long shot. The surrealistic theme of the movie did tend to ignore the somewhat darker side of his character that could be pretty nasty indeed... glad they included his family makeupmixup as an element explains a lot about his drive etc. I had heard that he had known about his sister being his mother from a very young age but had put it out of his memory. This subplot worked itself into the story pretty well. I'm not sure that Dick Clark had that much to do with his initial success at all the men never really knew each other all that well. The big thing about the movie last night was the applause by the full house audience as the credits were running quite loud and sustained. Looking around most if not all of the people in there were our age 60 to 70 and all were very much shaken by the movie. How did he say it?  Our memories will be whatever we want them to be or something like that. That is just about what I felt. The things that happened and were happening to me while I was listening to his records fill an enormous part of my memory bank. I'm sure that held true from everyone I saw leaving the theatre. He had such an impact on so many lives".

	schema:reviewBody "9.2I was never a big fan of the West. I always figured it was some sort of ancestral thing. I mean seriously how interesting can Westerns be? Think of some of the key elements of the Western setting desolate deserts near poor living environments unless you were rich railroads and trains. That doesn't sound very interesting does it? However the West usually offers very grim and destructive characters whose lives and actions are very captivating for audiences. The West itself is stark as an environment. The West is infamous.How The West Was Won is a 1962 epic film about the Westward expansion that occurred in the United States in the 19th Century. It follows the Prescott family from their humble roots in the Erie Canal all the way to their eventual settlement in the West. The film covers many different aspects of the West. It includes historical events such as the Gold Rush in California the Civil War and the laying of the railroads in that part of the land. It also includes trademark icons of Western life such as struggle with Native Americans travelling in wagons and outlawed gangs. It is very much the quintessential experience of the West in film format. How The West Was Won uses an interesting technique for filming called Cinerama. It is basically style of shooting a film using three cameras at the same time. It creates a very wide aspect ratio where your peripheral vision is intended to be engulfed by onscreen content. It is sort of like a surround vision. I unfortunately can not tell you what it is like to see the film in its intended manner. There are only supposed to be a handful of theaters that are capable of presenting it this way and I was only able to see the BluRay version of the film. On this version you can watch it with a wraparound effect or the regular 2.891 letterbox version.What results is a very fascinating experience. I personally am a huge fan of wide aspect ratio shots. Rarely do films employ such a technique. I was very very impressed and excited by what I found in How The West Was Won. There are many shots that show an entire landscape and most of the time there is a character or object in the center so as to keep the focus on it. It is interesting that in real life our vision is not as wide but giving it such a look can paint a very pretty picture. Along with the breathtaking landscape shots there are many shots where you see a group of people conversing in the middle but you never lose sight of the environment around them. Giving the fact that it was originally presented with the wraparound screen this must have contributed greatly to ambiance. How The West Was Won is a very well shot film.Unfortunately it does not use these techniques all of the time. There are many scenes in the film that solely rely on the use of dialogue and story. Not only is there very little to see but the Cinerama technology is pretty much wasted here. These scenes are usually near the middle and towards the very end of the movie. Granted maybe there wasn't enough open air around them but I still think that more could have been done with the three cameras in these scenes. How The West Was Won is a very good film. Going into this I was thinking oh great another Western film and this one is very long this is not going to be that enjoyable. I was wrong. It is a very entertaining film. Although it is really not that long at all it definitely feels very long. I guess that this is a compliment so as to say that they achieved the epic feel that they were going for. However by the end of it I was feeling a little tired. But I won't count that against the film especially since it does offer an intermission. The use of the Cinerama technology even though it is wasted at times is very impressive. I wish that more films used this technology. One scene that I loved was the outro or ending sequence. Spending what seemed like 50 years in the West seeing the developments of people out there only to finish it off with a modern day flyby of San Francisco was amazing. Very good way to finish off this film and send audiences off into the world again. How The West Was Won definitely won over my attention.".

Watching the film on home video represents a compromise but Warner's latest edition offers as good a presentation as you're likely to see outside of a Cinerama theatre.The film which was based on a series of 'Life' magazine articles traces the fortunes of the Prescott family as they take part in the westward expansion in 19th century America. The story unfolds over several decades and touches on the Gold Rush the Civil War and other periods in American history. James R. Webb's screenplay while more entertaining than historically exhaustive won him an Oscar.The cast is about as starstudded a bunch as you're likely to see anywhere. Where else can you see Jimmy Stewart Henry Fonda  John Wayne all in same film? Not to mention Karl Malden Gregory Peck Eli Wallach Richard Widmark Walter Brennan and others too numerous to mention. Needless to say the acting is in good hands.Technically the film looks quite nice. The Oscarnominated cinematography is breathtaking and Alfred Newman's score is topnotch. However the filming process made for an overabundance of long shots and there are a few instances of rear projection that frankly look bad next to the rest of the picture. Also while not a fault per se there are geometric distortions inherent in displaying the curved picture on a flat screen.Yet despite its minor imperfections How the West Was Won is an attractive and engaging epic Western. As a history lesson it's somewhat superficial but the combination of fine acting and stunning visuals make it well worth your time. Just be sure to pick up the Special Edition or Bluray release.".

	schema:reviewBody "I still remember seeing How the West Was Won in Cinerama when it made it into general release back in 1962. A motion picture theater equipped for Cinerama is the only way this one should be seen. The formatted VHS copy I watched tonight can't come close to doing it justice.James R. Webb's original screenplay for the screen won an Oscar in 1962 and it involves an episodic account of the Presscott family and their contribution to settling the American west in the 19th century. We first meet the Presscotts Karl Malden and Agnes Moorehead going west on the Erie Canal and later by flatboat on the Ohio River. They have two daughters dreamy romantic Carroll Baker and feisty Debbie Reynolds. The girls meet and marry mountain man James Stewart and gambler Gregory Peck eventually and their adventures and those of their children are what make up the plot of How the West Was Won.Three of Hollywood's top directors did parts of this film although the lion's share by all accounts was done by Henry Hathaway. John Ford did the Civil War sequence and George Marshall the sequence about the railroad. The Civil War piece featured John Wayne and Harry Morgan in a moment of reflection at the battlefield of Shiloh. Morgan did a first rate job as Grant in his brief cameo and Wayne was playing Sherman for the second time in his career. He'd previously played Sherman in an unbilled cameo on his friend Ward Bond's Wagon Train series. I'm surprised Wayne never did Sherman in a biographical film he would have been good casting.If any of the stars could be said to be THE star of the film it would have to be Debbie Reynolds. She's in the film almost through out and in the last sequence where as a widow she goes to live with her nephew George Peppard and his family she's made up as a gray haired old woman and does very well with the aging. Debbie also gets to do a couple of musical numbers A Home in the Meadow and Raise A Ruckus both blend in well in the story. Debbie's performance in How the West Was Won must have been the reason she was cast in The Unsinkable Molly Brown.Cinerama was rarely as effectively employed as in How the West Was Won. I well remember feeling like you were right on the flatboat that the Presscott family was on as they got caught in the Ohio River rapids. The Indian attack and the buffalo stampede were also well done. But the climax involving that running gun battle between peace officers George Peppard and Lee J. Cobb with outlaw Eli Wallach and his gang on a moving train even on a formatted VHS is beyond thrilling.There is a sequence that was removed and it had to do with Peppard going to live with buffalo hunter Henry Fonda and marrying Hope Lange who was Fonda's daughter. She dies and Peppard leaves the mountains and then marries Carolyn Jones. Lange's part was completely left on the cutting room floor. Hopefully there will be a restored version of How the West Was Won we'll see Hope Lange and more of Henry Fonda.And it should be restored. All those Hollywood legends in one exciting film. They really don't make them like this any more.".

Seating was fine it's reserved so you know ahead where you'll be.  Because you're looking at three separate 35mm projections the sum total of the three result in a very large clear and bright picture just as good as a 70mm film and perhaps better in some respects. The prints were vivid and sharp. At the Dome a theater executive came out to discuss the film and the theater history with the audience just prior to the start of the  picture he spoke for 1015 minutes discussing the pros and cons of the process why it wasn't practical to continue making films this way etc. One of the plus aspects is that with the small lenses they used the focus was fixed and any object from 2 ft to infinity was always in focus therefore all the scenery was sharp except for certain singlecamera and process shots.  One of the downside aspects is that extreme closeups are not possible in Cinerama and he said that the directors hated that. Then he tells inside trivia about the film how it includes about a minute of footage from two other films one was The Alamo because the scenes fit perfectly in the storyline. He also mentioned that back in the 1960's it took 5 people to run the show three projectors the 35mm sound projector and one master projectionist  total of 5. The gentleman said that today with all the modern technological improvements they were now able to produce the identical result  with just 5 projectionists!   In other words nothing had changed.  Another reason the process could not survive. Got a big laugh. He then introduced each projectionist to the audience. Anyway the whole thing came off without a hitch and I had forgotten much of the film's vivid details and incredible scenery so it was very much like seeing it for the first time. I had not seen it in Cinerama ever and when I did see a blended 35mm print in a local Edwards theater back in '64 it was somewhat of a disappointment. The magnetic 6track sound was on still another 35mm film strip so 4 separate strips are actually required to comprise the presentation.  The sound was fine  clear and sharp  with lots of separation in the six channels but it was not as boomy as the sound we hear in today's pics. For anyone interested in what it might have been like to see a stateoftheart presentation in the early 1960's this presents a magnificent opportunity and the film is a trip.    DFR".

	schema:reviewBody "In the early 1960s Hollywood found itself under attack by television so had to wheel out some big guns . THE LONGEST DAY and HOW THE WEST WAS WON were a couple of these howitzers . Films that lasted several hours full of episodic structure with big names playing the characters . Watching these type of movies years later you can see the thinking behind them but do seem overblown with hindsight and you can also see why film makers wanted to make more intense movies via New Hollywood in the 1970s That said HTWWW is by no means a bad movie . If there's a problem with it it's the narrative problem of trying to squeeze 100 years of history in to three hours of cinema and to a large degree the film succeeds to a large extent . It also deserves some credit for using Debbie Reynolds and George Peppard  neither of whom were the biggest names in the movie  to play the main linking charactersAnd yet the problem of the narrative is impossible to overcome entirely successfully . The story remains episodic and has every clich under the sun . Men are men and women are thankful . White men tend to be extremely good or extremely bad and the indigenous population are noble savages who become mere savages when white man speak with forked tongue . There's also the annoying production value of people standing in front of back projection which jars with the numerous establishing shots taken on location. It's also a conservative film with God frequently getting a name check But for the most part it's an entertaining Western even for those of us who don't like the genre . Perhaps the reason it does work is because it's so traditional where the world is portrayed in black and white  a world that has never existed in the first place".

There are also some great clips from the first Cinerama picture This Is Cinerama 1953 presented by explorer and Cinerama pioneer Lowell Thomas.But it is disc two that really takes the biscuit!

And for the first time in a video release the full width of the Cinerama screen has been captured. About a third of each of the two side images was missing in previous video versions. This version is so wide that a widescreen HDTV still requires black bars at top and bottom to fit the image on the screen.Yes there are moments we wish we could rewrite such as the narrator's reference to primitive people. This is balanced however by an unusually fair for the time treatment of the plight of the plains Indians. The movie holds up remarkably well thanks to a well written script and strong performances by a large Alist cast. With the exception of a scene in which Debbie Reynolds breaks into a songand dance number in a wagontrain encampment the excuse being that her character is a singer there is almost nothing that betrays the era when the film was made. Well there is the fact that most of the cast members are long dead.As a professional historian I have to say that the almost complete absence of reference to specific historical events except the battle of Shiloh is part of the secret of the film's success. This is a movie that captures the myth of the American west a myth that is still alive and powerful.This movie was made for the biggest screen ever prior to the Imax era. The absence of true closeup shots a limitation of the Cinerama process is more noticeable on a smaller screen. It deserves to be seen on the biggest widescreen TV you can find.

The scene at her father's grave when Carol Baker sends her son off to war long after her husband has also gone is very moving.  What was it that made me so mistyeyed?  I found myself getting caught up in the lives of these pioneers with their hopes dreams and disappointments and all too human frailties.Now for the flip side  I must admit that I cringed when I heard Spencer Tracey's narration stating that the west had to be won...from primitive man.  It made me think about how onesided this presentation was with regards to our treatment of Native Americans.  George Peppard's character is an ally of the Native Americans but this plot development occurs far too late to provide any kind of real balance to the story.In the final analysis we have a film that is not very politically correct but is a tale told well filmed beautifully about people who sacrificed everything they had to pursue their dream.".

	schema:headline " A visual experience like no other";
	schema:reviewBody "Very much like IMAX's grandiose stand against the emergence of internet streaming BluRay and the 'Golden Age of Television' the 1950's saw studios battling against the arrival of a television in every home and used the likes of 3D and 'Spook Show Spectaculars' to draw the public in. Another shortlived fad was Cinerama a process of shooting with three synchronised cameras and creating an ultra widescreen effect in the process. It was a headache for film makers notably John Ford and special cinemas had to be built to house the format that required three projectors and a deeply curved screen.Also like IMAX Cinerama was intended mainly for documentaries but its immediate success meant that it wouldn't be too long before studios started to turn to features. The first was The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm in 1962 and How the West Was Won came later the same year. The latter is the most ambitious telling a story stretching 50 years across three generations and boasting a cast of '24 great stars' as the poster informs us taking us through the major events of America's expansion further west and employing four firstrate directors  John Ford Henry Hathaway George Marshall and the uncredited Richard Thorpe  to bring it to life.Whilst the ambition can only be admired How the West Was Won is a mixed bag. In part a roughandtumble oldfashioned western that offers differing perspectives of America's venture out west as Henry Fonda's grizzled buffalo hunter Jethro Stuart laments the bloody consequences of the railroad's arrival under the command of Richard Widmark's ruthless and treatydismissing overseer the film also cannot resist the lure of grand songanddance numbers with Debbie Reynolds husky voice and kneeslapping becoming tiresome very quickly. It also keeps the audience at a huge distance both emotionally and literally. With so much picture being captured actors are routinely squeezed into the centre of the frame with their facial expressions too far away to see.Broken up into 5 segments  The Rivers The Plains The Civil War The Railroad and The Outlaws  we follow the Prescott family led at first by Zebulon Karl Malden as they head for the frontier and encounter mountain man Linus Rawlings a woefully miscast James Stewart. Rawlings falls for eldest daughter Eve Carroll Baker and the family spread out from there. Hathaway directs three of the five with the best being the Outlaws section which pits George Peppard's Zeb Rawlings. a marshal against bandit Charlie Gant Eli Wallach and delivers a setpiece on top of moving train which is as technically impressive as anything made today a stuntman almost died during the filming.Ford's Civil War segment is the slightest but offers an interesting insight into the war. In one fantastic scene General Ulysses S.

	onyx:emotionText "Very much like IMAX's grandiose stand against the emergence of internet streaming BluRay and the 'Golden Age of Television' the 1950's saw studios battling against the arrival of a television in every home and used the likes of 3D and 'Spook Show Spectaculars' to draw the public in. Another shortlived fad was Cinerama a process of shooting with three synchronised cameras and creating an ultra widescreen effect in the process. It was a headache for film makers notably John Ford and special cinemas had to be built to house the format that required three projectors and a deeply curved screen.Also like IMAX Cinerama was intended mainly for documentaries but its immediate success meant that it wouldn't be too long before studios started to turn to features. The first was The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm in 1962 and How the West Was Won came later the same year. The latter is the most ambitious telling a story stretching 50 years across three generations and boasting a cast of '24 great stars' as the poster informs us taking us through the major events of America's expansion further west and employing four firstrate directors  John Ford Henry Hathaway George Marshall and the uncredited Richard Thorpe  to bring it to life.Whilst the ambition can only be admired How the West Was Won is a mixed bag. In part a roughandtumble oldfashioned western that offers differing perspectives of America's venture out west as Henry Fonda's grizzled buffalo hunter Jethro Stuart laments the bloody consequences of the railroad's arrival under the command of Richard Widmark's ruthless and treatydismissing overseer the film also cannot resist the lure of grand songanddance numbers with Debbie Reynolds husky voice and kneeslapping becoming tiresome very quickly. It also keeps the audience at a huge distance both emotionally and literally. With so much picture being captured actors are routinely squeezed into the centre of the frame with their facial expressions too far away to see.Broken up into 5 segments  The Rivers The Plains The Civil War The Railroad and The Outlaws  we follow the Prescott family led at first by Zebulon Karl Malden as they head for the frontier and encounter mountain man Linus Rawlings a woefully miscast James Stewart. Rawlings falls for eldest daughter Eve Carroll Baker and the family spread out from there. Hathaway directs three of the five with the best being the Outlaws section which pits George Peppard's Zeb Rawlings. a marshal against bandit Charlie Gant Eli Wallach and delivers a setpiece on top of moving train which is as technically impressive as anything made today a stuntman almost died during the filming.Ford's Civil War segment is the slightest but offers an interesting insight into the war. In one fantastic scene General Ulysses S. Grant Harry Morgan drunkly ponders his effectiveness to General William Sherman John Wayne as the young Zeb Rawlings listens demonstrating Ford's lack of fear in showing a brittler side to a man considered an unshakeable American hero. But Ford and the film in general never really commits to the themes it hints at and this is ultimately what makes How the West Was Won such a frustrating experience.

	schema:headline " Excellent Epic Western";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an excellent movie. I gave it 7 out of 10 IMDb stars which is a very high score for me. It did very well in my ranking system accumulating 17 points. This places it comfortably inside my top 20 all time Westerns although my project is far from complete. Here's what I liked I love multigenerational narratives i.e. stories that follow sets of families as they live and die through several decades. This is an extremely effective way to present historical fiction and was perfected by one of my favorite authors James Michener. In 1974 Michener published his own excellent grand pioneer novel called Centennial . This was made into a pretty good TV miniseries in 1978. I like the epic sweep of the film historically and geographically telling stories from the Erie Canal pioneers all the way to the end of the West lawmen. Many parts and scenes were very effective in terms of sentimentality especially when George Peppard's character returns home from war and passes his mother's tombstone. Those who are familiar with my ranking system will understand how much I appreciated an entire section devoted to the Civil War. The movie also treated its Indian characters multidimensionally. Although it did contain an important Mexican character played very well by Eli Wallach it failed to allude effectively to the broad Hispanic culture of the region. In a longer miniseries format I'm sure this would not have been neglected. This omission kept the movie from busting the maximum three point score in my Civil WarIndianMexico category. It's a great looking film of course with lots of big budget on location set pieces. It must have been quite an audio visual experience in the theater for 1962 audiences. Even on a home TV the rapids scene the buffalo stampede and the train wreck are quite harrowing. The music and soundtrack were well done with many period folks songs and lots of sweeping orchestral music to match the many natural landscapes that were filmed. I thought the characters were well developed i.e. I was able to really care about a lot of them. The stories moved along nicely and there were only a few plot holes. Gratuitous romantic female roles are a common fault in Westerns. This movie had two strongly developed female characters the sisters played by Debbie Reynolds and Carroll Baker. The more I watch Carroll Baker the more I like her. She was great in The Big Country and Cheyenne Autumn as well. Now here's what kept the movie from being better This opinion might surprise some but I thought the casting was a weakness in the movie. All star casts are awkward. It was kind of like watching a rock and roll Hall of Fame awards show where Bob Dylan Eric Clapton Jimmy Page and Bruce Springsteen all get up on stage together and play a Beatles song. They all get in each other's way so much no single musician has an opportunity to display his individual artistry. The result is usually an incomprehensible mess. In movies pairing so many superstars together doesn't present as big a problem as in music. These guys were all excellent in their cameos. I particularly enjoyed Henry Fonda as the super scout. My point is simply that you're not getting the full benefit of having Henry Fonda in the movie when his role is so limited. I'm also not against this type of ensemble casting. I had fun watching all these old pros especially since they are the veterans of so many other Westerns. I just think it would have been a much stronger movie if they had turned over a primary role to Wayne or Fonda. As it was the real coleads of the movie were Debbie Reynolds and George Peppard. Although they were both very good in this the bottom line is that the weakest actors had the biggest parts Even with almost three hours of running time they bit off more history than they could really chew. This needed a six hour TV mini series format and that might not have been enough. As a result the movie suffers from being a mile wide and an inch deep.".

Growing up a fan of westerns and loving the West and its beautiful history I've claimed this one as my alltime favorite movie. I found the love scenes between Eve and Linus the most romantic I'd ever witnessed and to this day it still gives me goose bumps. Eve knew her heart and her boldness with the resisting Linus is just wonderful. I still get a tear when Eve lets her son Zeb leave for the war. When she comments that he must take off his shirt so that she can wash it it's the only one he has and she pats his shoulder I feel my motherly instincts crying for my own son. It still moves me deeply. And when she drops to her knees praying at her father's grave it's simply heartwrenching. But just the scenery alone would have done it for me. Add the beautiful score and it's over the top. Yes the critics saw many flaws in this epic. They are the professionals who understood the problems of the split screens the sometimes less than realistic writing some obviously fake scenery wasn't there at least one cardboard saguaro cactus in the train scene? the toolong running time the weak characters for major actors on and on. But for me I've enjoyed my original 33 rpm album soundtrack all these years became a national park ranger traveled and lived all over the West and today still find the main characters of the story close to my heart. It was a lifeaffecting movie for all the right reasons. Entertainment doesn't get any better than that. I recently found the whole movie soundtrack on a double CD set that is really incredible. It contains extensive tracks not heard on the original album and is absolutely a must for any HTWWW fan.".

For a western I was shocked years later to view this on widescreen VHS and discover the number of songs in here most by Debbie Reynolds. Early on I wondered if I wasn't watching a musical rather than a western.The real story of this movie it would seem is the cast. If you want to see a Who's Who of the time period then you have to check this film out. Narrated by Spencer Tracy it features  in alphabetical order  Carroll Baker Lee J. Cobb Henry Fonda Carolyn Jones Karl Malden Gregory Peck George Peppard Robert Preston Reynolds James Stewart Eli Wallach John Wayne and Richard Widmark and a bunch more. Are you kidding me???!!!!!This was also one of the first Cinerama widescreen films put on a VHS tape I think. I was anxious to see it in that format but then disappointed there weren't more panoramic scenes. Outside of two  a buffalo stampede and a train robbery  the scenery was just fair.Peppard had the best part of the film in my opinion. He was featured in the final third. The film seemed divided into three distinct segments. Stewart was the key man in the first third and Peck in the middle. Baker and Reynolds provided the eye candy. I was surprised how small a role Wayne had in here.The VHS box says the movie is 162 minutes long but it you eliminate three overtures the eginning the intermission and ending you can chop off another 15 minutes of actual footage. In summary the cast is the only thing special as the story and the songs are just soso.".

Debbie Reynolds does carry through as the linchpin connecting the scenes together and she is perfect at doing it. The speed of the story telling is brisk and never allows a soap opera feeling to take hold. This is a major reason for hoping that NO REMAKE will be done. It also scares me to imagine which of the current lightweights would be allowed to work in it. I smell a soap opera chick flick! Mamma Mia goes west  UGH!!Now that this great movie is available on DVD there is no need to invest in any more than buying a copy.

	schema:reviewBody "FAR NORTH is a bleak disturbing story about isolation relationships and revenge. Director Asif Kapadia adapted this minimal dialogue screenplay with Tim Miller based on the story 'True North' by Sara Maitland and even with the strong trio of actors have managed to maintain the main character as the vast natural incomprehensibly difficult ice seas of the northern cap of the globe. The film is as majestically beautiful as the story is terrifying. Saiva Michelle Yeoh was pronounced evil by a shaman who witnessed her birth any person who comes near her will fall to harm. Cast out from her tribe Saiva has survived into adulthood accompanied by the young girl Anja Michelle Krusiec she has raised living a simple existence in tents dependent on any available food and always in hiding from a strange pursuing army of soldiers flashbacks show how Saiva had been physically abused by this strange band of wandering men. When danger approaches the two women simply move on. Saiva finds an injured and starving soldier Yoki Sean Bean who is likewise escaping from the marauding band and brings him into her tent nursing him to health exchanging signs of friendship to a stranger that seems so natural yet so foreign to guarded Saiva. As Yoki recovers Anja's curiosity about love and men is heightened and soon Anja and Yoki are planning to strike out on their own. When Saiva witnesses the passion between the two people in her life she reacts as a threatened animal and the horrors that follow echo across the frozen ice of her isolated life. Michelle Yeoh is astonishingly fine in this difficult role and Krusiec and Bean provide solid ensemble support. Praise must go to Asif Kapadia for his tense direction of this thriller but kudos are also in order for the extraordinary cinematography by Roman Osin and the appropriately eerie musical score by Dario Marianelli. Much of what happens in this film is shocking to the viewer's senses but it so in keeping with the animal responses in nature that it says much about our concept of 'civilization'. FAR NORTH is a remarkable achievement. Highly recommended. Grady Harp".

Greed survival and the need to be loved.When Saiva Michelle Yeoh was born her tribe shaman told her mother that she would grow to be evil and that everyone close to her would die. So as soon as she is old enough she is banished to travel and live alone. But she soon meets a tribe when they are rounding up the caribou and she becomes close to one man in particular.Then the Russians invade their land and she comes back from a short trip to discover soldiers have killed the whole tribe except her man friend and a baby. They are still there though and they rape her after slitting the man's throat. She escapes with the baby though we are never sure whether it is her daughter or someone else's. We cannot be sure of the time frame in these flashbacks as Kapadia has left this open to interpretation.I'm not sure whether this is good or bad good in the sense that spectators can defend Saiva's actions at the end if they so wish or bad because it requires less effort to speculate on facts rather than assumptions.The ending itself is truly disturbing it kept me thinking and reflecting for days on end. 'Disturbing' was the word I used to describe it to others quickly adding that this was a good film. I did enjoy it the scenery itself was almost overwhelmingly beautiful and was matched in its beauty by the cinematography. The performance from Yeoh was lovely to watch and in my opinion her character was easy to make an allegiance with as I could understand her reasons for doing what she did at the end.Her performance was strongly supported by Michelle Krusiec and Sean Bean although it could perhaps be said that Krusiec made her character a bit too ahead of her time. And judging by the ending for Mr. Bean I think I can safely assume that he'll be staying in climates above 0 degrees Celsius for quite sometime...wearing as many layers as possible.".

	schema:headline " Absorbing and terrifying in equal measure Far North didn't reach very far in terms of audiences but is certainly one to seek out.";
	schema:reviewBody "Somewhat underlooked British director Asif Kapadia's 2007 film Far North opens with a rather exquisite tracking shot which sweeps across a very large very open ice glacier that is shown to be split in several areas and thus beginning to fall apart. The manner in which Kapadia's film opens echoes the manner in which it closes with a similar tracking shot over what appears to be the same spread of ice  both sequences are representative of both the society within the film as well as the motherdaughter bond two people of that ilk share and experience throughout. Cracks are initially there as if something is melting or falling apart and are apparent in the opening shot while the condition of the glacier at the very end is representative of just how far things have come between the two people and the world around them as we witness those respective horrors and see the condition of the ice at the end.Unfolding in a large and ice cold location which is wide enough to encompass Russian soldiers people whose names sound Nordic as well as characters whom might well be of either Kazakh or Tajik descent although shot in Norway the film covers the trials and experiences of a middle aged woman named Saiva Yeoh and her adopted younger daughter named Anja Krusiec. Saiva and Anja's basic but brutal way of life is thrust into our faces by way of some shock tactics of animalistic levels in which an animal itself is on the wrong end of some harm. This rather shocking sequence of raw predicament and mustdo human survival consequently sets the overall tone of the film that raw look at how human beings act and react when push turns to shove and emotions sensations and predicaments must be confronted. Throughout murder and savagery is the order of the day and desperate scenarios are used as the basis for the human mind to act as the subject of the study.The film is narrated to us by Saiva whose opening speech tells us of how a village elder of some description once told her many years ago that she would bring death and wrongdoing to whomever she cared for or just generally loved. Looking up the daughter's name Anja on Wikipedia sees you directed to 'Anya' which I read translates out of Russian and into English as 'bringing goodness' thus interestingly contradicting Saiva's supposed curse.

It unfolds a stark harsh narrative amidst the backdrop of a stunning locale in which unflinching content and the dire realities of life under these conditions particularly in regards to garnering food by way of killing animals is given as much focus as the characters themselves. The film's opinion of sex as an item or event that destroys and tears apart is reinforced when two people move closer by way of makinglove although it destroys someone else's link to both of them and also when a hideous realisation is made during an additional sex scene.

	onyx:emotionText "Somewhat underlooked British director Asif Kapadia's 2007 film Far North opens with a rather exquisite tracking shot which sweeps across a very large very open ice glacier that is shown to be split in several areas and thus beginning to fall apart. The manner in which Kapadia's film opens echoes the manner in which it closes with a similar tracking shot over what appears to be the same spread of ice  both sequences are representative of both the society within the film as well as the motherdaughter bond two people of that ilk share and experience throughout. Cracks are initially there as if something is melting or falling apart and are apparent in the opening shot while the condition of the glacier at the very end is representative of just how far things have come between the two people and the world around them as we witness those respective horrors and see the condition of the ice at the end.Unfolding in a large and ice cold location which is wide enough to encompass Russian soldiers people whose names sound Nordic as well as characters whom might well be of either Kazakh or Tajik descent although shot in Norway the film covers the trials and experiences of a middle aged woman named Saiva Yeoh and her adopted younger daughter named Anja Krusiec. Saiva and Anja's basic but brutal way of life is thrust into our faces by way of some shock tactics of animalistic levels in which an animal itself is on the wrong end of some harm. This rather shocking sequence of raw predicament and mustdo human survival consequently sets the overall tone of the film that raw look at how human beings act and react when push turns to shove and emotions sensations and predicaments must be confronted. Throughout murder and savagery is the order of the day and desperate scenarios are used as the basis for the human mind to act as the subject of the study.The film is narrated to us by Saiva whose opening speech tells us of how a village elder of some description once told her many years ago that she would bring death and wrongdoing to whomever she cared for or just generally loved. Looking up the daughter's name Anja on Wikipedia sees you directed to 'Anya' which I read translates out of Russian and into English as 'bringing goodness' thus interestingly contradicting Saiva's supposed curse. The two seem to have gotten along rather well for all these years what could possibly go wrong? Saiva and Anja travel around quite a bit in fact they travel a lot.

Savia is the Exile cursed from birth to bring destruction to those around her she is also the Witch who once spurned by the fleeing neardead Adventurer exacts revenge on her Ward by stealing her face to entice and deceive her spurning Lover. In a sense Bean's Loki pays the price for choosing the physical beauty and youth of Krusiec's Anja over gratitude to his Saviour Saiva who by the way when he asks 'How can I repay you? Savia replies 'We shall see' implying she sees he has the debt of his life owing to herAn interesting addendum to this is that 'Loki' is the Scandinavian Trickster or Fool much as he appears at the beginning of the film carrying his belongings this time on a sledge. Unlike the wise Fool who pays his debt however he takes the path of the real Fool and spurns the one who saves him. For this both have then to pay the price.Beautifully shot and directed in lengthening the story it resembles many folktales of many cultures.".

The brutally sudden transition at the end when Saiva apparently ceases to be the damaged but recognizably human personality she has been for the previous 85 minutes and suddenly becomes an automated machine of mythic destruction simply does not work the transition does not add an interesting twist or take the story onto another level it's simply a noisy and inept crashing of narrative gears that becomes more irritating the more I think about it. The character Saiva as beautifully portrayed by Michelle Yeoh in the main realistic body of the film could simply never perform the actions the story gives her at the end out of such a banal motive as sexual jealousy  the only plausible motivation she is given. The person who struggled to shake off the curse her tribe had hung around her neck would not suddenly embrace it to this ridiculous extent.So are we meant to read back this mythic take into the rest of the at first glance realistic story? If so the setting is a problem The clothing and speech seem to indicate a Siberian setting. Does it become mythic because a couple of the Chukchi reindeer herders appear inexplicably to hail from Mumbai rather than Chukotka? Not really  it just looks ridiculous. The rifles are plainly later 20th century the outboard motor suggests a date sometime after 1960 and the windup radio places it after 1996 Trevor Baylis invented the idea in 1989 Baygen produced the first commercial models in 1996. So what war were Russian soldiers fighting in Siberia after 1996? Sorry but you can't have it both ways if you put your story in such a distinctly real place and such a recent time you can't expect people to accept it as a mythic anytime or a fictitious anywhere. Kapadia's earlier film Warrior was similarly set in a location and period that couldn't quite be pinned down but that didn't present a problem because the period in question was at least several centuries safely in the past. He should have remembered that example this time round or for a similar idea in an Arctic setting he should have looked at Nils Gaup's wonderful and consistently mythic Ofelas Pathfinder 1987 not the dreadful 2007 remake. The reviewer for Variety hit the nail on the head the climax of Far North requires a suspension of disbelief the pic doesn't earn.I'm giving this film 6 stars simply in recognition of two wonderful performances from Michelle Yeoh and Sean Bean who both portray the uncertainties and vulnerabilities of real human beings in what they must have assumed was intended to be a realistic setting.What the film demonstrates surprisingly is that mythic archetypes do not actually provide much insight into human psychology  they were simply the best adumbrations of human types that preliterate societies could come up with. Anyone who's read a novel by George Eliot or Hermann Hesse or Hardy or Mann has access to far richer truer more complex and more convincing portrayals of human personalities than were available to the ancient Greeks Egyptians Chinese or anyone else. It's three dimensions instead of one colour instead of black and white.".

Forced out of her tribe she lives nomadically with only her grownup daughter for company. Theirs is a never ending routine of handtomouth survival and constant relocation to ever more lonely shores.

Once Sean Bean's on therun Soldier arrives to upset the balance of their simple existence it soon becomes apparent that Saiva shares much in common with the ice pack surrounding her.So effectively does Asif conjure the quiet contemplative mood and pace of much Scandinavian or Russian cinema that it comes as quite a shock when the main trio of characters open their mouths which they do only rarely and talk in English. The point is that it does not matter what language they speak as the location and even the precise period of this story is kept deliberately vague. Just as it matters not what strange language it is that the other invading soldiers speak to themselves only that it is not familiar. They are the aliens here.For much of its short running time not a lot seems to be happening here but there is not a wasted moment or unnecessary scene. Judicious use of flashbacks provide insight into the moments that have forged Saiva's tough and ruthless survival instincts. While in the present much is communicated in silence by the glances of desire and jealousy that the trio exchange. Sean Bean comfortably inhabits the role of decent but morally weak man but it's Michelle Yeoh's steely haunted central performance that grabs and pulls you in. Like some MerchantIvory period drama stripped of all its airs and finery we are in a world of suppressed emotions and mounting tensions. The palpable sense that something has to give is the overriding drive towards the startling climax.".

The combination of image and sound in the film is meditative such beautiful images as the Aurora Borealis the great snowy mountains and the rolling hills so covered in impenetrable whiteness that it is hard not to be lost in their banal perfection entirely unforgettable. Largely a threehander the film's performances are the tentpoles which support it the particularly commendable quietness of Michelle Yeoh lending a dignified tragedy to her character.

The cold whites and blues of the arctic are contrasted wonderfully with the warm yellows and oranges of Saiva's flashback to times when she was with her community when she had love friendship and hope. It is difficult not to be saddened by the melancholy the film presents punctuated though it is by moments of silent beauty.An entrancing spectacle Far North offers the very best of the fine combination one can craft with cinematography and setting.

I don't think it does.Most of the film is in a very realistic mode and only toward the end did the characters stop being people one could care about and become only tragic archetypes. I have to say I felt somewhat betrayed for caring so much for the characters. Perhaps if I'd been forewarned I would have watched with more detachment and been less disappointed.Still it's a beautiful film the arctic landscape is awe inspiring. It must have been a great adventure to film. Sean Bean Michelle Yeoh and Michelle Krusiec do an excellent job but it seems like a waste in the end. 610 for being an interesting and beautiful failure.".

With no buzz publicity or plot spoilers I had no idea what to expect when I sat down to watch this and I was pleasantly surprised by a film that confounded all of my expectations. The film is almost like a fairy tale in its simplicity a motheranddaughter team living alone in the icy Siberian wastes are joined by a soldier gone A.W.O.L. The film is about what happens next how the power shifts and inevitable romance affects each character and three people in such an isolated setting can never really work.Visually the film is stunning. The inhospitable climate is a personality all in itself and the harshness of the landscape is captured in stunning detail  no more so than in the shocking opening sequence. There isn't a great deal of dialogue but what we do get is natural and realistic. Key flashbacks add to the viewer's understanding and the film finishes on a shocking twist. Best of all is the acting three actors giving excellent against the grain performances.Michelle Krusiec is the young unknown holding her own against two experienced hands. Sean Bean is a gentle and romantic man giving a more touching performance than we usually see. Michelle Yeoh is the older woman an outsider struggling to come to terms with the meaning of her life. Out of all three it's Yeoh who gives the most stunning performance she's totally cast against type usually playing a kickass kung fu heroine and she gets her character across wonderfully.

	schema:reviewBody "I started watching this movie on a lark really I saw what looked like Sean Bean on the poster but without his name listed on the display and was simply curious to see if it was actually him. I'm terribly glad that I did.The movie is simply beautiful fantastically shot and with very effective use of sound long swaths of icy water creaking and crackling in transition from scene to scene in perfect marriage with the mood of the film. The performances are stellar all around and the arc and the pace of the story are such that the ending will catch you entirely offguard thinking there must be at least another halfhour or so of resolution prior to the lead's brutal decision.The criticisms I see of this film are odd ones. First off that the timeperiod which is intentionally left quite ambiguous but is also clearly relatively modern doesn't lend itself to the nature of the story. That couldn't be more wrong to my mind as it was important to convey that these two women are living 'out of time' made into things of myth by the cruel label of their culture and their selfimposed isolation... people who don't really 'belong' in any age past or future.The other criticism I see is that the character's final actions are unbelievable as Saiva seemed too good a person and 'her only possible motivation could be sexual jealousy' which is inadequate. This too is just plain wrong and rooted in two assumptions the first being that we got to know Saiva well which we most certainly didn't. We know she was banished we know she had a husband who was brutally murdered we know she was raped we know she found a baby we know she killed several men. That is all we know about her. What we infer about who she ishow she feels from that is just supposition clearly incorrect in most cases. The second assumption is that sexual jealousy was the only motivation. This is hugely incorrect. Loneliness was the motivation the crushing isolation she had faced before and faced again now that her 'daughter' and Loki were leaving. She was jealous yes supremely so but it wasn't just sexual jealousy. Her envy was of a loving life a life in which she could love and be loved something she only got the very briefest taste of when she married only for her new family to be slaughtered before it could bear fruit. She wanted to be Anja young and uncursed with a future and a man and children of her own. She could have accepted being a third wheel the older 'concubine' and was trying once Anja and Loki started making love unabashedly to squeeze her way into that role. When it turned out to be in vain and Anja and Loki decided to abandon her it clearly pushed her over the edge she'd probably been walking all of her life. She didn't make that grisly disguise for the sake of simple lust and brutal womanly rivalry it was psychotic episode the straw that broke the camel's back in a long life of horror and crushing loneliness and tossed her to the teeth of a madness that had probably been circling her all of her days.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film impressed me with its picturesque of icelands and its nature. I had already known that the film would be slow on progress. I had had no background info about the film such as it was a tale of Sara or had a dark topic. Luckily i hadn't. It became more fun to watch and to be shocked in the end.In our normal lives jealousy has a potential power on how we behave some people. Jeaoulsy brings the anger with itself. We hate people whom we feel jealous at. But we are living in a social environment where there are restrictions so we cannot expose our anger when or where i want.In the middle of nowhere during world war II a mother with her only daughter try to survive eating even their dogs. They sleep hugging each other for years. one day a strangers comes up. the mother likes him and her daughter too. Just before the mother gives her first kiss to him the daughter shows up and steals the handsome guy from her hands. here i felt from the mother that something is really bad going to happen. A love begins between the guy and the daughter. One day the daughter says that she will leave with the guy and let the mother alone in the hell out of the ices. The mother cant help her anger because she will be left by her only daughter who doesn't even know the guy enough and by the guy who once put a kiss to herself and makes her remember her husband died. Because of these two reasons she killed her daughter and the guy caused him to be friezed outside naked. It of course seemed not normal to me and i know it is against human rights  But come on guys we are watching film here! It is nowhere in the middle of icelands and it is in the past.

I had had no background info about the film such as it was a tale of Sara or had a dark topic. Luckily i hadn't. It became more fun to watch and to be shocked in the end.In our normal lives jealousy has a potential power on how we behave some people. Jeaoulsy brings the anger with itself. We hate people whom we feel jealous at. But we are living in a social environment where there are restrictions so we cannot expose our anger when or where i want.In the middle of nowhere during world war II a mother with her only daughter try to survive eating even their dogs. They sleep hugging each other for years. one day a strangers comes up. the mother likes him and her daughter too. Just before the mother gives her first kiss to him the daughter shows up and steals the handsome guy from her hands. here i felt from the mother that something is really bad going to happen. A love begins between the guy and the daughter. One day the daughter says that she will leave with the guy and let the mother alone in the hell out of the ices. The mother cant help her anger because she will be left by her only daughter who doesn't even know the guy enough and by the guy who once put a kiss to herself and makes her remember her husband died. Because of these two reasons she killed her daughter and the guy caused him to be friezed outside naked. It of course seemed not normal to me and i know it is against human rights  But come on guys we are watching film here! It is nowhere in the middle of icelands and it is in the past. Shaman cursed the girl. Her husband was killed in front of her eyes. She was raped and concluded with the death of 4 Russian guys by her bare hands. What is normal here?!I found the film logical and beautiful.";

It is then revealed that the older girl saved the younger girl from some soldiers. However 70 minutes or so into the film she feels the need to strangle the girl she saved and cut her face off when she reveals she is leaving with the man. Pretty unconvincing stuff.At the start of the film i thought that possibly this film would have a political theme about mining coal in the Tundra but not so. No information is given to WHEN this film is set except for the presence of soldiers so assumingly during war time.Even the scenery isn't convincing the boat scenes on the rivers are clearly backdrops.This film will bore you to death for the vast majority of its duration with an ending that will baffle you and probably make you laugh.

She even believes natural associated processes such as menstruation are a sin about which she has refused to mention to Carrie.

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps one of the only genuinely good Stephen King adaptations Carrie' follows the tragic tale of Carrie White Sissy Spacek a young girl who is continually made to suffer at the hands of her bullying classmates and not helped by her overbearing religious mother Margaret Piper Laurie. Carrie however is not like regular teenagers as she has been blessed? with telekinetic powers and as the inner rage grows within Carrie so it seems do these potentially lethal abilities. Brian De Palma directed this amazingly stylish adaptation of Stephen King's first novel which is arguably the best Stephen King adaptation ever to be made. Sissy Spacek's performance is one of the greatest to ever grace a horror film. Somehow managing to perfectly embody the typical school life of the usual high school outcasts Spacek was able to bring to everyone the appalling life that so many teenagers are forced to tolerate. From the opening scenes where Carrie is utterly humiliated at the hands of her classmates after Carrie's hysterical reaction to her first menstruation to the painfully wretched ending it becomes nigh on impossible not to sympathise with Spacek's character. Spacek was quite rightly Oscarnominated for this performance. Spacek's performance was enhanced by fellow Oscarnominee Piper Laurie in the role of the religiousnut Margaret White. In some ways the naivety shown towards Carrie and what is happening to her is amusing but at the same time it is terrifying to think that any mother could allow her daughter to go though such a generally horrendous life. Piper Laurie was able to make this all too abhorrent character her own with a thoroughly convincing and unsettling performance. De Palma cleverly directs this movie. Instead of immediately introducing us to Carrie's powers he focuses on the torment and the tormentors of Carrie first. This allows the viewer to feel for Carrie and will her towards revenge while ensuring that she is not made into a onedimensional killer. The movie is very well paced and is presented in a brutally clear fashion. De Palma refrains from using any visual effects with the exception of the infamous Prom Night' scene which was incredibly well crafted and immersed the viewer in this horrifying display of rage. The final twenty minutes of Carrie are some of the most intense and gripping moments to have been portrayed in horror cinema. These scenes without a doubt helped to build one of the most artistic and and incredible climaxes in all of film.Carrie' is not for those who just want to see people sliced up or prefer fastpaced horror as it is presented as a heartbreaking drama with a horrifying twist. The magnificent cast which features John Travolta in an early role was also graced with fantastic performances from Betty Buckley as the kindly gym teacher and Nancy Allen as Chris the deplorable ring leader of this atrocious bullying. In my opinion Carrie' is unquestionably worth a look for horror fans. 'Carrie' is very well directed with a superb screenplay from Larry Cohen and featuring two of the greatest performances in horror. My rating for Carrie'  910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Watching the TV remake of Carrie last week just made me miss the original version all the more. There were so many elements that made the 1976 movie a classic but I will try to name just a few...First of all the original actresses could never be replaced. Sissy Spacek as Carrie White goes without saying. Sissy gave Carrie a childlike quality that no other actress can touch. You not only root for Spacek's Carrie but you want to reach in and hug her. Equally irreplacable was Piper Laurie who brings a manic energy to her role as the religiouswacko Mrs. White. I loved how Piper and Sissy's southern accents enhanced their characters. I don't know if it was Stephen King's intention or not but the way Carrie said Momma was just so southern. It was fun seeing Piper and Sissy reunited onscreen as southern sisters in the Grass Harp. Two supporting actresses in the film who get little credit are Amy Irving and Betty Buckley. Irving brought an intelligent thoughtful depth to the character of Sue Snell. Buckley as the caring gym teacher stole every scene she was in. One of the most touching moments was Miss Collins taking Carrie in front of the mirror and telling her that she is a pretty girl. Then the terrible realization on her face as she wonders if it is another cruel joke. And who didn't love it when Buckley slapped Nancy Allen's face?Maybe the single most important element in Carrie is the suspensebuilding music. I can't express how perfectly the music framed every scene. It should have won an oscar for the soundtrack alone. The two beautiful themes still stick in my mind Born To Have It All which was playing in the shower scene and I Never Dreamed Someone Like You Could Love Someone Like Me which Carrie and Tommy danced to at the prom. Even the cheesy band playing at the prom fit the mood just right with the lyrics The Devil's Got a Hold Of Your Soul. Carrie is campy nostalgia. It really is a time capsule of that era in history. The polyester the gym shorts and knee socks the afros and farrahhair just take you back to 1976. Where else can you see the stars of Welcome Back Kotter and Eight Is Enough in the same movie?".

	schema:headline " MELDING OF TWO GREAT ARTISTS";
	schema:reviewBody "Carrie is a melding of two great artists in this case Stephen King who wrote the novel and Brian DePalma who directed the film. This is a tense exciting thriller that is also a sturdy character study. It's hard to make a film that can accomplish both but DePalma does it. King's novel mostly dealt with a telekinetic girl who is cruelly treated by her classmates. DePalma and screenwriter Lawrence Cohen follow the novel fairly closely with the exception of the ending which is a great deal more sensationalistic and better in my opinion. King himself liked the finale and the film as stated in his exceptional study of the horror genre Danse MacabreAs is the case in most DePalma films the technical credits are superb. The cinematography by Mario Tosiis extremely effective colors and shadows have never been shot more effectively in a DePalma film since. The film score is by Pino Donaggio and it marks the first collaboration between Donaggio and DePalma. Bernard Herrmann died shortly after Obsession was completed Donaggio is among the most underrated and overlooked composers of his time. His scores for Dressed to Kill Blow Out and Body Double are all exceptional and all deserved Oscars. Carrie is no less brilliant as it accomplishes what all great scores are supposed to do enhance the film without giving anything away. Paul Hirsch's editing is also extremely effective as it was in Sisters Obsession Blow Out and Raising Cain. But it is the performances that make Carrie stand out. Carrie is played by Sissy Spacek in a performance of such power and strength that she received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress the first actress ever to be nominated for a horror film the second would be Sigourney Weaver for AliensShe manages to hit all the right notes. A lesser actress would have veered toward melodrama. Spacek plays the role more realistically and the film is much more effective that way. Just in case you didn't know Spacek was a DePalma regular but offscreen she was the art director for several of his early pictures. Also Carrie marked the return of Piper Laurie to films after a toolong hiatus her last credit was The Hustler Here she plays Carrie's mother. Again a lesser actress would have veered toward melodrama but Laurie resists the temptation. Her performance is a real knockout and also garned an Oscar nomination she should have won but typical Academy genius set in and gave the prize to Beatrice Straight who was in Network for a whopping 10 minutes and really didn't do much.Also as a side note this film also is a start for some future DePalma regulars such as John Travolta his first major studio film and Nancy Allen her first major roleWhat I really liked about Carrie is the absolutely perfect ending. I had commented before that Sisters had an absolutely perfect ending. The one thing about Brian DePalma is that he knows how to end a picture. Dressed to Kill had a really good one although some people hated it as well as Blow Out. The Fury has the greatest ending of all the DePalma thrillers. A small note to finish In 1999 Carrie 2 was made by profiteers at MGM. Despite a rich premise the film was an artistic failure.  DePalma had nothing to worry about. The sequel retread might be a better word lacks everything that makes DePalma's original so good. Rent or buy the original on tape in panandscan or widescreenand DVD widescreenand forget the sequel even if they give it away. out of 4 stars".

	schema:reviewBody "Carrie boomed Sissy Spacek's and John Travolta's career. I understand why.Carrie starts off at a gym locker room where we find out how much the other kids hate Carrie. But we find out that Carrie has some powers. Like in other Stephen King bookmovies the supernatural aspect is only minor compared to the rest of the story but it comes into play at the end. Carrie's mom Piper Laurie is an overprotective religious zealot who makes The Royal Tenenbaums seem normal. So Carrie tries to cope with her horrible life but it's getting tougher and tougher.Spacek is exceptional as Carrie and I now know why she was nominated for Best Actress. Her emotions are real not some fake tear drops that make us think she's sad. Either she has great motivation or she's one of the best actresses of the century or both!. Laurie was equally good as her mother who locks Carrie up in a closet everytime she thinks that Carrie has sinned. This movie wouldn't be half of what it was if the acting wasn't so great. When Carrie was sad you were sad. When the other kids ridiculed her you felt like you wanted to kill the kids. When she smiled you smiled. Emotions that raw couldn't come from just any movie.If you know me I'm a stickler for character developement. Carrie didn't take much time but from the opening scene you knew about Carrie and her weakness. So are the secondary characters they're nicely developed even if their role isn't that major. Travolta had a miniscule role but he was fine in it it led to Grease and Saturday Night Fever.The prom scene has got to be one of the most memorable scenes from a horror movie. That red tint is awesome it's like a premonition. In fact the movie is full of premonition the red tint the freaky looking voodoo doll They're all going to laugh at you. I'm assuming that director Brian De Palma meant to put that in so it just isn't about some supernatural powers it's also about foreshadowing. Also I dig that camera movement during the dancing.The blood and gore wasn't held back but they just put in what was necessary. De Palma obviously stole from Hitchcock's Psycho mainly the music cue whenever Carrie is using her telepathy. Also her school Bates High is another Psycho refrence.Carrie was also very creepy. It wasn't a thrillaminute but at the ending that was Scary with a capital S. The last ten or twenty minutes were scareinducing for sure. That last jump scene in the dream...wow! It's still jumping at me. If there was one complaint I had to do about the movie it's that it took too much time to get to main scene and the prom went on a little too long but other than that it's a first class horrrorthriller that any horror buff needs to see.My rating 810Rated R for nudity some language and blood.".

I honestly don't understand the it's not scary mentality!Now whether you want to call this horror film or thriller or whatever else is up to you but I think Carrie's scope cannot reaches beyond just one genre! It is a thriller but at the same time a very humane movie. You can feel the girl hurting you hate her mother you dislike her friends! This movie wasn't made for cheap scares every scene is brilliantly captured. The scary parts may be rare but when they are there you just can't move from your seat!The acting is also excellent Sissy Spacek of course deserving most of the credit but that is not to say that the other actors aren't great too.Concerning the script all the credit goes of course to Stephen King. When you see this movie you can really tell the difference between an artist like him an some cheap Hollywood writer Scream?. There is so much more to the story than Booooo! Aaaaaa!So if you want to see a scary movie go see Scream or some other shallow horror film. However if you are looking for a terrifying but also moving film Carrie is just right for you. And please if you must put this work of art into one genre its  better if you put it in social drama rather than horror film. Of course it's not scary! It's MUCH more than just that.".

We all know in this day and age that teenage girls are wicked bullies and the damage inflicted by their relentless bullying is often irreparable. But you don't need those books. Most of us who have watched the film Carrie already know the devastating effect that merciless torment can have upon us. That's why we watched the film  to see those bullies get what they deserve and to cheer Carrie on every step of the way. Carrie is an abused teenager with a void where her selfesteem should be. Her mother is a whacko religious nut who likes to violently throw Carrie around for imagined sins and lock her in the closet for days on end. Her schoolmates are spoiled rotten Clique Queens who enjoy attacking anyone less popular than they are for no reason at all other than that it amuses them. Carrie becomes their main target when her period  incredibly late  finally arrives one day in the locker room shower. Carrie who has never been sexually educated and is under the impression that she is bleeding to death freaks out. Of course her classmates find this terribly amusing. With her the onset of her menstrual cycle her dormant powers of telekinesis suddenly wake and cannot be controlled anymore than her newly awakened raging hormones can be. Unfortunately no one is aware of this. As Carrie dares to stand up to her mother and begins to break out of her shell her cruel and sadistic classmates have a plan to keep her in her place forever. Too bad they don't know how dangerous all that suppressed anger can be. Carrie gets her revenge on them all and the climax of the film is a bloody fiery apocalypse as Carrie unleashes her pent up anger along with her powers and literally lets them run their ferocious course.Carrie is not so much a horror film as it is a psychological one. The human mind is capable of horrors that no movie camera or special effects crew can reproduce and the abused psyche is a monster that no one wants to see unleashed. It features great performances by Sissy Spacek as the severely damaged Carrie Piper Laurie as her delusional mother Amy Irving as the one teenage girl with a streak of compassion and guilt and Nancy Allen as every nerds nightmare  the Popular Girl with no morals no feelings and no mercy.For having been written by a man Stephen Kings first novel this is a powerful portrait of what it is like to be a teenage girl...and an outcast one at that. The hope the anger and frustration all are strong and realistically portrayed. This is a film about the monster within us all.".

	schema:headline " the first postmodern horror film";
	schema:reviewBody "At its heart Carrie is not a 'horror film' but a film about horror.The subject matter is physical and emotional abuse time and time again DePalma returns to the theme of abuse to create a sense of anxiety and dread.  And although our hapless heroine is the primary target of abuse from her mother her peers and 'authority' abuse is also meted out liberally to othersviolence against women TravoltaAllen and public humiliation by authority figures Buckleyher gym class also add to the discomfort level  the John TravoltaNancy Allen relationship is defined solely by abuseand they in turn are the initiators of Carrie's humiliation.Except for Betty Buckley's gym teacher all the characters are cartoonish archetypesand almost all of these achetypes are brilliantly drawn. Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie deservedly have been singled out for praise but DePalma even managed to get the right performance out of decidedly untalented performers like Nancy Allen William Katt who is immeasurably aided by the kind of meticulous lighting that would have made Joan Crawford envious and P.J. Soles.Buckley deserves special mention because she does amazing things with a completely underwritten role.  By humanizing what could have been just one more cartoon the lesbian gym teacherlesbianism is never mentioned but Buckley's subtle performance affirms what she has acknowledged in interviewsthat she played her character as a lesbian she provides a central point of reality that keeps the film from spinning completely out of control.DePalma's intent was clearly not to scare the audience but to make the audience watch the film from a distance deliberately plagarizing two of the most notable sequences in film historyHitchcock's shower sequence and Eisenstein's use of the threeperspective split screen.  The shower scene takes place early in the film cuing the audience into the fact that this is a film ABOUT film.  And in the climactic prom sequence DePalma distances himself and the audience from the bloodbath on the screen by reminding us through the 'theft' from Eisenstein that its just a movie at the most critical moment.There are two significant flaws in the film.  For some reason DePalma interjected a 'fast forward' comedy sequence involving the purchase of tuxedosthe sequence serves no purpose in the film other than to restate the obvious fact that this is 'just a movie'.The second flaw is Amy Irving's performance.  Its not horrible by any means but it just doesn't work.

	onyx:emotionText "At its heart Carrie is not a 'horror film' but a film about horror.The subject matter is physical and emotional abuse time and time again DePalma returns to the theme of abuse to create a sense of anxiety and dread.  And although our hapless heroine is the primary target of abuse from her mother her peers and 'authority' abuse is also meted out liberally to othersviolence against women TravoltaAllen and public humiliation by authority figures Buckleyher gym class also add to the discomfort level  the John TravoltaNancy Allen relationship is defined solely by abuseand they in turn are the initiators of Carrie's humiliation.Except for Betty Buckley's gym teacher all the characters are cartoonish archetypesand almost all of these achetypes are brilliantly drawn. Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie deservedly have been singled out for praise but DePalma even managed to get the right performance out of decidedly untalented performers like Nancy Allen William Katt who is immeasurably aided by the kind of meticulous lighting that would have made Joan Crawford envious and P.J. Soles.Buckley deserves special mention because she does amazing things with a completely underwritten role.  By humanizing what could have been just one more cartoon the lesbian gym teacherlesbianism is never mentioned but Buckley's subtle performance affirms what she has acknowledged in interviewsthat she played her character as a lesbian she provides a central point of reality that keeps the film from spinning completely out of control.DePalma's intent was clearly not to scare the audience but to make the audience watch the film from a distance deliberately plagarizing two of the most notable sequences in film historyHitchcock's shower sequence and Eisenstein's use of the threeperspective split screen.  The shower scene takes place early in the film cuing the audience into the fact that this is a film ABOUT film.  And in the climactic prom sequence DePalma distances himself and the audience from the bloodbath on the screen by reminding us through the 'theft' from Eisenstein that its just a movie at the most critical moment.There are two significant flaws in the film.  For some reason DePalma interjected a 'fast forward' comedy sequence involving the purchase of tuxedosthe sequence serves no purpose in the film other than to restate the obvious fact that this is 'just a movie'.The second flaw is Amy Irving's performance.  Its not horrible by any means but it just doesn't work.  Irving has grown as an actress since then she was the only decent thing about the execrable sequel to Carrie but the demands made of her in Carrie were beyond her skills at the time it was made.  'Chris' was supposed to be the conscience of the film but winds up as wishywashy.Oh and DON'T watch this film on commercial televisionrent the video.

Made for 1.8 million it made almost 34 million domestically alone. Garnering award nominations something of a rarity for horror movies it also stands proud as one of the most influential movies in the horror genre. Be it the wave after wave of High School based horrors that would follow or the now standard use of the unexpected jolt Carrie has earned its place on any best of horror list. Not bad considering both De Palma and King don't feel it's necessarily a horror film! But that's for discussion elsewhere me thinks.De Palma astutely grabs us from the off after we are quickly introduced to Carrie White on the volleyball court where she subsequently loses the game for her side we shift to the locker room and Carrie takes a shower. Cut to slow motion as the girls lark and pamper themselves in various forms of undress. Shot in steam based soft focus by Tosi as Donaggio's score swirls with playful emotion. Then BAM! Having lulled us in to a false sense of security De Palma brings the blood menstrual blood. It's an attention grabber alright and it's a testament to how great Carrie is that the attention is held right to that jolting finale.

Not a horror film my eye Brian  Stephen.For those who wish to delve into subtexts meanings and motives etc Carrie's a good film for those of that mind. But again that's for discussion elsewhere.

I have seen enough to discriminate the bad from the good the mediocre from the excellent. And Carrie is certainly excellent.OK so the premise is at first glance a little weird and farfetched but hey that's Stephen King. What Stephen King also does is to somehow get these farfetched situations blended in with believable reality. He creates a sort of grey zone between horror and reality. I suppose that's what makes his books frightening enough to entertain millions.Anyway this is not a litterary review. Carrie White Sissy Spacek is a girl in her senior year of high school raised by a fanatically christian woman excellently played by a psycotically frizzyhaired Piper Laurie. She is teased and made fun of because of her naivety and oddness.So a stereotypical bitch girl in Carrie's class looking hideously 70s right down to the 'who wears' short shorts plots a nasty nasty surprise for Carrie. Without giving too much away this surprise comes right at a time when Carrie is truly happy for the first time in her life.It is in this classic scene before and after the prank that you see that Sissy Spacek is perfect as Carrie. She is introduced in the film as a shy oddlooking bland girl. Before the prank she beams and smiles and she is beautiful. The change is truly remarkable. After the prank well she is pretty scary. All these attributes are contained perfectly within Spaceks appearance and acting. It's a shame we don't see her in more movies.The storytelling as I have said in my oneline summary is excellent. The foreshadowing of the prank is subtely and deftly introduced so that the viewer knows in advance what's going to happen. Everyone it seems knows. Everyone but Carrie. We feel sorry for her and are on her side afterwards as well. This is something of a feat to pull off in Hollywood's 'whiteteethbigjawsqueakycleansuperhero' ideal.Carrie's internal development excuse the pun is paced just as well. Her growing rebellions against her mother her realization that there is more to life than bible bashing...all the way through she blooms. The symbolism is perhaps a bit overstated in places Who ever saw a Jesus figure that looked quite like that? but is none the less quite effective and drenches through the film appropriately.Brian DePalma is excellent at making movies that appeal on many levels. As a kid I liked the scary parts. My mother whom I watched it with enjoyed it for the human interaction and the bitchiness of the girls and their 'reward'. I as I have pointed out enjoyed the pacing and the whole imagery of the film. Something for everyone.Oh wait. There is one thing. The sight of Tommy Ross William Katt in his tuxedo is just awful. He is supposed to look sexy  the big catch at the prom  but his huge curly hair and the large lapels on his turqouise suit under his enourmous bow tie serve as a hideous reminder that the seventies were The Decade That Taste Forgot.".

Sissy Spacek conveys emotions of confusion and hysteria powerfully depicted by her facial expressions.  A moment when you can feel pity for Carrie White because of the mean treatment she receives from classmates.Before Carrie1976 Brian De Palma was known for his forays into comedies with exception of Sisters1973 and Obsession1976.  After Carrie1976 De Palma started to become famous for his horrorthriller features which displayed many homages to his fave direrctor Alfred Hitchcock as well as Dario Argento and Mario Bava.  He may not be original when it comes to some of his storylines but at his best makes things entertaining and interesting.  The Prom massacre scene is directed with some finesse although it does feel at times that he goes overboard with the splitscreen effects.  The genius of Carrie1976 is to depict the emotional meltdown of a young woman who is tormented from all sides and fronts.An intriquing look into the behavior and mind set of the teenager and the difficulties that comes with being one.  The performances in the film are quite convincing in showing the cruel and nasty nature that teens who are outsiders go through every day of their life.  Carrie White is portrayed in a sympathetic light whose hidden feelings of anger can be understandable. Chris Hargensenplayed by Nancy Allen is a character you love to hate because of her mean attitude towards Carrie White.  Probably the meanest and most unpleasent character Nancy Allen has played in film.One of the best film adaptations from a Stephen King book besides The Dead Zone1983 and Misery1990.  Definitely introduced the world to the writings of King and ended up making a household name out of him as a writer of horror literature.  The film plays a nice homage from a moment in Deliverance1972 during the final moments of Carrie1976.  The Prom massacre is one of the scariest moments in horror films that would be reworked into the final scene in Ms. 451981.  A classic 1970s horror pic that hasn't lost its touch in creating something so frightening and very much heart chilling.".

	schema:reviewBody "When pickedon high schooler Carrie White discovers to her horror that she's been made the butt of a nasty prank she unleashes her secret powers at the school prom and all hell literally comes loose. This sequence filmed in splitscreen is a canny marvel of technical wizardry twisted imagination and production design check out that gorgeous blaze that erupts behind Sissy Spacek. The cinematographer lights everything up like fluorescent goodies in a candybox the continuity problems with Carrie's appearance here can be overlooked. But Carrie's anger is all encompassingit's a high school holocaustand some of her victims are innocents like the gym teacher played very sensitively by Betty Buckley. Carrie has become as bad as her enemies and director Brian De Palma doesn't seem to understand the irony he's also too interested in girlpeeping although to his credit nobody comes off looking foolish. The picture is fun on the surface but has a depressing undermining that is never quite resolved. Spacek's performance in the lead is flawless Piper Laurie exceptional as her deranged mother it was her comeback role Oscarnominated yet it nearly typed her as a horrormovie actress Nancy Allen P.J. Soles and William Katt are excellent as Carrie's classmates Amy Irving is intriguing as schoolmate Sue who just wants to do the right thing Pauline Kael of The New Yorker complained that Sue's role in the disaster wasn't made clear but I disagree. I think she's conflicted and guilty and wants to help wants to see Carrie bask in some of the glory which she helped create. Although an improvement over the Stephen King source novel Carrie isn't perfect and is weighed down somewhat with dirty jokes and cheap laughs. Certainly it is a stylish picture with beautiful if repetitive music by Pino Donaggio and the final sequence is still being copied today.  from ".

	onyx:emotionText "When pickedon high schooler Carrie White discovers to her horror that she's been made the butt of a nasty prank she unleashes her secret powers at the school prom and all hell literally comes loose. This sequence filmed in splitscreen is a canny marvel of technical wizardry twisted imagination and production design check out that gorgeous blaze that erupts behind Sissy Spacek. The cinematographer lights everything up like fluorescent goodies in a candybox the continuity problems with Carrie's appearance here can be overlooked. But Carrie's anger is all encompassingit's a high school holocaustand some of her victims are innocents like the gym teacher played very sensitively by Betty Buckley. Carrie has become as bad as her enemies and director Brian De Palma doesn't seem to understand the irony he's also too interested in girlpeeping although to his credit nobody comes off looking foolish. The picture is fun on the surface but has a depressing undermining that is never quite resolved. Spacek's performance in the lead is flawless Piper Laurie exceptional as her deranged mother it was her comeback role Oscarnominated yet it nearly typed her as a horrormovie actress Nancy Allen P.J. Soles and William Katt are excellent as Carrie's classmates Amy Irving is intriguing as schoolmate Sue who just wants to do the right thing Pauline Kael of The New Yorker complained that Sue's role in the disaster wasn't made clear but I disagree. I think she's conflicted and guilty and wants to help wants to see Carrie bask in some of the glory which she helped create. Although an improvement over the Stephen King source novel Carrie isn't perfect and is weighed down somewhat with dirty jokes and cheap laughs. Certainly it is a stylish picture with beautiful if repetitive music by Pino Donaggio and the final sequence is still being copied today.  from ";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm coming out I want the world to know.  Diana RossIn Sisters director Brian De Palma has a Siamese twin take on the personality of her homicidal other half. In Obsession he has a daughter takes on an incestuous role largely edited out by studios usurping her dead mother and symbolically marrying her father. In Dressed to Kill he has a transvestite's feminine half killing women in an attempt to instigate a sex change operation. With Carrie which revolves around the tumultuous life of a schoolgirl named Carrie White Sissy Spacek De Palma continues his kinky gender wars. Every woman in Carrie is understood entirely in terms of their own sexual frustrations. Carrie's mother and teacher are middle aged loners. One is a religious fundamentalist the other a lonely romantic. On Carrie's prom night both women vie for Carrie. One views the prom as a vile ritual the other recalls her own prom as a moment of adolescent innocence.The younger generation of women within the film represent a similar polarity. We have Sue a well meaning monogamist who wants to help Carrie and Chrissy a mean nymphomaniac who wants to destroy Carrie. Both their boyfriends take on a similar duality. Chrissy's boyfriend John Travolta is an oversexed alpha male whilst Sue's boyfriend is a kindhearted poet. What's interesting is that both men are submissive to their women as are virtually all male characters in the film. Significantly Carrie begins the film as a child but pushes into womanhood when hen she menstruates in a shower. As Carrie's mother was sexually abused in the past a fact which leads her to both reject femininity and transpose her fears onto her daughter Carrie's own rites of passage is made to seem terrifying. Later Carrie's peers seek to reawaken the woman within her while others seek to destroy it. At the prom these two ideals  repressed femininity vs promiscuity  collide with Carrie in the middle. In either case Carrie has no control over her own sexual identity.Visually De Palma's film is special virtually every sequence idiosyncratically shot. Watch for example how he begins each act with grand brush strokes. In the first he paints Carrie as a loner his camera constantly finding her outside of the crowd. Epitomizing this is a crane shot which begins high above a girl's volleyball court and ends with the camera swooping down and finding Carrie ostracised from the group. The following scene is a dreamy shower sequence. Here various girls are portrayed as naked nymphs in touch with their freeflowing sexuality a far cry from the more repressed Carrie who is once again alone. De Palma's next shot continues this pattern. We're floating through school hallways watching kids go by until we find Carrie all by herself. When Carrie returns to school the next day the camera will again probe the classroom before finding her seated alone at the back.With each act of the film De Palma's camera adapts to reflect changes in Carrie's psychology. Act one she's a loner at school. Act two she's oppressed at home by her mother and God. Act 3 she caught in a tug of war between various female characters. Act 4 Carrie is part of the group. Act 5 Carrie is betrayed by the group. Act 6 Carrie transcends and destroys the group with her newfound powers.Each act is shot with an emphasis on different colours and with its own camera language. The crane shots in the first half mirror the crane shots in the prom sequence only now Carrie is engulfed in crowds of well wishers. When pigs' blood falls upon Carrie a mean prank which echoes earlier humiliating menstruation sequences Carrie is again quickly detached from the group. The film is also bookended by two symbolic shower scenes. In the first Carrie attains womanhood and is mocked for it in the second she revokes it in favour for selfrepression. Here she essentially becomes her repressed mother which De Palma highlights by having Carrie put on her mother's gown.But when her mother ALSO turns against her Carrie is forced to break free. She rejects all these female characters all the school girls are female archetypes and blazes her own trail. Say hello to next generation femininity empowered and answering to no one.Carrie's mother is also a fairly interesting character. As Carrie prepares for the prom her mother prays to herself sexually rocking back and forth with a rosary. Because the absence of sex in her life is replaced by an exaggerated obsession with spirituality her repressed sexual energy is released through this hallowed symbol. The rest of the film is similarly awash with sexuality and overt phallic symbols. Close ups of red lips phallic shower heads carrots castration thin gowns and gym shorts etc. What's also interesting is De Palma's use of the famous music shriek from Psycho. Critics accuse De Palma of stealing from Hitch but the sound effect also makes an interesting statement. Hitchcock's film dealt with an oppressive mother and focused on her damaging effect on her grown son. Carrie is a film devoid of men or sons  though a wholly patriarchal religion weights heavily on Carrie  and instead focuses on oppositions within a kind of female collective.The film's final scene a dream sequence shows the only self sacrificing she gave up her man to help another woman conscientious young woman in the picture Sue haunted by the actions of both herself and womankind as a whole. Of all the dream sequence endings in De Palma's films  and there are many  this is perhaps the most optimistic.8.510  An early De Palma classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Film adaptions of Stephen King books tend to be either really good or really bad. Thankfully this movie falls into the former category. In fact this could be the best King novelturned film ever.At first this movie seems to be your typical high school film. We're introduced at once to Carrie Sissy Spacek and the hellish life that she lives. Everyone at school picks on her and make her life a living hell. As if that wasn't bad enough she lives with her mother Piper Laurie who's a religious fanatic thinks everything is a sin and regularly locks Carrie in the closet. You can't help but sympathise for her.Unknown to everyone however Carrie has telekinetic powers. At first her powers are really underplayed in the film. By the time the prom scene approaches though they become more and more prominent. Carrie uses them against her mother while waiting for her prom date and then she uses them at the prom in a very destructive manner. The whole prom scene is both scary and sad. Sad because Carrie finally has her moment where it looks like she's finally been accepted only to have it all end in humiliation. And it's scary to see her powers come full circle in such a destructive and deadly manner. The scene where she slowly walks out of the gym as it burns is a really chilling moment.While this is a scary movie that has earned its place as a horror classic it's also a really sad movie as well. Carrie's life is miserable from the beginning right to the end. Watching Carrie kill all of her tormenters at the prom is every high school misfit's dream come true. Carrie has her revenge but at what price?Carrie is a classic horror film every horror fan should watch. It's welldirected with the right amount of atmosphere in just the right places and Spacek and Laurie are simply outstanding in their roles. Recommended!".

So it seems to be a properly perfect time for me to watch the original version for the very first time. Brian De Palma has been considered Hitchcock at his time by his devotees the similarity is both haven't received much awardscrammed recognition but arguably De Palma is a lesser player as his oeuvre encompasses more runofthemills but CARRIE is by any standards not among them and it could be his PSYCHO 1960 because De Palma shows off his artistry in a fullfledged sweep.

The motherdaughter faceoff and subsequent house caving into debris scenes may be attributed to produce a more crowdplease impression despite of its lowbudget SFX and the wellexpected surprise at the coda the film could hardly be pigeonholed as a horrorfest as Carrie is ubiquitous in every school every class a bullydefying story has much more drama empathy even after 35 years after its debut which could nicely explain the ground for a remake now. Sissy Spacek is against the grain to portray a teenage girl due to her actual 27 years old age the immense age difference is rarely perceivable if one doesn't know it before and Ms. Spacek is on fire in it renders an extraordinary transformation from vulnerability to malice. Piper Laurie as well doesn't betray her Oscar nomination to give birth to a conflicting mother role which is hauntingly unforgettable. All in all thanks to Stephen King's story to surmount many genre clichs and continue to stagger us with the rosy remake in 2013.".

So when token nice girl Sue Snell Amy Irving decides she wants to build Carrie's confidence by giving up her place at the prom and telling her kind hearted jock boyfriend Tommy Ross William Katt to invite Carrie Carrie's mentor Miss Collins Betty Buckley smells trouble. Sue promises all is well and Tommy ad Carrie run along to the prom. But when Chris and her dimwitted boyfriend Billy John Travolta's second role devise a horrible and humiliating prank they don't take into account what has manifested inside of Carrie after all those years of torment and how it will effect them in the films horrifying and very memorable climax.Brian De Palma's famous horror film adapted from Stephen King's chilling novel is often noted as the ultimate in teenage revenge films. De Palma used his distinctive style to make a chilling and original horror film that really is the best example of 1970's horror the style music clothes acting dialogue and pretty much everything in the film is like a timewarp. The editing very original and you can tell the makers of the film enjoyed creating it.The acting is very fine some of the best in any horror film out there. Sissy Spacek is great as the sympathetic freak but at times you wanna slap her she's so incredibly pathetic. Like when she's screaming about her period running around nude. I can understand that she didn't realise what was happening but running around like a lunatic and bleeding on people through your vagina isn't gonna inspire sympathy from them. But since I read the book I understand that was the intention. Piper Lurie was absolutely fantastic as the looney mother and all the other performances were pretty passable. I have to mention PJ Soles. Her character was so awesome I'd even go as far a to say that she was one of the many highlights of the film. Her character added a quirky charm the film that couldn't be matched by anybody else. Some of the themes explored was Carrie's journey into adulthood shown through the way she learnt to control her powers and discovering different parts of her body and different things she can do most obviously her first period and her telekinesis.Overall CARRIE is an outstanding horrordrama. Any horror fan or general film fan should check it out. 910".

We think of Ghostface running around stabbing people and we Whats New or of Leatherface swinging his Chainsaw into the sunset and we think Thats Campy or of Jason haunting the camp he died at and we think Well thats nothing new!. But then we see Carrie and we think Oh...my...god...! Carrie directed by the wonderful talented Brain DePalmer was actually a book by Stephen King. With these two minds at work how could we not get something totally incredible? Carrie isn't just another horror movie. It is a old idea finally brought to the screen for millions to watch. The reason it is so good is because it is done so perfect and it is done so delicately and mad to tenderly...that the finishing product throws a movie at you that you didn't expect.Carrie is our typical highschool misfit. She is mad fun of bye the lots of peers the popular kids? and the ones that don't make fun of her probably are the ones spreading the nasty rumors. To make matters worse the place were everyone should feel safe her home is just another living nightmare making school a warmup for her. She lives with a religious fanatic mother who has her fare share of problems as well. All along Chris Hargenson accompanied with her boyfriend Billy Nolen have a deadly surprise waiting for Carrie and the most important night of her life...that will change everything forever! But what everyone doesn't know is that she has powers to move things!Now after reading that dry one dimensional summary you might not think it is that good but you must watch the movie the you will know.What makes this movie great is it isn't just a horror movie but a drama...the interactions between everyone the good that people do that only ends up causing more chaos. How truly evil people can really be and...making the unbelievable believable. Carrie has so many levels and hidden things you might want to watch three times to really see it for what it is worth not just a horror but almost the study of humans...of course it is very scary indeed. You might also want to bring a pillow...just in case.The movie fastpaced but wonderful telling of Carries life just sets the tone. Starring Sisspy Spacek who does a job nobody else could do with the role of Carrie really will make you think. It also stars Piper Laurie queen of the stage playing Carries crazy mother. Her performance is done with so much power it will make you shiver. Meanwhile the rest of the cast does a wonderful job and keeps you on your feet with Betty Buckly Nancy Allen who does a wonderful job portraying your classic highschool bully Amy Irving as the kindhearted but misguided Sue Snell William Katt as Tommy Sues kindhearted boyfriend Jon Travolter as Billy and PJ Soles who always shines no matter what role she is playing.Watch Carrie today!".

She is mad fun of bye the lots of peers the popular kids? and the ones that don't make fun of her probably are the ones spreading the nasty rumors. To make matters worse the place were everyone should feel safe her home is just another living nightmare making school a warmup for her. She lives with a religious fanatic mother who has her fare share of problems as well. All along Chris Hargenson accompanied with her boyfriend Billy Nolen have a deadly surprise waiting for Carrie and the most important night of her life...that will change everything forever! But what everyone doesn't know is that she has powers to move things!Now after reading that dry one dimensional summary you might not think it is that good but you must watch the movie the you will know.What makes this movie great is it isn't just a horror movie but a drama...the interactions between everyone the good that people do that only ends up causing more chaos. How truly evil people can really be and...making the unbelievable believable. Carrie has so many levels and hidden things you might want to watch three times to really see it for what it is worth not just a horror but almost the study of humans...of course it is very scary indeed. You might also want to bring a pillow...just in case.The movie fastpaced but wonderful telling of Carries life just sets the tone. Starring Sisspy Spacek who does a job nobody else could do with the role of Carrie really will make you think. It also stars Piper Laurie queen of the stage playing Carries crazy mother. Her performance is done with so much power it will make you shiver. Meanwhile the rest of the cast does a wonderful job and keeps you on your feet with Betty Buckly Nancy Allen who does a wonderful job portraying your classic highschool bully Amy Irving as the kindhearted but misguided Sue Snell William Katt as Tommy Sues kindhearted boyfriend Jon Travolter as Billy and PJ Soles who always shines no matter what role she is playing.Watch Carrie today!";

The conditions for the story start from bad at the beginning then it slowly climbs towards good by the climax when it suddenly drops down to bad again and gets worse to a very sad ending. The climax scene is pretty effective with being frightening by being really chaotic and really brutal. The last few scenes are definitely the scariestsaddest and most powerful. The story is very moving so you can see why it's a classic. The direction and screenplay are kind of average until we get to the prom scene but then they get really good. The effects and music are also very scary but the music sounds exactly like that of Psycho. I thought this was a great film but more of a tragedy then a horror film.".

We are the ones who get punished for acting out when simply trying to defend ourselves from butt holes. Those same jerks never get anything more than a slap on the wrist while we get suspended. Is it any wonder why so many of us die young?! Some of us choose to take a few of our tormentors with us but let's be honest the Columbine Kids just couldn't AIM.

	schema:reviewBody "Carrie is a classic horror film that will be remembered for millenia. It is a moving comingofage dramaor thrilleror horror. In any case it is about a shy sweet girl played by Sissy Spacek who inhabits in a cruel world. Her mother is a religious zealot who abuses her whenever she thinks Carrie committed a sin and her high school peers shun her. Many viewers will find the film not scary at all but it is not meant to make your guts jump out. No it's a metaphorical tale of growing up and a deeply cynical one too which you will find at the end of the film.I will not spoil anything but I will just say how the film starts and it starts off in the girl's locker room. The camera pans along the misty room and we see the girls gossiping chattering and dressing up. The camera finally focused on to Carrie who was showering. This scene is very sensitive sensual emotive only made possible by the synergy of music and cinemotgraphy establishing Carrie as a sweet and innocent girl whom we should sympathize. As she showers blood flows down down her feet and shocked as she had never had period or known menstruation before. It is a premonition of things to come. It is the cinematography the lighting and lenses and the music which are the key elements that made Carrie such an effective film that it is thanks to Brian De Palma's direction. In particular the music is used to build up and accumulate the tension especially before and during the infamous prom scene. I being a film buff I could see Brian De Palma took pages from film making textbooks by emulating German Expressionist movies for lighting to create horror and Citizen Kane and 2001 A Sace Oddysey for using music as an alternative to tell the story.The cast in the movie is excellent and they all have great played their roles really well. Of course the star of the show is Sissy Spacek and she balanced her role well by not being a typical vulnerable damselin distress and yet you will feel truly sympathetic towards her. As one reviewer said she did not need to cry for you to feel sorry for her. The mother played by Piper Laurie is a class A religious lunatic whom you would feel absolute contempt for abusing her own daughter. Similarly Carrie's peers abuses her and you would feel so angry that you would want to take a dig at their faces with your fist. Now if the above emotions are what most people felt it means the cast have been really good with their role. As a matter of fact Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie were nominated for their roles.Before concluding the review I would like to offer some analysis of the movie to tie the review with my summary. The film Carrie is indeed a comingofage story but not your standard one. It is not even a standard horror film which may put off some people expecting jump scares and monsters. No it is far more mature and smart. It is a deeply deeply deeply metaphorical tale of cynicism and the world. Carrie is growing up and she is not prepared for the real world. She is your typical teenager not considering the telekinesis torn apart by pressure from the twisted idealism of her mother who do not teach her properly about the world and from the cruelty of her school colleagues. Only her gym teacher Miss Collins and Sue Snell showed genuine care.Overall the I love Carrie and it has universal themes and message very relatable to all of us who went through the troubling teenage years and to those still in their teens. I don't see any bad points other than it is not a conventional horror which some people complained. Nevertheless Carrie is a memorable and a classic horror film.".

Based on a novel by Stephen King Brian de Palma directing and Sissy Spacek in the lead role could mean that this film was a small masterpiece but it wasnt...The film started ok rather than good  but as the plot advanced I started wondering if I read horror instead of romantic drama for girls just reached puberty and King instead of Barbara Cartland. After an hour of boring and noninvolving stupidity the film reached its climax. The scene where Carrie gets the bucket in the head and starts the bloodshed seemed brilliant on the cover and could be a thrilling experience. But what happened? First the scene dragged on for something that seemed like the time from the big bang to the first human ape walking around on planet earth. And second in the following scenes the director uses a silly splitscreen effect to watch Carrie and the killings happen at the same time.. This scene opened up the opportunities to make this movie either a very entertaining splatter film with loads of blood and gore or a scary thriller. But the rest of the film was even worse than the opening. Some horrible firehose scenes and some doors clapping shut when people tried to leave the mess made this a hell to watch. And the prefinal scene where GOD himself ruined her house may be the most destroying moment for the film I have ever seen.. The film also includes an early Travolta. I cant understand how he managed to go from really terrifying and scary plain bad acting Grease and this one amongst others to brilliant acting in Pulp Fiction and Broken Arrow On the cover of the rental I read that this was the movie which made King's breaktrough as a horror writer not that I could understand why.. This one just places itself in the line of bad movies based upon his novels amongst The Stand Tommyknockers and so on. These films are really a strong contrast to the excellent The Shining with Kubrick as the director the result simply cant be bad or average and The Shawshank Redemption. Other titles worth mentioning is The Dark Half Misery and Christine. Some people says that all the books are excellent but the films are punished by poor actors and miserable directors but my doubt keeps growing. Sorry De Palma...Directing  3 out of 10 Film       2 10".

Credit where it's due  Brian De Palma presented a master class in how to build intensity and intensity in this film. It's so perfect that it brings me to tears.The difference between this film and any other teenager being abused who learns they have powers and gets revenge film is that we actually care about the teenagers. They're real. Other than one of them being able to move things with her mind their issues feel genuine. Some characters have shades of gray. And no one emerges unscathed in the end.The film starts with shy Carrie White Sissy Spacek having her first period in the shower surrounded by other girls. This typical nightmare scenario one we expect to wake up from like dreaming we're stuck in school naked is happening to her as the other girls pelt her with sanitary napkins. Christine Hargensen Nancy Allen Dressed to Kill leads the others as they yell Plug it up! Carrie's terror goes off as light bulbs explode and her teacher Miss Collins Betty Buckley who is so perfect in this has to console her.At home Carrie is abused further by her mother Piper Laurie Twin Peaks who screams at her for her sinful thoughts. Dragged into a prayer closet she must beg God to forgive her.One of Carrie's classmates Sue Snell Amy Irving the only actress to show up in the sequel  more about that travesty tomorrow feels guilty so she asks her boyfriend Tommy William Katt House to take Carrie to the prom. Miss Collins makes the girls pay for the way they treat by sending them to detention where Chris' behavior leads the teacher to slap her and suspend her from the prom.That's when Chris comes up with a horrible plot they will name Carrie as prom queen and dump blood upon her a scheme that she gets her boyfriend Billy John Travolta to make happen.Carrie's mom learns that she is going to the prom and accuses her of witchcraft. She uses her powers to throw her mother down. While at the prom Carrie finds a happiness that she has never known until now. She feels accepted. She feels love. And she has her first kiss with Tommy.What follows is what makes this movie a classic.Chris' friend Norma Totally P.J. Soles! rigs the election and Tommy and Carrie walk to the stage to be crowned. At the last second Sue tries to stop things and fails. And that's when De Palma uses nearly every trick in his book to amp this scene up. Split screen multiple angles time distortions...it's pure cinema.This scene took two weeks and 35 takes to shoot including an intense dizzying scene that was created by placing Spacek and Katt on a platform that spun in the opposite direction of a camera that was dollied away from the actors.After all that build and suspense the bucket of pig's blood covers Carrie and knocks out Billy. Our heroine has a hallucination that her mother's warning of everyone laughing at her has come true and she unleashes the full fury of her powers. Right and wrong good and evil everyone pays.You'd never guess that Sissy Spacek was her high school's homecoming queen.Carrie walks away as Chris and Billy try to kill her with his car but she easily makes it flip over and explode. Soon she is back home crying in her mother's arms. Margaret confesses that Carrie is a child of rape then stabs her in the back. She fights back by crucifying her mother and burying herself within the house.As Sue comes to the grave months after this all happens she is startled by a bloody hand that emerges from the tomb to attack her. Yet it's all a dream in a shock ending that has been  and will be  copied over and over.This is a movie that has lost none of its power. If it's not in your collection you don't have one to speak of.".

Split screen multiple angles time distortions...it's pure cinema.This scene took two weeks and 35 takes to shoot including an intense dizzying scene that was created by placing Spacek and Katt on a platform that spun in the opposite direction of a camera that was dollied away from the actors.After all that build and suspense the bucket of pig's blood covers Carrie and knocks out Billy. Our heroine has a hallucination that her mother's warning of everyone laughing at her has come true and she unleashes the full fury of her powers. Right and wrong good and evil everyone pays.You'd never guess that Sissy Spacek was her high school's homecoming queen.Carrie walks away as Chris and Billy try to kill her with his car but she easily makes it flip over and explode. Soon she is back home crying in her mother's arms. Margaret confesses that Carrie is a child of rape then stabs her in the back. She fights back by crucifying her mother and burying herself within the house.As Sue comes to the grave months after this all happens she is startled by a bloody hand that emerges from the tomb to attack her. Yet it's all a dream in a shock ending that has been  and will be  copied over and over.This is a movie that has lost none of its power. If it's not in your collection you don't have one to speak of.";

	schema:headline " Mel Gibson Fights for Freedom in Braveheart A FullThroated Epic of Overwhelming Emotion and Intense Beauty";
	schema:reviewBody "Braveheart is a rousing adventure a passionate romance and a soulstirring drama. In short Mel Gibson's 1995 classic is everything a great Hollywood epic should be. Gibson's second feature film as a director was a revelation. Who knew that Mel Gibson an established action superstar and leading man would be capable of helming a grand Medieval epic with the artistry of Braveheart? The story of William Wallace's legendary fight against English tyranny in Medieval Scotland works as a strong action spectacle but more than that Braveheart is a heartrending almost spiritual experience a rare film of bellowing passion that earns every towering emotion it conjures.Braveheart tackles the ambitious task of retelling the legend of William Wallace Mel Gibson a Scottish warrior who led a revolt against the English occupants of Scotland in the early part of the 14th Century. After his secret love Catherine McCormack is killed by English noblemen occupying the Scot's village Wallace begins a rebellion that eventually leads all the way to King Longshanks Partrick McGoohan of England. The story is not a historical retelling of the real William Wallace but an account of the mythic figure of William Wallace the largerthanlife Scottish hero. Mel Gibson is at his charismatic best as Wallace. His presence on screen conveys every bit of the folk legend that Wallace has become. It might not be an accurate portrait of a real historical figure but it is an exquisite visualization of a fabled warrior. The movie is after all based on the epic poem written by Blind Harry in the 15th Century. The choice to treat the story romantically rather than realistically is treated as a negative by some but it is actually a brilliant decision by Gibson and screenwriter Randall Wallace. The romantic approach opens the film up to more emotion more drama and more action than a straightforward docudrama would. Braveheart relishes in the romance of a time and place. The story is massive in scope and it plays to all those timetested notes of classic Hollywood adventures. Braveheart is a sentimentalized version of William Wallace no doubt but it is also surprisingly authentic. From the muddy village huts and crude stone castles to the closequarter violence of the battle scenes Braveheart is a legitimately unvarnished look into the cold cruel world of Medieval Scotland. This marriage of idealism and realism strikes at the heart of what makes Braveheart so special. It works just as well as a tearjerker and an action adventure.One of the standouts in Braveheart are the battle scenes which Mel Gibson stages with tremendous scale and violence. The action is appropriately chaotic but the way Gibson and editor Steven Rosenblum cut between the indecipherable mayhem and punctuative killshots gives the battles orientation. The violence is effective. Every brutal blow is winceinducingly severe. This is not typical Hollywood sword and sandals action this is real visceral action and it carries a purpose. Braveheart brilliantly captures the strategy as well as the barbarism inherent in Medieval warfare.Braveheart is a fantastic action epic but it outclasses those trappings. There have been many historical epics that have come and gone before and after Braveheart but precious few of them can compete with this film's craftsmanship. What Gibson has achieved here is almost miraculous. He takes what might be groaning clichs in the hands of a lesser director and injects them with a poignancy that they frankly do not deserve. We get the obligatory love stories the death scenes the speeches the evil kings and the treacherous allies. It's all been done before but never with such unbridled passion behind the camera. The characters are archetypes but they show what influence a great director and great actors can have on a character. The supporting cast is so filled with personality you just cannot help but root for what could have easily become twodimensional placeholders. James Cosmo's Campbell Brenden Gleeson's Hamish and Sophie Marceau's compassionate Princess Isabelle are excellent and Angus MacFadyen as Robert the Bruce does Oscarworthy work as a man who's loyalty balances precariously between the English and the Scottish sides of the conflict. James Horner's music may be the underappreciated key to Braveheart's success. The mournful bagpipes and spirited Scottish melodies of Horner's score are downright essential for the film's emotional climaxes of which there are many. When those climaxes hit they hit hard and that is thanks in large part to the music. Horner's score carries the same earnest spirit of the rest of the production. The music of Braveheart is precisely as big and bold as the story demands.Braveheart is a masculine story a simpleminded tale of heroes and villains executed with brute force. Of course it is an exciting action movie we might have expected that from the star of Mad Max and Lethal Weapon but the real discovery in Braveheart is its beauty. For all its violence and primitive mayhem Braveheart never lets go of its absolutely rousing grandeur. It doesn't just allow you to look on it with appreciation it demands it. Braveheart is cathartic in the way it overpowers you with emotion. There are shots in this film that nearly brought me to tears by their sheer beauty alone. When the story the characters the images filmed by cinematographer John Toll and the music crescendo it hits like a wave of overwhelming gratitude. The admirable thing about Braveheart is how Gibson and company stick to their guns. They don't conceal the drama or play it subtly. Gibson allows the tragedies the treachery and the triumphs of the William Wallace legend to be extravagant. The story is sprawling the romances are passionate and the emotions are let out with uninhibited fury. Braveheart is a man's movie a brutal action epic that will satisfy any redblooded man's desire for violence and carnage. The remarkable thing is that Braveheart is also a movie that moved me like few have before. 95100".

The acting is superb the man who played Lonshanks the actor who portrayed Robert the Bruce both should have been nominated for Oscars due to their powerful rendering of evil and a man who is saved from losing his humanity from becoming evil by meeting William Wallace. And let us not forget the direction the cinematography. Braveheart is glorious beautiful to look at. The slow motion pictures of horses preparing to charge armed combatants the entire landscape of Scotland that Mel Gibson captures with the camera. Braveheart is artwork it is as good as any picture. That the film is number 93 on the list of the top 250 movies ever is a shame. Yes there is violence in this film but that violence does serve a point...that freedom isn't free and sometimes it takes death gruesome and horrible to let ones people taste what it is like to be free. Braveheart is a great movie and it deserves to at least be in the top ten of IMDb's list of greatest films.".

I love the part where the English Commander gives the order to charge and Wallace sees this and raises his broadsword into the air and starts yelling.  He charges the field with the Scots and I'll let you see the movie to see what happens next.Wallace's emotional speech at the battle of Stirling still is inspirational and I think that the REAL William Wallace would be proud of the way Mel Gibson portrayed him.My hat goes off to Mel Gibson.

Braveheart contains elements of Romance several heart wrenching and warming instances EpicAction spectacular scenes Mystery can take a few viewings to put it all together History albeit romanticised and of course Drama perfectly unravelled. This level of uncompromised multitasking allows the film to move you to laugh and cry love and hate or even to think and be taught. I'm trying to avoid the clichs of glowing reviews almost as bad as entirely negative ones  but this is one of the few movies that I feel deserves one.The witty banter between friendsfoesloversrelatives is in my opinion flawless and aids the film's claim as a true classic. The soundtrack is similarly topnotch and encapsulates and refracts the patriotic theme during several key moments. The political subplot and gorgeous scenery also serve as refreshers during otherwise heavy areas of the story. Perhaps Braveheart's only flaw but if you share my sentiments it's actually a bonus is its length so you'll want to prepare a comfy seat and maybe even two pots of tea complete with cosies!.I suppose it's also relevant to touch on the historic inaccuracies as I expect this is what people might dislike most about this film. However History is written by those who have hanged heroes also the overall sketchiness of such periods coupled with the right of artistic license are enough for me to personally dismiss such thoughts. On that note I hope you also enjoy what to me is the greatest film created so far.".

A few English soldiers try to rape Murron at a marketplace. Wallace tries to rescue her but the agressors can catch her and kill her right on the marketplace. When Wallace finds out about it he takes revenge. He executes the murderers of his beloved. This ation is like a wakeup call for his fellow countrymen. They see him as their Leader to defeat the English occupying power. In their first battle the highlanders accomplish to defeat a numeral superior English Force. Wallace becomes an inspiration and more and more Scottish people follow him into war. Meanwhile in England the tyrannic King Edward the Longshankes Patrick Mc Goohan takes notice of the triumphs of Wallace. But this is not his only problem His and heir apparent is a mollycoddled coward who doesn't behave like his father would like to see it from a Prince.

During the movie you'll see a lot of great filmed battles two heart breaking love storys first between Wallace and Murron later in the movie young princess Isabelle falls in love with Wallace and an exciting story about love hate patriotism deception and heroism all in front of a wonderful landscape the movie was actually set in Ireland. When you watch this movie you'll be carried away by this powerful and always haunting epic and unterstand why there was no other chance than giving this movie 5 Oscars including the award for the best film. It is a film who has it all A great story perfect filmed battles one of the best soundtracks ever made it is a shame that the score didn't win an Oscar and a hell of a cast. The role of William Wallace fits Mel Gibson perfect heroic romantic but always in a down to earth kind of way. Sophie Marceau and Catherine McCormack are lovely from their first appearance until the end of the film and Patrick McGoohan gives the most despicable this is meant as a compliment interpretation of an English King ever seen. This movie you can see over and over again and it never looses his magic and it is a movie you can watch with men and women as well Men will love the great staged battles and women will love the lovestory.".

Braveheart is one of my favorite movies that never gets old. Despite it's long running time I will watch this movie any day.Mel Gibson has come so far in the movie business and he not only stars but directed Braveheart. He did a terrific job and deserves a lot of credit for this remarkable film. Despite it not being totally accurate with history anyone can enjoy Braveheart. Based on the life story of William Wallace a town peasant who just wants to live in peace and harmony with a wife and children. But when the British king of England Longshanks is sick of Scotland being full of Scots he comes up with a way of bringing them more into a British land by breeding them out. Promising any British soldier to a Scotish bride on her wedding night before her husband can have her. Wallace won't hear of it and marries his love in secret. When a British soldier notices his wife and attempts to rape her Wallace comes in and saves her causing a riot in their village and he thinks he's got her safe when he sends her away from the soldiers but they catch her and kill her right in front of her family.Wallace has had it and wants war for not only the murder of his wife and love he wants freedom for Scotland and will shed blood to do it. What will you do without freedom?! this is one of the most memorable speeches of all cinematic history during their first major battle with the British. Through countless battles friends traitors and bloodshed all Wallace just wishes for is freedom. As Robert the Bruce says to his father They look at him and fight by his side. He describes Wallace's bravery and what everyone feels in wanting to be him. I love Robert's last line You have bled with Wallace! Now bleed with me! and the army stands and continues their struggling battles for freedom! This is such an inspirational movie with a powerful message Every man dies but not every man really lives to a tearful ending that will make anyone shed a tear to a terrific heartfelt sound track it's no wonder this won best picture with other Oscars. This is a movie a terrific one that everyone should enjoy and watch.1010".

	schema:headline " Brutal But Epic Masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an emotional involving and ultimately draining film. By the time you are done you are spent. What makes this movie so intense is the passion of the main character Scottish rebel leader William Wallace played by Mel Gibson who put his heart and soul into this performance. Add to that a powerful story great cinematography excellent action scenes and even some humor....and you have a classic film.Patrick McGoohan shines as the evil English king and Sophie Marceau Agnus McFadyen and Catherine McCormack all contribute. I'm sorry the latter had such a short role as her beauty captivated me very much. All the characters in Wallace's army are fun to watch too.For those a bit queasy with bloody violence this is not a movie for you. There are lots of gory action scenes that includes limbs being hacked off. This is not a film for the feint of heart. The only objection I have to the violence is the ending. Seeing a man tortured is not my idea of entertainment. I now fastforward through that part but otherwise thoroughly enjoy the rest of the threehour film an epic adventure if there ever was one.The most memorable scene in the film for me was not any of the action scenes but just the absolutely stunned look on Gibson's face when he discovers his trusted ally was anything but that. To discover that the key people in the country that you are fighting for are not backing you must have been indescribably crushing to although since this is the movies I don't know how accurate this was to the real story. Whatever the accuracy it's a great film and belongs in anyone's collection of epicadventure masterpieces.The BluRay transfer by the way is spectacular.".

Add to that a powerful story great cinematography excellent action scenes and even some humor....and you have a classic film.Patrick McGoohan shines as the evil English king and Sophie Marceau Agnus McFadyen and Catherine McCormack all contribute. I'm sorry the latter had such a short role as her beauty captivated me very much. All the characters in Wallace's army are fun to watch too.For those a bit queasy with bloody violence this is not a movie for you. There are lots of gory action scenes that includes limbs being hacked off. This is not a film for the feint of heart. The only objection I have to the violence is the ending. Seeing a man tortured is not my idea of entertainment. I now fastforward through that part but otherwise thoroughly enjoy the rest of the threehour film an epic adventure if there ever was one.The most memorable scene in the film for me was not any of the action scenes but just the absolutely stunned look on Gibson's face when he discovers his trusted ally was anything but that. To discover that the key people in the country that you are fighting for are not backing you must have been indescribably crushing to although since this is the movies I don't know how accurate this was to the real story. Whatever the accuracy it's a great film and belongs in anyone's collection of epicadventure masterpieces.The BluRay transfer by the way is spectacular.";

The cast performed very well as this well written tale was told. Even though it is over 10 years old now it still holds a place in my heart as one of the best. The accuracy of the battle scenes are only eclipsed by the expressions of the actors faces as they share this story. Stephen the Irishman steals the show with his plucky comic relief. Hamish the sidekick does a great job playing against the over the top performance of Mel Gibson. The predominantly European cast does a great job of not needing to fake accents and mannerisms.

Rarely is it mentioned that the real guy killed anyone who understood the English tongue and often skinned and burned alive his prisoners  many of whom were taken during Scottish raids into England yes it happened both ways though this film would have you think differently.Does it work? Sure it works on a very simple level. The scenery is lovely the battles are probably the most convincingly filmed to date though if you look closely you'll see that they mainly consist of brawny Scotsmen bloodily butchering screaming squawking Englishmen. But it does work. It's pacey enough it's entertaining and it has as raw gutsy feel.If however you're like me and you prefer at least a little bit of historical accuracy then it's a dog's breakfast. To begin with the armies Wallace led are portrayed in the movie as poorlyarmed highlanders whereas in reality they were lowlanders easily as well equipped as the English armies they fought. The battle of Stirling Bridge was decided by the collapse of the bridge under the weight of the English cavalry most of whom then drowned in their armour. The Scots did wreak some butchery but mainly on the small infantry vanguard who'd got to the other side  the English 'heavy horse' were never involved. At Falkirk the Irish didn't side with their fellow Celts they despised the Scots and though the battle was indeed won by the English because the Scottish nobility fled the field Wallace also fled  how else did he survive? The characterisation is extraordinarily weak. Gibson himself though his performance strikes a convincingly muscular patriotic note speaks in modern Glaswegian and sports blue woad and Celtic plaits that predate the Dark Ages never mind the Middle Ages. Sophie Marceau's beautiful French princess is totally onedimensional as an abused innocent in truth she was a scheming harpy who later connived in the savage murder of her own husband and then an attempted coup. Patrick McGoohan who steals the show for me  at least he gives his character some charisma concentrates mainly on the stern unyielding side of Edward Longshanks  we don't learn that he founded Parliament or revised countless laws for the benefit of the underclass etc.It's a big missed opportunity. The same story could still have been told painting Wallace as a hero depicting Scotland as an oppressed society but a bit of balance and political backstory would have made it much more interesting and dare I say it more adult.It sill works but only the way a pre1960s cavalry vs Indians western works as a bit of rousing fun anachronistic in a more educated age.".

	schema:reviewBody "This epic tale of patriotism love and conflict opens with a birds eye view which takes you through mist and air out onto an open loch with scenic mountains in the background. This is accompanied by stirring bagpipe music and shortly by the start of a narrative by Robert the Bruce.After a short introduction of a young William Wallace involving his fathers death and his first step into warriorhood we are taken to present day England where Edward Longshank's tight rule over Scotland is getting increasingly harsh. Enter a fully grown Wallace a rugged longhaired Gibson who is back to start a family and a new life. He soon meets Muran a girl who he remembered from way back. He and Muran fall in love and shortly get a private nighttime marriage as a public one would result in the 'Prima Nocte' rule being enforced.Unfortunately one of the English soldiers controlling their village confronts a scared Muran and forces her into a quiet spot. William leaps to Muran's rescue and all hell ensues. The commanding officer executes Muran promptly for assault on one of the King's men as she bit him whilst defending herself. She was supposed to meet William at a secret spot after she was rescued but was knocked off the horse.William returns to the village on horseback to give himself in but he has other plans. The uprising that ensues is one of the most pulse racing and exciting fights that has ever graced the silver screen IMO. This is the spark that starts off the Scottish revolution for freedom. Soon other clans join Wallace then whole towns stand by him. He soon finds himself on the fields of Stirling for a real showdown. I thought I'd give you the first hour in a nutshell the rest of the movie revolves around Wallace Longshanks and the Queen of France as they all fight for their own cause.The battle scenes are ground breaking and upfront the senses of comradeship love patriotism and courage all take a stand throughout the film. The music adds further to the epic be it sad and haunting tunes or strong and stirring bagpipe anthems. Wallace is portrayed as a beacon of strength and power not to mention a much honoured leader. Sometimes Gibson takes his character a little too far but the title Braveheart is one that is implied to Wallace's qualities. The films dramatic and moving ending is a good finish to a superb and powerful film.".

It is obvious that Mel Gibson has a hatred for England and Britain as whole and Randell Wallace only looked at a basic history of the Scotland war and I mean really basic!The film is about William Wallace's rising against the English in the late 13th Century. They are many historical inaccuracies in the film. I can understand minor things just to make the story flow better but Braveheart takes the biscuit. William Wallace was a minor noble and he wouldn't have lived in a shack and most of the Scottish nobles in the film also were living in poor conditions which was not the case. Scottish nobles were welloff and wouldn't have been must different to English nobles. Many Scottish nobles tended to own land in England as well as Scotland. The film make out that England had invaded and occupied Scotland for a long time what really happened was Edward I wasn't too interested in Scottish affairs at first and he was later invited to help the Scottish to solve the crisis in picking a new king. However Edward I became upset when his ally he made king tried to flex his muscles. Braveheart also makes out the Scottish army ran around painted themselves blue and defeated a superior army with ease. The Scottish army in the late 13th century wouldn't have been much different to any army in Western Europe and would have been as well armed and armoured to as the English army. The only different between the English and Scottish armies were the Scottish army was more infantry based whilst the English army was more calvary based. I personally think this film is pretty insulting to Scotland as well as England! William Wallace would not have fought for revenge or freedom but for his own personal interest believing he would have got a better deal any an independent Scotland then under semiEnglish rule. They was no idea of nationalism or the nationstate in the medieval period. As well as already mentioned many Scottish nobles had land in England and many had English names like Campbell. The film also ignores that William Wallace was also a brutal man not some heroic revolutionary. They are other things such as the Battle for Stirling Bridge was not fought at a bridge and that it was implied that Queen Isabel was in love with Wallace and that he fathered Edward III which couldn't have been possible because at the time Wallace's death Isabel was sixyearsold and lived in France. Some people have praised the acting in the film I ask why? I don't think its anything special. Mel Gibson's performance wasn't particularly good and only Sophie Marceau stood out to me. Edward I was a onedimensional villain showing he takes joy out of violence and death in reallife he was an experience commander but he was no different to any other Christain king at the time. William Wallace was a simple man who was driven to going to war against this did not happen. Prince Edward was effeminate weakly wimp he was bisexual and not a good military commander but he was not weak willed and he couldn't have lasted in medieval society if he was effeminate. He was also famous be being a fit man. The portrayal of Prince Edward was homophobic.This was a hatefilled movie that shouldn't have been made. If it was made as a fictional film set in an madeup country it would have called unrealistic. This was a weak film and should not have won Oscars for best Director or best Film the Usual Suspect was hundred times better and should have won those Oscars. The only good thing to come out of the film was some good action and the costumes of the English army. But this is not enough to save this film and people have seen Mel Gibson and Randall Wallace for what they really are for making films such as the Passion of the Christ Apocalypto and Pearl Harbor. If you have any taste at all don't watch this film!".

As William Wallace begins his long quest to make Scotland free once and for all along with the assistance of Robert the Bruce. There took place several battles such as Stirling  York though the sacking of York was invented for the movie Wallace never got as far south as York during his invasion of northern England and the famous Battle of Falkirk July 22 1298 in which the English army was personally led by King Edward I who decisively defeated the Scots  the reallife King Edward I was a military genius who learned combat tactics while fighting the Mamelukes during the Eighth and Ninth Crusades . There also appears Robert the Bruce  though many Scots were offended by the film's portrayal of Robert the Bruce Angus McFayden  who is considered a National Hero of Scotland . This epic movie contains thrills  emotion romance  breathtaking battles and being based on historical events . However  some reviewers often cited as the least accurate historical epic of all time and more than 90 of the movie is fiction. This is the classic story about confrontation between good guys  the Scots  versus bad guys  the Sassenachs . A simplistic and pure tale with rude stereotypes and offering a stew of Hollywood clichs  being overlong but well played and directed by Mel Gibson . Interesting script by Randall Wallace  this screenwriter had been visiting Edinburgh in 1983 to learn about his heritage when he came across a statue of William Wallace outside Edinburgh Castle he had never heard of the 14thcentury figure who shared his name but was intrigued enough by the stories told to him about Scotland's greatest hero to research the story as much as possible. The film was heavily fictitious but Gibson claimed the changes had been made for dramatic purposes  he also admitted he had always felt he was at least a decade too old to play Wallace. Impressive production design  including thousands of extras  a majority of the actors and extras in this film were actually Irish  members of the Irish Army  although they are supposed to be Scottish or English as many as 1600 were used on a given day. The film is very crude and brutal  including bloody battles  strong tortures with disembowelment provoking brave grimace and violent scenes as when Edward I threw his son's lover out of a castle window was particularly criticized for inciting homophobia  the lover was based on Piers Gaveston who was allegedly Edward II's lover. Colorful and glamorous cinematography by John Toll  showing marvelous outdoors  including glamorous opening shots  snowy peaks  silvery lochs  dark mists and many other things . Evocative and sensitive musical score by James Horner  despite the film being set in Scotland and based on the life of a Scottish folk hero the primary instrument heard throughout the soundtrack most notably at William's father's funeral are the Uilleann pipes which are a smaller traditionally Irish version of bagpipes rather than the ubiquitous Great Highland Bagpipe.This motion picture was very well directed by Mel Gibson and he picked up two Oscars for Best Film and Best Director  though this film has been accused of promoting Anglophobia. Mel said that was influenced by various classic and historical flicks  among the films Gibson watched in order to prepare to direct Braveheart were Polanski's Macbeth Spartacus Chimes at Midnight Alexander Nevsky A Man for All Seasons The Lion in Winter Seven Samurai and Throne of Blood . Rating  Better than average. Worthwhile watching . The picture will appeal to Mel Gibson fans .".

	schema:reviewBody "Those who lambast Mel Gibson for his supposedly antiJewish sentiments in his recent production The Passion of the Christ would do well to remember his antiEnglish and indeed antigay portrayals in this otherwise superlative action film.  Gibson's epic bloody romance was never meant to be a factual account of Scottish legend William Wallace but has stimulated more interest in the real thing than a mere documentary ever could.Set in Britain in the 13th Century the plot based largely on myth about the Scottish renegade sees a young William Wallace James Robinson witness the brutal murder of his father Sean Lawlor at the hands of English occupiers. He is taken under the wing of his wise Uncle Argyle Brian Cox and grows up under his guardianship.  Wallace now played by Mel Gibson returns home an educated man falls in love with a beautiful local girl Murron Catherine MacCormack and marries her.  However when English soldiers rape and murder his wife Wallace mounts a rebellion bringing him into conflict with both the English King Edward Longshanks Patrick MacGoohan and duplicitious Scottish nobles led by Robert the Bruce Angus MacFayden...The film makes no effort whatsoever in regards to historical accuracy and the the characters come off with variable success as simplistic stereotypes.  There is nothing wrong with most of this but some stereotypes could have been avoided in particular the portrayal of King Edward's son as a snivelling homosexual fop.  By necessity the English are the villains with the Scots either passionate warriors or doubledealing nobles. Whilst the antiEnglish sentiment is a touch overdone a character exclaims Excellent! when he's told he'll get to kill the English it doesn't seriously harm the film.Gibson has thankfully not Americanised his tale by asking American actors to assume fake Scottish brogues.  With the exception of Gibson himself almost everyone's accent here is natural and the film is better for it.  Gibson delivers his all as Wallace managing a passable Scottish accent.  His Wallace is a Scottish Mad Max only savvier more sentimental and with a powerful patriotic streak.  The character though lacks the ambiguity to make him a realistic personality.  The film sees nothing questionable in Wallace invading England effectively lowering himself to the level of his former oppressors.As for the supporting players Patrick MacGoohan quietly evinces menace as the ruthless King and Sophie Marceau makes the most of her limited role as the Princess of Wales.  Angus McFayden gives a sympathetic portrayal of a torn Robert the Bruce and Brendan Gleeson and David O'Hara provide solid backup as Wallace's trustiest allies.The battle scenes in the film are frenetically staged with lots of quick editing plus copious amounts of blood and gore.  They are well put together but the endless slicing dicing and skewering becomes repetitive after a while.  Woven into the tale is a gentle Celtic score by James Horner.Whilst it has stirred interest in Scottish interest and heritage including the life of the real William Wallace taken on its own terms Braveheart is an enjoyable action film and should not be taken any more seriously than that.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hush is the kind of film that's so easy that it should work right on the first view but it's not the case. I remember watching it a few years ago and finding one of the most boring things I've ever seen except for the outstanding acting of Jessica Lange. Fate pulls its strings sometimes and one of those nights when you're desperate for something to show up on TV and there you go there was this and I got a little gripped into seeing it again this time paying more attention to details. Well it turned out to be quite a good film undeserving the low rating that is getting now.A twisted and thrilling tale about acceptance and skeletons in the closet? You can say that. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the lovable Helen a successful and beautiful woman loved by a man who's also both of the forementioned qualities the great Jackson Johnathon Schaech of the powerful Baring family. But he has a mother the surprising Martha Jessica Lange of whom Helen always tries to please to the best since Jackson and his mom has some strong bonds between them and she wants to be part of this quite perfect family. Habitual to flicks of the same caliber there's secrets tension between both women and a certain disdain the old lady feels for the younger and it's up to Helen to discover what's the problem with the Baring family. Her only great ally is Jackson's grandmother Nina Foch excellent father of Martha's late husband and keeper of some family secrets that can storm a big mess in everyone's lives.There isn't much to be said about Hush except that the cast is great even though they're not at their greatest moment. Except Lange and Foch who are brilliant and the memorable special appearance of Hal Holbrook as the doctor. But it's Lange who steals the show playing a pitiful villain sometimes adorable other times really cruel but most of the time always in control of the situation. The plot should include more characters to make this more tense and less concentrated in those three main characters. The relationship between Jackson and Martha could've go to more controversial ways cause everything seems to indicate that the scene where he's covered in mud and she cleans him they're like pretending it's just a silly joke. There's something going on there.I know Jonathan Darby has directed better films like the criminally underrated and almost forgotten The Enemy Within with Forest Whitaker but what he makes here is quite good never cheap and at the most entertaining to watch for its cast and the beautiful cinematography. 810".

Gwenyth Paltrow who was offered Kate Winslet's part in Titanic at the time she committed to this project devles into her role as the unsuspecting fiancee with grace and down to earth affability. But this is clearly Jessica Lange's film. Her psychotic motherinlaw is one of the most disturbing characters I have come across in any film. In my opinion this film rates an 810.".

Jackson and Helen are living together in New York City and are reluctant to leave that life. But Helen somehow gets pregnant even though she was using birth control and the two get married and eventually do take over the farm.Jackson blames himself for his father's death when he was 7. Martha knows the truth but won't tell him and she seems to have an unnatural relationship with her son. It's almost as if she sees his father and wants to be with him in that way. And she sees the baby as a means of continuing the legacy but not a child to be loved at least not in the way most people would. Her treatment of Helen is strange as if Helen is only useful until the baby is born and then she will be in the way.The ending is exciting and sort of creepy at the same time.Jessica Lange does a fine job here as Jackson's overly controlling and demented mother. However Nina Foch gives the standout performance as Jackson's grandmother who is kept in a fancy nursing home because only she knows the truth about how her son died.I think all the leading actors did a good job here. I usually can't stand Debi Mazar who was a coworker to Helen and possibly her boss but I would like to have seen more of her here. But if Helen had to move out of New York I guess keeping her job was out of the question.I suppose my favorite scene was the one where Helen gets out of bed naked and meets her motherinlaw for the first time. That one was edited for TV in such a way it seemed kind of jerky and I didn't get to see much but a lot depends on how one sees this movie.It's not typical of what I like in a movie but still entertaining.".

	schema:reviewBody "First let's get this out of the way. I have never been a fan of Gwenyth Paltrow I never understood the fuss surrounding her. She has two expressions one with her mouth is pouting and one of bewilderment. The pouting technique is in high gear in this movie. Now that is over I have to say that for once I actually liked her character. She wasn't some dumb bunny who had to be hit over the head with a brick before she noticed something was up boyfriendhusband mom. Strange the first time I saw them as a couple going into their loft in downtown NYC they looked like John Kennedy Jr and his wife. I am not sure if that is the image we are suppose to get. Anyway there is grandma in the mix which we nothing about until the wedding. And we find out she wasn't invited she mentioned something about chasing down catering trucks to find out about the wedding. It was hilarious. Right away that should give the viewer who has yet to see the mother is nuts that something is wrong. The new husband seems to be clueless. Actually they could of used anyone including a dead Orson Welles for the part because the hubby really has nothing to do but just be a plot device. He is hubby son of a nut and that is his role. We find out that the the son also owns the ranch mommy lives on and runs. Another hint something was not right. THen we see that he blames himself for his dads death. It looks like they made that up while they were filming the movie. Because before that we just saw a perfectly normal guy with a nutty mom now we see a victim. Well before all of this she finds out she is having a baby and they get married. One day coming into her loft she get assaulted. This locket which had already been a conversation piece between mommy and daughter in law comes up missing from the assault. Her dead parents picture is in the locket. Now we know Gwennie is all alone without any family other then her future hubby. In other words a perfect victim. OH boy we all know that locket is going to show up again. Why do people in movies keep remnants of their bad deeds?? Throw the stuff out. In any case she is afraid to live home mommy is threatening to sell the horse farm. So son decides to make a go of the ranch. They move into the house. The hubby is really not seen too much after that other for some occasional nookie and seeing running the ranch. Like I said a dead Orson Welles could of played the part. Mom starts doing some piggy things and Gweenie is astute enough to see what is happening. There is a scene at this horse show and Gwenie sees grandma she wants to go talk to her and mom tells her she forbids her to talk to her. Well Gwennie turns around and mentions she hasn't been forbidden to do something since she was a teenager. Good for her I say!! She goes to see the grandma but mom yells her name and a horse gets excited and almost harms a pregnant Gwennie Well Gwen gets off the ground and Yells at mom and tells her You didn't have to yell She is not letting up on mom one bit I loved it. Oh before I forget mom hears Gwennie telling her son that she talked to his grandma and he should see her. After that mom makes a visit to the Home of the Hardly Living what the grandma calls the nursing home. And warns her to keep away. I swear she was going to kill her in the heating machine but she didn't. Gwen goes for a visit too and finds out that mom was basically a gold digger SURPRISE SURPRPISE! She eventually lets her know that the son didn't kill the dad and he wasn't leaving the mom because of a affair. Well now we know that mom is letting her son take blame for killing his dad. Oh boy. Another thing it seems the mom is interested in male offspring's only. Why we never find out but it is very weird. Heck the whole movie is weird. Gwen who has been smart up to a point all of sudden gets dumb and eats this piece of cake mom insists she eats. The poison induces labor and we see her give birth as mom is talking about the pain. Something she talks about through the movie. Weird. Before that scene we see mom has already got a room ready for the baby and Gwyn is mad. That is why I thought it was out of character for her to eat that cake. Orson Welles shows up eventually after the obligatory wish washy scene and leaves with his wife. Nothing is done about mom and her criminal behavior. I guess they are leaving granny who is a tough nut to take care of it. It is one of those so bad it is god movie. Take a look if there is nothing on. One last thing I find Jessica Lange who I think is a very good actress always uses cigarettes as a prop when she is playing sassy or devious women she does it here. All you have to see is her bring that cigarette put it between her fingers hold her hand up and move it backwards palm up out and you know the role she is going to play.".

	onyx:emotionText "First let's get this out of the way. I have never been a fan of Gwenyth Paltrow I never understood the fuss surrounding her. She has two expressions one with her mouth is pouting and one of bewilderment. The pouting technique is in high gear in this movie. Now that is over I have to say that for once I actually liked her character. She wasn't some dumb bunny who had to be hit over the head with a brick before she noticed something was up boyfriendhusband mom. Strange the first time I saw them as a couple going into their loft in downtown NYC they looked like John Kennedy Jr and his wife. I am not sure if that is the image we are suppose to get. Anyway there is grandma in the mix which we nothing about until the wedding. And we find out she wasn't invited she mentioned something about chasing down catering trucks to find out about the wedding. It was hilarious. Right away that should give the viewer who has yet to see the mother is nuts that something is wrong. The new husband seems to be clueless. Actually they could of used anyone including a dead Orson Welles for the part because the hubby really has nothing to do but just be a plot device. He is hubby son of a nut and that is his role. We find out that the the son also owns the ranch mommy lives on and runs. Another hint something was not right. THen we see that he blames himself for his dads death. It looks like they made that up while they were filming the movie. Because before that we just saw a perfectly normal guy with a nutty mom now we see a victim. Well before all of this she finds out she is having a baby and they get married. One day coming into her loft she get assaulted. This locket which had already been a conversation piece between mommy and daughter in law comes up missing from the assault. Her dead parents picture is in the locket. Now we know Gwennie is all alone without any family other then her future hubby. In other words a perfect victim. OH boy we all know that locket is going to show up again. Why do people in movies keep remnants of their bad deeds?? Throw the stuff out. In any case she is afraid to live home mommy is threatening to sell the horse farm. So son decides to make a go of the ranch. They move into the house. The hubby is really not seen too much after that other for some occasional nookie and seeing running the ranch. Like I said a dead Orson Welles could of played the part. Mom starts doing some piggy things and Gweenie is astute enough to see what is happening.

You know Lange's supposed to be evil because she smokes drinks and has an inexplicable Southern accent in upstate New York?.  The film sports two endings don't worry no spoilers here!!! the first of which is guffawinducing just because it's medically not possible and a final showdown which is incredibly dull and comes out of nowhere. Lots of bad dialogue and farfetched plot developments carry the viewer to the bitter end.Allegedly this film was held up for massive reshoots and edits for a whole year.

Briefly a drifter Randall Adams ran out of gas and was picked up by a 16yearold runaway David Harris. Later that night they drank some beer smoked some marijuana and went to the movies. Then their stories diverged. Adams claimed that he left for his motel where he was staying with his brother and went to sleep. Harris however said that they were stopped by police late that night and Adams suddenly shot the officer approaching their car. The film shows the audience the evidence gathered by the police who were under extreme pressure to clear the case. It strongly makes a point that the circumstantial evidence was very flimsy. In fact it becomes apparent that Harris was a much more likely suspect and was in the middle of a crime spree eventually ending up on Death Row himself for the later commission of other crimes.

	schema:headline " Stunning depiction of a gross miscarriage of justice";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an extraordinary documentary in which film maker Errol Morris shows how an innocent man was convicted of murdering a policeman while the real murderer was let off scot free by the incompetent criminal justice system of Dallas Texas. The amazing thing is that Morris demonstrates this gross miscarriage of justice in an utterly convincing manner simply by interviewing the participants. True he reenacts the crime scene and flashes headlines from the newspaper stories to guide us but it is simply the spoken words of the real murderer especially in the coldblooded explosive audio tape that ends the film that demonstrate not only his guilt but his psychopathic personality. And it is the spoken words of the defense attorneys the rather substantial Edith James and the withdrawing Dennis White and the wrongfully convicted Randall Adams that demonstrate the corrupt and incompetent methods used by the Dallas Country justice system to bring about this false conviction. Particularly chilling were the words of Judge Don Metcalfe waxing tearyeyed as he recalls listening to the prosecutor's summation about how society is made safe by that thin blue line of cops who give their lives to protect us from criminals. The chilling part is that while he is indulging his emotions he is allowing the cop killer to go free and helping to convict an innocent man. Almost as chilling in its revelation of just how perverted and corrupt the system has become was the report of how a paid psychologist as a means of justifying the death penalty interviewed innocent Randall Adams for fifteen minutes and found him to be a danger to society a bloodthirsty killer who would kill again.This film will get your dander up. How the cops were so blind as to not see that 16yearold David Harris was a dangerous remorseless psychopath from the very beginning is beyond belief. He even took a delight in bragging about his crime. As Morris suggests it was their desire to revenge the cop killing with the death penalty that blinded them to the obvious. They would rather fry an innocent man than convict the real murderer who because of his age was not subject to the death penalty under Texas law. When an innocent man is wrongly convicted of a murder three things happen that are disastrous One an innocent man is in jail or even executed. Two the real guilty party is free to kill again. And three the justice system is perverted. This last consequence is perhaps the worst. When people see their police their courts their judges condemning the innocent and letting the guilty walk free they lose faith in the system and they begin to identify with those outside the system. They no longer trust the cops or the courts. The people become estranged from the system and the system becomes estranged from the people. This is the beginning of the breakdown of society. The Dallas cops and prosecutors and the stupid judge David Metcalfe who should have seen through the travesty are to be blamed for the fact that David Harris after he testified for the prosecution and was set free did indeed kill again as well as commit a number of other crimes of violence.The beautiful thing about this film is over and above the brilliance of its artistic construction is that its message was so clear and so powerful that it led to the freeing of the innocent Randall Adams. Although the psychopathic David Harris to my knowledge was never tried for the crime he committed he is in prison for other crimes and it is hoped will be there for the rest of his life. Errol Morris and the other people who made this fine film can pride in these facts and in knowing that they did a job that the Dallas criminal justice system was unable to do.Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!".

	schema:headline " One of the Greatest Docs Ever Made";
	schema:reviewBody "The last few years have been a golden age for documentaries. For better or worse Michael Moore and his undeniable ability for manipulating the cinematic medium have brought this endangered genre into theaters and living rooms across the country. Most of today's casual moviegoers are relatively new to the nonfiction feature. In the case of director Errol Morris' The Thin Blue Line 1988 one film not only managed to free an innocent man from a lifetime in prison but it also elicited a confession from the guilty party. After collecting dust on video shelves for over fifteen years this groundbreaking documentary has finally arrived on DVD.Unless you're a devout cinephile or a video store clerk you have probably never heard much about Errol Morris. As a member of the former category I've been a fan of his since first renting The Thin Blue Line more than a decade ago. As I popped in that dusty VHS cassette and sat back I relished what many critics and documentary purists had been hotly debating Morris was taking the genre to exciting new places whether people liked it or not.As with all successful movies a good doc needs a good story. In 1976 Dallas County police officer Robert Wood and his partner were patrolling their district late one night. The two pulled a blue car over to the side of the road most likely to warn the driver of a busted taillight. Moments later Officer Wood was lying on the ground fatally wounded by a series of gunshots. His partner quickly ran to his aid but was unable to accurately retain and recall certain information about the killer's vehicle. Was it a Vega or a Comet? Did the driver have bushy hair or a furlined collar? These and many other questions emerged during the rushed investigation to bring the mysterious copkiller to justice. The film itself opens more than ten years after the murder took place. Randall Adams an oddly charismatic good ol' boy sits before the camera revealing what happened that unfortunate evening in late 1976. He admits to having shared a ride with a young kid named David Harris. The two apparently attended a drivein double feature where they both drank beer and smoked marijuana. Shortly thereafter Adams claims to have been dropped off at his motel for the evening. Meanwhile Morris shows us the aforementioned David Harris now in his mid20s talking cryptically about that night's events. This reallife Rashomon confronts viewers with several versions of the truth. It's unclear whether Morris instinctively knew the truth was still out there when he decided to pursue this project but his previous experience as a private investigator seems to have paid off as we witness his off camera interrogation of these two men.Adams responsible or not was determined guilty by the courts and sentenced to death. Despite having a police record as long as his shadow David Harris became the primary witness against Adams in the case. His testimony alone might not have hung Adams but at the last minute a trio of eyewitnesses to the crime emerged to corroborate his story. In the world of Errol Morris people are a truly strange lot and his greatest technique is to simply let his subjects talk and talk until their inherent weirdness becomes painfully evident. Such is the case with the three lastminute witnesses in the Adams case. The more we hear them speak the greater that uneasy feeling in our stomach and chest becomes. We are bearing witness to a catastrophic miscarriage of justice.Morris employs a bottomless bag of tricks in this landmark film. While much of the film does rely on the presence of talking heads he adds other elements to the mix such as old movie footage a haunting score by renowned composer Philip Glass and the granddaddy of documentary nono's dramatic reenactments. The latter tends to be the most challenged aspect of The Thin Blue Line but Morris uses it fairly and wisely. He tells this twisted tale in ways few people could. A shot of a swaying timepiece or a concession stand popcorn machine suddenly amount to much more than what we're simply seeing on the screen. All of these pieces are being put together little by little in the hopes that by the end we will see the bigger picture.When this movie was released in 1988 it was marketed as a nonfiction film because the word documentary was thought to scare off ticketbuyers. The studio's attempts to pass it off as a murder mystery failed but the movie made a minor splash once it hit video. It picked up plenty of awards from festivals and critics groups but the Oscars didn't even bother nominating it. In fact the Academy didn't so much as nod in Morris' direction until early 2004 when they nominated The Fog of War his powerful relevant look at former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. That film and Morris' two previous masterpieces Mr. Death and Fast Cheap  Out of Control have been available on DVD for some time. His first three films Gates of Heaven Vernon Florida and The Thin Blue Line were recently made available either individually or in a 3disc box set. All six of these films are unique intriguing portals into Mr. Morris' strange universe which is not so distant from our own. If it's dramatic situations reality TV or simply a great movie that you want look no further than The Thin Blue Line. As one of the greatest documentaries of our time it is all these things and so much more.Rating A".

Randall Adams in his 20's can and must be punished because he's a stranger to these smallminded bigots and someone must pay! Shocking that people can think that way. It makes The OxBow Incident and issues it raised 70 years ago valid even today.

The story is exceedingly well told and the end with the tape recorded last interview with David Harris is chilling. I can't say that after watching this I still have a clear opinion of what punishment should fit a crime but it has certainly made me question the validity of the mentality present in so many Muslim countries.

	schema:reviewBody "Randall Adams was a drifter who was picked up by runaway teenager David Harris when he ran out of petrol. The two men hang out for a while drank some beer went to the movies smoked some weed. At this point Adams says he went his own way to his motel with his brother watched TV and went to sleep. Alternatively Harris says the two men stayed together were stopped by the police when Adams took out a gun and opened fire on a police officer before driving off. This film follows the court case which charged Adams for the murder of a police officer with the underage Harris who was ineligible for the death penalty as one of the main witnesses against him.I do enjoy a Perry Mason film because after a solid hour of red herrings and questionmarks it always come down to the big reveal with Mason demanding isn't it true? ISN'T IT? as everyone gasps the guilty confesses on the stand and justice is done. Sadly this is not a documentary but a basic TVM series and what the Thin Blue Line does so effectively is to get passed all our ideas of how justice works from films and presents a nearunquestionable miscarriage of justice. At no point does the guilty person get totally exposed although the suggestion is very clearly there as to who it was but instead Morris goes after the idea of reasonable doubt which if there is any then the charged should not have been convicted. Starting at the very start of the fateful evening Morris uses interviews and some reconstructions to tell the story of what happened from various points of view  initially with a focus very much on the events as the courts saw it.From here he then uses these same contributions to inject a huge amount of doubt into the vast majority of the case for the prosecution. If you want to find it there are things in here that could be taken as antideath penalty but for me the film is projustice as opposed to antianything as it is essentially reinforcing the importance of reasonable doubt. By virtue of doing this everyone involved looks bad and Morris wisely doesn't need to pick on anybody in particular directly. It is fascinating as a film but I can understand the occasional claim of it being dull  I cannot agree with it but I can understand because in a world where excess is the norm style action violence opinion anything that is actually restrained and even handed could be taken as dull.This modern moaning aside though The Thin Blue Line is a well made film that simply and matteroffactly condemns the justice system as it applied to Randall Adams. One of Morris' best films and worth seeking out.".

I see people snoozing at the thought of yet another educational nonfiction film.Well I guess there was a period when they carried a bit more chic than in recent years. Flaherty made some money. And Mondo Cane of course if that was a documentary.But the whole field seems to have been revolutionized lately by Ken Burns and Errol Morris the former with The Civil War series on PBS and the latter with this film. Morris had made an earlier movie mostly about an animal cemetery but the subject seems to have had limited popular appeal.The Thin Blue Line however is about the shooting death of a police officer and the subsequent conviction imprisonment and death sentence of an innocent man.The movie really IS innovative. There is no narration for one thing. For another the talking heads we see aren't labeled at the bottom of the screen  Chester Smith Accountant at Robbin Cheatham and Frisk Law Firm. Instead Morris shows us close ups of newspaper clippings and other printed materials which just happen to mention the name of the person we are about to be introduced to. It's a small thing true but I can't recall the device's ever having been used before. It's unobtrusive and effective. That's the sort of thing I mean when I call this film innovative. The events are restaged and presented again and again from different points of view the whole being carefully constructed like a jigsaw puzzle but a jigsaw puzzle for children easy to comprehend. And it's easy to see why Morris latched on to this topic. Not only is it interesting per se an investigation into the justice system in Texas in which almost all the authority figures seem intent on extinguishing forfeited lives but the actual performers we see on screen are remarkably at ease in the presence of the camera. They smile conspiratorially practically winking at the camera. They look dramatically towards heaven and say things like It's crazy. But all in a pleasant Texas drawl. Nobody gets excited. Nobody breaks down and sobs. There's innovation for you! Nobody get angry and shouts at the camera. It's all very smooth.But although the performances are good they are still performances. No one seems to admit having made a mistake. Everyone enters his house justified. Randall Adams the innocent guy who was railroaded into the slams because he was 28 years old and could therefore be given the death penalty has been in jail long enough to know what he's about when he presents his case. He has a practiced wounded appearance and manner although he describes his experiences as if they happened to somebody else. You pick up things in jail along with the tattoos. David Harris the actual perp smiles and shrugs disarmingly and he keeps saying I guess and whatever. As cool as an ice cube in Sweetwater. He is in fact a textbookperfect example of what used to be called a psychopath. He's pleasant looking charming and utterly without any conscience.In some ways the most interesting character is the spacedout blonde who claims to have eyewitnessed the killing and identifies Adams as the murderer in court. She's the most interesting because her motives are the most obscure. Everyone else's goals are clear. Adams wants to save his neck. The prosecutor wants another conviction. But this babe is really something.She's constructed an old TV detective program with herself as the central figure.Two additional points. One is that the psychiatrist known as Doctor Death spent only 15 minutes with Adams in prison before testifying that Adams was an incurable murderer. I'm laughing as I write this. Anyway Dr. Death gave Adams two tests. The first which Adams describes as a lot of circles and squiggly lines is the Bender Gestalt Test which was originally designed to measure brain damage. In the second part of the examination Adams is asked to explain the meaning of a couple of adages. A rolling stone gathers no moss for example. It used to be thought that schizophrenics were given to concrete thinking and that they had trouble reasoning abstractly enough to interpret these old sayings. It's not used anymore. One thing always bothered me about it anyway. One of the items is A new broom sweeps clean and I could never figure out EXACTLY what that was supposed to mean.The second point is that Adams was given a new trial and released after this film was shown. In other words Errol Morris saved Randall Adam's life which would otherwise have been spent in prison. So what does Adams do after he's out of prison? He sues Errol Morris for having taken advantage of him! In TV interviews explaining his suit Adams uses exactly the same bewildered expressions and gestures of helplessness that he does in this film. At least those eleven years weren't a complete waste of time because he obviously learned something or whatever.".

	schema:headline " Justice Denied";
	schema:reviewBody "Errol Morris' The Thin Blue Line documents the 1976 murder of Dallas police officer Robert Wood. David Harris a young drifter was initially arrested for the crime but later testified that another man Randall Adams was actually responsible for the murder. Adams claimed to know nothing about the murder. Local authorities believed Harris however and Adams was eventually charged and given the death sentence. As the film begins Adams has been in jail for 11 years and Harris is serving time for an unrelated crime.Using dramatic reconstructions and many eyewitness testimonies Morris' documentary dives headlong into the case. It's a Rashomon styled parade of conflicting testimonies and overlapping subjective viewpoints the truth of the murder murky and shapeless until things begin to focus. When the crime begins to coalesce a pitiful picture begins to take shape rampant police corruption led to Adams being falsely convicted Harris emerges as a juvenile psychopath police incompetence is exposed scapegoats are exonerated corroborating evidence and testimonies are undermined the moral character of lawyers psychiatrists law enforcement officers and expert witnesses is called into question and even the testimonies of regular civilians are seen to be wholly biased easily swayed by personal desires for money and fame. The film's point trust no one test the gods and keep probing until you find the truth.The Thin Blue Line was well received when it released in the late 1980s but it would be a number of years before its influence on the documentary genre would become apparent. Morris' dramatic reconstructions of the crime  filmed in nightmarish noirish hues and resemblant of a David Lynch film  talking heads and overall aestheticapproach would give rise to an entire documentary industry influencing countless TV crime docs court TV stations and investigative programmes.

	onyx:emotionText "Errol Morris' The Thin Blue Line documents the 1976 murder of Dallas police officer Robert Wood. David Harris a young drifter was initially arrested for the crime but later testified that another man Randall Adams was actually responsible for the murder. Adams claimed to know nothing about the murder. Local authorities believed Harris however and Adams was eventually charged and given the death sentence. As the film begins Adams has been in jail for 11 years and Harris is serving time for an unrelated crime.Using dramatic reconstructions and many eyewitness testimonies Morris' documentary dives headlong into the case. It's a Rashomon styled parade of conflicting testimonies and overlapping subjective viewpoints the truth of the murder murky and shapeless until things begin to focus. When the crime begins to coalesce a pitiful picture begins to take shape rampant police corruption led to Adams being falsely convicted Harris emerges as a juvenile psychopath police incompetence is exposed scapegoats are exonerated corroborating evidence and testimonies are undermined the moral character of lawyers psychiatrists law enforcement officers and expert witnesses is called into question and even the testimonies of regular civilians are seen to be wholly biased easily swayed by personal desires for money and fame. The film's point trust no one test the gods and keep probing until you find the truth.The Thin Blue Line was well received when it released in the late 1980s but it would be a number of years before its influence on the documentary genre would become apparent. Morris' dramatic reconstructions of the crime  filmed in nightmarish noirish hues and resemblant of a David Lynch film  talking heads and overall aestheticapproach would give rise to an entire documentary industry influencing countless TV crime docs court TV stations and investigative programmes. Adding weight to Morris' visuals is a mounting powerful score by Philip Glass which pulls portentously down on the picture like a hang man's noose.Still for a film purporting to search for the truth The Thin Blue Line is at times a thin work.

I have long struggled with my opinions on Morris' work mainly because I am more of a purist when it comes to documentaries. I want to see footage photographs interviews etc. that are going to back up a strong story not a lot of camera angles stark white backgrounds and a postmodernist score.'The Thin Blue Line' had the latter presentation so I immediately was slightly turned off  until the subject of the film was presented. The location is Dallas and it is the 1970's. Late one night a squad car pulls over a car that does not have its lights on but as soon as the policeman reaches the driver's side door he is shot several times and murdered. The car pulls away before the policeman's partner is able to ascertain the license plate number or even the exact make and model of the vehicle. What follows is a veritable witch hunt for the killer or killers that ends with one man in jail who is professing his innocence and another man a career criminal who gets away veritably scotfree. Through various interviews with the players involved detectives alleged eyewitnesses the accused themselves Morris seeks to find out the truth in a case that comes down to a 'hesaidhesaid' situation. 'The Thin Blue Line' is expert filmmaking in the investigative sense. Morris does his job in presenting as many facts as possible. The case finally came to a head a couple of years after the film was finished but it is documented as being instrumental in the reexamination of the facts. I still don't necessarily care for Morris' style but it cannot be argued that 'The Thin Blue Line' is an excellent documentary and that he definitely has an eye for picking very compelling subjects.

It is the documentaries that give the impression of being objective that are in fact the most manipulative.  In the case of The Thin Blue Line the purpose of the documentary is clear and the viewer is not tricked into believing that they are watching something objective.  Instead it is quite upfront about its purpose and therefore is a much more honest piece of work.  People should never accept anything they see in a documentary as fact it's important to understand that documentaries are simply an attempt to present the director's perspective of a reallife situation.  It is the great documentaries that present their perspective in a convincing manner and do so without boring the viewer to sleep.  Here The Thin Blue Line succeeds very well it is powerful it is engaging and it's extremely convincing. Does that mean that everyone should be convinced?  Lets hope not.  However it certainly should give everyone something to think about.The only real problem with the film is its overuse of reenactments where they are not really that necessary.  For example there is an image of a clock representing the futility of time which is too long for its own good.  The milkshake scene was also intentionallyannoying.  However this is a minor problem and not one that should bother most people.  Overall great film and highly recommended.".

Prosecuting attorneys are not men who believe in doing what's right but what will most successfully add to their reputation. A psychologist testifies against over 99 of those criminals he interviews so that they will get the death penalty. The police choose to believe a juvenile delinquent's testimony against a man who has never done anything majorly illegal in his life just because they cannot send a 16 year old to the chair and they cannot fail to execute someone over the death of a police officer. Every single police officer and witness who had anything to do with the trial was discreditable yet no discrediting evidence was ever allowed in the court. You may have guessed that this all takes place in Texas.Even with the power it carries The Thin Blue Line has some structural problems. I wish that we had been given some more information on Randall Adams although maybe there just wasn't too much to say. And I wish that we would have been able to hear the thin blue line closing argument of the prosecuting attorney a speech that made the judge's eyes water. If you like this film search out Paradise Lost The Child Murders of Robin Hood Hills a documentary obviously inspired by this. That one is a little more convincing and powerful than The Thin Blue Line although this one apparently helped to get Adams off the hook of course with the amount of evidence that the film amassed it is difficult to let the man rot without one more chance.".

It moves at a geriatric pace the music is insipid and the crimereenactment acting is straight out of the the juniorhigh play. Many times I wondered if the crew of this film were on serious drugs. I had to watch this for a class assignment and to get through it I had to watch it in installments  it was that painful to endure. The entire case could have been summed up the miscarriage of justice exhibited in a much more sophisticated succinct manner. Instead it was just one long drawnout painful experience. A hoakier more godawful production I've yet to see. Do yourself a favor and read the book. It's better and much more interesting than this dung heap of a film.".

It moves at a geriatric pace the music is insipid and the crimereenactment acting is straight out of the the juniorhigh play. Many times I wondered if the crew of this film were on serious drugs. I had to watch this for a class assignment and to get through it I had to watch it in installments  it was that painful to endure. The entire case could have been summed up the miscarriage of justice exhibited in a much more sophisticated succinct manner. Instead it was just one long drawnout painful experience. A hoakier more godawful production I've yet to see. Do yourself a favor and read the book. It's better and much more interesting than this dung heap of a film.";

At least in 1976 Dallas. To me there are two main aspects to what happened. There must have been an initial motive to go after Randall Adams instead of David Harris and then once he was made the main suspect there had to be some explanation to why he is convicted despite almost everything pointing in the other direction.Adams was 28 whereas lil' David was 16. The movie pointed out that this would've been enough since only Adams was eligible for death. In addition and perhaps more important David was from Vidor Texas whereas Adams was from out of state.There is something else that even though is never talked about must have been in people's minds.I first thought it hard to understand why a 28 year old would spend an evening with a 16 year old. Moreover after it was clear that David had guns and even had shot some rounds in the air Adams still goes with him to a drivein movie which included a softcore feature albeit a heterosexual one. They also talk about the possibility of David spending the night in the same hotel which does not materialize because Adams' brother did not like 'those things'. Even after this is made clear David still hangs around a bit and Adams leaning on the car says he can help out and offers to try to get him a job. Some viewers believed Adams was in the car during the shooting because the story about the rounds shot in the air?. No witness claims to have seen two people in the car. David however says he slid in his seat when the officer came to the car. This would put him in a rather awkward position if you follow my thoughts. It's hard to gauge how important this was but I'd take a wild guess that Dallas is not exactly a gayfriendly city.As for how this eventually only got worse a few things caught my attention. The prosecutor's perfect record was not to be stained by this case the first female officer on duty was not to have such a bad start despite her obvious incompetence and finally the life of a texan 16 year old boy was not to be ruined as put by one of the police officers even though he was the obvious suspect. Unfortunately as Adams himself hints at these have nothing to do with who was actually likely to have committed the crime.At some point in the movie an officer makes the remark that never had it taken so long for a copkilling to be resolved. One can only wonder how many similar stories didn't make it to the big screen.As a closing remark I found Adams' interpretation of 'a rolling stone gathers no moss' a bit weird. As for all those on the prosecution's sideDum excusare credis accusas".

	schema:reviewBody "Errol Morris has constructed a film here that defies all traditional aesthetics once held dear to documentaries. Morris is a filmmaker who is said to have despised all verite and as a result has abandoned all characteristics attributed to that style. Specifically there is no feel of spontaneity or immediacy in his films absolutely no handheld shots and no presenting of extra information. You can tell there is not a shooting ratio of 1502001 as with say a typical Frederick High School Wiseman film. It is precisely this rejection which makes The Thin Blue Line so compelling.The Thin Blue Line is a documentary about the wrongful arrest and subsequent conviction of a man whom hitched a ride with the wrong man at the wrong time. His story is told through a series of interviews including one from the jailed man himself intercut throughout various reenactments of the disputed crime. Morris presents us with a very dark film filled with high contrast lighting and cool blues which give all the subjects a pale look. It is however with the reenactments that this documentary stands out. Morris's use of slowmotion photography close ups and editing focuses your attention on specific aspects of the crime scene as well as the aesthetic value of these traditionally narrative tools.This film's most impressive aspect is the haunting score by Phillip Glass which immediately encapsulates you from the first second we are introduced to Dallas Texas. The score tends to play out during reenactments and through crucial aspects of the interviews which narrow our attention to the message of the film. This score can put you into a kind of trance which makes you completely open to manipulation.It is this manipulation however which reminds you of the limitations of the narrative documentary. We are absolutely told what to think about the people police and witnesses whom do not support the claims of the jailed man. Morris intended to make a film about the wrongful conviction of this man and any of the interviewees who got in the way of that were either trivialized or their stories were manipulated as to only present arguments of the innocence of this man. But who cares of course we are being manipulated by the narrative structure it is still damned compelling.".

They are the incompetent cop the inept detectives who are oblivious to truth or bare facts staring at them the lying witnesses the crooked psychiatrist who gave dishonest testimony and a selfdeceiving and perverted judiciary uninterested in truth and hellbent on executing people.But something happened which redeemed the whole sordid affair and it came from an unexpected source the apparently psychotic young man David Harris who seemed to kill with no remorse. He declared Randall Adams innocent at the end and implied his own guilt. He later testified not in the film in court that he did killed the cop and set Randalll Adams free. The judiciary is extremely reluctant in admitting their own mistakes  watch another documentary Paradise Lost The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills read about its aftermath and see how blatant the judiciary can be in ignoring its obvious mistakes. Without David Harris admission Randall Adams may very well still have stayed in prison. David Harris appeared in this film to be a young man who was traumatised through no fault of his own by the death of his brother and the subsequent punishment by rejection by his father. It perhaps does explain his apparent callous response to death and says something about the damage that can be done to children by their parents by what they did. Understanding this or the confession by David Harris of his own crimes doesn't mitigated against the murders committed by David Harris. But he did a good thing at the end a redeeming act in a world sinking in a morass of corruption and lies.Someone more cynical might say that he was already in death row for another murder admitting this murder is of no great consequence and it may just be an attempt to appear a better man than he actually is or that it is actually the cleverness of Errol Morris that coaxed and elicited Harris's confession. Perhaps perhaps not. From the film he appeared to me to be intelligent and surprisingly appealing far less calculating and readier to admit his guilt once confronted with the truth than others in the film. Compare him to the people who directly or indirectly condemned innocent people to death or in other words committing murder through the judicial process  for example the Dr Death who to his death refused to admit any wrongdoing and his funeral was attended by many of the prosecutors who found his testimony useful in sending people innocent or otherwise to their death. These people are happy to execute innocent people but refuse to admit they are wrong when confronted with the evidence. They are perhaps beyond redemption and these are the people we place our trusted on to do the right thing and make the society a safer place. I have no moral or ethical objection to death penalty but this film must make anyone wonder if the right people are in charge of making decision of life and death or that given people on show here if it is ever possible for find these right people. David Harris was executed in 30 June 2004.".

	schema:reviewBody "No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance  for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination  I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates maybe no more than usual but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see we feel connected to the human being we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in 10 Rillington Place to the hideous unredeemable Christian Bale in American Psycho. Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She like us sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film.".

	schema:headline " It's the Little Things";
	schema:reviewBody "So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examplesa. The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false noteor a missed oneas each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if on the surface not much appears to be happening.b. Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance due mostly to the bright desert sun and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional he never raises his voice and comes across as calm and rather perceptive and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is alas a bad actress and the cop sees through this if not to the heart of the matter yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her and if she had just been a little less clever and driven more slowly and the skies remained clear he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.c. California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fasttalking semistreetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realisticand perfectly acted and timedand also a little frightening from the opening I'm in no mood for trouble to the final hey! just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right but the problem isn't with the car lot it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.d. Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things and Norman is a good observer if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line Sometimes just once is enough in a reference to private traps and Norman seems to catch her drift if not the actual meaning of what she's saying and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight and yet the drama plays out in a light relaxed mode and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful and the end result nothing less than staggering.e. The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a minicomedy of manners but it is also good exposition as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death and the dress she was buried in periwinkle blue. John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene and no other and expertly delivers its punchline Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary.f. Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played lowkey and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner and know that Arbogast does too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match and though Norman wins on a technicality we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.g. The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all the movie came out in 1960 and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech with all its Freudian brilliance the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience even if we can accept it can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes one can put people like Norman under the microscope and even dissect what one sees but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho which is on the surface is a somewhat plainlooking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small thingsgestures glances sudden changes in lighting razorsharp editing and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominatethat we understand the meaning of the word genius the meaning of the word creative.".

We can now identify what made this little lurid tale into a classic. Hitchcock himself naturally but now we know the first director's cut was a major disappointment and that Alma Reville  Hitch's wife  took over re edited and the results have been praised applauded and studied ever since. Janet Leigh's Marion Crane created a movie landmark with her shower scene. Bernard Herrmann and his strings created an extra character that we recognize as soon as it reappears under any disguise but what shook me the most now in 2017 is Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. His performance has evolved with the passing of time and its effect has remain as chilling as moving as funny and as real as it was in 1960. It's interesting to watch Gus Van Sant's 1998 version with Vince Vaugh as Norman Bates. If you look at the film shot by shot with Berrnard Herrmann's strings  it's pretty fantastic.  Play it in black and white if you can. The problem and it is a monumental problem we wait for Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins if the casting of Anne Heche was really bad  not a hint of Janet Leigh's humanity the casting of Vince Vaughn was incomprehensible. Not just not credible for a moment but annoying very annoying. Anthony Perkins brought something profoundly personal to Norman Bates and as a consequence we connected with his sickness. We felt for him. Okay sorry I didn't mean to go there but I felt compelled to because I saw again Psycho 1960 ad Psycho 1998 at 24 hours from each other and realized that the main flaw of the 1998 versions is the absence of Anthony Perkins.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I watched this for the first time in over 30 years I was surprised how little action there was since I had remembered this as some intense horror movie. Of course I was young and more impressionable so I guess I just remembered those few dramatic sensational scenes such as Janet Leigh murdered in the shower and the quick other murder at the top of the stairs. Basically that was about it actionwise BUT I have no complaints because the more I watch this film the more I like it. It has become my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie along with Rear Window.I mention the lack of action and blood too because younger people who might be watching this for the first time are not going to see the kind of horror film they're accustomed to seeing. A generation back movie makers tended to build up characters and suspense so there was a lot more storytelling and less action than you see today. Also this movie doesn't have the shock value today for audiences either not after years of Freddie Kruegertype bloodandguts seen in the past 30 years.But what you WILL see in this movie is 1 superb acting 2 a fascinating lead character 3 excellent photography and 4 a bizarre story.Norman Bates is one of the most famous fictional names in film history thanks to this film and the great work portraying him by Anthony Perkins. Norman is a nutcase as it turns out and the more you know all about him the more fun it is to study Perkins and his character Norman in subsequent viewings. He really has the guy down pat. However it isn't just Perkins' film the supporting is just fine with Leigh whose figure is still awesome no matter how many times you see it Martin Balsam as the private detective Vera Miles and John Gavin. Everyone contributes.What makes me really enjoy this movie is the cinematography. I bought this on VHS when it became available on widescreen. Later of course I got the DVD. Each time I appreciate John Russell's camerawork and Hitchcock's direction more and more. I wonder if this isn't Hitchcock's best job of directing as his camera angles and lighting are outstanding. On the DVD the blacks whites and grays are just super and the famous house next to the Bates Motel never looked better. That house really looks eerie.The sound effects in here don't hurt. When Balsam is attacked the accompanying frightening music never fails to bring chills down my spine. The music literally screams at you.I went 35 years between showings but now have watched this five times in the past four years. I love it and look forward to seeing it again. Many people here think this is Hitchcock's greatest film. Add me to that list.".

	schema:reviewBody "What can you say about a film that's been talked about to death? Just this If you've never seen it you owe it to yourself to do so not because it's a way of paying homage to the one true master of modern film but because it's so fun to watch.Janet Leigh plays a bored office drone who decides to steal some loot from her boss's obnoxious client and parlay it into a new life with her alltoodistant boyfriend. All is going more or less according to plan until she stops in at the wrong motel where she befriends a friendly if somewhat nerdy desk clerk only to find it causes problems with that clerk's possessive mother who as her boy explains is not herself today. I'll say she isn't and so would Leigh's Marion Crane who maybe should have put up that DoNotDisturb sign before taking a shower.You can feel the decade literally shifting out of '50s and into '60s with this one. Even the opening shot where the camera looks over a Western U.S. city in the middle of the afternoon and zooms in on what looks exactly like the Texas School Book Depository overlooking Dealey Plaza. Norman Rockwell touches abound like the decor of the motel but look at what's going on around it. People dress well they still wear fedoras and jackets but in their tense conversations and hooded gazes you can feel the culture just ticking away like a time bomb waiting to explode.Most especially there's Anthony Perkins who plays motel clerk Norman Bates in a very oddly naturalistic way complete with facial tics and halfswallowed words not the polished image one expected to see then. Just compare him with John Gavin who plays Marion's boyfriend in the standardactoroftheday way. Perkins manages to be so weirdly magnetizing even in small moments like the way he stumbles on the word falsity or notes how creepy he finds dampness to be.He shines in bigger scenes too like his tense chat with Martin Balsam's boorish but diligent private detective character Arbogast who along with Perkins and Leigh delivers a landmark performance. The way both actors play out the awkwardness in their conversation makes you literally sweat. Then again you're always uneasy around Norman. You definitely feel wary of him right away but you find yourself liking him too even when he's busy covering up Mother's misdeeds. Not since Bela Legosi played Dracula did you get a horror movie with such a compelling central figure.If you are sampling the many other comments here be sure to look up Merwyn Grote's. He makes an interesting compelling case for how director Alfred Hitchcock used his television series as a template for Psycho. Certainly Psycho looks more like early 1960s television than any of the more sumptuous fare Hitchcock had been bringing to screen at the time. Not only is it in blackandwhite not color but the sets a ramshackle motel a mothbally old house a couple of cheap looking bedrooms a bathroom in a usedcar dealership are deliberately low class.It's thrilling to see Hitchcock move so effectively outside his normal element and move things along with such clinical detachment and lowkey technical finesse. Thrilling too to realize this is one of his most accomplished products made by a man who was experienced enough to know how the game was played and daring enough still to break the rules indeed start a whole new ballgame.Is it the best Hitchcock movie? It's definitely one of his best right up there with The 39 Steps and Strangers On A Train and Sabotage and Shadow Of A Doubt. He only once again came close to making as good a film with The Birds while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely and became an ambassador.Often imitated parodied referenced and analyzed to death Psycho still isn't played out nearly 45 years after it came out. You owe it to yourself to pay a visit to the Bates Motel Norman has a room ready.".

	onyx:emotionText "What can you say about a film that's been talked about to death? Just this If you've never seen it you owe it to yourself to do so not because it's a way of paying homage to the one true master of modern film but because it's so fun to watch.Janet Leigh plays a bored office drone who decides to steal some loot from her boss's obnoxious client and parlay it into a new life with her alltoodistant boyfriend. All is going more or less according to plan until she stops in at the wrong motel where she befriends a friendly if somewhat nerdy desk clerk only to find it causes problems with that clerk's possessive mother who as her boy explains is not herself today. I'll say she isn't and so would Leigh's Marion Crane who maybe should have put up that DoNotDisturb sign before taking a shower.You can feel the decade literally shifting out of '50s and into '60s with this one.

	schema:reviewBody "Yes everything you've heard is true. The score is a part of pop culture. The domestic conflict is wellknown. But nothing shocks like the experience itself.If you have not seen this movie do yourself a favor. Stop reading thse comments get up take a shower then GO GET THIS MOVIE. Buy it don't rent. You will not regret it.Psycho is easily the best horrorthriller of all time. Nothing even comes close...maybe Les Diaboliques 1955 but not really.Psycho has one of the best scripts you'll ever find in a movie. The movie's only shortcoming is that one of the characters seems to have little motivation in the first act of the movie but as the story progresses you realize that Hitchcock GENIUS! GENIUS! GENIUS! in a stroke of genius has done this on purpose because there is another character whose motivations are even more important. Vitally important. So important that you totally forget about anything else. I was lucky enough to have spent my life wisely avoiding any conversation regarding the plot of this movie until I was able to see it in full. Thank God I did! The movie has arguably the best midplot point and climactic twist in thriller history and certainly the bestdirected ending. The last few shots are chilling and leave a lingering horror in the viewer's mind.Just as good as the writing is Hitchcock's direction which is so outstanding that it defies explanation. Suffice it to say that this movie is probably the best directorial effort by film history's best director. I was fortunate enough to see this movie at a big oldtime movie house during a Hitchcock revival. Janet Leigh still radiant spoke before the film and explained how Hitchcock's genius was in his ability to 1 frighten without gore and 2 leave his indelible mark on the movie without overshadowing his actors like the great Jean Renoir could never do. Psycho is clearly its own phenomenon despite all the bigname talent involved.Hitchcock does not disappoint by leaving out his trademark dark humor. His brilliance is in making a climax that is at once both scary and hilarious. When I saw it in the theatre the audience was both gasping in disbelief while fallingonthefloor laughing.One more thing...Tony Perkins. Janet Leigh got muchdeserved accolades for this film but it is Perkins who gives what remains the single best performance by an actor in a horror movie. He is so understated that his brillance passes you by. He becomes the character. The sheer brillance of the role is evidenced by the ineptitude of the actors in Gus Van Sant's 1998 dear God make it stop! shotforshot remake. Though the movies are nearly identical Hitchcock's is superior mostly because of the acting and the atmosphere some of the creepiness is lost with color. This is made obvious by the initial conversation between Leigh's character and Perkins a pivotal scene. The brilliance of Perkins in the original shines even brighter when compared with the ruination in the remake even though the words and the shots were exactly the same. The crucial chemistry in this scene lacking in the remake gives everything away and mars our understanding of upcoming events. The fact that Perkins could never escape this role  his star stopped rising star as it had done in the 50s  proves that he played the part perhaps too well.I keep using the word brilliant but I cannot hide my enthusiasm for this movie. It is wholly unlike the overblown overbudget overlong fluff spewing alltoooften out of Hollywood today. Psycho is simple wellcrafted and just the right length.Elevenandahalf out of ten stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "When you look up the phrase Horror Film in the dictionary .. a picture of Janet Leigh screaming in a shower should appear next to it. Undoubtedly Psycho is the greatest horror film ever made barnone. The story is incredible. The acting is near perfection. The cinematography is godly. The soundtrack is perfect. It's hard to find anything wrong with Psycho. Perhaps the only imperfection I can find with Psycho is the inability to stand the test of time. One of the reasons the shower scene has become so notorious is that it's not only filmed to perfection but because the elements of sexuality and murder are so surreal. In 1960 seeing a nude women being murdered in a shower was something that noone had experienced yet and was quite shocking. Nowadays seeing Jason doublespearing two lovers having sex is nothing uncommon. I envy those who experienced Psycho in 1960 in the theaters .. those experienced the full terror of Psycho.Aside from this though the movie is flawless. I won't even go into to how incredible the cinematography is. One thing I think people seem to forget about the movie is the incredible soundtrack. Sound is such an important element in movies and Psycho is undaunted when it comes to sound. The only other horror movie that even comes close to using sound with such perfection is Halloween 1978.The movie is perfectly casted as well. Janet Leigh as the beautiful Marion Crane Vera Miles as the concerned sister Lila Crane and of course the unforgettable performance from Anthony Perkins as the eerie yet charismatic Norman Bates.I would recommend this movie to any horror movie film fanatic. I would especially recommend this movie to any horror movie fan not desensitized by Friday The 13th Nightmare On Elm Street or Scream .. if such a fan exists.".

	schema:reviewBody "Alfred Hitchock is the master of suspense and Psycho is probably his most famous film. Because let's face it one way or another you have seen or heard of this film. It's been made fun of been remadeunfortunately not to mention that this movie's word will be spred from generation to generation. I came across it very young my parents used to tell me how scary it was and how I wouldn't want to take a shower after watching this film. I didn't believe them but when I watched it I for the first time pulled the blanket over my head it was that frightening! The thing that is so amazing about Psycho is how much of an impact it made and understandably why it did. It ranked in over 60 million dollars at the box office now this was the time where tickets were like 50 cents at the theater now if you compare that to today that's Titanic like money! It broke many taboo's like this was the first film to show a toilet being flushed isn't that interesting? My high school teacher said that her and her mom saw Psycho when it was first released in theaters and she actually ran out of the theater terrified! Alfred did so well keeping us glued to our seats with all his great twists! This was before The Sixth Sense I mean the ending is just such a mind blower! But I won't give spoilers.Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane a woman who is in love with a divorced man Sam Loomis. He says once he pays his ex wife off with the alimony they'll get married. When Marion's boss asks her to put their most valued client's money 40000 to be exact and bring it to the bank. She has other plans though she takes the money for herself and flee's the city but not before her boss sees her driving off. Shaky enough huh? But she pulls over to get a nap in and a police officer asks if she's OK but she gets shaky and just wants to drive off. The policemen fallows her since she is so shaky and she ends up buying a different car. She gets caught in a giant rainstorm and pulls over to the Bates Motel.She meets there the owner a pleasant and polite young man Norman Bates. He lives in the house next to the motel with his mother. Marion checks in and Norman offers her dinner they have a conversation mostly about his mom and Marion is concerned when she heard screams from the house that sounded like his mom. Norman gets on the defenses and asks Marion some questions as well she says she is going to a private island. Norman is very attracted to her you can tell immediately and she leaves knowing that she has to get out of the trap she set for herself back in Phoenix. As she's taking a shower before bed a mysterious figure comes to the curtain and opens it stabbing Marion violently several times causing her to die. Norman cleans up the mess and gets rid of her body not knowing about her money and throwing that away too.Marion's boyfriend Sam and her sister Lola hire a private detective to find her. The private detective comes across The Bates Motel and doesn't end up coming back after trying to talk to the mother. Lola and Sam are concerned and decide to investigate for themselves but will they end up coming back to the city alive? Psycho is just one of those movies you have to see before you die. It's one of the most important films of our time and will never be forgotten. It's a true treasure with terrific actors and a terrifying plot that will give you nightmares for weeks! Please don't let that scare you I'm just having fun but it is a freaky film! Watch it in the dark! It has a better effect I think. Over 40 years and this film is still horrifying as if it were made today! 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "...from the first time I saw it at age 14 until today whenever I run across it.This is the rare example of a muchballyhooed film that is truly deserving of all the hype surrounding it. It would have been nice to have experienced the film without any knowledge of the plot twists. Unfortunately for most viewers the big surprises are not possible since so many of the scenes are part of our popular culture.There were however so many unexpected surprises. The opening scene with Janet Leigh and John Gavin in the hotel room was amazing and pardon the clich so real. Hitchcock and Janet Leigh did a brilliant job of pulling us into Marion Crane's story that of a woman in love with a divorced man who might as well be married considering his heavy financial obligations that leave him unable to marry in a practical sense even though he can in a legal sense. He doesn't even have a proper home  just a room in the back of the store he owns. Marion is then seemingly set up as the center of the movie as she thinks she has found a solution to her problems  a felonious one. Then the focus is skillfully shifted to the Norman Bates character as the protagonist victimized by his insane mother or so it seemed and then the focus is shifted once again to Marion's sister's search. The movie was adapted from a novel so some of the original audience would have been familiar with the plot of the book. In the novel Norman Bates was a middleaged man. I think it was a brilliant stroke to have the Norman of the film as a man in his twenties a boy who never grew up in a man's body. Anthony Perkins is so identified today with his role of Norman Bates that it was surprising to see how endearingly he played him in the early scenes. And he did one of the best stammers I've ever seen in a movie when he was being questioned by the private detective Martin Balsam who is also searching for Marion. I also wasn't expecting to see how protective the local sheriff and his wife were of Norman when they were being questioned about him and his mother. You could tell they didn't want somebody Norman whom they thought had been dealt a bad hand to have anymore publicity and scrutiny than he already had.This film is mentioned in the documentary Moguls and Movie Stars as an example of how films were becoming more like TV as the 60s began  spartan art design and a script that was bold in the amount of sex and violence it had even if the vast majority is implied. You have to be impressed by the versatility that is Hitchcock. Making movies in England? No problem. Making movies in the American studio system? No problem. Modernizing to deal with the evaporation of the production code? Again no problem. Weird factoid  for you TCM fans out there Robert Osborne is credited as man in Psycho although I don't remember him ever mentioning it. The only person it could possibly be unless he never comes close to having his face on camera is the parson as the sheriff and his wife are exiting church. See what you think.".

Could you possibly imagine anyone other than Nicholson in the role of Randall P. McMurphy in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest or Dennis Hopper as Billy in Easy Rider?  Keep in mind the introverted insecure Mama's Boy was not really PSYCHOpathic as Hannibal The Cannibal was in Silence of the Lambs  a coldblooded killer with no conscience  but rather criminally insane plagued by schizophrenic delusions and seriously in need of multiple realitychecks.  Anthony Hopkins did a wonderful job as the vicious Hannibal and also as Corky the schizokiller ventriloquist in Magic.

	schema:headline " A Perfect Film.";
	schema:reviewBody "Perfect films are few and far between and the filmmakers usually have no inkling as to the topnotch quality of work they are doing.  Alfred Hitchcock thought it was a good idea to make a new kind of suspense picture back in 1959.  Something that would give the audience goose bumps was in order but bigger bumps must have been the goal.  Hitch had to use his TV crew from his network series Alfred Hitchcock Presents... because many film executives didn't like the material.  Little did they know that the big Brit was about to make a cinematic milestone and change the way films are structured and material is presented.  At the time PSYCHO was a nastyspirited movie that led some moviegoers to leave early or stop taking showers.  It has held up amazingly well and is far superior to its countless ripoffs.PSYCHO is perfect because 1 It is in black and white not blazing technicolor which would have stained the film for no purpose and made the shower murder less artistic. Hitch may have went the route of director Michael Powell who became an outcast once his technicolor murder flick PEEPING TOM was seen.2The featured star disappears a third of the way through igniting a new method of scriptwriting and casting.  Hitch made strict stipulations for theatre owners not to allow people into the movie once the picture started in order for this secret to stay secret.3Lesser known actors are used to provide a more authentic feel for the characters.  This is so true in the case of Anthony Perkins not exactly a Cary Grant who creates a stunningly chaotic portrayal of an abused sonmental madman. Hitch shoots him from tilted angles and shadowy atmospheres to project Norman Bates' unquestionably distorted state of mind not to mention his evil grin.4 The shower scene of course.  Never before in any film of any kind known to man had people seen such frightening butchery and frank brutality. Hitch storyboarded each of the 80 cuts that take place within the 2 minute segment.5 Norman Bates' mother who sits upstairs in the old house on the hill and just watches what transpires when she's not taking part in it.  Hitch makes her a mystery until the very end when she is finally revealed to us and to Vera Miles in a masterfully shot turn of a chair.6The setup and payoff which consists of 40000 dollars a device common in most thrillers but new to this kind of psychological terror.  Hitch makes the viewer think the 40 grand will be the staple of importance and plot when it really disappears amidst the horror and has no significance at all.7Finally composer Bernard Hermann's famed musical score is a pulsating vibrant piece of gothic composition that matches the story and character actions perfectly.  Hitch and Hermann worked on several films together none better than this.Is there any other question that PSYCHO is one of the top 7 or 8 films of all time?  I don't think so.  Just look how film history began a slow course towards more independence and honesty after PSYCHO scared everyone into believing this kind of film could be made.RATING 10".

	schema:headline " It was a dark and stormy night...";
	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERSFor most people the most memorable scene in Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO indeed it's most famous scene is the shower sequence. It has been broken down and analyzed ad nauseam as an example of the fine art of editing. It is a great sequence but to me the best scene in PSYCHO occurs just before that. Janet Leigh as Marion Crane on the run from having committed a crime sits in the parlor behind the Bates Motel's office and discusses nothing and everything with Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates the motel's lonely proprietor. It is a chat between strangers who desperately need to talk to someone anyone but have no one to whom they can confide. It is a beautifully written and acted scene which serves as the calm before the storm. For all of its flashiness and sleightofhand gore the shower sequence isn't nearly as effective at showing what a master filmmaker Hitchcock was. It is in the parlor scene that the entire narrative spins around as the audience is prompted to switch their allegiance from Marion to Norman. Nothing really happens in the scene other than two characters talking but how things are said reveals as much as what is actually said. Here Marion comes to terms with her mistake and decides to pull herself out of her private trap. Norman introduces us indirectly to Mother and wins our sympathy which is vital to the way the rest of the film plays out. The scene very skillfully sets the mood of uneasiness that propels us into the upcoming murder even as it suggests that Marion is achieving a sense of inner peace. Madness is revealed danger is suggested yet the audiences is coolly and cruelly lulled into an almost tranquil state. It is obvious something is coming but not so soon. Then the shower curtain is ripped aside and blood begins to splatter.The measure of a film like PSYCHO is not how cleverly it fools you the first time but how irrelevant its surprises are to enjoying it time after time. Indeed compare it to Gus Van Sant's 1998 remake or even Brian De Palma's 1980 semiremake DRESSED TO KILL and the power of the film is obvious. Van Sant's version though a scene for scene imitation is barely watchable even once especially if you are already familiar with the plot and while De Palma's homage is stylish and intriguing the first time around its psychology and plot tricks don't stand up on repeated viewings. By contrast Hitchcock's PSYCHO can be viewed repeatedly with full awareness and appreciation of knowing what is coming up next. I think an element of Hitchcock's genius is apparent in that he doesn't treat his major plot twist as a just a gimmick. The entire first half of PSYCHO could have been treated as just a shaggy dog story a prelude marking time until Norman Bates' story takes center stage. But Hitchcock realized that Janet Leigh's story had to be presented with all due gravity otherwise the shift to Anthony Perkins' story wouldn't be nearly as effective. Neither Van Sant nor De Palma seemed to understand this especially De Palma who treats the Angie Dickinson scenes in DRESSED with a cruel condescending sense of humor. Hitchcock's PSYCHO works as a whole but could very easily have been presented as two independent episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents..... Marion Crane's story is not just a build up though Hitchcock himself claimed that killing off his leading lady was all meant as a joke on the audience but as a complete story unto itself replete with the type of shocking twist ending that was the hallmark of Hitchcock's television anthology. Likewise the Norman Bates half of PSYCHO is a complete suspense tale in its own right. The shower scene is the bridge between the two stories but it is the scene in the parlor that cements the two tales  and the fates of the two protagonist. And if you look at PSYCHO as two separate parts of a whole then Marion's story is revealed to be the more complete of the two. Norman's story while beautifully done is essentially a mystery story Sam Lila and Arbogast are trying to solve a whodunit what happened to Marion and the 40000? The cleverness of Hitchcock and screenwriter Joseph Stefano is that they let us think we know the answer right off the bat building to a conclusion where it is revealed how completely we have been fooled. In the end we know little more than Lila and Sam. To some extent this is the real gimmick of the film. On the other hand Marion's story allows Hitchcock to make so much out of so little. He creates tension even though there is no tangible threat. Marion is on the run with stolen funds but the theft hasn't even been discovered yet. All of the danger is strictly in her mind What will happen when...? She is a smart woman who has done something very stupid but proceeds even as her fears grow and grow. But cinematically the suspense is created out of mundane things a policeman's face at the car window rain and windshield wipers slashing across the screen the glare of on coming headlights. Mix this with the haunting voice overs of accusing voices and Bernard Herrmann incredible musical violence and the effect is hypnotic. But these imagined dangers do not prepare Marian or the audience for the real dangers ahead.And something has to be said for Janet Leigh. Always overshadowed by Anthony Perkins' iconic performance Leigh never gets her due though she was nominated for an Oscar she lost to Shirley Jones in ELMER GANTRY. But she dominates the first half of the film with a vivid performance that is sexual humorous and bittersweet. So much of her role depends on the subtlety of her facial expressions her sad smile at pretending to believe Sam's excuses for not marrying her her bemused glances at the flirtatious old millionaire her selfsatisfied smirks as she thinks about how people will react to discovering her crime her mixture of concern and fear as she talks to Norman in the backroom parlor. Plus she displays an attitude that is both smart and sexy. It is one of the great film performance.It's easy to take PSYCHO for granted now it has been imitated so many times in so many ways by far lesser talents. Indeed it's one negative is that it inspired so may pale imitations including its own three sequels and a very bad remake. Yet even so PSYCHO remains a one and only original. And its iconic status can't be denied it redefined the concepts of what a Hitchcock film was and what a horror film could be.".

	schema:headline " A Hitchcock masterpiecethanks to Bernard Herrmann";
	schema:reviewBody "Psycho ranks second on a list of Alfred Hitchcock's four masterpieces following Vertigo and followed by North by Northwest and Rear Window which ranks number four only because it lacks a Bernard Herrmann score. While Hitch's camera is always the best feature of his films Herrmann is the artist who puts three of them over the top and into the realm of true greatnesssetting them beyond such neargreat movies as Notorious and Strangers on a Train which both had good scores but nothing like the sublime and haunting music of this film. There is no underestimating Hitchcock nor the work of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins who play the film's two main characters but without Herrmann this could not have been a great movie.The opening scene is the best place to appreciate both Herrmann and Hitchcock. Joseph Stefano's script is extremely wellstructured and it was his idea to make Marion Crane the story's main character before switching over forty minutes later to Norman Bates. In the original novel Robert Bloch dispatches Mary Crane much sooner. But his dialogue is often stilted and the opening scene where Marion and Sam Loomis John Gavin share a lunchtime tryst in a cheap hotel is badly written. The fault is made worse by Gavin whose performance is stiff and awkward throughout nowhere more than here. Yet this scene is among the glories of the movie with the camera the music and Janet Leigh's performance all giving it an aching poignancy that haunts our minds long after the film is over. Our sense of Marion's longing and frustration which could not be conveyed by Leigh alone is necessary for us to understand why she commits the rash act of stealing money from her boss's client. Watch how much is conveyed to us by the camera when Marion suddenly rises from the bed. Listen how much is conveyed by Herrmann's music when Sam spreads out his hands in mocksurrender and says All right. The scene as written would seem unworkable in other hands in the hands of Herrmann and Hitchcock and Leigh it becomes masterly.Gus Van Sant's remake a fascinating failure helps us appreciate many things about this film including the performanceseven perversely the performances of Gavin and Vera Miles who plays Marion's sister Lila. Gavin is incompetent and Miles is thoroughly competent but both have the same effect on us we don't care about them. Or rather we would be bored by them if they were doing anything other than solving the mystery of Marion's disappearance. Viggo Mortensen and Julianne Moore give these bland characters more dimension and in doing so annoy us with their distracting personalities. Characters that are deliberately featureless often excite our imaginations more than ones that are full of tedious quirks. As is so often true with old movies their faults prove to be virtues when remakes attempt to correct them.Oddly I vividly remember everything about the Van Sant film except for Vince Vaughn's performance as Norman Bates I only remember that at the time I thought it was excellent. Anne Heche by contrast was memorably awful especially in the one scene that enhances our appreciation of Janet Leigh. When Marion is in her apartment alone and without any monologue packing her things and worrying about her mad plan Leigh conveys all the anxiety in her decision with a minimum of affectation. But Heche not only makes the putrid decision to play the scene as if she is halfamused by her own craziness she conveys this idea with the maximum of overplaying as if she were compensating for her lack of dialogue with broad gestures and eyerolling. Leigh shows us how she feels Heche announces it over a megaphone.Anthony Perkins' performance as Norman Bates is among the most memorable ever recorded on film. He is sympathetic and frightening innocent and malign horrifyingly unlike us and even more horrifyingly like us. Stefano gives him the best lines and Hitchcock's camera is preternaturally adept at drawing us into his world when necessary and then coldly keeping us distant when needed. Yet with all this how much more than a satisfying thriller with a clever trick ending could Psycho have been without Herrmann's score to help it transcend itself? Could Norman Bates have haunted us as much with a merely excellent score like the ones for Strangers on a Train and Frenzy? Neither Bloch nor Stefano is Shakespeare and Norman Bates does not live on the page as Macbeth Edmund and Iago do. Could Norman Bates like Shakespeare's characters live for fourhundred more years? If he survives it will have been the joint genius of Perkins Hitchcock and Bernard Herrmann that rendered him and his story an immortal nightmare.".

She meets the innkeeper a fragile and soft spoken young man who is emotionally and verbally pushed around by his overbearing mother.What follows is a tension filled and horrifying tale of psychological suspense.

Nothing to me could be more terrifying than the reality that people like some of those presented in this film truly exist in our world. It takes a lot more than fake blood and overlygory special effects to impress me and the sad thing is that today's horror films and even some claiming to be suspense films rely too much on the supernatural or just plain disgusting to achieve their affect. None of that for me thanks.One of my true pleasures is to see someone view this film for the first time. Moments in the film tend to shock or surprise people who think they've seen it all. Those who have seen enough knockoffs and there are a TON of them may figure out some of the story's plot before it is revealed but only because so many films have shamelessly ripped this one off.

Hitchcock uses pure cinema to arouse audience emotions...For the first forty minutes he cautiously builds up sympathy and audience identification with a troubled fugitive a young estate secretary Marion Crane Janet Leigh who wants to marry Sam Loomis John Gavin but neither can afford it... Entrusted by a wealthy customer with 40000 to put in a safe deposit box in a bank she succumbs to temptation and steals the money in order to start a new life with her lover... So the motive is love! We begin to feel the tension when she's spotted  leaving Phoenix Arizona  by her boss who thinks she remains in bed with a headache... Then when she pulls off the highway to take a nap and is awaken by a suspicious patrolman  in disturbing dark glasses  who trails her... Hitchcock's trademark paranoia about the police is here at his best...Frightened and tired by a violent rainstorm she stops at Bates Motel and has a small talk with a twitchy cordial motel keeper Norman Bates Anthony Perkinsin an outstanding performance an attractive shy young man who seems uneasy around her and can't even bring himself to pronounce the world bathroom...The movie turns dark and claustrophobic when she overheard the voice of Norman's mother speaking sharply with her son and after she learns Norman's strong devotion to his irritable mother...Alone in the room she strips to shower Safe and relaxing the hot air rises as the water cascades over her Suddenly she turns at a sound her eyes dilate with horror and her repeated screams rend the air as a hand from nowhere holding a long knife plunges it repeatedly into her body Her blood mingling with the water flushes down the drain in one of the most terrifying images of modern cinema No one who saw the film will forget the shock effect of that scene... Not only because of its terrifying realism with the blood gushing and swirling on the shower floor but also because Leigh was a sympathetic and star figure Although she had stolen we felt involved with her as we were involved with Marnie we wanted her to get away and here with twothirds of the film still to got we watched helplessly as the life and the beauty and the hopes were butchered out of herThe movie is only off one third when Hitchcock's spiral closeup of her unmoving eyeball reveals the nightmare... But the movie does really begin after her murder because once she is killed we never stop thinking about her...With Marion Crane gone our attention is shift to the sensitive Norman with a passion for birds and mother... They are very close and he guards her jealousy... As three people began to investigate our sympathies were subtly maneuvered to the goodlooking young man who it seemed must try to protect a homicidal mother We see him distraught cleaning up and disposing of Marion's car with her body and cash into a swamp... We have no reason to think that he himself have done the dirty work... So could his crippled old mother be the vicious murderer? Or do we have some other reason to suspect that Norman's abusive mother does not exist? We heard the old woman talking constantly to him and we see Norman carrying her to the cellar... Or is it another Hitchcock's trick? But the knife comes out again striking and killing... The high angle shot shows perfectly her mad menacing rush from her bedroom... Hitchcock's version is definitive a terrifying insinuating thriller with only two sudden and vicious murders... A classic essential cinema with his rich vivid and effective imagery in the use of light and shadow his voyeurism when Perkins spies on Leigh in a black bra The first time he shows a lady disrobed his 'metaphysical vertigo' in the overhead shot as Norman drags his mother down to the cellar...".

	schema:reviewBody "Throughout his long and illustrious career director Alfred Hitchcock thrilled and captivated audiences everywhere but never before or since as well as he did with the psychological chiller Psycho' which introduced the cinematic world to a guy named Norman Bates.  And now forty years later even in an age of jaded desensitized sensibilities graphic horror and the likes of Hannibal Lecter and American Psycho' Hitchcock's masterpiece remains even after repeated viewings truly frightening and intrinsically disturbing.  Just as Ingmar Bergman did with his character of Karin in his landmark film Through A Glass Darkly' Hitchcock presents a character Bates at the psychological crossroads of his life a pivotal juncture wherein he is required to make a conscious decision that will determine the course of the rest of his life  Whether to reach for the light and healing or succumb to the voices beckoning to him from the dark a place from which there will be no return.  Norman howeverlike karin is incapable of making that decision and ultimately must adhere to the resolution of the subconscious which takes him past the point of no return and subsequently beyond the reach of any help forevermore.  The rest of the characters in the story Marion Crane Lila Sam Loomis Arbogast are all mere pawns who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and are forced by fate to help play out the drama of Norman's twisted existence. Janet Leigh gives a memorable performance as Marion creating a character that was not only destined to go down in cinematic history but one that would make women everywhere afraid to shower at a motel.  Vera Miles is effective as Marion's sister Lila and John Gavin gives credibility to Marion's lover Sam Loomis.  Martin Balsam gives a solid performance as well as Arbogast the illfated Private Eye whose encounter with Norman's mother on the stairs is a scene nearly as famous as that of Marion's shower.'   But the real star of the film is of course Anthony Perkins who gives an Oscar worthy performance as Norman Bates a character even more chilling than Hannibal Lecter in that his outward appearance is so deceiving so contrary to the evil dwelling behind his unintended facade of normalcy.  His gentle countenance and boyish charm are so real' that after being exposed to him it forever after makes anyone and everyone you encounter in your own life suspect.  And Perkins plays him to perfection in arguably the best and definitely the most memorable performance of his career. The supporting cast includes John McIntire Sheriff Chambers Simon Oakland Dr. Richmond Vaughn Taylor George Lowery Frank Albertson Tom Cassidy Lurene Tuttle Mrs. Chambers Patricia Hitchcock Caroline John Anderson Charlie and Mort Mills Highway Patrolman.  If there was any doubt by the time this film was made Psycho' once and for all proved that Hitchcock was indeed the Master of Suspense.  There have been many imitators before and since but all of them good and bad alike only serve to point out that nobody does it better than Hitchcock.  I rate this one 1010.".

And now forty years later even in an age of jaded desensitized sensibilities graphic horror and the likes of Hannibal Lecter and American Psycho' Hitchcock's masterpiece remains even after repeated viewings truly frightening and intrinsically disturbing.  Just as Ingmar Bergman did with his character of Karin in his landmark film Through A Glass Darkly' Hitchcock presents a character Bates at the psychological crossroads of his life a pivotal juncture wherein he is required to make a conscious decision that will determine the course of the rest of his life  Whether to reach for the light and healing or succumb to the voices beckoning to him from the dark a place from which there will be no return.  Norman howeverlike karin is incapable of making that decision and ultimately must adhere to the resolution of the subconscious which takes him past the point of no return and subsequently beyond the reach of any help forevermore.  The rest of the characters in the story Marion Crane Lila Sam Loomis Arbogast are all mere pawns who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and are forced by fate to help play out the drama of Norman's twisted existence. Janet Leigh gives a memorable performance as Marion creating a character that was not only destined to go down in cinematic history but one that would make women everywhere afraid to shower at a motel.  Vera Miles is effective as Marion's sister Lila and John Gavin gives credibility to Marion's lover Sam Loomis.  Martin Balsam gives a solid performance as well as Arbogast the illfated Private Eye whose encounter with Norman's mother on the stairs is a scene nearly as famous as that of Marion's shower.'   But the real star of the film is of course Anthony Perkins who gives an Oscar worthy performance as Norman Bates a character even more chilling than Hannibal Lecter in that his outward appearance is so deceiving so contrary to the evil dwelling behind his unintended facade of normalcy.  His gentle countenance and boyish charm are so real' that after being exposed to him it forever after makes anyone and everyone you encounter in your own life suspect.  And Perkins plays him to perfection in arguably the best and definitely the most memorable performance of his career. The supporting cast includes John McIntire Sheriff Chambers Simon Oakland Dr. Richmond Vaughn Taylor George Lowery Frank Albertson Tom Cassidy Lurene Tuttle Mrs. Chambers Patricia Hitchcock Caroline John Anderson Charlie and Mort Mills Highway Patrolman.  If there was any doubt by the time this film was made Psycho' once and for all proved that Hitchcock was indeed the Master of Suspense.  There have been many imitators before and since but all of them good and bad alike only serve to point out that nobody does it better than Hitchcock.  I rate this one 1010.";

	schema:reviewBody "The psychological threads of the film are so complex as to be nearly inexhaustible this feature alone contributes to its place in film history as one of the great celluloid efforts of all time. Like any genuine work of true genius it may be enjoyed on more than one level. Alfred Hitchcock forced filmgoers to confront headon just a few of the shadowy corners of the human psyche the OedipusElektra complexes jealousy about sexual perceived sexual rights guilt and selfhatred as in Norman's crossdresssing to cite just a few examples of neurotic behavior. Perhaps the most frightening interpretation of the film is that one is responsible for one's actions and cannot ever alter the designated course a particular act has set in motion. Here it is Marion Crane's decision to steal the 40 grand from her employer in order to race to Fairvale to be with her illicit lover Sam Loomis. The opening vista a bleak mountain and desert landscape over Phoenix note the metaphor for both the geographical location and the town's name is replete with the futility of the lovers ever forging a permanent bond with one another. The film is a terrific essay of human desperation and its stray threads the hunger for sex for a safe haven for an ascendant place in one's tiny universe. The barrenness of the emotional landscape is shiveringly mirrored in Bernard Herrmann's shrill spiky score which speaks of the desolation of all humankind. Both murders are violent acts of mutilation and hatred one thinks not only for the victims but also for the perpetrator. Fittingly the killer's cleansing ritual takes place in a swamp the normal repository for all kinds of secrets and unclean dangerous organisms lurking beneath the stagnant surface. Finally I found most interesting the title on the record label on the turntable in Norman's room Beethoven's Eroica Symphony No. 3. This majestic noble work bears no resemblance to the music one would justly associate with the tormented mind of young Bates. One can only guess that the boy's impressionable mind was at one time quite normal and receptive to elevated experiences such as a hearing of this great work of Beethoven's but that jealousy perhaps having been spurred by an intimacy with his mother drove the boy to madness. Guilt one of the human being's great purgatives finds no outlet here as we see in Norman's feral smile at the film's end. Hitchcock's use of mirrors works wonderful psychological tricks upon us forcing us to wonder if what we see in our real and fancied mirrors is real.".

We begin at what is from the protagonist's point of view the beginning of the tale things happen that are interesting in their own right and not simply because we know that there's meant to be a mystery lurking somewhere we are given information as we go along and later revelations actually explain earlier puzzles.  Mamet doesn't force us through a maze.  Rather he lets us watch someone else walk through the maze and it's a pleasure.I'm determined not to spoil this pleasure so I'm unable to say anything at all really about what the movie's about.

This just isn't the kind of story suited to emotingwhilepretendingnotto acting.  All of the characters must dissemble in front of at least one other of the characters THAT gives nothing away trust me and all of them are just a little bit unsettling.I'll close by putting in a word for Carter Burwell's score.

	onyx:emotionText "You heard me.  Even if you prefer say Kevin Spacey's performance in The Usual Suspects' to Campbell Scott's here to each his own at least this is a film that plays fair with us.  We begin at what is from the protagonist's point of view the beginning of the tale things happen that are interesting in their own right and not simply because we know that there's meant to be a mystery lurking somewhere we are given information as we go along and later revelations actually explain earlier puzzles.  Mamet doesn't force us through a maze.  Rather he lets us watch someone else walk through the maze and it's a pleasure.I'm determined not to spoil this pleasure so I'm unable to say anything at all really about what the movie's about.

I enjoyed it both times but the second time around several plot holes were evident most of which took place in the last 20 minutes.Spoilers SpoilersThe problems start at the airport where it appears that Susan is going to double cross Joe by putting a gun in his baggage and giving him a ticket to Venezuela. Before going into the airport Susan insists that he get a clover for St. Patrick's Day from a guy at the entrance and this turns out to be a recording device that is later used to entrap Susan and Julian.

She is talking the the fake FBI lady verifying that she is a bad guy. Joe does not see this but it is obvious that they expected him to get arrested in the airport or else she would not be in a compromising position. Later on the ferry it is made to look as though it was planned that he would end up on the ferry the whole time so that Julian could kill him but that does not make any sense in light of the fact that they already planned to get him arrested at the airport.It also seems odd that it seemed planed by the US Marshals that he would get on the bus with the Japanese tourists that were all carrying the tubes one of which would later turn out to be holding a rifle. So did the Marshals plan for Joe to run out of the airport at the last minute just barely evading police? It seems as though they would have had to plan for him to get out of line at the last minute.These things at the end give the whole movie a very contrived feeling.

	schema:headline " A film that twists around suspense film conventions some spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "This is definitely a thinking man's suspense film that references thrillers of yore. I was reminded of two old films in particular North by Northwest and Charade. Both of these movies concern a mysterious goal and questions about identity.The high stakes involved are established in the first scene of the movie with the introduction of The Process a vaguely defined procedure or product that will make the company funding it very rich. Joe Ross the inventor of The Process is soon marked for an elaborate con game and finds his world tipped upside down with no one being exactly who they seem.A brief consideration of the plot will quickly reveal holes but plot really isn't the point of the film. It's the ideas presented here that make the film fascinating. Even the title The Spanish Prisoner that supposedly references an ancient confidence game doesn't make much sense. The actual confidence game that plays out on the screen bears little resemblance to the Spanish Prisoner as described. In fact the Spanish Prisoner confidence sounds more like the basic structure of the cinematic thriller the guy gets the money and the princess. It is this basic structure that Mamet twists just a little. A good example of this is the use of the innocent remark that triggers a memory of something essential. A mother berating her child become the example of this in the film but rather than making her remark once as is usually done in such films she repeats it over and over again. In doing this Mamet is hitting us over the head with the comment's significance and calling attention to it as a cinematic convention.Ultimately what are interesting are the ideas being presented the effects of deception the slipperiness of identity and the ambiguity present in all our lives. All of these ideas are communicated via characters' comments and various objects with some kind of metaphoric meaning. For example the film creates an interesting metaphor with Joe's glasses. At one point Susan his secretary asks him to take them off as if asking him to stop looking at the world through rosecolored glasses and see her and the world for who and what they really are. I wonder if Susan was truly drawn to him at this point and offering him a real relationship if he will only see it. However he puts his glasses back on and gently rebuffs her. Susan rejected becomes committed to a course that will find her ultimately betraying him. Later when Joe goes to the only person who appears to be his ally and finds him dead his glasses with a bloody fingerprint are left on the table next to the body. He does not wear the glasses for the rest of the film symbolic of his finally seeing world around him for what it is untrustworthy and duplicitous.Joe is referred to somewhat disparagingly throughout the film as a boy scout. In fact the film initially seems to be somewhat contemptuous of nice guys in general as it is this characteristic of Joe's that the grifters use to their advantage. Whereas most cons appeal to victims' baser instincts this one appeals to higher ones. While this appears to be Joe's weakness cleverly it is also presented as one of his strengths. There are two times when the con goes awry and both times it is because of Joe's boy scout nature. The first is when Joe thoughtfully substitutes the wornout book given him by Jimmy to deliver to Jimmy's sister with a better copy and keeps the tattered book. The second time is towards the end of the film when Joe helps a woman struggling with her young child through airport security. The mother's comments as mentioned earlier spark Joe's memory. In addition as Joe and the security guard help the woman through the security guard misses the bag containing the gun handed to Joe by Susan. Unknowing Joe leaves it behind in his hurry to get back to New York narrowly avoiding an arrest that surely would have ended all his efforts to free himself from his nightmare. The screen with the xrayed image of the gun is the only image in the move that we see and Joe doesn't. While it broadcasts an interesting twist I think the scene was included to also punctuate the idea that maybe nice guys don't always finish last.However even Joe's good behavior can't protect him from everything and to save him Mamet employs the deus ex machina a tried and true method of rescuing the protagonist in suspense films of this ilk. Many a hero has appeared doomed only to have help from some totally unexpected and obscure corner. But even this convention is twisted a bit as the Japanese US Marshall who ultimately saves Joe actually appears in previous scenes.In conclusion The Spanish Prisoner is a film that entertains you while it's on and leaves you pondering a bit after it's done.".

This seed of doubt which others around him recognize sets into motion a whole series of secrets and deceptions.  The dialog is snappy as in all Mamet writing and you either really like the style a lot or you don't.  I really like it.

It is not a great film but a worthy one.Beside Steve martin in his serious role which he pulls off very well the film also has Ben Gazzara and Mamet's wife Rebecca Pidgeon who is very good in one of the key roles in this film.".

Ross is then drawn into a big conspiracy surrounds his valuable system. I won't go into the details so that i won't spoil the surprises and there are many. All the actors involved gives their best most notable are Rebecca Pigeon as Susan Joseph's pretty and sophisticated secretary and for Steve Martin who was very refreshing to see in a serious role. The film has some unique and intelligent dialogs often appear in David Mamet's works. The twists are very surprising but MAKE SENSE something that a lot of film makers have to learn these days.

A nice highrated crimemysterythriller from David Mamet with Steve Martin! Sounds great!But unfortunately it was probably one of the least thrilling thrillers I've ever watched. Predictable with plot holes indifferent directing and naive scenario. Spoilers Even though the whole movie was a big spoilJust to name a few cringe moments  why is Susan throughout the movie actively trying to convince the hero that Jimmy Dell wasn't actually on that hydroplane? She's in on it... you'd think she'd want to keep quiet about it. why did Susan help him escape the police from the NY airport and drove him to Boston only to then slip him a gun so he'd be arrested by the police.

Ridiculous!!The worst of all... why are con artists still around chasing Joe on the airport and boat scene? They have the book... they've setup everything to accuse Joe... it's over. They need nothing else from him. Just leave and you're home free. But they hang around for some reason and chase him. Even though they want nothing from him. Monumental idiotic! And just think about it for a minute... The con artists didn't really need anything from Joe. They had the second key from Mr Klein so they had the book at any time they wanted. They could setup everything to frame Joe without him even getting involved. What was all the other silly nonsense about? Creating a fake sister a fake FBI agent a fake apartment club etc. All that to make him bring the book... which they had access to all along. Pathetic!And just to mention few completely silly and embarrassing moments the woman shouting at the baby You got your FINGERPINTS all over the BOOK two or three times! Yes yes!! We got it!! We got it half an hour ago!! Joe painfully asking Susan a few times why she was a criminal. Why? Wow... talk naive scenario.They could however fix this whole movie with adding just one punchline. And I offer this free of charge for the director's cut version of the movie. When the US Marshals van leaves and he's left all alone on the pier at the end of the movie he could just turn towards the camera and say Gotcha Suckers!. Then all the Steve Martin fans would understand this movie is actually a parody from Bowfinger productions!".

A nice highrated crimemysterythriller from David Mamet with Steve Martin! Sounds great!But unfortunately it was probably one of the least thrilling thrillers I've ever watched. Predictable with plot holes indifferent directing and naive scenario. Spoilers Even though the whole movie was a big spoilJust to name a few cringe moments  why is Susan throughout the movie actively trying to convince the hero that Jimmy Dell wasn't actually on that hydroplane? She's in on it... you'd think she'd want to keep quiet about it. why did Susan help him escape the police from the NY airport and drove him to Boston only to then slip him a gun so he'd be arrested by the police. The airplane ticket she had was a return ticket from St. Estephe back to NY... in her name. And he would use that ticket to fly himself from Boston back to St. Estephe.

The film lacks the visual strengths of Hitch of course but it makes up for this with a clever script and a series of neat twists toward its end. The plot? Campbell Scott plays Joe Ross an unassuming guy who has invented a mysterious process worth a lot of money. Joe's boss promises to compensate him richly for the process but Joe is sceptical. Will he really be paid for his work? Joe's growing nervousness is subtly stoked by Jimmy Dell played by Steve Martin a charming and apparently wealthy new friend who...well to say anything more about the film would be to spoil the fun. Suffice to say that Prisoner delights in subverting expectations and continues Mamet's trend of casting comedians Steve Martin Danny Devito Tim Allen Ed O'Neil in serious tough guy rolls Mamet's all about scrambling preconceptions.The Spanish Prisoner lacks the big setpieces necessary to draw in the blockbuster crowd but it's nevertheless well written. Of course the key word here is written. Mamet's films are oft exercises in style but unlike most of cinema's stylists he sculpts entirely with the pen. He's playing with words with syntax and rhythm his characters often even pausing to discuss linguistics and the nature of words themselves. They argue over the meaning of words of literature and often stop to question the motivation of another character's use of a certain word. For Mamet language and prose are merely tools for persuasion and cinema is itself the ultimate card trick language the ultimate con.810  The joy of Mamet is in recognising how carefully he straddles the line between clich and genius taking the conventional beats of the thrillerconheist genre and using them to sing his own tune.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen Mamet's House of Games I sort of knew what to expect and how to watch this movie I expected a complex plot full of twists and hence I watched it with particular attention to detail.In the end the movie turns out to have three major plot twists. The first  and major  plot twist comes at about two thirds of the movie when it turns out that the FBI is a fake FBI and that they are in it together with Martin. I halfsuspected at one point that the FBI was fake but I must admit that this twist came as a genuine surprise. What did not come as a surprise at all was the second major plot twist about Rebecca Pidgeon being also involved in the conspiracy against Scott this was bleedin' obvious. From the very beginning she acted extremely suspiciously always hanging around Campbell and  as it turned out  had the duty to lead him on to participate in his own frameup as much as possible according to the conspirators' plans.And this is where the major flaw of the movie lies this second twist was not only obvious to the viewer  since all evidence pointed clearly to her guilt  but SHOULD have been obvious to Scott as well he is portrayed as a naive guy but they gave him enough intelligence for him to be able to work out the very obvious fact that Pidgeon was lying to him. This disappointed me Scott should have figured out that she is guilty BEFORE he was released on bail. I mean just the fact that she was so insistent on showing him those Caribbean photos AND that fake FBI card AND her suggestion to Scott to not trust what one is given in a package on a flight easily implicate her and Scott certainly had enough time in jail to figure that out. But he didn't as though he were a complete idiot or something.Oh well... Still the third and last major plot twist was a genuine surprise it turns out that the real FBI had Scott wired from the very time he left jail and that his bail's payer his boss Gazzara was the mastermind behind the entire highly complex scheme.The film draws you in gradually and never let's you doze off every minute there is something happening which might later be important. The plot is as complex as they get yet I think that if one analyzed the film there would be no logic flaws and that everything would indeed add up  apart from Scott not figuring the second major twist of course though this was not so much of a logic flaw in the plot but was instead a flaw in the characterization.This entire conspiracy story is to a degree farfetched without a doubt. However as long as logic is pretty much intact in a movie I allow for a certain level of farfetchedness after all this is only a movie and not a documentary. Also The Game is far more farfetched yet that film was very entertaining as well.The cast is very good except for Mamet's wife Rebecca Pidgeon who is totally wooden and should take some acting classes before appearing in another film. Mamet has a bad habit of putting his wives and mistresses in his movies and that can backfire when the ladies in question aren't professional actresses. She was similarly wooden in Homicide.".

On an Caribbean holiday along with his business partners he meets the very likable Jimmy Dell and over time they become friends. But things start getting really worrying for Joseph as he feels that his employers are trying to take all the credit for what's about to come. So Joseph turns to Jimmy for advice on the matter and Jimmy gladly lends a helping hand.Now The Spanish Prisoner has got to be one of the most undeservedly overlooked smallscale thrillers of the last decade. The only reason I can think why is because it's really a glum and quite subdue film that relies on a wellwritten story to keep you mesmerized and rather bamboozled. There's nothing overly stylish about it but it's such an elegant and easy going exercise that's professionally handled all round despite the elementary factors. So don't be expecting a potboiler with plenty of fastpaced thrills from this one. For me it's up there with another underappreciated 90s thriller Arlington Road. These were two films I knew nothing about but when I accidentally came across them I was more than impressed in what I saw.The shady paranoid premise is standard stuff for films of this ilk with it being cluttered with the usual cunning double crossings and misleading revelations. But while you might pick up on the web of deceit with it's twists and turns it's just that the complicated story is far more cerebral in its patterns that you are just compelled by it all. The further along the story goes the more interesting it does get with the spontaneous structure flowing with concise dialogues and underling sharp wit. Just who can you trust? What are their true intentions? Are they who they say they are? Money Money Money? Well we are talking about high fliers here . This sorely thorough cloud hangs high that it will have you thinking. Some twists and bluffs you might see coming but really you are never quite sure how its entirely going to pan out. Also I couldn't shake the feel of old style crime thrillers from the glass like texture that was manufactured here. The film's location had an atmospheric stronghold that got swept along with its softly moody music score.The performances were very good. Steve Martin was more than efficient as he played a unconventional role where he had to provide a real mystic edge and a laidback attitude to his character. Campbell Scott was satisfactory in a pretty bleak role as Joseph. That's not because of the performance but that was the character in the story and it's a real important element on how things played out. The support roles were strong by the likes of Rebecca Pigeon Ben Gazzara Ricky Jay and Felicity Huffman. Director  writer David Mamet has provided a tight and quite entertaining thriller that's a puzzle to work out.A vividly ingenious thriller that plays it rather patiently.".

I read where one wellknown critic labeled his acting as wooden but I didn't find that. He was okay as was the female lead Rebecca Pigeon.

She's made a couple of films since that are recognizable but I can't say the same for Scott. Also making smaller appearances here are name players Steve Martin and Ben Gazzara.The story is about an elaborate con job perpetrated on Scott. The problem with it is that it gets too confusing in the last half hour. Despite that I still found this movie intriguing even though it may not be one I would watch more than once possibly twice.

I like some of his films particularly Glengarry Glen Ross which is actually one of my favorites. But The Spanish Prisoner plays and sounds like a high school production. Literally.I cannot for the life of me understand how this film can be called intelligent. Yes it does not rely on violence sex swearing drugs alcohol traffic violations or even jaywalking to at least make it interesting. So call it a moral film whatever that means. Oh yes it has a plot. I assume that is why it's called intelligent.I sat through this plot not knowing a thing about the film and I could see and hear the twists coming like I was tied to a post watching a host of bison pounding impending death into my ears. Plus it had more holes in it than a room full of acupuncture patients.To begin the editing was AWFUL particularly the initial 30 minutes. Typically when two characters walk into a room it really does look like they were engrossed in conversation before walking in front of the camera. But in TSP it looks like Mamet had just given the go ahead to roll tape. It played like it was made up of strips of paper cut up with scissors and then glued together. There might as well have been a speedbump noise every time there was a scene change.And the dialogue?! What is even more discouraging than the abysmal quality of most films coming out now is when we're sold a piece of goods and people are convinced that it's intelligent. At least with the first problem we're merely disgruntled. With the second we're delusional. I find that depressing. So this film depressed me for that reason.How contrived TSP is is metaphorically represented by the prime element of its plot structure The System. OK? I don't mind vague points. But this is just lazy. Why couldn't he just have made it topsecret information which could be used for insider trading? Or information about a revolutionary new product? The plot of Episode I The Phantom Menace? Mamet may be acclaimed as a genius but he has to do more than throw out a script with a twist to have me sacrificing my firstborn to his word processor.I will grant you that art is not life. That said it should not be more artificial than artifice requires. If Mamet hopes to continue holding an audience made up of more than sophomoric dilettantes he should take some advice from another author.  The overdone or come tardy off though it might impress some cannot but make the judicious grieve. Reform it altogether David.".

His character was subdued but with something of an edge that you couldn't quite put your finger on. I also found that the twists and turns of the various plot devices were somewhat clever but this was also the movie's Achilles heel. Without giving any plot devices away there is simply NO WAY that even the most sophisticated organization could run such an elaborate con game. For every step that they would have to manipulate our Hero to there are many potential problems that would crop up and there are many contingency plans that would have to be developed. You would have to plan to have all the necessary people and resources available to achieve all your goals at every step of the way. For this plan to work the CIA and FBI combined couldn't have done the job. For the plot to work you have to believe that Joe Ross would ABSOLUTELY make ONE particular decision at each juncture. If he makes any other decision for example he decides to even glance casually at the Club Membership agreement instead of just blindly signing it then the entire plot falls apart.I'm led to believe by reading external reviews that this is supposed to be a well made filmnoir movie and that the characters are meant to talk..in..measured..staccato..deliberate..voices. I found that annoying. That's not how people talk and it takes my attention away from what they're saying.The direction was peculiar in a number of instances. For example some scenes were believable following from events that came before. Others seemed out of place as though inserted as an afterthought the ambiance wholly different from the scenes before or after it.Hey I like mysterythrillercon movies as much as anyone and I liked this one a little bit. But creating a successful con game for such a movie is a difficult job yet it's the most important part of the movie. Mamet didn't quite develop his con game enough so on a scale of 110 I'd give The Spanish Prisoner a 3.".

The scenes are ridiculous acting is dreadful. They didn't even bother with hiring enough extras to fill up a train cart and the gas chamber. It all looks like a field trip that ended up a bit badly.Uwe Boll apparently wanted to raise awareness about the Holocaust with the younger generations in Germany but has blundered monstrously. This is a joke and instead of raising awareness it raises your lunch. In my case it was just some yogurt but bad enough nevertheless.As noble as Uwe Boll's intentions might be please use some quality cinema on the topic and numerous genuine documentaries. There's a lot of those about highquality and accurate ones so just chuck this one out immediately. In case you were stupid enough to cough up some cash for this joke. I was for one.".

I'm a becoming history teacher so forgive me if I expect from a movie that wants to show how it was to actually show how it was.So where do I begin I just make a list of things that were wrong. This list is not complete but these things just stuck in my mind after seeing these movie 1. There is 0 indication from the movie alone if we ignore its title that it plays in Auschwitz. It could have been easily played at Majdanek for example The only indication that this plays in Auschwitz is the presence of these wire net columns in the gas chamber but of course those things worked and looked completely different than in the movie and the gas chamber looked nothing like the real ones in Krema II or III. The size was wrong the position of the wire net columns was wrong their appearance was wrong the door to the gas chamber was wrong the walls were wrong there was no ventilation system visible and so on and on.2. The building with the gas chambers and the ovens looked nothing like any extermination facility in Auschwitz. If you don't want to build a whole crematory for your movie than either don't produce such a movie or just show a different extermination facility like Bunker I or II which were farm houses that were transferred into gas chambers.3. You got to be kidding me about the number of people that were actually sent to the gas chamber in this movie. Was their a shortage of actors willing to act in this crappy movie? In reality there was no room to even breath in these chambers. And why did they shoot the kids in front of the building and not gas them with the other victims? This not only makes no sense but it's again far from the reality of Auchwitz. Yeah I know Boll just wanted to shock his audience.4. The ovens looked nothing like the real ones. For Christs sake is it to hard to look at the homepage of the Auschwitz museum or of the company Topf und Shne? And one body at a time? In reality they cremated up to 4 or 5 bodies in one muffle at the same time.I could go on forever.If you are interested in how Auschwitz really was watch the mini series War and Remembrance which only made minor mistakes but even rebuild a crematory and actually was a good series or read Pressac book AUSCHWITZ Technique and Operation of the Gas Chambers which is available online on holocausthistory.org for example.If you want to see a good movie and don't care for accuracy than also stay away from this piece of junk since it fails as a movie too. In the first part we have a look at students who don't know anything about the holocaust then we have scenes in which Jews were gassed cremated and so on and in the end we have students again but this time they show at least basic knowledge. And that is it.There is one ! good scene where two SS members talk about the extermination as if it was just some annoying bureaucracy this scene is the reason for the 2 star review and that is it. The rest is just plain boring. Yeah an Auschwitz movie that is boring. That is something that is hard to accomplish. Congratulations!".

However when tackling a serious issue like the Third Reich and the atrocities committed in the concentration camps it becomes difficult to keep a review light and funny.So to what film could we compare Auschwitz to? Schindler's List? Sure in Bolls wildest dreams and delusions. The TVseries Holocaust? That would be to compare melted Belgium chocolate to something of similar colour and consistency but not taste. No for a comparison we have to reach back to a rather obscure almost forgotten subgenre namely the Naziexploitation films of the 1970's. We're not talking the sleazy highlight Ilsa SheWolf of the SS we're talking the low points like Beast in Heat and The Last Orgy of the SS. The major differences are that the exploitation films actually intended to be exploitive. Boll handles the material with utter seriousness  albeit free of talent or passion. Plus if you expect nudity and acts of depravity like in afore mentioned exploitation films you'll be disappointed  there are none.There is no law in Germany  for once I say unfortunately  that could prevent a hack like Uwe Boll from taking on a serious issue like the holocaust or WW2. To sum it all up it's simply a bad film with a serious topic  too serious as to speak of unwanted humour in a bad film.And that's already too many words wasted on a bad film.".

Boll tries to be as real as possible he has stated that this is not Schindlers List but a real depiction of what went on back then though Budget restrictions did not really allow him to be faithful to what he wanted to accomplish but never achieves his goal fully. Due to the budget restrictions the tone is gritty which helps the documentary style but does not add acting value which on the other hand brings the movie down again.

The viewer gains a very poor representation of the camp this may be because of lack of research or budget limitations but it simply does not deliver a convincing representation of the scale of Auschwits.

In the actual movie which is about 30 minutes long you see a train arriving at a concentration camp and then you see every detail until the Nazis kill the inmates. You see hear and can almost feel the people choke in the Gas in every detail. The movie shows shocking images of how it could have been back then in Auschwitz.In the movie part Uwe Boll is playing a Nazi Guard and he plays his role just as if he would work in a School Kindergarten or Prison with total normality as if what he's doing as a Nazi Guard is normal work. There is dialogues between the Nazi guards that I found mostly realistic. They have normal problems and small talk just like anybody else and are not the typical Hollywoodtype of bad guys.Before and after the movie there is the 45 minute documentary which consists of a short introduction by Uwe Boll and interviews with German Teenagers Germans and German Immigrants where one of them looks like a young Claudia Schiffer but does give surprisingly intelligent answers about the Holocaust Jews and Auschwitz. In this part of this work there is also real images and video from Concentration Camps Hitler and the time back then.I think it's important to remember this time I do think the movie by Uwe Boll helps. I like how the documentary part of the movie does mention other parts of the world where today still genocide happens just in smaller numbers. We should never forget and respect each other and care for each other no matter race nationality skin color or beliefs.To quote John Lennon I hope you join us. 1010 for Inspiration and the documentary value.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I have to say in Uwe Boll's favor that I am completely against smear campaigns that discredit the entire body of work from a filmmaker only because he made 2 or 3 really bad movies. Unfortunately Auschwitz comes close to that description too. The film starts with Boll saying something about his film and also ends with it. I personally find this a very annoying watch and it has a narcissistic take in my opinion. This is just personal perception though but I think this stuff should be on DVDs as commentary or something like that. What is not subjective is the fact that Boll delivers pretty much nothing of substance in his monologues and his English is also really bad. He should not have done it I think. Then there are two sequences of classroom action when we hear Boll ask questions about Auschwitz the Holocaust and Nazis to German students. It becomes obvious that most of them are really not that educated on the subject. Some are but most are not.This is the premise that Boll uses as the motivation to make this film. The long middle sequence of the movie depicts the reenacted action from the concentration camp in Auschwitz. It is very graphic but that should not come as a surprise with Boll behind the film. We see people die in gas chambers. We see a young boy being shot in the head by a Nazi officer. Sadly we do not really learn anything in this middle sequence. I am fairly certain there was nothing in there you would not know by now and I refuse to believe that students were really that limited in terms of knowledge about concentration camps. In my opinion the interviews with the student were entirely or almost entirely scripted.All in all it's not a complete failure of a film and I agree that it is certainly difficult to bring something new to the subject with the hundreds of films and documentaries that already exist about it but it was still a very unrewarding watch. This is a bit of a shame as the cast was not entirely bad. I believe Arved Birnbaum for example is a talented actor. But he has little to work with here with Boll's script. So yeah the best thing is probably that this film does not even run for 70 minutes so it does not drag at least for the most part. The worst is probably the parts during which Boll elaborates in a cringeworthy manner on why he made this film very early. As a whole not recommended.".

It is a movie about dying in Auschwitz how it came that Auschwitz is not only a name but a death symbol and what children of today know about the backgrounds. In some ways it succeeds in some ways it fails to fulfill its ambitions with the succeeding part predominating.First school kids are asked about their knowledge of Hitler and the Jews and the Holocaust and some do not know anything or at least very little. Some of the older school kids of the second interview series are better informed. Where the horror begins is in the fictive sceneries of the past when a child mourns to its parents about its feet while walking to certain death. Every father or mother have heard their child mourning like that during a long walk. But in this context it is simply unsettling.Then bringing the victims to their fate is shown as a normal business process. Guards are bored professional. Killing people on a daily base like slaughtering cows or pigs. The victims obey they don't know what comes. They think they are arrested and so they are quiet and calm. And then the gas chambers. We are watching naked people suffering death. At some point Boll is afraid of his own courage and spares us from the full length of their suffering. That I see as a big mistake. Death by CyclonB is within 5 to 15 minutes.However we will also follow a basically uninteresting dialog between two officers which is nearly as painful as the death scenes because people are only numbers and not of more worth than insects. Problems with schedule and staff and holidays are discussed. There's a noise in the background and later we learn what's the reason about. But the two officer's are so accustomed to this noise they aren't realizing it.There are some scenes of shooting small children these scenes are not quite believable and are of course not explained. Shooting Babies in this scenery makes no sense but the whole scenery makes no sense at all. I would have abandoned these scenes they are not made well.Boll made a laconic comment about inhumanity and how we remember. No more no less. He shows us how much we tell our children about the backgrounds. One of the girls is asked why people participated in executing the Holocaust and she answers they were afraid of the others or simply followers. Boll asks how would you react in this situation he means she and the others and she answers exactly the same way. That alone was worth watching the movie.P.S. I know that most of the scenes and places aren't historically exact. The life and death of the Lager inhabitants is completely missing. The film doesn't show the real Auschwitz. The amount of people killed at once was much higher etcetera. The movie itself isn't carefully prepared nor edited. But those aren't essential details. It's the meaning. In this case for real.".

Once there with the loss of Monir in the wartime chaos they are captured by Northern Alliance fighters. They are then handed them over the American forces who transport them to the prison camps at the Guantanamo Bay base in Cuba.

There's an element of black comedy to all this  they keep their senses of humor as they recount the horrible distasteful and despicable manner in which they're treated.That we would have had an American pretending to be British to try and coerce these three men doesn't surprise me in the least. After all it turns out Dubya considered painting the UN logo on a plane to tempt Saddam to shoot it down so we could have a reason to wage war. Gulf of Tonkin anyone?This is an incredibly difficult at times harrowing film to watch. There are those of us who still foolishly perhaps believe in the American ideal. A nation that stands for human rights and decent treatment of prisoners. But I know reality is far different. We have a Supreme Court justice who scoffs at giving Gitmo prisoners their day in court and a government that believes the Geneva Conventions are antiquated.We apparently want to show the world we're the beacon of freedom and treat everyone  including alleged criminals  with certain rights such as due process. And that's what we're trying to instill in Iraq and Afghanistan. But in practice we do exactly the opposite.The Road to Guantanmo works because Winterbottom never lets go never eases up to allow us to feel comfortable. Watching what happens to the Tipton Three is awfully disquieting. It is shameful that we behave like this. What's more worrisome is there seems to be such a lack of outrage among Americans that we're doing this. This administration and its blowhard allies have done such a wonderful job convincing Americans that speaking out against their policies is tantamount to being unpatriotic.I realize many will reject Winterbottom's film because it doesn't cast the United States in all honorable light. It shows how vicious uncaring and brutal we are even though our leaders continue to deny everything.I can only hope that years from now we will be thoroughly ashamed of how our government treated people in the war on terror just as we now feel shame for how we treated JapaneseAmericans during WWII.The Road to Guantanamo is an important film. I hope now that it has an American distributor more people will be exposed to it. I am sure the rightwing demagogues will attack it as antiAmerican and tell us that seeing it would be unpatriotic. Then again I don't need OxyContin to function daily.The MPAA banned the initial poster for this film because it depicted a man with his wrists tied and a burlap sack over his head and that apparently is too much for our children to see. It's quite alright expose kids to horrormovie posters but letting them see depictions of some of the despicable acts of our government is bad? Because of AMPAS' dumb rules I am certain this film won't be eligible for any Oscars. It already has been shown on TV in the UK and is available on DVD there.

	schema:reviewBody "The prison complex at Guantnamo Cuba has been used to hold men captured in Afghanistan or Pakistan post 911 and believed to be Taliban or Al Qaeda. Perhaps 750 prisoners have gone through the prison perhaps 300odd have been released. Enemy combatant was the category created to justify rounding up prisoners and holding them for years without following the Geneva Convention bringing charges or providing legal representation or trials.Prisoner'seye views of Guantnamo have come to us from detainees released back to England. Several years ago the Tricycle Theater of London produced Guantnamo Honor Bound to Defend Freedom which was also produced in New York and Chicago. In this dramatization transcripts and interviews recounted the Gitmo experiences of Jamal alHarith Bisher alRawi Moazzam Begg and Ruhel Ahmed and much time was devoted to their spoken narratives. In the background on stage could be seen the cages and orangeclad men of the prison largely as tableaux. There was also an emphasis on British capitulation to US policies that violated British law. Voices of politicians Jack Straw Donald Rumsfeld lawyers for the prisoners and the chief legal officer of England Lord Justice Styne in a stunning rebuke are also heard. But mainly from transcripts of interviews and letters what you get is a picture of the four prisoners and their families the absurdity of the circumstances of their seizure and their various individual responses from irony to despair and nearmadness.Now a couple years later again from British sources there is The Road to Guantanamo a vivid pseudodocumentary based on the experiences of the Tipton Three Ruhel Ahmed Asif Iqbal and Shafiq Rasul twentyyearolds of Pakistani and Bengali background from a predominantly poor area in the West Midlands they originally were four boyhood pals who went to Pakistan together because one of them was exploring the possibility of an arranged marriage with a girl there set up by his family. To hear them tell it the whole trip was a kind of lark but also an opportunity to explore roots and reconnect with relatives.They're a bit rough these boys though perhaps not atypical for a part of England said to have no middle class. They'd been in some trouble with the law and this is what ultimately gained them their release because they had to check in at home for community service during the time they were supposed to be in Afghanistan with Al Qaeda and so they had proof of their innocence from the Tipton cops. They're all four Muslims and when they arrive in Pakistan they stay at a mosque because it's cheaper than a hotel. The US is about to start bombing Afghanistan and a firebrand imam inspires the boys to go to Afghanistan to help the Afghans. They don't seem to grasp that they're heading directly into grave danger.This is the part viewers and reviewers tend to question. Were the boys being stupid or is their description disingenuous? We don't know and unlike the Tricycle stage play Honor Bound the film doesn't cleave closely to actual testimony. Where it excels beyond anything you've ever seen is as a Rough Guide to bumbling into a war zone. It's believable that wild boys on an adventure would want to explore the next country. They think they may be able to deal with the language and they've heard the naan bread loaves are huge. So they plunge in. And it all goes terribly wrong.Michael Winterbottom and codirector Mat Whitecross have shot this story on location with intense vividness. The scenes of Pakistan Afghanistan and the ultimate chaos and bombing and the trap the guys fall into one of their number disappearing and never heard from again followed by the van ride that was to take them out of the country but just leads them into the hands of the Northern alliance and a roundup of Taliban a deadly ride in a metal container and ultimately shipment to the barbed wire fences and brutalities of Guantnamo is intercut with head shots of the men narrating and commenting today played by nonactors chosen to be so close to the originals that you wouldn't know the difference.Afghanistan in 2001 and 2002 is madness chaos and war. Guantnamo is boneheaded stupidity brutal racism religious persecution and psychological torture. The Road to Guantanamo gives us a strong taste of all those elements. This is inyourface filmmaking of a peculiarly intense kind.Although the play is more thoughtful and provides more perspective Winterbottom's intense gutsy agitprop is far more powerful. Its second half really just brings to life and adds detail to what we already know the head masks the chains the suits the outdoor cages and the rest the interrogators who hammer over and over to the boys You're Al Qaeda! They start at Camp XRay for the worst treatment and later are moved to Camp Delta. Finally the Tipton boys are called The Three Kings and given special treatment when somewhat inexplicably they've been cleared.At this point much of the world protests this treatment of untried and unaccused prisoners that has now persisted for five years. With hunger strikes and attempted suicides and in the recent wake of three successful coordinated suicides of prisoners some of America's closest allies are calling for Gitmo to be shut down and even Bush has said he wants to. Winterbottom's pseudodocumentary skillfully interspersed with actual documentary footage is based on information provided by the three surviving Tipton Three. No one to my knowledge has been released back to the US or if anyone has he hasn't spoken up.While the TricycleCulture Project play appealed to the mind the movie goes for the gut and it does so very effectively. We need both. The play seems a little nambypamby now. The movie seems careless. Together though they give you some kind of truth.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Road To Guantanamo a film which was screened on Channel 4 last night is a harrowing tale of injustice committed by the American Government under the guise of the war on terror.Three innocent men actually four to begin withchildhood friends all British 3 of Pakistani origin and one Bangladeshi  not Arab as described by IronicFilmReference review set off to Pakistan for a holiday and to attend the wedding of one of the 4 men.With time on their hands before the wedding stupidly they decide to go to Afghanistan to help with the relief effort at a time when the US is gearing up for an invasion.When they realise the gravity of the situation in Afghanistan they try to get back to Pakistan instead they get taken deeper into the combat zone and there the 4 men from Tipton became the Tipton 3 as one of their Friends Monir gets separated and is never seen again.Taken into custody by The US forces after surviving near starvation for a month at the hands of the Northern Alliance what should of been the end of their ordeal turns out to be just the beginning.What emerges next through interviews with the men and reenactment of events is a tale of unbelievable treatment of the three men and incompetence at the hands of the US authorities.Routine humiliation and torture both physical and psychological in Afghanistan before they are sent to Guantanamo Bay where they some how endure the same regime for a further 2 years.This is an unmissable filmdocumentary of the above mentioned events which will have you question the freedoms and rights you enjoy so freely and how in this day and age the world is so silent on the injustice and blatant disregard for human rights that is taking place in Guantanamo Bay.Whatever else you do in 2006 watching this film should be at the top of your list.".

Three young Englishmen tell their story of a wedding trip to Pakistan and an unplanned journey into Afghanistan. Victims of circumstance their tale leads to incarceration in Guantanamo Bay and the apparently shocking treatment that ensued.Whilst the story is told purely from the perspective of the detainees there is never any point at which you really doubt the content of the film. In no way does the portrayal of events seem exaggerated or biased so as to evoke a stronger reaction from the audience. In parts sequences seem almost void of emotion in terms of their description and surprisingly the effect is to make it even more hard hitting. Not overcooking the trauma means what can only be assumed as a factual depiction of horrifying circumstances comes across quite superbly.There are points where you can question the realism of the young men's decisions. For example the point from which they want to leave Kabul back for Pakistan only to find themselves trapped with the Taliban is a little scantily dealt with. This may or may not be wholly accurate and of course they felt compelled to follow those they felt were standing up for their religion but from the individual interview footage you can't help feel they were impressionable youths just following their noses lost in the surreal adventure of it all.Perfectly paced the film spends just the right amount of time on each arealocation of the story. Winterbottom nicely interweaves footage from British television news to prompt recollection of the perspective from which the public saw the events in Afghanistan. And with a good balance of acted reconstruction and subject interview both the drama and technicalities feel great. Is there no style or subject this man can't handle?".

After spending a few days of shopping and sightseeing the friends attend a mosque with Asif's Pakistani cousin Zahid.The Imam inspires them to volunteer to travel to Afghanistan and provide humanitarian aid presumably to the refugees being created in the civil strife with the Taliban on the eve of the invasion The friends decide to go to Kabul to help. The story finds them set loose in the chaos of the invasion after the bus driver hits and kills a man then leaves them.They try to arrange for a ride back to Pakistan instead the ride takes them north to a Taliban stronghold. The stronghold falls and they are taken prisoner they lose track of Monir and he is not heard from again. They herd the three onto trucks and the nightmare truly begins Asif and Shafiq are sent to Guantanamo Zahid is imprisoned in Pakistan.It's a hard movie to watch with the reenactments of the cruel treatment born by the boys. What's always puzzled me is how did we know these detainees were Al Qaeda enablers instrumental in the attacks of 911 sworn enemies of every good and decent American thing? The movie provides a news clip of King George saying The only thing I know for certain is that these are some bad people. Well we've seen the certainty of The Decider before e.g. weapons of mass destruction and Saddam's relationship with Al Qaeda. According to MSNBC sources as reported in Wikipedia As of November 2006 out of 775 detainees brought to Guantanamo approximately 340 have been released leaving 435 detainees. Of those 435 110 are labeled as ready for release. Of the other 325 only more than 70 will face trial the Pentagon says. That leaves about 250 who may be held indefinitely....For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2007".

Long story I was expecting a film about a group of obviously innocent lads caught in the wrong place at the wrong time to be mistaken for enemy Taliban fighters.We start with them talking about going to Pakistan about wedding plans and going to Afghanistan to help. No mention of how 911 has kicked everything off in the country and war is coming indicating that this is probably a VERY stupid idea at best and aiding and abetting the enemy at worst.The lads hang around with a group of armed men obviously not charity workers who tragically according to the way it is shown get killed by air strikes and are all captured.I was nonplussed these guys are obviously not giving a straight story. And then they get captured and interrogated. They aren't treated very kindly but nothing serious. Certainly no backrubs and massages but not the torture I was expecting.All that happens now is they're kept in slightly uncomfortable conditions and get interrogated a bit more before being released. That's it. No brutal beatings electroshocks not even a friggin waterboarding! A guard even kills a spider to protect one of the prisoners!The fact that two of the lads admitted to going to jihad camps and learning to handle explosives and rifles shows the audacity of the stupid left wing filmmakers here. The last one refused to take a lie test which shows he is clearly hiding something. And then that virtually nothing else happens to them well I cannot express my opinions adequately. For those talking evidence the lads actions prove in spades their guilt. And they were not enemy combatants so it is hardly as if their rights were infringed by anything other than their own stupidity and further guilt.The only highlight of the entire wasteful film was the wonderful Riz Ahmed doing a rap number in his cage to the amusement of a guard but that was because he was Riz Ahmed not because of the absent quality of this pathetic film.".

It was also awful timing for the US to engage in a war that many of the American public do not support.Despite what George W. Bush Dick Cheney and other right wingers say there is torture disrespect beatings and a host of other shameless things that are in direct violation of the Geneva code at Guantanamo. We all saw what happened in Abu Ghraib and the prisoner abuse there that was LARGELY kept secret until someone reported it this is nothing in the post 911 world but tip of the iceberg.The stuff going on Guantanamo has been well detailed in shows like 60 Minutes and news sources like the Guantanamoble project which has DVD's and interviews with prisoners httpwww.guantanamobile.orginterviews.phpYet we continue doing the same mistakes over and over in the name of National Security even when Lawyers and Supreme Court itself say the policies there are wrong.. This is what causes the rest of the world which is in poverty and despair to lash out the USA with such rage and passion. Everyone was affected by 911 no doubt but there were better ways to rebuild and handle than to jail hundreds of people without due process of law. Sadly the law seems something that is only really executed to the rich and well enough than to the common man or foreigner.Directors Michael Winterbottom Mat Whitecross did an amazingly good job. He hired some actors to play the role but we also see interviews with the actual Tipton Three about their terrible ordeal. The movie is beautifully shot as well and really you just have are in admiration for what the directors are trying to do here which is to end the madness and say hey this is wrong. The policies are wrong especially when it comes to the military with really no prove whatsoever to try and coerce some of these prisoners to admit that they are AlQueda or some terrorist organizations without any sufficient proof. Anyhow see this movie. It's getting great ratings on IMDb as well and I would urge any real concerned American to watch it and discuss it with their friends.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I watched 'The Road to Guantnamo' it was with the view that it would give a wellbalanced look at Guantanamo and what is supposed to be happening in the camp. Instead I have to agree with criticism that this was film was not only very antiAmerican but gave the impression the whole of Britain hated America.I can't complain about the acting which was first rate especially when you consider this was a debut for most of the actors. Also the actual plot if you see it as fictional was involving and gritty and that is why I do give the film a fiveoutoften rating.However I loathed the fact the producers made out this was a true story and the events played out just as depicted in the film. Noone knows exactly why these men were in Afghanistan and I find it hard they were there out of purely innocent reasons. These were not sweet little boys plucked off the streets of London by the Big Bad Americans they were grown men more than old enough to know what they were doing and they were caught with Afghan soldiers fighting against US troops. Also we're just expected to take their word that they were tortured and abused when noone knows exactly what went on in Guantnamo I find it hard to believe the Americans would have been so heavyhanded on three Britons who had access to a lawyer.I certainly don't think the Americans are innocents in all of this the Afghan prisoners of Guantnamo should have access to lawyers but they are far from the evil this film made them out to be. And they are probably more innocent than these three pretend to be. If anything the only crime the Americans have really committed in my mind is not coming to take Abu Hamza off to their Cuban camp since the UK is so wrapped up in soft EU laws that we are forced to let this proved terrorist remain here in a lap of luxury.As a work of fiction this is a wellportrayed film but it just didn't ask enough questions. Why did these three feel the need to leave the UK for Afghanistan? Why were they so stupid to remain in the country if they were there by mistake? If they were so innocent why were they caught in the heat of the fighting? Where is the actual physical evidence they were tortured?".

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps there is more than one Michael Winterbottom. The history of cinema is full of Big Reputations built on very short CVs but this guy must be working on several projects simultaneously and anyone lucky to get close enough will be caught up in the slipstream. He's the I K Brunel of the silver screen. However Whitecross must have handled the bulk of the work here and a lucky few at the Bristol Watershed England will have met him with the three British protagonists of this adventure 16th March who relate their experiences intercut with actors and archive footage in what may prove to be the seminal event of 21st Century cinema. It's certainly the most powerful experience you are liable to have in the theatre. This reviewer has not seen it on TV nor downloaded it to PC but my guess is that it will retain some of its force. Undoubtedly much of this force is because it's a true story and one which connects with us all through our governments' recreation of the Cold War strategy for slicing up the world into areas of influence and using the artifice of 'bogeymen' Pinkos Martians Yankees Muslims to keep the populace down. But the secret of great art is to make it look easy. In lesser hands this could have been an exercise in widescreen bathos. And recognising the gift from real life to the film maker in the scene where one of the guards exposes his cultural commonality with one of these 'dangerous terrorists' asking him to perform a rap is just one example. The confusion of Afghanistan and Pakistan as the bombs fall and the invaders take over is totally convincing. An eyesopen nightmare full of dust and colliding waves of refugees followed by the interminable grind of terror insults from thugs and 'cultured' interrogators boredom and torture suffered by the captives in a situation that Kafka and Orwell could never have imagined. This is a trite comparison I know but violence is trite and banal. If you see any one film this year make it this one. CLIFF HANLEY".

	onyx:emotionText "Perhaps there is more than one Michael Winterbottom. The history of cinema is full of Big Reputations built on very short CVs but this guy must be working on several projects simultaneously and anyone lucky to get close enough will be caught up in the slipstream. He's the I K Brunel of the silver screen. However Whitecross must have handled the bulk of the work here and a lucky few at the Bristol Watershed England will have met him with the three British protagonists of this adventure 16th March who relate their experiences intercut with actors and archive footage in what may prove to be the seminal event of 21st Century cinema. It's certainly the most powerful experience you are liable to have in the theatre. This reviewer has not seen it on TV nor downloaded it to PC but my guess is that it will retain some of its force. Undoubtedly much of this force is because it's a true story and one which connects with us all through our governments' recreation of the Cold War strategy for slicing up the world into areas of influence and using the artifice of 'bogeymen' Pinkos Martians Yankees Muslims to keep the populace down.

If it was a fictional movie you would say that the plot id awful for sure. ...And they expect for us to believe this in a documentary film?When they take the bus to go back to Pakistan the bus actually carried them to a Taliban resistance center with taliban soldiers so called terrorists fighting against the coalition. Of course the Taliban wouldn't receive people with them unless they were sure they were on their side they wouldn't receive four British civilian even when they were Pakistanis's origin.I want to be clear that I was against the war in Irak and was not pro the war in Afghanistan. I am really against all this petrol war but I hate lies and I think this film is full of them.In the very unlikely case that they were really innocents someone must be very very idiotic to go the the middle of a war and end up in an enemy district so in that case they also deserve what happened to then for being so idiots. ... But I don't think it is the most probable case. If they were taliban 's followers and became taliban soldiers that's OK it was a war and they were captured. They must be thankful that they are still alive. And now they still fight this war now with this film. It is biased and antiAmerican propaganda. I'm not saying that what everything Americans did there was all right far from that but please... the viewer must not be so innocent to believe the story told from a biased sight.What I rescue from this film is that it lets you see how the people live in those countries. One funny thing is when the Americans torture the prisoners with heavy metal songs ha ha I have a friend who does the same thing!!".

Show of hands who was actually at gitmo not to mention Afghanistan and Iraq my hand is up. With my time spent at gitmo I never heard of the three Britons or never saw heard of or sensed any kind of torture or abuse. Whether we were taking prisoners off the battle field or securing them at gitmo I never saw a soldier or marine mishandle an inmate NOT ONCE! I'm sure none of you could say the same for most if not all of you have never been to either three locations. If this were a documentary showing actual video and not a socalled 'remake' i might give it a second thought but all it is is just another anarchist in Winterbottom who just wants to get his name in the Michael Moore papers and that's all. Those prisoners who deserver no rights are still given them and are treated humanely. Let's keep in mind 99 of detainees at gitmo or abu ghraib were taken off the battle field fighting the coalition or with those who are fighting the coalition fighting as terrorist and no where in the Geneva convention does it mention how your supposed to treat 'terrorist'. My few months at gitmo I have witnessed numerous visits by the RedcrossRed crescent and I have seen no formal complaint by either organization for eye witness abuses. Oh yeah a lot of the detainees claim torture as a psychological tactic yet mostly if not all had no physical proof of such abuse. Also with the accusations that we starve detainees...funny how that's brought up since these detainees are given three square meals a day with a selection I didn't have in the army and numerous times do these terrorist wave their right at a meal by throwing their food tray at security. That is the kind of act much like in any domestic American prison where that inmate would be put in solitary confinement until they can behave..One thing I do fine very interesting is the account of a friend of mine who happens to be in EPOW enemy prisoner of war Psychological Operations for the U.S. Army. He took numerous prisoners to Abu ghraib from southern Iraq and upon arriving at Abu ghraib saw numerous photo albums of what Uday Hussein and the 'fedayeen Saddam' did to political prisoners and followed by expressing to me just how familiar the photos looked that the media showed of 'u.s. torture at abu ghraib'. Of course the photos with actual torture much like what the 'fedayeen Saddam' did a terrorist organization started by Saddam to terrorize his rule in Iraq looks suspiciously like those he saw in those photo albums and none of actual torture showed any American soldiers. Of course we have all seen the photos of a dog handler holding a dog about 2 feet from a whimpering republican guard soldier and a female soldier pointing at a naked terrorist but let's keep in mind those images were not torture only against the military uniform code of conduct taking pictures of inmates for personal use. So instead of just believing whatever Winterbottom or these three Britons can come up with let's get some facts and PROOF!".

	schema:reviewBody "Don't be confused the film is intended to be propagandist. It's purpose is to expose the antihumanitarian ways of the prisons at Guantanamo Bay. These prisoners have no rights have no contact to lawyers or the outside world and are regularly tortured for information that many of them do not have. The majority of them have not been charged and to this date none have been convicted of a crime.The exact reasons why the Tipton Three made the decision to go into Afghanistan may not be explicit in the film but that's because the filmmakers feel that is irrelevant. The point is that guilty of something or not the methods used to bring prisoners to Guantanamo Bay and then the way they are handled once there are not humanitarian and are in no way in line with the Geneva Convention. Their motivation is that Guantanamo Bay needs to be shut down.I had the pleasure of attending a screening that included a QA following with 2 of the Tipton Three one of the actors and codirector Mat Whitecross. For those of you compelled to know the Tipton Three's reasons for going to Afghanistan the answer is as simple as the film makes it out to be that is they wanted to do something to help the people in Afghanistan. Their purpose was humanitarian aid and they were young and foolish not to mention in Pakistan where there is virtually no Western news reported and they thought that they could do it themselves. They realized shortly after they got there that probably wasn't a wise idea and they tried to return to Pakistan but were as at least one of the Tipton Three believes deceived by their friend who helped them get there in the first place and who said he would help get them out when they asked. So they ended up even further into Afghanistan with no conceivable way out and they were eventually picked up by the Northern Alliance along with everyone else guilty or not of fighting who was found in any invaded area. They made a stupid decision granted but the way things went once they were picked up is unforgivable of all Northern Alliance partners in my opinion.I sincerely hope this film is released in the USA. I am American and I do not feel this is an antiAmerican film I hope others see it that way as well. I think it is very useful in that it forces people to open their eyes to what is really happening in Guantanamo and hopefully see that these atrocities must end.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love this film. I love it for itself and I love it for the light it sheds on Sirk's later Universal pictures of the '50's. The DVD from Kino comes with a brilliant little essay by JanChristopher Horak where among other things he asks the question But was it this film really transgressive? This same question has been asked about Written on the Wind Imitation of Life and all the others. And all of us who love Sirk's films need to ask ourselves this question from time to time. I can say that what I find transgressive in Sirk's work is the multiplicity of angles and approaches that the films reveal. They dare to find the beauty and truth in melodrama. They dare to be ironic without snickering. For all the acclaim that Far From Heaven received no one as far as I know commented on the fact that compared to Sirk Haynes stacks the deck. None of his minor characters have the emotional or psychological complexity that Sirk's do. They are stick figures for us to laugh knowingly at. They are camp. But Sirk plunges into his work with such camp icons as Leander here and Rock Hudson elsewhere and comes up with a text that continues to resonate long after the images have flickered away. Horak goes on to say that in this film Puerto Rico is exciting exotic and dangerous a typography of the Other while Sweden represents all that is Heimat. A vision of Aryan homeland and thus a site for subliminal Nazi ideology. Did Sirk do no more than artistically mirror the status quo? I think not.Sirk was a successful director of women's pictures in the early days of the Third Reich just as he was in the America of the '50's. What is oppositional in his work is not any kind of obvious political subtext but an attitude towards image and material where the despotic Don Pedro is counterpoised with the smothering nearly incestuous Astree. And both of them are covered in shadows slats mirrors flowers  all of the accoutrements of the Sirkian hothouse atmosphere. Some sicklysweet unhealthy thing is always insinuating itself into the mise  en  scene. Sirk is like what Walter Benjamin called Baudelaire a secret agent of his class and society. His missives send images of that society to its members that correspond to the vision they have of themselves. And underneath that there is another level of text. Nothing so obvious as critique. But portraiture  la verite en peinture  sometimes as devastating as Goya's.".

I've seen it twice so far. I was lucky enough to tape it one time when it was on TV so now i've got this little copy of it sitting on my shelf that i can watch whenever I like there are no DVD or VHS releases of any Sirk films in Australia  and I wouldn't have chosen La Habanera if i was going to order some Sirk from overseas.It's melodrama and designed as crap for the masses  but there's just something beautiful about everything in it. The noble beauty in Don de Avila's face during the courtship scenes at the beginning which has turned to harshness and brooding intensity when we cut to ten years later. His burning eyes and face burn up the screen. Some of my other favourite things in it are the ceiling fan during the card game the light through the slats in the scientists' room the face of Dr Luis Gomez the scene where Dr Nagel goes out in the street on a windy night and finds the fever sufferer and best of all the magnificent pond in the middle of the room during the scene where Ms Leander sings the Habanera and in which we see the reflection of the room.There is a poetry to the images that you may not notice unless you come in halfway through like I did on my first viewing so that you can't really follow what's happening in the plot. Doing this was a revelation for me. I was forced to just look at the pretty pictures and i found to my surprise that there was something transfixing and poetic about them.Second run through when I watched it from the beginning I found I also loved the story and the characters which was a bonus.

	schema:headline " Ferdinand Marian  Much More Than Jud Suss";
	schema:reviewBody "I recently watched Veit Harlan's 1940 Nazi propaganda Jud Suss the most hateful film ever made. I had to see more of its star the actor Ferdinand Marian.The first eighteen minutes of La Habanera constitute one of the most beautiful economical sequences in film. The camera glides like the most sinuous and powerful of ballroom dancers shots and sound accumulate artistic power like the carefully placed words in a sonnet. On the dramatic seaside cliff of a tropical isle Astree Zarah Leander a sheltered Swedish tourist watches Flamenco. The camera caresses everything it sees sea foam rock face palm fronds the costume of the Flamenco dancer her pride in her skill Spanish and Indian physiognomies. With variations that make your heart ache like the notes of a fugue the same visual motifs replay throughout the film exotically costumed women performing for audiences caged birds men saying goodbye water both wild and domesticated fruits flowers and light filtered and fractured by venetian blinds mosquito nets ceiling fans and snow. The ear as well as the eye is invited to participate in the dream the shrill call of a bigoted aunt Astree Astree! frosts the most tender of moments the bullfight crowd roars. La Habanera engulfs you you're on vacation. Director Douglas Sirk's artistry never lets up till the final frame symmetry serves as the strands of his web. La Habanera the title song is insistently seductive as a toreador  you want to sway with his hips and let him dictate movement  and then it is grating and cruelly taunting  you want to slam shut the window and silence the singers  and finally it is heartbreakingly poignant  you want to follow but realize that you no longer can.A jeep driver with one flower behind his ear another in his teeth and a song in his heart picks up Astree and her overbearing very chesty dowager aunt. They encounter Don Pedro de Avila the island's padrone astride a black horse. His face is framed by a widebrimmed black hat and embroidered lapels. This romancenovel hero escorts the Swedish ladies to a bullfight. Don Pedro communicates his masterful inhabitation of his body. His steps spring his arm greeting spectators sweeps with the majesty of inherited noblesse oblige his hand nonchalantly tosses a handkerchief into a deferential peon's proffered hat thus releasing a raging bull. When Don Pedro smiles his warm crinklyeyed smile at Astree it is as if the sun is rising in the east. He is manly when the bullfighter fails it is he at Astree's command who dispatches the bull with one thrust to the heart. He is attentive Astree drops her fan in the bullring and Pedro retrieves it snaps it open and returns it to Astree with a gesture that Nijinski could not perform with more seductive grace. Don Pedro accompanies Astree and Aunt Anna to their ship he walks backward away from the ship there is a tension in his step as if he were a mime imitating a man saying goodbye to his love who is leaving aboard a ship. He pauses behind dockside exports to light a cigarette even that casual mundane move conveys erotic power. Within seconds Astree has jumped ship she's in his arms and her fate is sealed.Fast forward ten years. Don Pedro much aged addresses Astree nowhere to be seen. In her place across an elegant armchair drapes a lovely lacey cloud reminiscent of a brides' wedding gown. With a riding crop Don Pedro tentatively taps then seductively strokes this white dress. His aggression rising again using the riding crop he lifts the dress as if lasciviously lifting a woman's hem. He then grabs the dress manhandles it rips it viciously and throws it down. Only then does a very changed Astree enter. Her youth is gone. She who had been so wild gay and impetuous is now sober and resigned. Sirk has conveyed the previous ten years in Don Pedro's treatment of Astree's dress. Worship and passion morphed into obsession and then descended into oppression and contempt. Astree tells Don Pedro that she's come to despise the island and him she deeply regrets ever leaving cold blond superior Sweden.Later in a climactic scene before hurting Don Pedro badly Astree performs a profoundly sentimental gesture. She dons a traditional Caribbean costume Pedro had given her. By wearing this dress at a key moment Astree gives Don Pedro a gift. Similarly director Douglas Sirk who was the husband of a Jewish wife gives the audience a gift. This scene undercuts the Swede  superior Caribbean  inferior message. As Astree sings Don Pedro watches her he becomes ecstatic it is clear that no matter how Nazi ideology or melodramatic convention dictate that this movie end no one will ever love Astree as her racially inferior dark lover has. Pedro breathes her in like air she moves him as his drug of choice. You know from watching her watching him that Don Pedro has given Astree the most unforgettable nights of her life.There's so much else to talk about in this film from the goofy font used in the opening title sequence to Astree's emotionally incestuous interactions with her strikingly cold blond son. There's Rosita the male crossdresser and FriedaKahlo imitator who plays Pedro's housekeeper. Rosita dresses like a nun part of the film's antiCatholic proscience as well as antiCaribbean proSwedish subtext. There's Dr. Gomez a SimonAbkarian lookalike who in a very funny scene is regaled by a gallbladderobsessed hypochondriac. There's Puerto Rico fever perfidious islanders and the heroic Swedish doctor who fights both. There's the breathtakingly beautiful Zarah Leander marketed as Nazi Germany's substitute for Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich. But what this film amply demonstrates is that Ferdinand Marian was a compelling actor worthy of remembrance for so much more than having been coerced to appear in Jud Suss the most hateful film ever made.".

His steps spring his arm greeting spectators sweeps with the majesty of inherited noblesse oblige his hand nonchalantly tosses a handkerchief into a deferential peon's proffered hat thus releasing a raging bull. When Don Pedro smiles his warm crinklyeyed smile at Astree it is as if the sun is rising in the east. He is manly when the bullfighter fails it is he at Astree's command who dispatches the bull with one thrust to the heart. He is attentive Astree drops her fan in the bullring and Pedro retrieves it snaps it open and returns it to Astree with a gesture that Nijinski could not perform with more seductive grace. Don Pedro accompanies Astree and Aunt Anna to their ship he walks backward away from the ship there is a tension in his step as if he were a mime imitating a man saying goodbye to his love who is leaving aboard a ship. He pauses behind dockside exports to light a cigarette even that casual mundane move conveys erotic power. Within seconds Astree has jumped ship she's in his arms and her fate is sealed.Fast forward ten years. Don Pedro much aged addresses Astree nowhere to be seen. In her place across an elegant armchair drapes a lovely lacey cloud reminiscent of a brides' wedding gown. With a riding crop Don Pedro tentatively taps then seductively strokes this white dress. His aggression rising again using the riding crop he lifts the dress as if lasciviously lifting a woman's hem. He then grabs the dress manhandles it rips it viciously and throws it down. Only then does a very changed Astree enter. Her youth is gone. She who had been so wild gay and impetuous is now sober and resigned. Sirk has conveyed the previous ten years in Don Pedro's treatment of Astree's dress. Worship and passion morphed into obsession and then descended into oppression and contempt. Astree tells Don Pedro that she's come to despise the island and him she deeply regrets ever leaving cold blond superior Sweden.Later in a climactic scene before hurting Don Pedro badly Astree performs a profoundly sentimental gesture. She dons a traditional Caribbean costume Pedro had given her. By wearing this dress at a key moment Astree gives Don Pedro a gift. Similarly director Douglas Sirk who was the husband of a Jewish wife gives the audience a gift. This scene undercuts the Swede  superior Caribbean  inferior message. As Astree sings Don Pedro watches her he becomes ecstatic it is clear that no matter how Nazi ideology or melodramatic convention dictate that this movie end no one will ever love Astree as her racially inferior dark lover has. Pedro breathes her in like air she moves him as his drug of choice. You know from watching her watching him that Don Pedro has given Astree the most unforgettable nights of her life.There's so much else to talk about in this film from the goofy font used in the opening title sequence to Astree's emotionally incestuous interactions with her strikingly cold blond son. There's Rosita the male crossdresser and FriedaKahlo imitator who plays Pedro's housekeeper. Rosita dresses like a nun part of the film's antiCatholic proscience as well as antiCaribbean proSwedish subtext. There's Dr. Gomez a SimonAbkarian lookalike who in a very funny scene is regaled by a gallbladderobsessed hypochondriac. There's Puerto Rico fever perfidious islanders and the heroic Swedish doctor who fights both. There's the breathtakingly beautiful Zarah Leander marketed as Nazi Germany's substitute for Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich. But what this film amply demonstrates is that Ferdinand Marian was a compelling actor worthy of remembrance for so much more than having been coerced to appear in Jud Suss the most hateful film ever made.";

Sirk's visual imagination is seemingly inexhaustible and he is aided by firstrate art direction. It should be no surprise really that his last film in Germany should be a masterpiece.

Unlike Garbo and much like Dietrich she often sang in her films while swathed in baroque costumes and tons of makeup and curlicued coiffures so as to convey an extreme artificiality. La Habanera stylishly directed by Detlef Sierk the future Douglas Sirk and beautifully shot is the perfect vehicle for this lush romantic vision of the tropics. Astree a young Swede travels to Puerto Rico with her bilious old aunt is so enraptured by the tropical atmosphere and the attentions of a local Don Ferdinand Marian that she jumps ship to stay there. Ten years later she's miserable in the remorseless heat and torpidity crushed by the realization that she made an impulsive mistake married a man she didn't love and now is sentenced to remain trapped and homesick. Her only consolation is her son whom she estranges from his father spoiling him doting on him and singing him twee songs with lyrics about snowflakes on nose tips intertwined with melodic recitations of the letters of the alphabet. One would hope that by the age of 9 the boy would be ready for something a bit more advanced. A parallel plot line involves two Swedish scientists who travel to the island to research and develop a vaccine for the Puerto Rico Fever which blows in annually on a fever wind and sends people into comas from which they never emerge. The powerful Don does not want the world to think infectious fevers exist on the island  hurts business. So he connives to sabotage their efforts.Throughout the story the haunting but kitschy title song by Lothar Bruhne and Bruno Balz is sung by various groups of natives used as underscoring and in a climactic scene performed to the hilt by Leander and a Caribbean orchestra in one of most rapturous musical sequences of 1930's filmdom.Threaded through the plot are criticisms of the United States via the Rockefeller Institute and a sly dig at President Roosevelt and a suggestion that Nordic types are better off with their own kind. The depiction of Puerto Rico is pure fantasy but no worse than the usual Hollywood image of Latin America of the period.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found this film to be interesting to watch as a film that was produced in the Third Reich and also as an early melodrama in Sierck's oeuvre. Maybe because I saw this film with the mindset of it's a Nazi film! that I couldn't help but interpret it as propaganda. With its veneer as an entertainment film one could pick out things that reflect Nazi ideology. The idea of heimat struck me in the beginning of the film when I saw how uncomfortable Astre's aunt was. Already it was a sign that she does not belong in the world of Puerto Rico thus Astre Leander doesn't as well. Eventually Puerto Rico's charm fades and Astre longs for Sweden. On top of this her child with Don Pedro Marian has light blonde hair and has an affinity for things related to Sweden. Spanish guy  Swedish woman  perfect Aryan child a bit weird isn't it? Also note that Juan Jr. seems to get along with Dr. Nagel Martell more than his own father. Interesting Everything in this film has implications that people belong where they are from and also casts a bad light on anyone who isn't Swedish. Don Pedro's death is his own fault the Americans are mentioned consistently and seen as incompetent while the Swedish doctor comes and finds a cure for the Puerto Rico fever in just a few days. If this film was produced outside of Germany would I have thought these things? Is it because I know that this film was made in Nazi Germany that I have these thoughts? I could probably find the idea of heimat in American films as well and give any film a Nazi slant if I wanted to thus is it right to assume that every film from Nazi Germany is propaganda? It's hard for me to come to terms with the idea that every Nazi film is propaganda but it's also hard for me to believe that some or not all weren't. In the end I can probably argue for either point. Perhaps watching this film as pure entertainment can bring us a little closer to what the contemporary German audiences thought of this film. I am so conflicted because on one hand I believe that it is important to put context and history together with films but at the same time when I get attached to films like La Habanera I want to believe that it's not Nazi propaganda as if somehow the Nazi Germany part leaves a stain on the film.Anyway going on I really adore Sierck's works for some reason and La Habanera is really a gem. Not only can viewers see Sierck's beginnings in Germany but the lush imagery that I loved about Sierck's Technicolor works is all in La Habanera just without the colour. Anyone who is interested in Sierck's works should definitely put this film on their list. I really wonder what Sierck's connection with Ufa and the Nazis were. Just how much was he in charge of the story? Nothing about the imagery shouts out NAZI PROPAGANDA! but each scene seduces the viewer with its beautiful scenery and the viewer becomes a part of this film thus being seduced like Astre was with its charm. FASCIST AESTHETICS?! I don't know Acting on Leander and Marian's part is A. I ADORE Marian and it's such a shame that his career in current times is tainted by Jd Su. Funny that they're making a film about his role in Jd Su and the title of the upcoming film is also called the same name as the film. I really don't think Marian would appreciate that since he didn't want to take part in the wretched film at all. Anyway Marian is just perfect as Don Pedro especially in the final scenes when you can tell that he is suffering from the disease yet he looks so delighted in the fact that Astre is singing La Habanera. He tells her that he loves her and while she shuns him I think that deep down he does love her in his own way. Leander is great from start to finish especially when you see the difference in her demeanor in the beginning and in the middle of the film. The change is drastic and so real that I really believed that time did take its toll on Leander herself rather than this character of Astre. And if you're really not a fan of dramas and love stories at least watch the film up to the wedding scene Astre's wedding dress is to die for in a bad way.Overall I give this film a 7.510. Not too bad not all that great but definitely worth a watch for Leander and Marian's performance and for Sierck's work in Germany.".

I could probably find the idea of heimat in American films as well and give any film a Nazi slant if I wanted to thus is it right to assume that every film from Nazi Germany is propaganda? It's hard for me to come to terms with the idea that every Nazi film is propaganda but it's also hard for me to believe that some or not all weren't. In the end I can probably argue for either point. Perhaps watching this film as pure entertainment can bring us a little closer to what the contemporary German audiences thought of this film. I am so conflicted because on one hand I believe that it is important to put context and history together with films but at the same time when I get attached to films like La Habanera I want to believe that it's not Nazi propaganda as if somehow the Nazi Germany part leaves a stain on the film.Anyway going on I really adore Sierck's works for some reason and La Habanera is really a gem. Not only can viewers see Sierck's beginnings in Germany but the lush imagery that I loved about Sierck's Technicolor works is all in La Habanera just without the colour. Anyone who is interested in Sierck's works should definitely put this film on their list. I really wonder what Sierck's connection with Ufa and the Nazis were. Just how much was he in charge of the story? Nothing about the imagery shouts out NAZI PROPAGANDA! but each scene seduces the viewer with its beautiful scenery and the viewer becomes a part of this film thus being seduced like Astre was with its charm. FASCIST AESTHETICS?! I don't know Acting on Leander and Marian's part is A. I ADORE Marian and it's such a shame that his career in current times is tainted by Jd Su. Funny that they're making a film about his role in Jd Su and the title of the upcoming film is also called the same name as the film. I really don't think Marian would appreciate that since he didn't want to take part in the wretched film at all. Anyway Marian is just perfect as Don Pedro especially in the final scenes when you can tell that he is suffering from the disease yet he looks so delighted in the fact that Astre is singing La Habanera. He tells her that he loves her and while she shuns him I think that deep down he does love her in his own way. Leander is great from start to finish especially when you see the difference in her demeanor in the beginning and in the middle of the film. The change is drastic and so real that I really believed that time did take its toll on Leander herself rather than this character of Astre. And if you're really not a fan of dramas and love stories at least watch the film up to the wedding scene Astre's wedding dress is to die for in a bad way.Overall I give this film a 7.510. Not too bad not all that great but definitely worth a watch for Leander and Marian's performance and for Sierck's work in Germany.";

	schema:reviewBody "You may not guess it from the title but La Habanera is a German movie from 1937 which means this was made during the years of Nazi Germany before World War II started. Next year this film that runs for slightly over 90 minutes will have its 80th anniversary. The lead actress here is Zara Leander from Sweden and this is one of several propaganda movies she made during that time probably the darkest years in her career as we know now. But still this is one of her most known films and also among the more known propaganda films from 1930's Germany. It is almost as blatantly obvious as Jud S and fittingly Ferdinand Marian also plays the evil foreign main antagonist in here. There is really little subtlety in this movie it is all extremely obvious. A woman falls in love with a rich Puerto Rican but a couple years later the love has pretty much gone and the film depicts how she really belongs back to her home and far far away from all the uncivilized patterns that take place in Puerto Rico synonymously for abroad and partially have to do with her husband. The film tells Germans that they should not be fooled by something that may appeal to them that is not German because in the end it will be a disappointment. The addition with the strange virus breeding there is maybe the most offensive aspect about the film. I will not go into detail any further about all the xenophobic aspects in here but it is basically from start to finish. Nazis always appreciated animals so the reference to bullfighting is not unexpected and actually it is pretty spoton. Nonetheless this is a dark hour for everybody working on this project including director Douglas Sirk and writer Gerhard Menzel. But these political references are also really the only reason to watch this film as it is a prime example of how film used propaganda back then to change the minds of the people. Storywise it is not really worth seeing. All in all a thumbs down.".

Zarah Leander as one of the leading actresses in Germany did well too though I reckon most of her roles are similar in that she needs to act cool and sing with her characteristic deep voice. Leander can be seen as a substitute for Marlene Dietrich who left for America and Leander's role here reminds me of Dietrich's role in Blonde Venus. There are some similarities to both narratives as well as both women's role as a mother. Karl Martell and Boris Alekin were pretty much the only ones who seemed to brighten up the film with their charismatic persona.The story was interesting enough for the most part though it is interesting to analyse the film in terms of Nazi propaganda. The Puerto Ricans are depicted as uncivilized rough and corrupt while the Swedish ultimately the Germans are seen in clean environments and depicted as rich gentlemanly and having better technology. Plus the son is the ideal image of an Aryan. Coincidence? I think not! Leander's character is established as Swedish so as to divert any accusations that this film is Nazi propaganda. I really didn't think about this at all but that is what my professor says and it makes senseThough the ending does cause some confusion.

	schema:reviewBody "The pedigree for this film is very interesting. It's a German film that's set in Puerto Rico and stars a Swedish lady Zarah Leander! And by the way there's also almost no Spanish spoken in the entire film. Huh?! It's directed by the German Douglas Sirk a man who became famous for directing soapy films in America such as Magnificent Obsession in the 1950s.I was also surprised early in the film when they talked about bullfighting in Puerto Rico. But after a bit of research I found that they really DID have bullfighting on the island long ago. Who'd have known? While visiting the island Astree Leander meets a bullfighter and against her Aunt's advice she marries the man and stays in Puerto Rico. Ten years passduring which time no one hears from Astree. Then when an international medical team goes to Puerto Rico to treat a local fever epidemic a couple doctors try to find her.At this point the film shifts back to Puerto Rico and to the married couple. Astree's husband is a virtual dictator in the home and keeps her prisoner in their fine home. He browbeats her and accuses her of infidelityand it's obvious that he's abusive and insanely jealous. You also learn that the marriage has produced a sona child who the father expects to follow in his shoes. And the father will NOT allow the boy alone with the motherlest she try to escape with him back to Sweden. In many ways the film is reminiscent of the 1991 film Not Without My Daughterthough of course the settings are quite different.It's pretty odd as the wicked husband actually is doing everything he can to prevent doctors from identifying and treating the fever! So when the two doctors investigating the illness are invited to Don Pedro's home they are excited and they know he is Astree's husbandbut they don't know what a dangerous scoundrel he is and that he will stop at nothing to stop their work! Nice guy huh?! Well it all comes together for a really cool and satisfying endingsomething you'll just have to see for yourself. A very good and very unusual film.By the way on a depressing note little Michael SchulzDornburg who played Astree's son served in the German military and was killed on the Russian Front at age 17. Also if you are curious about the title La Habanera is a slow Cuban dance similar to the Tango.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've just finished watching 'Lore' and found it to be a deeply moving story beautifully shot on film which is becoming a rarity with a breathtaking performance by the lead Saskia Rosendahl.I wasn't planning on coming on here to write a review but after reading other people's views and comments I was quite stunned to see one reviewer giving it only one star out of ten claiming it to be 'Holocaust Denial Trash!'. Having read this reviewers comments it seemed to me that the reviewer had missed a crucial element in the film and her reaction seems to concentrate on a revelation from the final third of the film which if the earlier reveal isn't taken into account could have caused her reaction. The following comments contain a good few spoilers so please don't read on if you have not already seen the film.In the aforementioned reviewer's comments she mentioned the scene where it is revealed that the papers carried by the character Thomas were not his own but those of a Jewish man named Thomas Weil. It is mentioned by one of the children that Thomas had told him that was not Jewish but carried the papers because Americans like Jews. If basing the theme of the film on this scene alone I can almost see why this reviewer came to her conclusions as she appears to have assumed that Thomas was NOT Jewish all along.However earlier in the film we see Thomas notice Lore looking at the numbers tattooed on his wrist which he then covers with his sleeve. Thomas is a survivor in every way. He has survived the camps and has adapted to continue his survival. Although it is never explicitly explained using another persons papers may have been easier than not having any papers at all and the revelation to the younger children may have been because Thomas knew the young boy would not follow him to safety if he had thought Thomas was Jewish. For Lore it is evident from the moment she sees the tattoo that she knows Thomas is Jewish. Even after the revelation that the documents are not his she still knows. This explains her actions in the final few scenes a reaction against her earlier beliefs and strict upbringing. This is what makes it all the more powerful. The reviewer also references one other scene of other passengers on a train discussing the photographs of holocaust victims and one of these passengers claiming that they are faked circulated by the Americans. Is the inclusion of this scene intended as 'Holocaust Denial'? I think not. When Lore overhears this discussion she is already fully aware that the photographs are real and we know this because earlier in the film we see her tearing away a piece of a photo which is later revealed to contain the image of her father in full uniform witnessing the atrocities. At this point she is unable to deny either the events or her fathers involvement.The reviewer I have mentioned stated that she was hoping for a classic example of the 'Bildungsroman' or comingofage story and personally I feel this is exactly what director Cate Shortland has given us. A tale of a young girl who has to come to terms with the end of adolescence the end of a brutal war and the gradual realisation that all she has been led to believe may not be true.".

	schema:reviewBody "You'd think that 68 years after the end of the second World War every perspective would have been covered by the numerous films that have been made about it. But 'Lore' proves that it's still possible to make a movie about an unknown aspect of the war. In this case it's the situation in Germany just after the victory of the allied forces. It's a very interesting perspective because things get turned around. The Nazis are no longer powerful rulers but hapless losers afraid to get caught by the Americans. And the Jews although still despised by most Germans are the ones who get things done with the allied troops. The movie shows a country in an almost apocalyptic state with dead people and destructed buildings everywhere. Citizens can't trust each other and are willing to do anything for some food or transportation. The powers are constantly shifting an ally can suddenly turn into an enemy. It's in this utterly destructed and disheartened country that a family without parents is finding its way led by Lore a girl of approximately 16 or 17 years old. Her parents highranking Nazis's have left her to hide from the Americans and it's up to her to lead her younger sister and three little brothers of which one is still a baby to her grandmother in the north of the country. They have to beg for food and shelter sometimes paying with the jewels her mother left behind. Australian director Cate Shortland is very good in capturing the mood of desperation and defeat. She uses faded colours almost like a Polaroid picture and shows lots of closeups. Not only of faces but also of hands feet clothes and shoes. It accentuates the oppressive atmosphere in postwar Germany and the terrible fate of the children. The story gets a twist when the children meet a young man who for some reason is willing to help them. The relationship between Lore and the young man is ambiguous for several reasons. 'Lore' is not easy to watch. There are several disturbing and gruesome scenes in the film. But it's a gripping tale of the human urge to survive in almost inhuman circumstances. And most of all it reminds us of the utter horrors of war. This war and any war.".

This is a really terrific movie even though it has a single basic ongoing sad arcmoving from place to place in search of food and safety as the Allies mostly unseen take over administration of the country in 1945. What it manages to say is not just that war is bad or that people have the ability to survive anything if they must but that beliefs and politics are stubborn and irrational.It's this last part that comes through it all as the shining purpose. It's one thing for this band of children to beg for food or walk though forests weary and assaulted by marauders. But to have them run into others who like themselves don't know where to turn or what is going on and still have a devotion bordering on worship for the fuhrer is mind blowing. But believable. The filmingscenes light color moving camera and the sheer range of all of these from scene to sceneis stunning absolutely terrific. As you might grow weary of all the weariness you never grow weary of the movie because it's so rich in other ways. And it's never dull either as characters come and go and their motivations turn on a dime. How it ends both literally and emotionally will stay a surprise and yet when it happens it makes such perfect sad undramatic sense. There are all kinds of war movies and this is an important insight into one of the least explored aspects to it allthe terrible aftermath. It's an Australian production mainly shot in Germany in German. And it's a really special thoughtful beautiful film.".

This is a film that will stay with you a long time after you have left the theater even if your parents did not live through this era in Europe as mine did. The film touches on so many human elements some very conflicting ranging from hope compelling compassion and the draw of sexuality to revenge murder and hatred. It brilliantly blends the social and the individual with it's backdrop of the sociohistorical landscape of Germany right at the end of World War Two and how the power of that situation impacts on the lives of its protagonists. If ever there was an artful illustration of how one generation is affected by the actions or inactions of a previous generation Lore excels in demonstrating that.".

People are starving and sick. They deny the Holocaust and mourn their dead leader who committed suicide in a bunker. Throughout it all the 15yearold lead character Lore must somehow get her siblings to grandma's house while slogging through the chaos of the failed Third Reich.As I said it's immensely complicated. It feels like a slice of life even if it is fiction. The cinematography is excellent. The lead actress all of 19 in real life is obviously very talented. I gave the film a 7 out of 10 because it's a bit too disjointed for my tastes but perhaps that's an effective way to portray Germany's disarray at the end of the war.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's a punchline movie.The ending ties it up well and puts it in proper perspective. Human perspective.The movie for me is largely symbolic archetypical. Lore is not really a person she IS the immediate postwar Germany.Everything that she experiences all her opinions all the opinions she is exposed to and indoctrinated with are the points of view of millions of the German populace.How she deals with it or denies it is how Germany dealt with and denied it. The 'it' being the entire ethos that permittedenabled WWII.In a sense all cultures are a form of mass hysteria mass hypnotism. Societies indoctrinate as part of their nature actually part of their definition is the values with which they indoctrinate their populace.If the values are extreme and violent the populace often follows. It the society fails at its aims and is physically destroyed then the population becomes valueless and must die or reinvent itself.Post WWI German society didn't die so this is a movie about the pressures the pressure cooker in which gave birth to its reinvention.So as a piece of symbolic representation it's magnificent.There are no plot holes every bit of dialog every image in necessary for understanding.And patience is required. The viewer assembles all the images all of Lore's perceptions.And the pressure cooker cooks.".

Lore is not really a person she IS the immediate postwar Germany.Everything that she experiences all her opinions all the opinions she is exposed to and indoctrinated with are the points of view of millions of the German populace.How she deals with it or denies it is how Germany dealt with and denied it. The 'it' being the entire ethos that permittedenabled WWII.In a sense all cultures are a form of mass hysteria mass hypnotism. Societies indoctrinate as part of their nature actually part of their definition is the values with which they indoctrinate their populace.If the values are extreme and violent the populace often follows. It the society fails at its aims and is physically destroyed then the population becomes valueless and must die or reinvent itself.Post WWI German society didn't die so this is a movie about the pressures the pressure cooker in which gave birth to its reinvention.So as a piece of symbolic representation it's magnificent.There are no plot holes every bit of dialog every image in necessary for understanding.And patience is required. The viewer assembles all the images all of Lore's perceptions.And the pressure cooker cooks.";

	schema:reviewBody "An intense coming of age film set during an immense period of modern European history. Finding original stories related to the European theatre of World War Two is difficult however this film brings an engaging and refreshing lens to the period.The film focuses on the events at the end of World War II including the death of Adolf Hitler the tracking down of the perpetrators of the Holocaust the aftermath of camp survivors and the territorial carve up of Germany. A time of lawlessness starvation and depredation.Within this historical period the film focuses on 5 children brought up as Hitler's Youth who are on a journey to their Aunt's. The journey brings both physical and psychological challenges along the way for the children. Lore as the eldest child takes on the responsibility of guide provider and parent. The historical events create the incredible physical tension in the film of a fallen 'utopia' with all of its personal dangers violence and hardship.Along the way they encounter Thomas a recently released from a concentration camp. The ensuing relationship between Lore and Thomas which is part survival part attraction part revulsion and part adolescent creates the psychological tension that is at the centre of the film.The film has echoes of the Films Downfall of the Third Reich and Zentropa in its subject material. All three films by necessity are deeply intense psychological films. The end of the world as most in Germany new it and the incredible psychological changes that the ushering of an entirely new political social and cultural regime brings. In my world it is almost impossible to imagine but the children that lived through this are still alive still with us the living memories of that period of incredible turmoil. Fertile ground for story telling and film telling about our world and our society.".

This mother had to flee for reasons that remained unknown.What follows is that Lore had to abruptly grow up without any training or warning and face a battle for survival as she heads to a place of safety. The film therefore is a chronicle of the journey undertaken by 4 children led by a teenager from a place of abandonment to a place of safety.During this journey they had to face the best and worst of human nature in their encounters with others.

	schema:reviewBody "Lore is an intense drama involving a period of postWW II German society that is rarely if ever examined and to do it as this film does from the viewpoint of German children caught up in these tragic days is worth a visit just out of curiosity. However this film does not just take a dispassionate look from the viewpoint of historian's or news print rather because of the wonderful direction of Cate Shortland this movie moves completely away from ordinary story telling into the far less examined area of psychological change.Superficially this story is about a family of young children who are forced because of Germany's WW II defeat to make their way from the Black Forrest to their grandmother's home near Hamburg in northern Germany. The story concerns the time before that long journey the incidents of that journey and finally their arrival at their grandmother's home. Sounds simple and straight forward but the devil as they say is in the details or rather the story.As the story unfolds while the children attempt to reach the grandmother's home the viewer explores through the eldest who leads this group many of the consequences of her past history as a child growing in this family with all the mental baggage implied by this maturation. The drama is carried by this eldest child Saskia Rosendahl to whom many of the film's incidents occur.Moviegoers might be struck by the closeups used by the director most of the movie's shots are taken at that range and viewers may not like the method. It contributes to an extremely distinct film along with the story as well as Rosendahl's superb acting which must affect the viewer and this after all is why we attend movies to begin.".

	schema:headline " a bleak and foreboding coming of age drama set in Germany during the dying days of WWII";
	schema:reviewBody "Eight years ago Cate Shortland's debut feature cleaned up at the AFI awards winning 13 awards an amazing achievement albeit it in an fairly average year for local films. Over the passage of time views have changed and now people have probably been kinder to the film. After an absence of eight years Shortland returns to the screen with her second feature Lore which is based on one episode in Rachel Seiffert's best selling novel The Dark Room. This is a bleak and foreboding coming of age drama set in Germany in the spring of 1945 during the dying days of WWII. Fifteenyearold Hannelore newcomer Saskia Rosendahl watches as her father an SS officer prepares to abandon the family home. He burns valuable documents before he heads off to the front and certain death. When news reaches the family that Hitler has been killed Hannelore's mother surrenders to the Americans leaving the teenager in charge of the rest of the family. She is charged with helping her siblings  younger sister Liesel Nele Trebs and twins Jurgen Miki Siedel and Gunther Andre Frid and baby Peter  travel across a divided Germany to reach their grandmother's house in Hamburg some 500kms away. They journey across an inhospitable environment and face hunger exposure from the elements and even capture. Lore is resentful of her responsibilities and is also fiercely antiSemitic. Along the way they meet Thomas KiaPeter Malina from The White Ribbon etc a Jewish refugee and survivor of a concentration camp. But she has to form an uneasy alliance with Thomas in order to survive their treacherous journey. Lore is forced to rethink her ideology and National Socialist beliefs in the face of the new reality for the defeated and occupied Germany. Lore is a dark comingofage tale about the loss of innocence awakening sexuality identity and family. Lore is forced to deal with the consequences of her actions and question her beliefs and much of the film unfolds from her perspective which lends a fresh insight to the traumatic experiences and the harsh world around her. Although it is dealing with familiar themes and universal issues the setting gives the material a freshness and realism. Films like the recent Wunderkinder and The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas have also viewed the horrors of war from a nave children's perspective which makes events even more harrowing. Shortland eschews conventional narrative structure here often working in short sharp takes and she uses imagery and sensations to create a gradual sense of dread. Shortland has a distinctive vision for the film and this is a more assured and mature piece of filmmaking than the flawed Somersault. The dialogue is all delivered in German with subtitles a risky move. The central character is initially unsympathetic but Rosendahl's performance is mature and assured and she captures the complex emotional journey of the character well. It is not an easy film to warm too but audiences soon become emotionally invested in her plight and her arduous journey. Shortland is aided by the lyrical cinematography from Adam Arkapaw who has previously worked on films like Snowtown and Animal Kingdom etc which captures the bleak beauty of the setting. There is some breathtaking imagery and the closeups of flowers and thistles and the bleak beauty of nature creates a stark contrast with the ugliness and horror of war and the desolation of the ravaged countryside. A coproduction between Australia and Germany Lore is a harrowing and affecting drama. The film is Australia's official nominee for the Best Foreign Language Film for the 2013 Oscars.".

The most interesting and thought provoking films about the Nazi time seem to come out of German speaking countries fifty or sixty years after the fact and I was surprised to read that it was actually an Australian film and the director was Australian but from the credits I learned that it was cooperation. You have to see this film several times to get it all and even then many scenes are open to interpretation as much is only shown in images without words. This film shows how children get indoctrinated with the beliefs of their parents before the time they are able to form their own judgment. Racism is taught it does not come natural. It also shows that an authoritarian education produces people who follow orders without questioning them. What is shown above all is that people are not willing to give up on a dream. Hitler created this dream of Germany being the greatest country on earth with the most powerful military and that there will be a final victory. When instead of the final victory the ultimate disaster happened they were just not willing to let the dream go.The lead character Lore goes on a difficult journey from teenager to adult when she is suddenly forced to be the head of the family of five children struggling their way through the ruined Germany from South to North through the different zones now occupied by the US Russia Britain and France. The parents who obviously were high ranking Nazis took the easy way out and abandoned the children. Here in the States nobody since the Civil war experiences the aftermaths of a lost war. All wars are fought far away and only the relatives of the dead or wounded soldiers have to deal with the aftermaths of war while the general population does not have to bear the consequences of the decisions their leaders made. No bombed out cities no hunger no rapes by the enemy soldiers no fear of being imprisoned no guilt feelings and no questioning of their own or other's actions.This film gives a very accurate picture of the postwar Germany and I am qualified to say so as in a way I was the little baby Peter in this film. I was born in January 1945 in Berlin and my parents had to flee to the Black Forest when the Russians invaded Berlin. I spent my first year of life on the road together with my seven year old brother and my parents who were starved to skeletons selling all the family jewelry and silver for food along the way. There are no pictures of me as a baby and all I ever heard of my birth was that my mother was scared to death during the whole pregnancy because Berlin was bombed all the time. Like nearly all Germans of my generation I hate war. I do not know any young boy my age who entered military service they all chose civil service instead when they were drafted. Of course I was too little to remember my first year but I remember very well that nobody talked about the war when I grew up. Even the teachers in school managed somehow to omit this subject in history classes. I grew up in a society who did not practice racism. Only when I moved to the US did I learn what racism looks like. I also grew up with friends who came from large families and at the time I thought that my parents had only two children because they married later in life. Much later I realized that these families with five or six children were following Hitler's population program to produce as many children of the Arian race as possible. What was very interesting about this film was also that people did not like Americans I do not remember that I grew up as an European and America was so far away that it did not concern me. . I am so glad that many people in this forum recognize what a powerful film this is. The only very small critique I have is that the people the children meet in the Black Forest would not speak High German having grown up in this area it just felt so wrong everybody speaks dialect. I thought the acting was outstanding  I was already familiar with the actor who played Thomas from the  The White Ribbon.  which is another excellent movie showing how Germans got to be the way they were during the time leading to WWII. My compliments to the director I will make sure I will see all her films in future.".

What was very interesting about this film was also that people did not like Americans I do not remember that I grew up as an European and America was so far away that it did not concern me. . I am so glad that many people in this forum recognize what a powerful film this is. The only very small critique I have is that the people the children meet in the Black Forest would not speak High German having grown up in this area it just felt so wrong everybody speaks dialect. I thought the acting was outstanding  I was already familiar with the actor who played Thomas from the  The White Ribbon.  which is another excellent movie showing how Germans got to be the way they were during the time leading to WWII. My compliments to the director I will make sure I will see all her films in future.";

	schema:reviewBody "Lore is neither a denial of the Holocaust nor a sop of sympathy to surviving Germans. Instead this is a film that treats often very subtly and wordlessly the terrible ambiguities and uncertainties of a situation we have learned to understand as completely black and white and transparent. It also deals with deeply diseased family relationships as a source for genocidal thinking. One of the main points of the narrative is that the teenager Lore discovers that her father was a genocidal war criminal. The film handles this discovery wordlessly. But there is a very explicit set of gestures that explain precisely what she has seen she first stands in a crowd of Germans forced by the Allies to confront photographs of mass murder in exchange for food this is mentioned very briefly in an aside by an unknown character then she notices her father in uniform in one of the photographs of mass murder she touches the photograph and the glue backing it adheres to her fingers. Later she tries to remove the traces of glue from her hand. She returns and removes the part of the picture where her father is standing. Because the film is wordless on this point the viewer doesn't know whether this is because she wants to keep the photograph to remind herself of her father's role in the atrocities or to deny his guilt. But subsequently her younger brother exhibits a treasured image of their father in that same uniform and boasts that Vati Daddy is out fighting in Belarus the site of many atrocities. Lore somehow acquires that photograph as well and we see her put the two images of Vati in uniform together and bury them under mud and grass. That's how this film works and by working this way it manages to reveal the painfully mixed and contradictory motivations all real human beings have. It interests me that some viewers are not able to follow a narrative given in images. It is the dynamic between Lore and her parents that I think is a key element to this film and it has to do with how young people become genocidal and what might make them break with their psychological training. There is an extraordinarily ugly relationship between the parents and between the parents and the children. It was part of the ideology of Nazi Germany to reward German women with medals for producing as many children as possible. In other words it is entirely possible that a woman like Lore's mother a fanatic lover of Hitler would produce a brood of five solely in service of the Fuehrer. Her husband whom she also seems to loathe for what she calls his cowardice in abandoning the family and the cause is just a prosthetic husband. She deeply jealous of Lore for her beauty and her budding sexuality and in the scenes we watch she treats her children as inept servants. When Lore shuts her younger brother up in a cabinet and vilifies him in the cruelest terms possible for stealing food when he is hungry one understands that she is following the example of her own parents' authoritarian methods. Cruelty a harsh authoritarian morality and a lack of loving kindness were the daily bread of that household this is reflected in Lore's behavior as mother to her siblings.When the mother leaves the family it is not for inexplicable reasons as one reviewer implied. We see that the parents are both implicated in the crimes of the war because they go to the length of destroying their library and documents. The parents are clearly thinking about Allied revenge when the mother tells Lore that the Allies kill babies and that's why the mother can't take her nursing infant with her the viewer doesn't know whether or not she believes this herself. We know why the mother leaves but not where she goes. She says she is turning herself in but she may be fleeing to a safe house and taking up a new identity. The children would keep her from escaping her old identity so they have to be jettisoned. In the amazing scene toward the end of the film when the grandmother also  surprise  a strict authoritarian parent chastises Lore's surviving younger brother for eating without the proper table manners Lore finally makes a break with her upbringing. She shows us that she recognizes the hypocrisy and lies of her parents' generation by intentionally eating like an animal in support of her brother spilling milk on the table and lapping it from her hands. And then she breaks all the little kitschy statuettes including the little deer.And on the subject of the Jewish helper  yes his identity is ambiguous. But the fact that he is a camp survivor is made clear from his tattoo. That he has false papers is an important point the regime was all about telling people who they were. When Lore understands that he is a Jew she immediately tries to put him into the category Jew she has been taught parasite lecher. But he breaks out of those categories. He refuses to be the person she frames him to be. The fact that we as viewers are anxious to have his identity defined through papers puts us unhappily into the same position as the Nazis.On the whole this film could disappoint some viewers by not maintaining traditional story structure or temporal structure by leaving significant things unsaid and unexplained by avoiding some of the traditional scenes of war films destroyed cities firefights by depicting American soldiers in a less than heroic or even congenial way. But if you are a film viewer with patience for nonmainstream filmmaking this is a profound and beautiful though sometimes brutal look at disease.".

	schema:reviewBody "Lore released in 2012 directed by Cate Shortland was an amazing film with very few negative points. Lore is a film about her leading her siblings on a journey that exposes them to the truth of their parents' beliefs. In the days of Adolf Hitler when all came crumbling down and finally to an end. Lore in this film was the daughter of a Nazi militant who he in the end was running to hide. Lore and her brothers an sisters didn't realize what her family was they only knew what they we brought up to think. Lore ends up having to take her brothers and sisters far from the area being if they were found they would be put to death.This movie is outstanding! Caught it last night on Netflix based on the ratings of Lore on Rotten Tomatoes website. Netflix rating had a low score of which usually when we see a low star count we don't bother watching. Now Rotten Tomatoes had a score of 96 Tomatoes which states the movie is awesome based on real peoples opinions so we watched it. To our surprise this film was remarkably put together the acting was top notch and the affect omg so realistic. Lore is a sad film being that the eyes  the mind have to endure the thought of what mankind in that era had done and become. It is a slow film working off of every detail keeping you on your toes to watch it is impossible to stop viewing it. It's a frightening film knowing that things on both sides of the spectrum can be so easily misplaced within morality.The only thing that was bad or upsetting about the film is the way it ended. You'd have to see it to decide for yourself But think it's brilliant work! Check out the trailer below.".

Without a word spoken the director was able to show the audience the subtle steps of her new awareness. I think that is what this movie was about. The story jumped from scene to scene without smooth transitions but Hannalore's changing world view was very easy to grasp and understand. Each scene was developed to tell that story.

	schema:reviewBody "Directorwriter Cate Shortland has created something truly remarkable forcing us to find within ourselves sympathy for a young Nazi. The story is grim and dense but features one hell of a lead performance. Shortland combines wonderful visuals with a brutal story of survival involving family and patriotism and a running commentary on the state of Germany after the fall of the Third Reich. As the German army collapses in the spring of 1945 the breakdown of a family serves as a microcosm of a country in despair in the closing days of World War II. Lore Saskia Rosendahl and her four younger siblings are abandoned as their Nazi supporting parents are forced to flee the Allied forces. As they travel on foot to their grandmother's house in Hamburg the children encounter a young Jewish refuge Thomas on whom they are forced to rely for both food and safe passage through Allyoccupied lands. As she is exposed to the lies of their parents and begins to develop feelings for one whom she has been taught to hate Lore is forced to come to terms with a belief system that is quickly unraveling.It's the children that have to do all the heavy lifting in the film dramatically and they carry their weight and then some. The film is anchored by a remarkable lead performance from Rosendahl who comes across as a seasoned veteran despite this being her debut performance. Her character goes from obnoxious adolescent to young adult via a series of confronting moments where her morals and beliefs are challenged. Her vibrant youthful spirit is replaced with a burning rage with a war torn Europe as the backdrop. A new perspective on an event often forces an audience to confront disturbing realities they may wish to avoid. Although Lore relates a story from the second world war it reveals the point of view of those we do not often consider children of a highranking Nazi official. This story may not be pleasant but it is certainly fascinating.".

The acting is great especially the young cast who all give very emotionally mature performances.The film walks a line between an accurately detailed portrayal of an historical past and a personal and emotional journey of an individual namely Lore played beautifully by Saskia Rosendahl. I am pleased to say it does this very cleverly always holding these two at an appropriate tension which results in an honest empathy between us and the characters.I would highly recommend you watch this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "A fascinating piece of cinema and worth every star it is given a glimpse into an apocalyptic and fertile but all too rarely explored place and time. Yes on second viewing those sometimes camera angles began to grate but there were more than enough pearls to make up for that.Of greater significance for me though were the divergences between Shortland's vision and that of Rachel Seiffert in her book The Dark Room from which Lore is taken. Helmut the first story deals with the period up to the end of the war Lore the immediate aftermath and Micha an exploration of the question of war guilt from the perspective of the late 1990s.The short story depicts none of the overt sexual tension which ultimately developed between Lore and Thomas on screen note when they are in the abandoned bombmaking facility and indeed Seiffert's Thomas was an emaciated and sparselytoothed older man far removed from Malina' s character.The eeler the boat and the crossing of the river. This was a critical moment in the movie. A point from which there is no turning back. Lore's cry of what have we done? those so few words is as much a comment on her and Thomas's personal guilt as it is on Germany's collective responsibility. But the scene an example of the violence this movie so vividly portrays  and for which it is often criticised  was again not contained in the book.And finally the depiction of Oma's idyll on the Baltic Coast Lore's ultimate destination untouched by war and a refuge a refuge too for her unreconstructed grandmother. Your parents did nothing wrong. No such idyll in Seiffert's version though but rather a far more realistic and utterly devastated urban Hamburg. Watch Gerhard Lamprecht's sublime Somewhere in Berlin to get an idea.These few points of comparison though are not meant to be any criticism of such a magnificent movie but rather they are examples of how so often screen adaptations can go down unforeseen pathways.A motion picture and a short story of significant merit.".

	schema:headline " Unusual look at Hitler's supporters after the war";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on the novel The Dark Room by Rachel Seiffert the GermanAustralian coproduction Lore takes a look at postWorld War II Europe from an unusual vantage point  not that of Hitler's countless victims but of his many rankandfile supporters one might say adorers in the days immediately following his downfall. Lore played by the remarkable Saskia Rosendahl is a young woman who is forced to flee with her parents and four younger siblings into the Black Forest when the Americans invade their country arresting Nazis and Nazisympathizers and liberating the concentration camps. When the mother and father are eventually apprehended Lore is left to struggle on her own to provide for herself along with her sister and three younger brothers one a newborn as they search for the home of their paternal grandmother. The screenplay by Robin Mukherjee and director Cate Shortland challenges the audience by asking us to empathize with a main character who is an unapologetic supporter of Hitler and a confirmed antiSemite to boot even if we sense it is a result of her background and upbringing. In fact most of the people she encounters on her journey share similar delusions about their dear leader whom they clearly still worship even in death. They've even convinced themselves that all these pictures they're being shown of the concentration camps is mere staged propaganda by the Americans  an attitude clearly designed to assuage their own guilt and deny their own complicity in the horrors their beloved Fuhrer brought about. This antiSemitic philosophy is really put to the test when Lore and her siblings encounter Thomas Kai Malina a young Jewish man who claims to have spent time in a concentration camp and who helps the family in their struggles.The writers clearly know that the audience craving reassurance amid all the moral chaos would like the characters' actions to be guided by an adherence to at least some type of moral code yet the movie aiming for a much more insightful and honest depiction of human nature stubbornly refuses to cater to that desire. For instance just as Thomas appears to be settling into the role of noble victimsavior he goes ahead and commits an act so vile  if understandable in the context of the situation  that we are thrown back in a state of moral and emotional confusion  as is Lore. In a similar way the relationship between Thomas and Lore remains enigmatic throughout and only towards the end does Lore appear to be coming to terms with the fact that everything she's been taught and raised to believe in may in fact be a lie.Yet even with that slight ray of hope at the end the thesis of the movie seems to be that there is nothing enriching or ennobling about war and that when it comes down to a choice between survival and morality survival will win every time. Morals and ethics it appears are fine when one has the comfort of civilization and the luxury of peace to accommodate them but when one doesn't it truly becomes a case of every man and in this instance every woman for himself. That may be a bleak and disturbing picture of mankind but in the world of this movie it seems a brutally honest one.As director Shortland consistently juxtaposes the ugliness of the characters' lives and situations with the lyricism of the photography and setting. The result is a thoughprovoking and artful addition to the litany of films about the Nazi era.".

	schema:headline " Zinnemann again looks at the aftermath of war";
	schema:reviewBody "In Seventh Cross director Fred Zinnemann depicted the isolation of a concentration camp escapee Spencer Tracy with MGM studio sets stepping in for actual locations  that would have been impossible at the time. In The Search he made use of a ruined Berlin to tell the story of a very young concentration camp survivor  a young boy separated from his mother  using the ruins as a metaphor for the many ruined lives.In Act of Violence Zinnemann returns to the aftermath of war  this time telling of two prisonerofwar camp survivors one of whom was a Nazi collaborator the other one a vengeful fellow prisoner who takes it upon himself to track down and kill his former friend. Cinematographer Robert Surtees makes great use of Los Angeles' seedier parts of town  I was reminded of how his son Bruce Surtees made similar effective use of San Francisco in Dirty Harry  this is noir at its best not only in cinematic terms but with those only come out at night characters you expect in a top notch thriller.Mary Astor is most effective as the barfly couldn't make her a prostitute though it is more than obvious  and after her performance in the garish Desert Fury it's nice to see her in blackandwhite again. We first meet her in a pub in which Van Heflin runs for sanctuary the lighting there has us admiring the way she has held up but when we move to the harsher lighting of her apartment the lamp hanging on a cord is unshaded we realize that the first impression was too kind. It's a magnificent performance  perhaps the best that I've seen of her.Barry Kroeger whose altogether too infrequent appearances included such noir classics as Cry of the City and Gun Crazy makes the most of his few moments as an underworld enforcer who would be quite willing to kill Ryan for a price. While Ryan seems to be a man who is on the verge of violence at any second barely able to restrain himself Kroeger is even more chilling. His calm rational demeanor puts him in a different class of predator  he's good at what he does and he's used to doing it like Alan Ladd's character in This Gun For Hire we can be sure that when committing murder he feels Fine just fine.Janet Leigh appears as Heflin's wife  it's an early turn for her and while it is a most stereotypically written wifey role she invests it with all that she has but the ending is such that we have to wonder just how she will react. Right before that we have a taut scene with Heflin about to confront Ryan while Kroeger is watching. The tension is almost unbearable all done through editing and camerawork and not one line of dialogue.Zinnemann would continue to look at war's effects on those who came home in The Men as well as Teresa and in Hatful Of Rain  the man may be the most unheralded of classic film directors but his resume includes Oscar winners such as High Noon and A Man For All Seasons as well as such nailbiters as this film and the original Day of the Jackal.".

We first meet her in a pub in which Van Heflin runs for sanctuary the lighting there has us admiring the way she has held up but when we move to the harsher lighting of her apartment the lamp hanging on a cord is unshaded we realize that the first impression was too kind. It's a magnificent performance  perhaps the best that I've seen of her.Barry Kroeger whose altogether too infrequent appearances included such noir classics as Cry of the City and Gun Crazy makes the most of his few moments as an underworld enforcer who would be quite willing to kill Ryan for a price. While Ryan seems to be a man who is on the verge of violence at any second barely able to restrain himself Kroeger is even more chilling. His calm rational demeanor puts him in a different class of predator  he's good at what he does and he's used to doing it like Alan Ladd's character in This Gun For Hire we can be sure that when committing murder he feels Fine just fine.Janet Leigh appears as Heflin's wife  it's an early turn for her and while it is a most stereotypically written wifey role she invests it with all that she has but the ending is such that we have to wonder just how she will react. Right before that we have a taut scene with Heflin about to confront Ryan while Kroeger is watching. The tension is almost unbearable all done through editing and camerawork and not one line of dialogue.Zinnemann would continue to look at war's effects on those who came home in The Men as well as Teresa and in Hatful Of Rain  the man may be the most unheralded of classic film directors but his resume includes Oscar winners such as High Noon and A Man For All Seasons as well as such nailbiters as this film and the original Day of the Jackal.";

She's seen all the troubles in the world she tells him And they boil down to just those two. You're broke or you're lonely. Most noir films confirm this the hero is brought down by lust or greed or some combination of the two by the temptations of crime or the lure of a femme fatale. But this time the worldweary hooker is wrong her man's problem has nothing to do with love or money. It has to do with the war when as the man tells his wife A lot of things happened...that you don't understand.World War II is an undercurrent in many postwar noirs. A generation of men had faced violence and death they couldn't settle back into their ostentatiously wholesome communities and they were all too ready to pull out their service revolvers to solve peacetime problems. ACT OF VIOLENCE offers the most direct analysis of the war as a source of noir angst becoming both one of the best examples of the genre and one of the best films about the effects of war. Four years after America's victory it was still daring to admit that not all of our boys behaved honorably overseas and that our prosperity might rest on corrupt foundations.Frank Enley Van Heflin is a perfect image of postwar success a war hero with a thriving business a nice house in the suburbs a beautiful wife and a young son. This idyll of fishing trips and checkered aprons is invaded by Joe Parkson Robert Ryan a creepy limping gunwielding apparently deranged stalker. He was with Frank in the army and in a P.O.W. camp and holds a mysterious murderous grudge against him. The first part of the movie plays like a horror film using magnified soundsespecially the slow shuffling drag of Parkson's lame legin eerie stillness to heighten suspense. As we learn more about what really happened in the war the blackandwhite scenario of threatened innocence unfolds into a complex moral puzzle. Can desperate circumstances or good intentions mitigate an act of betrayal and moral cowardice? Is violent revenge ever justified?Robert Ryan starts out in typical form intense tightlywound scary seething with hate. But we also get to glimpse the suffering and moral outrage that underlie his tortured obsession. His anger might be righteous but he's still a figure of terror. Van Heflin has the richer part and he reveals the full measure of his underappreciated brilliance. He doesn't look like a movie starhe was well described as attractively homelyand he doesn't act like a movie star either. He's so transparent and direct he never advertises what he's doing. Like Arthur Kennedy he specialized in ambiguity playing nice guys with something shifty and unreliable about them or unscrupulous heels with decent cores. Here he evolves from an amiable pillar of the community to a man so sick with selfloathing that he can hardly stand up straight.In a classic noir trajectory he moves from the sunny suburbs to the wasteland of an urban night where the desolate streets around L.A.'s Angel's Flight mirror his state of mind. The suburbs too have dark shadows and unsettling overtones like the background motif of the Enleys' baby screaming behind the bars of his crib or playpen trapped and helpless as his father. At the end of his rope Frank meets a friendly wornout barfly a shockingly weathered and tawdry Mary Astor. Astor works wonders with a clichd part all nervous tics and generosity pinched by fear and bad memories. She keeps talking about getting her kicksit's all she has left. Gee there's no law says you gotta be happy. In this seedy underworld the man with the tortured conscience meets a man with no conscience a killerforhire with a smooth voice and plump evil face Barry Kroeger who plays the part of Satan tempting Frank to get rid of his problem the easiest way. Heflin manages to retain sympathy for his weak and sometimes despicable character through the honesty and vividness of his anguish. Fred Zinneman keeps the suspense mounting through taut spare direction no excessive music or flashy visuals or extraneous flourishes just a relentless focus on the collision courses of the main characters who include Frank's wife the girlish gorgeous Janet Leigh and Parkson's girlfriend Phyllis Thaxter who doesn't want her man to be a murderer.What would you do if you were starving literally fighting for survival and you had a chance to save yourself? What if you had done something terrible and knew that only one living witness knew about it? What if you were that witness? There are no easy answers in this movie which attacks the popular notion that when a war is over it's over and people can just get on with their lives. An act of violence is never the end it always leads to another.".

	schema:reviewBody "Act of Violence is the penultimate noir film containing many key elements that made the genre so formidable. Coming a year before Carol Reed's classic The Third Man the imagery of the tunnel as a symbol for the search for redemption is presented already full blown by Fred Zinnemann. The effective utilization of urban nocturnal sounds in place of music punctuate the mood of desperation and hopelessness like a sharp knife slashing the soul asunder. What can be more lonely than a distant train whistle in the middle of a dark night? Or wind whistling through the eves of houses occupied by deserted lost individuals? No place is as desolate as the empty streets of a large city in the wee hours of morning just before dawn. Zinnemann and his superb cameraman Robert Surtees provide these chilling images plus so much more. Who can forget Frank R. Enley Van Heflin at his best escaping from his demons not just limping Joe Parkson Robert Ryan or bad boy Johnny Berry Kroeger through a vacant tunnel screaming at the top of his lungs Don't do it Joe...Don't.... Or the scenes of Joe running down oppressive stairways to get away from the specters that haunt him. His actions are not enough to justify recompense. Recompense comes only at the end of the film not a closing that most would want or expect in a Hollywood film of the day but the required one for the theme of the story.The entire cast of Act of Violence is first rate giving performances worthy of recognition but veteran actress Mary Astor as the lost soul Pat who takes an ambivalent attitude toward Frank runs away with the show. She portrays despair and desperation writ large. Pat's human side wants to help Frank to free him of the hell hounds nipping at his heels. But the survival part of Pat wants to throw him to the wolves for a pittance. A telling scene occurs when Johnny nonchalantly dashes a drink into her face for attempting to aid Frank. She reacts in an impassive manner as if this were a daily occurrence. Pat is perennially at the mercy of men who treat her like trash. She views life the same way she views men.One other performance of note comes from Taylor Holmes as Gavery the aged shyster lawyer. Holmes makes his small part shine becoming the epitome of an intelligent educated professional corrupted by greed and ego. His surroundings suggest Gavery is debarred now living on funds extorted or purloined from illegal activities. Johnny played to perfection by Berry Kroeger is a crude immoral mental dwarf ruled by emotion and violence a counterpart to Holmes who uses punks such as Johnny to do the dirty work and be the patsy if caught. Johnny is also a foil for Joe who seeks to kill Frank for moral altruism reasons. The script by Robert Richards from a story by Collier Young is not much and would have withered on the vine in the hands of a journeyman director. Fred Zinnemann and cinematographer Robert Surtees breathe life into the routine story to make it one of the best noir thrillers of them all innovative and entertaining. A leading citizen of a small town Frank Enley is being stalked by a former army buddy Joe Parkson because of an incident that took place in a German POW camp that led to the death of several fellow soldiers. Joe was left for dead but miraculously survived to hunt down the informer Frank and kill him. Frank attempts to escape by hiding out in a seedy section of Los Angeles. He meets a fellow creature of the night Pat who introduces him to a hitman Johnny. While drunk and out of his mind Frank makes a deal with the devil. Realizing too late what he has done Frank rushes to stop the inevitable.".

	schema:reviewBody "ACT OF VIOLENCE is a disturbing and provocative film which raises moral issues which probe deeper than the sometimes contrived melodramatics of the plot would seem to allow. The story centers around two WWII veterans who both survived internment in a German POW camp. Joe played by a grim Robert Ryan with gun always at hand is an implacable limping angel of retribution relentlessly tracking down the man who betrayed him and his comrades. That man is Frank played by Van Heflin who in contrast to Joe has made a new and good life for himself in the postwar world. He has a pretty young wife Janet Leigh and a young son. He is a respected and successful businessman. All seems right with his world until Joe arrives like a cloud on a sunny day. The moral confusion begins right away. Joe has come to murder for righteous retribution not to confront Frank or bring him to legal justice. Frank is frightened but honest enough to confess his guilt to his wife. Joe had organized a plan to tunnel out of the camp and when he refused Frank's order to stop Frank informed the Nazi Commandant. We see that Frank is not really a bad man only a weak one. His crime was under extreme duress and starvation. He admits he did it to eat.There are issues here though that the movie does not deal with. Frank was the superior officer. He was responsible for all of the men. He ordered Joe not to try to escape. Joe disobeyed the order. Is Joe perhaps somewhat more culpable than he is willing to admit to himself? The war was nearly over. All they had to do was hang on a few weeks. Frank's way may have been the wisest way. If there had been no escape attempt all of the men might have survived. Frank's voiceover flashback has Joe giving his reason as We are not gonna starve any longer. It echoes Frank's confession to his wife.The movie does not really probe this issue of the respective guilts of the two. Joe keeps coming on his mission of vengeance. Frank cracks and the movie skids into familiar noir territory with a sleazy lawyer hooking Frank up with a hitman. The ending is stock oldtime melodrama not up to the premise of the film. As a movie though this is a winner. Fred Zinneman's shadowy direction builds smoothly and the melodramatic climax is tense and welldone if contrived. The acting from the entire cast is solid with Mary Astor the standout as a downandout bar girl. All and all a very good melodrama which has within it the seeds of a very great film indeed if more attention had been paid to character and less to standard noir complications.".

	schema:reviewBody "Act of Violence is directed by Fred Zinnemann and adapted for the screen by Robert L. Richards from a story by Collier Young. It stars Van Heflin Robert Ryan and Janet Leigh with support coming from Mary Astor Phyllis Thaxter  Berry Kroeger. Robert Surtees photographs it from various California locations and Bronislau Kaper provides the music that is conducted by Andr Previn.An Embittered former POW Ryan is hell bent on revenge against his former commanding officer Heflin who betrayed his men's planned escape attempt from a Nazi prison camp.Superior film noir piece that is not only boasting a taut intelligent and suspenseful story to work from but also a collective group of film makers on tip top form. The film primarily looks at the point of view of the troubled soldiers who upon returning from war are mentally and physically shot. Some are thriving as the economy in the post war times has picked up while others are carrying the legacy of battle   with deep long memories gnawing away with every battle scarred step. They say time is a big healer particularly with the passing of loved ones and the willingness to forgive those who have done you wrong. But the makers here are not in that frame of mind. The ghosts of the past are not content to sit around in Surtees' menacing shadows they want out and with Ryan  Heflin deftly channelling different yet very flawed characters the result is a tough and at times fascinating viewing experience.Zinnerman one can reasonably assume gave his heart for this one. Having fled Austria to escape the Nazis his heart would be shattered as his parents would become part of that dark piece of history that encompassed the Holocaust. The grim texture Surtees again dealing in genius like mood enhancements of the piece carries an air of realism a need to cast out some demons in the form of cinema. The ending will cause some consternation to first time viewers definitely! But personally I think it's closure for the director and to us the viewers it should has make for an interesting conversation piece about noir and the way to finish off one of its dark offspring. As for the cast? Ryan  Heflin are superb two of the finest character actors from the golden era of Westerns and Noirs. But rest assured that here the girls are also their equal. Leigh gives gravitas to the role of the courageous loving and fretful wife of Heflin's tortured soul. Thaxter blends common sense with anguished loyalty as the girlfriend of Ryan's malevolent cripple. While Astor almost steals the film from the guys as a brassy woman of the bars and streets who takes Heflin in off the now dangerous avenues and alleyways.Smart pangy and dripping with noir style Act Of Violence has so much going for it and equally as much to say. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Act Of Violence is a powerful and tense melodrama about two men who during the period immediately following World War 11 are both haunted by the past. The methods by which they struggle to resolve their troubled circumstances differ as one chooses violent revenge as a solution whilst the other ultimately opts for an even more perversely criminal remedy. Stark visual contrasts are drawn between the brightly lit scenes which celebrate all the optimism and positivity of the period and the more darkly lit ones during which the problems of the recent past are addressed.Frank Enley Van Heflin is a clean cut exserviceman who runs his own successful business. He's happily married and well respected in his local community. Joe Parkson Robert Ryan is a disabled war veteran who calls at Frank's house and learns from his wife Edith Janet Leigh that Frank is away on a fishing trip. Joe pursues Frank to the nearby lake with the intention of killing him but is thwarted when he is unable to get a clear shot at him. When a bartender tells Frank that a stranger with a limp has been asking about him he immediately panics and heads home.Frank tells Edith that Joe and he were in a Nazi POW camp together and that he doesn't want to see Joe as he's mentally ill. Frank also admits that it was because of Joe that he moved the family away from their previous home in Syracuse New York. The couple hide out in their darkened house when Joe calls again and his threatening presence pacing around outside makes the sound of his irregular stride seem extremely sinister.When Frank goes to a builders' and contractors' convention in Los Angeles Joe goes again to his home and tells Edith that he's pursuing Frank because he was responsible for his disability and the deaths of a number of his comrades. At the convention Joe finds Frank and after a brief scuffle Frank escapes. He goes to a bar where he meets Pat Mary Astor who introduces him to a lawyer named Gavery Taylor Holmes and a hit man called Johnny Berry Kroeger and between them they make an arrangement for Joe to be murdered. The events that take place when the killing is to be carried out lead to a resolution for both men and some degree of redemption for Frank.Frank is an archetypal noir character being a rather weak man haunted by something from his past and who despite his best efforts is unable to avoid his own destiny. His collusion with the Nazis that led to the deaths of his comrades had been an ill judged action which had been made at a time when he was under duress and the same poor judgement was shown yet again when he made a similar bad decision to conspire with criminals to kill Joe. Neither man is completely noble or unequivocally evil but both are undoubtedly victims of their recent tragic past. Their story which initially appears to be a simple conflict between good and evil is gradually revealed to be something more complex and disturbing.Fred Zinnemann's direction and Robert Surtees' cinematography are both excellent and combine effectively to unveil the different aspects of Frank and Joe's characters and also to convey all the associated tension and anxiety that they feel throughout.Act Of Violence certainly grows from its deceptively straightforward looking introduction into an absorbing tale of some substance and profundity.".

There are no epiphanies no one is morally redeemed. These are people who have in the past been placed in horrible circumstances by forces largely beyond their control but the disasters that their lives have become are largely of their own making.Robert Ryan gives a solid performance as the vengeancecrazed vet. Van Heflin's performance as the guilt ridden morally conflicted and thus morally ambiguous exPOW is excellent. He disintegrates from upstanding halefellowwellmet to cringing manon therun as he realizes that his current life is a fragile construction of fantasy that the horror of his past during the war must inevitably shatter. Mary Astor's performance as the aging barfly looking for kicks is stunning and in my opinion Oscarworthy although she was not nominated that year.  L.A.'s original Bunker Hill district is also a standout in many scenes.As with any noir you won't be uplifted. You will however be entertained by Act of Violence.".

It has all the elements of film noire such as the dark dimly lit night scenes the water soaked streets the pursed the pursuer and a femme fatale all of which are used to great effect.The film opens on a rain soaked street in presumably New York with a lone figure limping to a seedy hotel to retrieve a gun. The camera pans up to a grim faced Joe Parkson Robert Ryan who boards a bus bound for Los Angeles. At first we do not know the reason for his quest.Cut to the Los Angelis suburb of San Rita where Frank Enley Van Heflin his pretty young wife Edith Janet Leigh and their young son are enjoying the good life. Frank is being honored as the contractor who has built the latest suburban housing project.Parkson goes to Enley's house but learns from his wife that he has gone fishing. Edith becomes alarmed. Parkson follows Endley to the fishing spot and intends to shoot him but fails. Endley learns of the stranger seeking him from Pop the fish camp owner Will Wright and knows right away who it is that is after him.Back home Frank tells Edith the reason for the appearance of this stranger. During WWII after their plane was shot down Parkson had planned an escape from the prisoner of war camp. Henley partially to prevent the escape and partially for his own personal gain had informed the Germans of the planned escape. All but Parkson are killed during the attempt.Enley flees to a builder's convention in an effort to escape his pursuer. Parkson learns of Enley's whereabouts from a neighbor Connie Gilchrist and follows him to the convention. After slugging Parkson in the hotel lobby Enley flees again winding up in a seedy bar in the wrong side of town. There he meets Pat Mary Astor an aging prostitute. Perhaps sensing an easy score she takes him home.When she learns of Enley's plight Pat takes him to crooked lawyer Gavery Taylor Holmes. There the two talk the hapless fugitive into paying a cold gunman Johnny Berry Kroeger to kill Parkson.

Ryan plays Parkson as a cold determined assassin who cannot be deterred from his task regardless of the consequences. Mary Astor almost steals the picture as the femme fatale who leads Enley further into the depths of fear.

It's a terrific piece of work a truly taut thriller and yes you could say very UnZinnemann like. The act of violence of the title is twofold. It could refer to Robert Ryan's desire to kill Van Heflin or it could equally refer to the act of violence that Heflin was responsible for when a number of his men during the war were murdered by the Nazis after he betrayed them. Heflin now lives a life of almost desperate respectability in a small Californian town with wife Janet Leigh and it's to there that Ryan tracks him down.This is a morally complex film that was never the success it deserved to be. Both Heflin and Ryan are superb and Leigh too is excellent as the wife trying to come to terms with her husband's past. There is also a terrific and sadly neglected supporting turn from Mary Astor as an ageing prostitute. It was shot magnificently and on actual locations in black and white by Robert Surtees and it remains one of Zinnemann's very finest films.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 'act of violence' of the title is contemplated not carried out. This is therefore not a violent film despite the title. The film is a brilliant and thoughtful attempt to deal with serious issues of postwar trauma betrayal and revenge. The women in the film are the helpless spectators of the actingout of a postscript to a war of which they had no direct knowledge. Beautiful and talented Janet Leigh aged only 21 is the adoring wife of Van Heflin who delivers one of his finest performances as a man whose past has caught up with him in the most menacing way possible as Robert Ryan with a gun in his hand deciding that van Heflin must pay for what he did when they were in the Nazi prison camp together. These situations existed in real life and did not have to be invented. Fred Zinnemann the director was freshly back from Germany where he had just finished shooting 'The Search' 1948 on location amidst the rubble and ruins of the war. The aftermath of the war was his obsession at that time followed after this by 'The Men' which also dealt with veterans. I knew Fred very well for a while and he was a deep thinker a man with a profound conscience and sense of social responsibility to inform and enlighten the public. He was an Austrian Jew and his first film experience was with the German film 'Menschen am Sonntag' 'People on Sunday'1930 which is an astonishing bold and mesmerising documentary film of social observation mixed with avant garde. Fred told me he had trained as a violinist when young in Vienna. He was a thinker and a complete highbrow hence his ability to direct 'A Man for All Seasons' so well but one who was devoted to public communication. I had the highest possible opinion of Fred as a person and as a creative artist. He was so gentle that he was able to tease sensitive performances out of anybody. He had some rough times in his career but that is another story. With 'High Noon' 1952 Fred achieved recognition as one of the world's leading film directors recognition which should have come to him earlier. Certainly this film in which every frame is perfect the script is wellhoned and the editing and construction without flaw together with its spectacular performances Mary Astor harrowingly convincing as a prostitute! and Robert Ryan at his most grimly determined and menacing where we come to realize that his need for vengeance is purely idealistic and not personal shows clearly what a master Fred Zinnemann already was. This is not 'just a noir film' it is a Fred Zinnemann film in the noir genre which is something else again. It should not be missed by connoisseurs who want to see how a dark thriller can be genuinely profound in a social and psychological sense. Fred's wish was not just to make a good thriller but to explore the depths of what that thriller represented in every respect. Since film noir was a genre which came into existence as the result of the aftermath of the war this film is central to understanding the genre as a whole and if you haven't seen it you can never properly understand the genre. This and 'Force of Evil' are probably the two key noir films the most profound of them all.".

From the moment that Ryan looking like a pleasant serious businessman lets you know he has a gun you'll gasp the tension never lets up.Ryan here is after Van Heflin another very fine and intelligent actor whose character from the moment he learns that Ryan has found him out is torn apart by his dilemma both practically and psychologically. He can't run he can't hide he can't fight but worse than this he can no longer evade feeling that he deserves to die. His flailing efforts to escape get out of his control and put him in even greater danger.Why did this terrific early Fred Zinnemann movie die at the box office? The title was a dog for one thing boring and vague. There was no romance. But most of all the subject was unbearably grimnot just the manhunt aspect but the soulsearching the questions the movie asks about guilt forgiveness and reparation the scene when Heflin tries to buy his way out of trouble is one of the most chilling in the film. These were questions that clearly preoccupied Zinnemann whose previous movie was The Search and whose parents had died in the Holocaust while he was safe in America.All the performances are wonderful emotional when necessary but never showy. The most disturbing in a way is Mary Astor an actress as classy as her assumed name who plays a slovenly middle aged prostitute with selfeffacing simplicity. And despite the grandeur of the theme there are nice little touches such as Ryan's being so obsessed by his quest that he doesn't notice a patriotic parade coming down the street and tries to cross in front of ita scene that has a grotesque echo later when Heflin's wife desperate to save him has to push her way past a parade of stumbling leering drunken conventiongoers.One quibble It is reasonable that Ryan should have some kind of handicap or disfigurement to symbolise his damaged body and soul. But did it have to be a limp? The limping villain with the sound of his creepy irregular gait offscreen frightening people in the silence of the night was a clich a generation before this movie was made. Indeed it was the mark of the villain in The Fallen Sparrow of six years earlier another revenge drama about betrayal in wartime.".

	schema:reviewBody "Very enjoyable machinegun paced film noir tells a solidly entertaining tight story in atmospheric and potent fashion by director Fred Zinnemann. It's noteworthy for the way it portrays the effects of WWII on the minds of the men who fought it. Our two main characters are hunter and the hunted but are not so different and they're both created in shades of grey. One made some awful mistakes but must suffer the pangs of guilt and the other has allowed his hatred and need for revenge to completely dominate his life to the exclusion of all else. The supporting cast is strong and Zinnemann and company just get right into the action saving all of the credits for the end which would have been a real rarity in this era.Van Heflin plays Frank Enley a successful building contractor who finds that he is being relentlessly pursued by one of his old war comrades Joe Parkson Robert Ryan. Joe simply can NOT forgive Frank for his actions during their time as prisoners of war and is intent on killing him. Soon Frank must take it on the lam while other people involved in the drama such as Franks' terrified wife Edith Janet Leigh and Joes' distraught girlfriend Ann Phyllis Thaxter try to dissuade Joe from continuing in his mission.There's no filler here just an engaging straightforward story authored by Collier Young and written for the screen by Robert L. Richards. Things really kick up a notch once the frazzled Frank goes on the run and get truly interesting when a concerned call girl Pat Mary Astor takes some pity on Frank and tries to help him out. Things only get worse when he's introduced to characters such as Gavery Taylor Holmes and Johnny Berry Kroeger. Heflin and Ryan are both compulsively watchable the young and gorgeous Leigh is a joy Holmes and Kroeger are great fun to watch and Astor is fantastic and a real standout among the cast.For those people who love this genre and also like a bit of action to go with it Act of Violence is a satisfying bit of entertainment.Eight out of 10.".

Some of the low key scenes are nice and effective like when Napoleon's sick grandfather has his last conversation with his grandson. But ultimately the movie is a little TOO low key for its own good. For the most part it chugs along not only at a very slow pace but lacking bite the movie could have used a bit more tension and conflict. Near the end the tone really changes with the actionpacked climax but it seems to come from a different movie altogether. There is additionally some interest in seeing the prefame Michael Douglas who is pretty good and Jodie Foster who is unexceptional though this was her first movie.

The script had too much emphasis on Scully's patient and not enough emphasis on what was actually happening in the main story. Scully was really whiny. And it annoyed me that she brought up Samantha. Mulder was a little bit weak and somewhat boring he did not have the spirit and gusto that he had in the show. It was not scary. It was barely dramatic. It was not engaging and unfortunately I really never asked the question what's going to happen next or how are they going to solve this? But rather when will this speed up. It is only my die hard fanship of the show that made me not ask myself When can I go home? Although I did have free tickets so it would have been silly to leave. And the inclusion of Skinner was an obvious fan treat and completely irrelevant to the plot.I hate the fact that I didn't like it. It should have been an event. And it wasn't.

First of all what the hell is Xzibit doing in there? He should stick to pimp my ride there he sucks just a little less than in the new X files film. I don't think much better of Amanda Peet but she couldn't suck more than Xzibit well i suppose she does in real life if Xzibit is't one of the badguyturnedgood father Joe's altar boys she should make a romancecomedy not X filed well there was a lot of romance in this film but not with her involved... Scully and Mulder resembled themselves from the old days no comment on that a good performance and of course you can't mess up Skinner there's no way the scene where he enters the plot line was one of a few good ones. Father Joe is also pretty good acted he seems that he's sorry but should have been more psychotic that's my opinion Billy Connolly was a victim of the cp story. All the Russians were bull's excrement. The Russians don't have the technology! The Chinese do! Finished with the acting let's get to the storyline. It sucked. Even more than Xzibit. I would've given it 5 stars if Xzibit wasn't there so with him in the film not even 4 stars for the plot. There's barely something that you could call paranormal... Bleeding from the eyes? Bah... Psychic powers? That's chewed up already... Head transplant? That was fun for a minute but where's the rest? At least the twoheaded dog was fun but didn't get enough screen time. Maybe all of the Xzibit's parts could go to the cool dawg...dog... They should at least have thrown in some aliens doesn't matter where couldn't make it any worse as it is. As mentioned there was romance between Mulder and Scully. To much of it. Unnecessary and boring. That's all I have to say about it. Russian gay love story including the body transplant was kind of fun at moments but nothing shocking or disturbing or at least a little bit scary as one would expect from Xfiles. Why should he transplant all of his body? It would be enough if he'd just get the vaginoplasty just like Mr. Garrison did. The parallel story of Scully working in a hospital wasn't interesting either and barely had any connection with the main one. What was Mulder doing all that time? Growing beard? The snowy scenery was beautiful the film well shot and cut. At least that was good about it. All in all the film was below my expectations which were low before seeing it and at least it's not better than the last Batman which I've also seen I kind of expected hoped that maybe it would be as I certainly didn't like the Dark Knight but that doesn't have any connection with the movie i'm commenting on. If you don't like church go see it. If you don't like gay people go see it. If you like gay people go see it. If you like Sicko go see it. If you like Saw watch it again don't waste time on this it's similar but not as direct you won't like it. If you like Extreme Makeover go see it. If you like Pimp my ride stick to that. If you like X files skip this film.Sorry for my English.".

	schema:headline " Chris Chris Chris....";
	schema:reviewBody "I just saw XFiles I Want to Believe. There are too many other people beginning their reviews with I Wanted to Believe It Would Have Been a Decent Film for me to do the same. However that is how I like many others felt tonight. There was laughter during the serious scenes and no laughter during the briefly comic moments. Not a good sign when the audience is tittering during moments of anger or tears between the main actors. After it was over I wanted to buy Chris Carter a beer sit down with him slap him in the head and say Chris..... what happened? Chris wrote some great episodes but as the series ended it got weaker and weaker. This movie plays like a subpar episode from one of their weaker seasons. It's as if Carter had proved the old clich that a writer only has so many stories in them and when they're gone they're gone. I don't want to believe that but it's hard to dispute it in this case. Duchovny and Anderson are firstrate as always they are the only reason people would watch this movie noone else could say these lines and hold interest. Watch this movie only if you want to see them as their characters and discard any need for coherency or plot let alone logic because you won't find it. POSSIBLE SPOILERS NOT THAT IT MATTERSThe main villain in this movie is a 50 yearold Russian delivery man who outruns the younger Mulder outwits him is played as if he's the unstoppable Alien throughout the series when he is really only a.... 50 yearold Russian guy with no special powers. Then at the very end after getting away after every gruesome crime he gets whacked in the noggin with a wrench from a woman and goes down. End of villain. The movie ends shortly thereafter. The hero of the movie is a retired pedophile priest. Making this schmoe a pedophile just to make him unpalatable was unnecessary and insensitive to those who have actually been molested as children. It was a very cheap and easy way to make the guy disturbing to audiences and Carter is smarter than to use such a cheap device. SPOILER ALERT again not that it matters The entire plot as ludicrous as it sounds boils down to thisA 50 yearold gay Russian dude who is part of an illegal organsnatching ring wants to save his gay partner by stealing body parts when that fails he plans to have his head grafted onto a woman's body. That's it. I kid you not. When you see the movie you will see this is exactly the plot. You will also want to join me in slapping Chris Carter in the head. After all this time this is the best he can come up with? It is a cross between a Russian Dr. Frankenstein movie and Hairspray. MOST LUDICROUS MOMENT AWARD Again the shame here is on Carter not Duchovny. He actually has Mulder go into a room full of the people he knows have been abducting and cutting up women for body parts armed with.... a wrench. That's right a wrench. He staggers around he has a head injury saying Stop! Just Stop what you're doing! Do any of you speak English?? Then a 70 year old Russian doc hits him with a hypo gun knocking him out. This is the guy who went toe to toe with unstoppable morphing aliens in the series. Now he's dumb enough to get hypo'd by a guy on social security. Everything after this point was pure farce and you feel insulted that you were expected to take any of it seriously. The plot holes are too giant to describe. Save that for a guy that used to live on the cell phone it doesn't occur to Mulder to use his phone when he finds out where the bad guys are. Oh yeah he does but his car gets rammed so he drops it. Then when he wakes up hours later in his car he still has his phone but doesn't use it. But wait Skinner arrives anyway! And he has some of the dumbest lines in the movie as he and Skully try to find Mulder randomly in the dark! OK I give up..... there's no describing it. The Truth Is Out There and it is this Any member of the audience tonight that was laughing during this movie could have sat down and in two weeks written a treatment that would have turned into a better movie than what Chris Carter and Spotnitz wrote. If you are a fan you will leave the theater with the same feeling and you will be correct. Yep this...thing with two heads was written by two heads. Which is probably why you will see twoheaded things in this movie. As for myself I Don't Want to Believe. I Don't Want to Believe that Carter would write something this bad and this insulting to not only the diehard XFiles fans but for Duchovny and Anderson to perform. I can't end without saying something directly to Carter though I know he won't ever read it Come on Chris. You know you could have written a better and more compelling and more coherent script than this. You should have vetted it found out how bad it was scrapped it and started from scratch with a new script with higher stakes and more meaning for your audience. Your audience deserved better and your legacy deserves better. Cue mournful XFiles music at end......".

	onyx:emotionText "I just saw XFiles I Want to Believe. There are too many other people beginning their reviews with I Wanted to Believe It Would Have Been a Decent Film for me to do the same. However that is how I like many others felt tonight. There was laughter during the serious scenes and no laughter during the briefly comic moments. Not a good sign when the audience is tittering during moments of anger or tears between the main actors. After it was over I wanted to buy Chris Carter a beer sit down with him slap him in the head and say Chris..... what happened? Chris wrote some great episodes but as the series ended it got weaker and weaker. This movie plays like a subpar episode from one of their weaker seasons. It's as if Carter had proved the old clich that a writer only has so many stories in them and when they're gone they're gone. I don't want to believe that but it's hard to dispute it in this case. Duchovny and Anderson are firstrate as always they are the only reason people would watch this movie noone else could say these lines and hold interest. Watch this movie only if you want to see them as their characters and discard any need for coherency or plot let alone logic because you won't find it. POSSIBLE SPOILERS NOT THAT IT MATTERSThe main villain in this movie is a 50 yearold Russian delivery man who outruns the younger Mulder outwits him is played as if he's the unstoppable Alien throughout the series when he is really only a.... 50 yearold Russian guy with no special powers. Then at the very end after getting away after every gruesome crime he gets whacked in the noggin with a wrench from a woman and goes down. End of villain. The movie ends shortly thereafter. The hero of the movie is a retired pedophile priest. Making this schmoe a pedophile just to make him unpalatable was unnecessary and insensitive to those who have actually been molested as children. It was a very cheap and easy way to make the guy disturbing to audiences and Carter is smarter than to use such a cheap device. SPOILER ALERT again not that it matters The entire plot as ludicrous as it sounds boils down to thisA 50 yearold gay Russian dude who is part of an illegal organsnatching ring wants to save his gay partner by stealing body parts when that fails he plans to have his head grafted onto a woman's body. That's it. I kid you not. When you see the movie you will see this is exactly the plot. You will also want to join me in slapping Chris Carter in the head. After all this time this is the best he can come up with? It is a cross between a Russian Dr. Frankenstein movie and Hairspray. MOST LUDICROUS MOMENT AWARD Again the shame here is on Carter not Duchovny. He actually has Mulder go into a room full of the people he knows have been abducting and cutting up women for body parts armed with.... a wrench. That's right a wrench. He staggers around he has a head injury saying Stop! Just Stop what you're doing! Do any of you speak English?? Then a 70 year old Russian doc hits him with a hypo gun knocking him out.

I really think that Chris Carter David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson delivered what they had promised to. All along throughout the postproduction and press campaign we've been told that this is a creepy story with Mulder and Scully's relationship at its core. Well that's what it is ... plain and simple. I really think that all the negativity and people's harsh reviews are from false and hyped up expectations of what this movie is supposed to be. If anything you should just try to walk into the theatre with an open mind.But I almost think some people who reviewed this film saw a different film than I did ...1. I read a review in which the person said Gillian Anderson's acting was awful. That is false. It is quite the contrary. Gillian Anderson is probably one of the strongest aspects of this movie. Every time she's in a scene you're captivated.2. I had read that Mulder and Scully don't show up in the film until 45 minutes into it. False. Scully appears in the 3rd scene  so what? no more than 7 minutes?  and Mulder directly follows.3. Someone complained about an irrelevant and torturously long scene where Mulder fills up his gas tank. This doesn't happen. He goes to a gas station gets out of his car and goes into a store.4. Lastly it was rumored that the actors where flubbing up their lines all the time. Okay even if they did that wouldn't end up in the final film. Obviously they do multiple takes for a reason. The lines are solid.This movie is not boring. The surprises are there. It may not be scary in a 'horror film' sort of way where things are jumping out at you every 2 seconds but it is scary. The acting is amazing. Gillian Anderson on her own is a joy to watch but when you put her in a scene with David it's either going to break your heart or melt it. The supporting cast won't let you down and neither will the storyline. It's not paranormal in the sense of freaks and monsters but religion and God. It's very much in the fashion of All Things seeing the signs and following them. Finally it is just excellently put together. Whoever edited this film did a phenomenal job! The intercutting and juxtaposition was out of this world.GIVE IT A CHANCE FOLKS.".

One day Scully pushes and manipulates Mulder to take on this case. He resists but Scully is hell bent on convincing him to take the case. OK fine. This leads me to believe that the Scully character wants Mulder to take the case. Then 48 hours later she decides that Mulder is obsessed with the case he is working more than a 95 in order to solve it and she tells him that he must drop the case or she will leave him forever I think they are married or at least the next best thing. Huh? One day she feels strongly that he take the case 48 hours later she is willing to nix her entire marriage to him because he has been working overtime for the last 2 days? What does this tell us about Scully? That random motivations flit through her mind with no rhyme or reason and that she acts on them impulsively? If that is what she is how can the audience sympathize with her? How could Mulder deal with her as a wife? How could there be screen chemistry between a man and a random motivation generating machine? The thing is any random 10th grader would not have made this mistake if they were hired to write this script. Problem 2 The cinematography was what you would expect from a moderate budget TV show not a movie. It had the look and feel of a normal TV episode and yet was worse than nearly all the episodes of year 17.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have been a huge XFiles fan since the first episode. I even read the comics put out by Topps and the novels by Charles Grant and Kevin J. Anderson. I loved the first movie Fight the Future. Even though I had heard people disparaging the film because it wasn't connected to any larger mytharc I thought that would be fine because some of the standalone episodes are my favorites Pusher Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose etc.. Even the worst episodes were entertaining in some way so what could go wrong? As I found out many things could go wrong. Bad writing. Clich and forced dialogue. Plot holes. Awkward and unfunny humor. Really bad story. Transparent parallels that felt cheap and unentertaining.The theater I was in was pretty full. It was 3 days after opening night. I sensed that most of the reactions around me were similar to mine. People were laughing but not at intentional jokes. Sometimes the actions of the characters just seemed stupid. Like towards the end Mulder comes into the villains' lair yelling Stop! Don't do that! People were rolling in the aisles.I could tell a few minutes into the movie it was going to be bad. When Mulder initially refuses to help with the case then sees a picture of his sister and that totally changes his mind I thought to myself Uhoh this might be bad. I kept hoping for improvement but it was not forthcoming.There really wasn't a single scene in this I can say that I liked. The dialogue was so stilted unoriginal and unorganic that I wondered if Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz had paid some fanfiction author to write this. I take that back there's fanfiction that's better than this.The villains being gay Russian organ harvestersmad scientists is just so lame and boring. I mean this is the XFiles where's the paranormal? Sure there's a supposedly psychic pedophile priest but that didn't work too well and was the only weak connection to the XFiles. Why did the FBI really need Mulder so badly? And let's remember that the conflictedcomplex psychic character had already been done  and much better  in Beyond the Sea. Add in a silly Bush joke I'm no fan of Bush but it just seemed such a cheap shot and so out of place and a pointless 15minute Skinner cameo the only point people cheered in the theater and you can see why this is so poorly made. Never in my deepest pessimism would I have imagined that this film would have been so bad.I haven't the slightest idea where Carter and Spotnitz were coming from. They wanted to make Mulder and Scully look more mature? Less waving his gun at the heavens? like Mulder says in the first movie? They could have done it better than this. Scully berates Mulder for still looking for his sister? After all these years she still thinks it's about that? The parallel between Mulder's obsession with finding the truth and Scully's obsession with helping the sick boy Christian subtle name was so hityouoverthehead. And Don't give up? So profound.They tried to address issues like the Catholic priest sex scandal why God allows suffering gay marriage and even the existence of God  but it's done so hodgepodge and shallowly that it comes off like a bad movieoftheweek drama.I could say so much more. I'm going to go back and watch some episodes of the series. I will never watch this movie again or buy it on DVD. It doesn't even deserve to be associated with the greatness of the series.EDIT After 7 years I went back and watched it after hearing a small but growing fanbase of the movie argue for its merits. I had pretty much the same reaction unfortunately and couldn't find any merits to it despite trying my hardest. At least there's the revival miniseries XFiles Reopened coming up. I'm looking forward to that and hope they can go on as if the second movie never happened.".

	schema:headline " No Country for Old XFiles";
	schema:reviewBody "The world is a greatly changed place since the heyday of The Xfiles. Back in the late 1990's the TV show was at its height and tapping into the shared fears of the day fear of the unknown fear of the impending millennium and fear that something larger than us the government or alien invaders was up to no good. Flash forward to the year 2008 and we know all that hubbub about the millennium was for nothing our government has been up to no good for years and it's not space invaders we need to worry about but other people terrorizing us. The murky gloomy grim style of The XFiles is now the norm with feverish and dark films like There Will Be Blood and The Dark Knight tapping into the mindset of culture today from opposite ends of the film spectrum.Apparently creator Chris Carter didn't realize his baby was irrelevant now. His only mission should've been to please the faithful. If he wanted to revive his series on film he had best stick to the labyrinthine alien mythology that still has some diehard fans buzzing or at the very least deliver a fun standalone monsteroftheweek style flick that would make fans jump in their seats. With The XFiles I Want to Believe he does neither of those things. Instead he gives us a story where Mulder and Scully come out of hiding to work on a case where the FBI are using a psychic criminal priest to help locate a missing agent and track down a potential serial killer. The plot fits more into the mold of his far less popular companion series Millennium than it does to The XFiles. Apparently Carter wanted to please no one except perhaps himself.The weirdest thing about the film is that it isn't all that bad. Carter as a director lays on some decent atmosphere with all the globalwarming defying snow and some eerie nighttime shots and creates some palpable tension as the horrors of the case grow grimmer. The chemistry between Mulder a lazy but effective David Duchovny and Scully an amazingly fully ranged and emotional Gillian Anderson is still there and Anderson's performance is especially gripping. Billy Connolly cast against type gives an interesting turn as the corrupted priest searching for redemption through his visions that probably would've garnered an Emmy nod had this been a very special twopart TV episode. Also good is Amanda Peet looking smashing in her smart FBI pantsuits.Most interesting is the story arc given Dana Scully. I honestly had stopped watching the show after the sixth season and aside from the mythology storyline that built up to the first film released ten years ago I recall some of my favorite episodes being the ones where Scully questioned her faith and struggled with reconciling her Catholicism with her scientific approach to the paranormal investigations. This is again explored here as Scully always the skeptic so desperately wants to believe in something. However it's an odd choice for Carter to focus on this internal human drama when he should be focusing on how to bring fans back into the fold. It would've been an interesting and compelling layer had Carter not been so inept with the rest of the plot.In the end some fine performances and a moody atmosphere do not add up to a good time. Eventually it becomes an uncomfortable and anachronistic creepfest that plays like the type of suspense thriller that ruled the roost in the mid1990's after films like Silence of the Lambs and Seven made police detection and serial killing popular entertainment. Well it's 2008 Mr. Carter and it's time to wake up from your prolonged nightmare that was rendered uninteresting in 2001.".

Back in the late 1990's the TV show was at its height and tapping into the shared fears of the day fear of the unknown fear of the impending millennium and fear that something larger than us the government or alien invaders was up to no good. Flash forward to the year 2008 and we know all that hubbub about the millennium was for nothing our government has been up to no good for years and it's not space invaders we need to worry about but other people terrorizing us. The murky gloomy grim style of The XFiles is now the norm with feverish and dark films like There Will Be Blood and The Dark Knight tapping into the mindset of culture today from opposite ends of the film spectrum.Apparently creator Chris Carter didn't realize his baby was irrelevant now. His only mission should've been to please the faithful. If he wanted to revive his series on film he had best stick to the labyrinthine alien mythology that still has some diehard fans buzzing or at the very least deliver a fun standalone monsteroftheweek style flick that would make fans jump in their seats. With The XFiles I Want to Believe he does neither of those things. Instead he gives us a story where Mulder and Scully come out of hiding to work on a case where the FBI are using a psychic criminal priest to help locate a missing agent and track down a potential serial killer. The plot fits more into the mold of his far less popular companion series Millennium than it does to The XFiles. Apparently Carter wanted to please no one except perhaps himself.The weirdest thing about the film is that it isn't all that bad. Carter as a director lays on some decent atmosphere with all the globalwarming defying snow and some eerie nighttime shots and creates some palpable tension as the horrors of the case grow grimmer. The chemistry between Mulder a lazy but effective David Duchovny and Scully an amazingly fully ranged and emotional Gillian Anderson is still there and Anderson's performance is especially gripping. Billy Connolly cast against type gives an interesting turn as the corrupted priest searching for redemption through his visions that probably would've garnered an Emmy nod had this been a very special twopart TV episode. Also good is Amanda Peet looking smashing in her smart FBI pantsuits.Most interesting is the story arc given Dana Scully. I honestly had stopped watching the show after the sixth season and aside from the mythology storyline that built up to the first film released ten years ago I recall some of my favorite episodes being the ones where Scully questioned her faith and struggled with reconciling her Catholicism with her scientific approach to the paranormal investigations. This is again explored here as Scully always the skeptic so desperately wants to believe in something. However it's an odd choice for Carter to focus on this internal human drama when he should be focusing on how to bring fans back into the fold. It would've been an interesting and compelling layer had Carter not been so inept with the rest of the plot.In the end some fine performances and a moody atmosphere do not add up to a good time. Eventually it becomes an uncomfortable and anachronistic creepfest that plays like the type of suspense thriller that ruled the roost in the mid1990's after films like Silence of the Lambs and Seven made police detection and serial killing popular entertainment. Well it's 2008 Mr. Carter and it's time to wake up from your prolonged nightmare that was rendered uninteresting in 2001.";

Anyone who has watched the series over and over like me will be completely disappointed. All those classic episodes Home Tombs Our Town etc etc blow this rubbish out of the water. The first film was great with the black oil bees and alien involvement. A great start with the cavemen fighting the alien in the ice.What does carter provide for us in this movie  xzibit and Billy Conolly  please save me.There was very little for fans apart from a pointless reference to Mulders sister the pencils in the ceiling and Mulder's nut eating and nothing for nonfans.You know you have a bad movie when there is another pointless scene trying to poke fun at George Bush? Didn't realise this film was written by buds of Michael Moore. Concentrate on the film not politics. Only losers enjoy that sort of rubbish.A complete disaster and Chris Carter should be ashamed. It shows the guest writers really carried the series.The only bonus was i got a free DVD of the 1st movie at the cinema!!".

There are two main plots within this movie that with the exception of Scully being in both have nothing to do with each other and neither plot is worthy of being on something titled The XFiles. The only real paranormal things in this movie are Mulder's beard and the psychic's eyes bleeding.What was even worse is that there was no climax to this movie. NONE. The climactic scene was there but the events happened so quickly that if you blinked you easily missed where the climax should have been.The only reason to see this movie is to see Mulder Scully and Skinner all on the big screen again.

I went in expecting a good film  the first film might not've been amazing but it was watchable and it fit in with the series and I figured what with the huge wait for this one they must've been taking their time and getting a great script together because surely they'd want to prove wrong all the people who rubbished the first film?I think maybe they waited too long to do another movie. I think maybe Chris Carter forgot what The XFiles used to be about forgot what exactly it was that made the show so great. Yeah the episodes were weird and yeah some story lines strained belief but they always offered so much to back it up that it got you thinking and it always had an enthusiasm in the characters that just made it enjoyable regardless of believability.Pet peeves of the movie 1. No follow on from the end of season 9 at all. 2. Come back all is forgiven. Never realised Mulder was that blindly trusting. He's a wanted man. He never even bothered to make sure that the offer was on the level just took their word for it  the word of a government he's never trusted. 3. The focus was all wrong...instead of focusing on the case and the background and giving us details to involve us and catch our interest they focused on Mulder and Scully's relationship except that there was zero chemistry between the two and they even tried unsuccessfully to add back some of the will they won't they tension from the series with Scully's halfhearted threats of I'll leave you. 4. The bad guys weren't even scary  they were stolen from over half the horror films currently out there kidnapping with sick experiments seems to be par for the course when going for shock value these days so shame on Chris Carter for following the crowd. 5. Even the ending was halfhearted  less than 10mins of one of the main characters from the series  surely Skinner deserved a bigger role? Basically it just left us feeling cheated.I really tried to like it I wanted to like it but it just wasn't an Xfile. Give Mulder and Scully's characters different names and it just becomes another in a long line of preachy films about letting science go to far and religion  and seriously? Making the paedophile a good guy? What kind of message is that sending out?Shame on you Chris Carter.".

While we always needed to crank up the volume to try and make sense of the murmurs involving shadow governments and secret conspiracies our favourite episodes almost unanimously were those oneoff ones so called the monster episodes.And it's been 6 years since The End and 10 years since the first XFiles movie hit the screen. While that movie was intricately linked to the major conspiracy thread this movie as the trailer led us to believe was a oneoff monster episode or so I thought. While it's indeed a oneoff episode it's no monster of an episode in the mould of those in the television series though it really felt like an extended stand alone episode which gave us a slightly more in depth look at the dynamics of our beloved duo especially what happened to them in the last few years they went off the FBI radar. But as the saying goes you can't put a good man and a lady down for too long.This is a story about obsession. As we all know Mulder's obsessed with everything X classifiable and in the years of absence here comes an opportunity for a breath of fresh air when Agent Dakota Whitney Amanda Peet comes knocking to seek his expertise as the FBI now has a case on their hands and a psychic convicted pedophile of a Catholic Father Joseph Crissman Billy Connolly who volunteers key information to help in that case. The FBI isn't sure if Father Crissman is a liar or worse connected to the crime and hence Mulder's help is to be their liedetector. Naturally with religion and her usual cynicism in the mix Scully is disgusted by the sheer presence of the religious felon and thus set the stage for some conflict with her beau.Like an old quarreling couple who can't seem to give way to each other their philosophies clash as their interests  Scully battling the hospital system to save her young chronically ill patient  differ and threaten to pull the couple apart. He thinks that she's not being supportive of his venturing into an Xcase even though they're now civilians while she thinks he's latching onto Father Crissman to use his prowess if proved true to find Samantha Fox. Which I thought would probably make an excellent sub plot but alas the potential was dangled like a carrot in front of us and then went totally off tangent.Don't expect any big sets or intricate subplots here as it really looked like it's done on a shoestring budget with the look and feel of a typical classic television episode a twoparter in fact. There are strange aberrations of course but all these go unexplained and you know they're just going to be glossed over since everything will be wrapped up by the time the end credits roll. However there are adequate moments to keep you at the edge of your seat and some developments do enough to leave your mouth gaping wide open especially those involving extreme medicine.David Duchovny does look more comfortable reprising his role as Mulder but Gillian Anderson as interviews have revealed required a lot more time trying to get back into character and this uneasiness unfortunately shows on screen. The chemistry's still not lacking but given that their respective characters have aged and grown more comfortable with one another gone are the tensions between them though the problems that surface here did try to rekindle some of the opposition they felt during the course of their long running series.Chris Carter and XFiles regular scribe Frank Spotnitz did incorporate a nice surprise in the movie so do keep your eyes peeled as you will silently cheer when it happens. But I thought what was a ghastly way to bid farewell was the little coda toward the end of the credit roll which somewhat signals the finale of everything though in a very out of place manner. Anyhow this XFiles movie episode isn't going to win any new fans over but for Xphiles I'd bet we're probably just satisfied already with our heroes appearing in celluloid one more time that no matter how wafer thin the plot is it's not going to dampen our collective fan spirit.And to thank our lucky stars that Mark Snow's iconic theme song didn't get played in the movie under the horrific techno rendition.".

The end resolution is pretty crap as well Father Joe dying. Your also unsure if Scully's patient is ever cured and if Mulder  Scully reunite.Mitch Pileggi is brought back as Skinner and even he can't save this god awful film. There isn't enough that doesn't confuse to make a clear understandable film that has an actual ending. I didn't even realise Xzibit was playing the Agent who was constantly doubting Father Joe's abilities as it doesn't look like him at all.I'd wait until this is released on DVD and watch it with the commentary on it might make the film a bit easier to follow  understand. Otherwise steer well clear its really awful.".

It's here! shouts Billy Connolly's mysterious questionable and apparently psychic Father Joe Crissman in the film's opening scene and although he is talking about something much more grotesque than the return of The XFiles the words clearly echo the thoughts of every last XPhile awaiting the return of Mulder and Scully of The XFiles and as surely everyone hoped something to make up for the many hours wasted on the show's astonishingly mediocre final season.If you do not enjoy The XFiles you will not enjoy I Want to Believe. That is a simple fact. Although this film was marketed as a standalone feature requiring no prior understanding of the series the final product is quite far removed from one of the more straightforward standalone episodes and is actually more about characters and themes than the plot itself which is not on its own very good.What it comes down to in the end is whether or not I was satisfied when the credits started rolling and UNKLE's excellent version of Mark Snow's theme started playing. The answer is yes. The XFiles I Want to Believe is not entirely satisfying as a straightforward thriller. It is not entirely satisfying as a procedural or as a medical drama. It is however satisfying when the disparate elements come together to form the thematic core of Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz's solid screenplay and although the journey to the ending is occasionally frustrating preachy and even downright annoying the end result is worth it.Nobody can rightfully accuse Carter and Spotnitz of writing a hurried screenplay. If anything The XFiles I Want to Believe is too preoccupied with including as much as possible on a thematic level. This film could have been a tight thrilling 90minute film if they had decided to go that way. What The XFiles I Want to Believe is is a combination of various sorts of episodes into one feature film. If you crave a straightforward scary thriller you will inevitably be disappointed because that simply is not what this film is about regardless of what Carter himself might tell you. When the film comes together as a whole at the end the XFile or in this case not so much itself couldn't possibly matter less. The title which seems frustratingly awkward on paper is incredibly fitting once you have actually seen the film.The XFiles also known as Fight the Future released in 1998 was a mythologybased story with plenty of action. It was The XFiles in blockbuster mode. Although it satisfied many fans I found it rushed inconsequential and severely lacking in substance. While I Want to Believe may feature a main plot that often feels like a subplot and one that is quite far from being the most inventive or exciting Mulder and Scully have ever dealt with it feels like a more complete film. What is lacking in thrills scares and action is made up for with outstanding character moments and an effective thematic core. Chris Carter's feature debut as director The XFiles I Want to Believe provides some solid visual moments in addition to some misguided decisions. All in all Carter keeps the film moving at the slow but involving pace of most episodes and the prelude to the film is a very wellexecuted scene.The performances are uniformly outstanding except for Xzibit and Amanda Peet who are both not given much to do. Billy Connolly's understated performance is a masterclass in acting that is quite possibly one of the best male performances of the year thus far and Duchovny and Anderson slip back into the roles of Mulder and Scully albeit an older slightly different Mulder and Scully with no problems whatsoever. The film features several outstanding scenes the final conversation between Mulder and Scully in the film and Scully's latenight confrontation of Father Joe a stunning scene really stand out as the finest. Carter provides the romantics much to swoon over but never allows the romantic plot to become cheesy or overpower the remainder of the film. The film is far from completely serious as there is much humor here and a lot of treats for the fans including some very very pleasant surprises and small references to the series the latter taking place mostly in Mulder's office at the start of the film. Also look for a bizarre but funny gag involving J. Edgar Hoover George W. Bush and Mark Snow's XFiles theme.The XFiles I Want to Believe is an atmospheric thriller that while flawed and certainly not providing a definitive XFiles experience is much better than 1998's Fight the Future and an enjoyable return for Mulder and Scully which encapsulates much of what made The XFiles so addictive humor drama great characters and an excellent musical score.7.510".

To be honest I was wondering why I know that there are still fans that are shaking to see their favorite agents back but the story was weak and felt like another episode just an extended one. Now I did enjoy The XFiles series I also did like the first XFiles film so I felt like maybe this was going to be big and have an exciting story but instead we have just another episode that is trying to have the Saw edge and gross people out. We also have some added characters that are just weak for example Xzibit as a one dimensional character who is just flat and typical also it's Xzibit I don't know what casting director was thinking he's perfect no offense to this guy but he should stick to his day job. David and Gillain are also off track and don't have the same chemistry as they did in the series.Fox Mulder has been requested back by the FBI to help them with a case of missing female FBI agents he meets a priestpedophilepsychic who is also helping the FBI out with the case. Dana Scully has decided to stay with her current career as a doctor who is struggling to save a little boy's brain disease. But Fox wants her back in work with him and together they discover the darker world that is happening with these missing FBI agents and the Russian black market.The X Files I Want to Believe is over all not a bad movie by any means but it's at this point that it seems like the writers were not even trying. Also with David and Gillain I like to call this movie The X Files I Want a Paycheck because they just didn't put their hearts into this and you can tell very much I thought David hated the series you think he would have been more stubborn or at least would have read the script first before the paycheck. As far as for the fans I'd recommend that you just do the matine it's not a full price ticket movie it's just an extended episode the ending is anticlimatic and this was just pointless.510".

	schema:headline " Incredible that they could produce such rubbish!";
	schema:reviewBody "What resulted was a dreadful waste of 140 hours of my life that will never be replaced. I sat there slap faced through shock and disappointment at the audacity of the director Chris Carter who has basically sold us out and conformed to main stream acceptance to underestimate our intelligence as viewers to actually think that this would be worth anybodies time. Basically Chris Carter here has just capitalised on the reputation that this once brilliant series formerly had. What one had grown to enjoy with the XFiles franchise during the 90's was dramatically and rapidly obliterated in this one sitting.The flair of drama intertwined with mystery revolving around paranormal subjects of great scientific interest and which had done well to intrigue the general public was diluted severely to a mere love story between Moulder and Scully. The storyplot was pathetic worse than any of the episodes of the actual series! The acting was lame especially from the actor Xzibit who played agent Mosley Drummy as the sceptic in the whole affair that was played out amateurish was not the word.I looked on wideeyed with disbelief at how appalling this was. Scully's character was one i just wanted to smack with a reality check still the sceptic who needs logic to deal with any phenomena remotely strange despite the experiences Scully has dealt with one would think that this act was well worn out. Basically a bog roll film of the highest calibre after watching this film you will not want to believe ever again in your life. XFiles will never recover from this poor excuse for a movie. I hope what you made from this Chris was worth it.".

It is standard for any local Police Department to use psychics and it is pretty common so I asked myself why is this believable? There has to be more right? Maybe I should stay and keep watching because something better must happen! This entire movie should not have been made no matter how much I like to see aging stars at least working in these fetal film times.

Going in thanks to great marketing you won't shouldn't know anything about the plot and this helps create a real sense of mystery. By now you know it has to do something with psychics but you really have no idea.The writing just like the show is pitch perfect. The character development between Mulder and Scully is never off and they even introduce new characters. These characters aren't great I suppose at times Xibit is kind of annoying but they work pretty well to move the story along. This film also does something many movies have a hard time doing and thats creating sub plots that don't fall flat. There's a great sub plot involving a boy with a terrible disease and its emotional and you never don't care about his fate even though it isn't the central focus of the story.The acting is great. Duchovney and Anderson both flourish as the main characters while newcomers Amanda Peet and Xibit is he trying to pull a Rock on us and change it to his birth name? do their job admirably but never steal a scene from the real stars of the film.I know I have a ton of great things to say about this movie and yes I loved it. I'd rank it among the greatest summer films this year for those wondering Dark Knight and Iron Man both trump this. This is on par with how I felt about The Incredible Hulk which I also loved. I just can't say that it's great and honestly I'm not sure what it is. Probably that it felt like a really epic episode.This feels right at home in the series and it's a real relief to say that because it could've been good but not at home within the series.I give this film a B.".

Shame shame on the socalled Fans.In I Want To Believe  The Fans who followed the show to the end forget that Mulder and Skully were allowed to go into hiding and set free by Skinner and Kirsch and had NO INVOLVEMENT with the FBI or the literal X Files from that point on. That was back in 2002. For the Fans to forget this is solidly unforgivable.What did they want these socalled Eberts? They did not want to see Mulder and Skully they wanted EBEs. They forget that about half of the XFiles cases were cases just like this case in this film.As an XFile this is your regular dose of Conundrum. As a Film it is well directed by Chris Carter himself. The look of the film is cold and bleak just like the story being told. The Locations are also dismal just like the majority of locations in The X Files show. Most of the fans who posted here sound more like RightWing AntiAbortion Extremists than True Fans of TheXFiles Therefore I must refute them all.Now as I WAS a fan from day one of the first Pilot of the Series and I stayed with the show for almost a decade I will say these So Called Internet Eberts are Ungrateful Sots. And I don't care who LIKES what I have to say about them it was the same thing that happened with Star Trek Nemesis which was also a great film PANNED by the Franchise' own Fans. If they can't see what they did to this film then it's on them not Carter. All Carter wanted to do was give us Mulder and Skully again and he does this and it succeeds. I did not WATCH this film to see Little Green EBEs I watched it to see the DYNAMIC of Skully and Mulder and how they work together which is as awesome here as it was in the series and the other feature film.Billy Conolly is Joseph Crissman a Pedophilic XPriest who for some reason has been seeing the abduction of a young FBI Agent Monica Bannon Xantha Radley. ASAC Dakota Whitney Amanda Peet locates and calls upon Fox Mulder to help her decipher what Crissman is seeing or if it has any validity. She says Help us and the FBI says All Is Forgiven.  And we get the impression in this film this is exactly what Mulder wants  As he and Skully have been wasting away in a rural area. The chance to work with the X Files once more gives Mulder new life.But it takes us the whole film to see this process going on within Mulder. On one hand he wants to Get Away from all the Government Lies but on the other hand he can't really live unless he is investigating some kind of Fringe Event.Skully meanwhile is working in a Catholic Hospital which just like the FBI is run by the tenet Apology is Policy  She is in the middle of treating a child with an untreatable Brain Illness but she has found an alternative Treatment which gives the boy a fair chance of survival but the Catholic Hospital will not allow it because it has to do with Stem Cell research. In a way Skully is now seeing what Mulder had to go through with the FBI with each XFile.This puts Skully in the bad position of not being fully available to Mulder as he gets more involved with the FBI in the search for Bannon And as Skully has rejected Crissman's claims that he has a Psychic Link to the Victim and the FBI is looking for a reallife connection between Bannon and Crissman  This puts Mulder in the same spot where he seems to land himself in most of the series of The X Files.So Skully leaves Mulder alone to work with the FBI while she convinces the Hospital to allow her to save the boy. In her research she discovers a connection between her work the Agent's abduction and Father Crissman. As with an XFiles case Mulder figures out the more unbelievable things while Skully finds scientific evidence. But nothing can explain Father Crissman is is a Fakir? Skully thinks so but ultimately the Truth Out vindicates Crissman.What we have here is a full blown Mike Hammer style Mystery with elements of The Supernatural. Mix in some Fringe Science and a few scenes where Mulder gets the crap kicked out of him and it's regular XFiles circa Season Three.I say that this Feature Film is similar to the 3rd Season Ep Grotesque because it follows the Spiritual format of Season Three and Grotesque was the best of these Eps  It showed Mulder's Process of going to the Dark Place and becoming it as does this film. I thought Season Three was one of the best XFiles seasons and most of the XFiles of that year had to do with cases like this one.I want to personally tell Chris Carter  Give us some more and stand your Ground. Tell is IN FILM what you were saying here in This Film  Chris I'm behind you all the way. Because if Apology is Policy then it is not a good one.".

	schema:headline " Old Fashioned Fun Western";
	schema:reviewBody "Whatever happened to lighthearted western movies like 'Something Big'? Now whenever Hollywood manages to let a western slip out among the 'Die Hard' ripoffs and teen romances they are always ponderous grim indictments of the murderous whiteman's persecution of indians or sombre stories about tormented gunslingers.  By 90's movie standards nobody in the Wild West seems to have ever cracked a smile.  'Something Big' is a movie from the good old days of politically incorrect westerns.  Dean Martin plays a likeable outlaw with plans for something big to finish his career in the west. Plans involving a Gatling gun a fortune in gold a kidnapped wife of a cavalry officer Apaches and Mexican bandidos galore. The movie has a cheerful adventurous mood to it with all kinds of touches of atmosphere like Dean Martin's pet dog Scruffy the skeleton propped up in the saloon and the John Fordlike dialogue between Brian Keith as the cavalry officer and Ben Johnson as his scout. 'Something Big' has almost the same mood as a pirate movie only set in the west. An exciting story with likeable scoundrels after a fabulous treasure.

	onyx:emotionText "Whatever happened to lighthearted western movies like 'Something Big'? Now whenever Hollywood manages to let a western slip out among the 'Die Hard' ripoffs and teen romances they are always ponderous grim indictments of the murderous whiteman's persecution of indians or sombre stories about tormented gunslingers.  By 90's movie standards nobody in the Wild West seems to have ever cracked a smile.  'Something Big' is a movie from the good old days of politically incorrect westerns.  Dean Martin plays a likeable outlaw with plans for something big to finish his career in the west. Plans involving a Gatling gun a fortune in gold a kidnapped wife of a cavalry officer Apaches and Mexican bandidos galore. The movie has a cheerful adventurous mood to it with all kinds of touches of atmosphere like Dean Martin's pet dog Scruffy the skeleton propped up in the saloon and the John Fordlike dialogue between Brian Keith as the cavalry officer and Ben Johnson as his scout. 'Something Big' has almost the same mood as a pirate movie only set in the west. An exciting story with likeable scoundrels after a fabulous treasure.  I remember seeing this on TV as a little kid and wishing my life could be like that of Dean Martin's character in this movie.  If you love westerns and do not feel like watching a big important 'message' movie like Dances With Wolves or a revisionist gunfighter story like Unforgiven you should try to find this film on TV.

	schema:reviewBody "Something Big has always gotten a bad wrap from critics but I have to disagree with them on this one.This flick is good fun western escapism at it's non political correctness best. Just two years later Mel Brooks was hailed for a much raunchier Blazing Saddles but for some reason Something Big was deemed way over the top in 1971. Sad since by this point after his Airport success Dean was at the tail end of a hectic 25year film making career. One senses that as Dean prepares to end his outlaw ways in the film he was saying goodbye to the movie... after a continuous run of at least one film per year since 1949. Indeed other than the Cannonball Run nonsense in the 80s Dean would do only two more films... 1973's Showdown with Rock Hudson a good one! and 1975's crime drama Mr. Ricco a MUST SEE for Dean fans.Anyway... onto Something Big. Dean is on his last legs as an outlaw and wants to pull one more big event. This one involves getting a gattling gun trying to get Albert Salmi a wife putting some Mexican banditos on ice and ... ah well it's kind of a rollicking mish mash but it's a lot of fun on the way!Dean is really in his element and shines as the antihero. Brian Keith is a hoot as a stiff calvary officer and other great supporting cast members like the great Ben Johnson and the above mentioned Albert Salmi make this one a must see. Like Dean's television show of the time this flick doesn't take itself too seriously but you know deep down the bad guys really aren't too bad and work with their own sort of code of honor. Speaking of honor Honor Blackmun is good here too.Other Dean Martin westerns I'd recommend are Rio Bravo Rough Night in Jericho and especially Showdown. He did others but The Sons of Katie Elder and Five Card Stud weren't up to par in my opinionalthough they are watchable. Only Four For Texas is truly bad.Too bad this isn't available on video or DVD. The Dean Martin catalog is seriously under represented in video and DVD and I hope that is rectified sometime soon.Enjoy Something Big for what it is... a bit randier version of Support Your Local Sheriff type of thing with a pretty good cast of A list players good locations and cinematography and a funny script. The deep blue arid skies and dusty locales are truly beautiful and may have been filmed near the Superstition Mts. in Arizona where I once lived so the movie has a special place in my heart. The best thing I can say about this film is that it made me want to be one of the characters in it looking for an adventure and finding it in the old west. No cares no responsibilities just a desire once in life to do something really really big!".

He wants to really make a score do Something Big before returning to the east and another outlaw Albert Salmi has an interesting proposition for him.Salmi's been without a woman for way too long now and his sidekick Robert Donner is not one to bring out the love that dare not speak its name. There just ain't too many folks of the female persuasion out in the territory. So if Martin will get him a woman Salmi can lay his hands on a Gatling Gun to be used in whatever that Something Big scheme will be.So what does Dino do?

The problem there is Dino didn't check her hand for a wedding ring she's the wife of Brian Keith the commander of the local army post.Ironically enough this silliness actually works as Brian Keith and chief scout Ben Johnson go searching the territory for Martin and Blackman. The various misadventures of the players goes for most of the film and when Martin does put his big scheme into operation in the last 20 minutes or so of the film it is so anticlimatic it's actually a let down.Something Big is a very funny film for some reason not often shown. All the players do well but my absolute favorites are Joyce Van Patten and Judi Meredith the Standish sisters. A pair of frontier widows who really know how to be hospitable to a passing stranger especially if the stranger is in pants.Hopefully TCM will get this film and run it and soon.".

Before she arrives he wants to do 'something big' to impress her and provide funds for their trip east and wedding. Baker is a bandit heading a sizable gang of Mexicans along with Dover's Scottish brother Tommy. Thus Baker's idea is to steal a rumored fortune stashed by infamous Mexican bandit Emilio Estevez somewhere in the Mexican village he and his numerous gang members have taken over. Baker figures he needs a Gatling machine gun to even the odds that his gang can outshoot Emilio's gang. Hence most of the screen play relates to efforts to procure such a gun. This takes an indirect route beginning with trader Morton who steals the gun from a federal arsenal. Morton is supposed to sell this to the pair of Cobb and Moon who will trade it to Baker for a woman he findsWomen are very scarce in this region. Well Morton ups the price for the gun when he delivers it to Cobb and Moon. Hence Moon flings his knife at Morton killing him with a chest strike. Meanwhile Baker and gang have been holding up various stage coaches looking for a good woman for Cobb. They find a buxom floozy in one but Tommy rejects her as not refined enough for Cobb. Finally they find a refined beautiful ladyHonor Blackman as Mary Anna and abduct her. Later they discover she is the wife of Colonel MorganBrian Keith commander of the nearby army post who has come to accompany the Colonel home upon his imminent retirement. She says she has liked the arrangement where she and the Colonel are together for only one month per year. It's like a new romance each year. Baker and Tommy later decide that she's too refined for Cobb thus they take the Gatling gun without giving Cobb a woman. However they direct him to a pair of manhungry women out in the boonies who seem poised to satisfy him.Meanwhile the Colonel has learned of the abduction of his wife and goes looking for her and Baker. He eventually finds them and initially wants to charge Baker with abduction as well as possession of a stolen firearm. However Mary Anna has formed a favorable impression of Baker and argues against charging him with either offense. Baker and gang then go to bandit Emilio's village which seems deserted at first but soon opens up with gunfire from everywhere. Miraculously Baker and gang are not harmed by this hail of bullets and finally get the Gatling gun in position to mow down the defenders to the last man. They then have to guess where the treasure might be. I leave the rest of the story for you to find out what happens.Both Tommy and Dover have endearing thick Scottish accents. Tommy occasionally plays his bagpipes. Much of the humor relates to the women primarily Mary Anna Morgan and the pair of hard rock gold diggers who try to grab anything in pants. This includes the Colonel and his sidekick BookbinderBen Johnson who are looking for Baker who has been there recently. The scene where PollyJoyce Van Patten and CarrieJudi Meredith are vigorously trying to seduce the Colonel and Bookbinder is especially funny. Apparently the girls succeeded to the Colonel's embarrassment....Also Baker's small dog rates a few chuckles here and there. It's small enough to fit in Baker's saddlebag with front end sticking out.".

	schema:headline " Nothing Big";
	schema:reviewBody "Andrew V. McLaglen's lackluster western comedy of errors Something Big amounts to nothing big. This hokum is about as bloodless as you can imagine and McLaglen and Undefeated scenarist James Lee Barrett have contrived a dusty southwestern horse opera about a freewheeling gunslinger Joe Baker Dean Martin who rides around with cute doggie in a bag and 30year cavalry Colonel Morgan Brian Keith of The Deadly Companions on the verge of retirement. Baker Dean Martin of Five Card Stud plans to do 'something big' that requires the use of a Gatling gun. The man who can deliver a Gatling gun to Baker wants to be paid off with a woman. Johnny Cobb Albert Salmi of Lawman doesn't want to be paid off in money. Cobb's request drives poor Baker crazy because he cannot find a suitable woman for this quirky lug of a guy who lives with a bounty on his head and cannot set foot outside of his bailiwick. Meantime the first decent woman that Baker finds for Cobb turns out to be Mary Anna Morgan Honor Blackman of Shalako the wife of Colonel Morgan. Morgan leads a detachment from the fort to recover his wife. As it turns out Mary Anna has a soft spot for Baker and vouches for him to her stiff collared husband. He wants to confiscate the Gatling gun but Mary Anna informs him that he has been retired for two days. Baker appropriates the Gatling gun hightails it to Mexico and wipes out a bandit stronghold that belongs to the most notorious bandit Emilio Estevez Jos ngel Espinoza of Big Jake who supposedly has a cache of treasure in a mission. At the same time Baker is being stalked by Dover MacBride Carol White of A Prize of Gold a woman from Pittsburgh that he promised to marry.Something Big benefits from a seasoned cast of western veterans including familiar faces like Bob Steele Edward Faulkner Ben Johnson Denver Pyle Harry Carey Jr. and Paul Fix. The saving grace is that this horse opera looks like a western. This shouldn't be surprising when you consider that McLaglen had done five westerns with John Wayne. The real shooting doesn't start until the final reel but it is nothing like a profane bloodsplattered Sam Peckinpah western.

According to McLaglen the company that released Something Big went bankrupt and Something Big languished at the box office.

	onyx:emotionText "Andrew V. McLaglen's lackluster western comedy of errors Something Big amounts to nothing big. This hokum is about as bloodless as you can imagine and McLaglen and Undefeated scenarist James Lee Barrett have contrived a dusty southwestern horse opera about a freewheeling gunslinger Joe Baker Dean Martin who rides around with cute doggie in a bag and 30year cavalry Colonel Morgan Brian Keith of The Deadly Companions on the verge of retirement. Baker Dean Martin of Five Card Stud plans to do 'something big' that requires the use of a Gatling gun. The man who can deliver a Gatling gun to Baker wants to be paid off with a woman. Johnny Cobb Albert Salmi of Lawman doesn't want to be paid off in money. Cobb's request drives poor Baker crazy because he cannot find a suitable woman for this quirky lug of a guy who lives with a bounty on his head and cannot set foot outside of his bailiwick. Meantime the first decent woman that Baker finds for Cobb turns out to be Mary Anna Morgan Honor Blackman of Shalako the wife of Colonel Morgan. Morgan leads a detachment from the fort to recover his wife. As it turns out Mary Anna has a soft spot for Baker and vouches for him to her stiff collared husband. He wants to confiscate the Gatling gun but Mary Anna informs him that he has been retired for two days. Baker appropriates the Gatling gun hightails it to Mexico and wipes out a bandit stronghold that belongs to the most notorious bandit Emilio Estevez Jos ngel Espinoza of Big Jake who supposedly has a cache of treasure in a mission. At the same time Baker is being stalked by Dover MacBride Carol White of A Prize of Gold a woman from Pittsburgh that he promised to marry.Something Big benefits from a seasoned cast of western veterans including familiar faces like Bob Steele Edward Faulkner Ben Johnson Denver Pyle Harry Carey Jr. and Paul Fix. The saving grace is that this horse opera looks like a western. This shouldn't be surprising when you consider that McLaglen had done five westerns with John Wayne. The real shooting doesn't start until the final reel but it is nothing like a profane bloodsplattered Sam Peckinpah western. Everything before the big shootout at the end involves Baker planning his incursion against the dastardly Mexicans. Martin saunters through the role without a care in the world. You can tell when his stunt man is performing his riding chores. Sometimes we do get to see Dino riding hard across the terrain.

Music is by Marvin Hamlisch title song by Burt Bacharach and cinematography by Harry Stradling Junior. Dull as dishwater Something Big is the very definition of a star vehicle where the star sleepwalks for the paycheck. The plot for what it's worth has Martin as Joe Baker an ageing bandit wanting to do something big before retirement. He strikes a deal with Jonny Cobb Salmi to exchange a Gatling Gun for a woman you see Cobb just wants to get laid apparently. With Joe's fiance on her way to the Territory to make an honest man of him and Colonel Morgan Keith determined to stop Joe achieving his criminal ambition before he himself retires Joe has it all to do to do that something big. What follows in the one hour and forty five minute run time is well nothing of any note. There are a whole raft of characters in the mix and a dog but they never serve any purpose other than being dressage or to deliver some unfunny dialogue. The intention is to make Martin's lovable scallywag the axis for some mature daft shenanigans building to the big finale before everyone settles down in the sun and shouts hooray! But Martin isn't interested and McLaglen isn't clever enough to knit all the loose ends together. While the big finale consists of a five minute boring shootout that is essentially just Martin going around in a circle firing the Gatling Gun at bad guys we have not met seen or had time to be intrigued about. Some nice costumes cleavage and Technicolor photography stop it from total damnation but this is only recommended to easy going Western fans who simply have no other genre choices to pick from in their nuclear fall out shelter. 310".

While the previous few years had had the western genre shook up by the spaghetti westerns from Italy and violent American westerns like The Wild Bunch this particular western seems to come from a earlier time. It's an old fashioned kind of western. Nothing really wrong with that as long as the execution is done well. But sadly the movie is a big letdown. The main reason why it fails is that most of the movie is really boring. The little story there is moves at a snail's pace with abundant padding throughout. Things could have still been saved with an extra ingredient like action or comedy but the movie is a letdown in those areas as well. There is very little action up to the violent climax and the violence in the climax is not worth the wait. As for the comedy it is pretty lame with the only laugh being an unintentional one a character has the name Emilio Estevez. Small wonder that headline star Dean Martin seems alternately bored or somewhat bewildered with what is going on around him. By the way he's also offscreen for long periods of time which he was probably thankful for.".

It's an old fashioned kind of western. Nothing really wrong with that as long as the execution is done well. But sadly the movie is a big letdown. The main reason why it fails is that most of the movie is really boring. The little story there is moves at a snail's pace with abundant padding throughout. Things could have still been saved with an extra ingredient like action or comedy but the movie is a letdown in those areas as well. There is very little action up to the violent climax and the violence in the climax is not worth the wait. As for the comedy it is pretty lame with the only laugh being an unintentional one a character has the name Emilio Estevez. Small wonder that headline star Dean Martin seems alternately bored or somewhat bewildered with what is going on around him. By the way he's also offscreen for long periods of time which he was probably thankful for.";

Ben Johnson plays a scout while Carol White appears as the wannabe fianc of Baker. The title refers to 'something big' that Joe Baker is supposed to do before retiring from outlawry with several of the characters citing the line a quaint idea but it's not funny and gets old after a while. The opening act is a dud with nothing stimulating happening to draw the viewer into the story. There are several curious props a skeleton a dog bagpipes and a peg leg but they fail to stir much interest. Things finally perk up in the second half but not enough to save the movie. One huge problem is the idea that this antihero we're supposed to like is engaged in something way too unsavory kidnaping the innocent wife to offer to the odious gunrunner which amounts to slavery. Martin was able to get away with this type of character in the excellent Bandolero! 1968 because his crimes weren't so abhorrent not so here.There are some good bits however like the two manhungry women living in the remote wilderness Joyce Van Patten  Judi Meredith. Nevertheless it's obvious why Something Big has been condemned to cinematic obscurity never being released to VHS and barely making it to DVD in 2012. THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 48 minutes and was shot in Durango Mexico. WRITER James Lee Barrett. GRADE C".

It's not a great film but it is a decent Western and better than I remembered it being...perhaps because I sometimes confuse it with another of Dean's films from that era  Texas Across The River.Perhaps it's my age that has led to a great appreciation of this film. When it came out I was a 22 year old fan of Dean's. Now seeing it again I'm a 63 year old fan of Dean's. And Dean is...well cool in this movie. But the appreciation comes with the story  the realization as one gets older that if he never has done something big fortunately I have then there may be that desire to do something big before one dies. And Dean plays it pretty well here. He's the right age and has the right attitude. And before I forget to mention it does most of his own horse riding in it Dean actually owned show horses and was quite good. That's not to say that Dean's character is totally likable  after all he is kidnapping a woman to trade her for a Gatling gun! Although they keep it in bounds by Dean's realization that what he's doing is bothering his conscience.I've never been much of a fan of Brain Keith but he does fine as the army colonel who wants to know what Dean is going to do that is something big only to find out that part of it is kidnapping his Keith's wife! Honor Blackman played her part as Brian Keith's wife quite well here...she gave it he gravitas needed. Ben Johnson was fun as the Army scout. Albert Salmi appropriately disgusting as a dirty character desperately in need of a woman. Joyce Van Patten good as a manhungry woman. Denver Pyle is a totally meaningless role why did he even take it? And Harry Carey Jr as a peglegged cowboy was entertaining.Very watchable and a bit tongue in cheek.".

This is Jess Franco's attempt at the genre and he almost pulls it off. If it weren't for some lapses in action and logic this one would have been very good. But far too often nothing much of interest is going on. In a typical James Bond movie there are many instances where the action stops to further the plot. In The Girl from Rio these stops in the action do nothing to advance the story. They are just there.Franco probably had one of the bigger name casts in The Girl from Rio that he ever worked with. Shirley Eaton from Goldfinger is the villainous Sumuru. George Sanders who I always get a kick out of watching is very funny as the equally villainous Sir Masius. The biggest problem with the casting is Richard Wyler as the films hero. He's not interesting enough to carry the part.Having watched a few Franco movies over the past few years The Girl from Rio is decidedly tame. While the movie has its moments the usual Franco sleaze is not evident. Too bad  it might have made some of the nonaction moments more tolerable.".

	schema:reviewBody "As I live in Rio de Janeiro I was curious to see this film. The other reason I picked up this film was that it was directed by Jess Franco I had already seen Vampyros Lesbos She killed in ecstasy and Sadomania. These films are what I would call porn trash  they tell stories that offer us luscious images of female flesh lesbianism mild violence and really entertain us. Vampyros Lesbos in particular is a psychedelic sound and visual trip featuring the gorgeous Soledad Miranda present also in She killed in ecstasy. Jess Franco has a sophisticated visual style of his own.But The Girl from Riocalled also The Seven Secrets of Sumuru is absolutely amateurish. It tells no story at all. Its plot is a mixture of sciencefiction spythriller and soft porn trash. There is the detective a mixture of James Bond and Flint the main character? always wearing flashy suits and carrying a suitcase containing 10 million dollars there are the girls from Femina a city located somewhere near Rio that intend to conquer the world and enslave the men and there is a gang run by George Sanders. The 10 million dollars is what they are all fighting for. There are of course lots of girls.Many fights so badly done that people fall before they are hit. Femina was filmed inside and around the Museu de Arte Moderna in Rio. The gang run by George Sanders is composed by 5 people! There's a scene in which they run after the hero? wearing fantasy masks and after a ridiculous fist fight he knocks them out and runs away. Incredible! Not to mention the apocalyptic final battle among the hero the female warriors of Femina and the Gang of Five.The Girl from Rio belongs to the category so bad that it's good. I had my fun all right! By todays standards this film can't even be considered porn and the violence is mild.If you see this film do it the same way you would watch an Ed Wood movie and you'll have your fun. This film was made in such an easygoing way that if you let yourself flow with it you will have a smile on your face when it ends.".

All the right ingredients are wellpresented yet this is a surprisingly weak and unsatisfying adventure movie. The plot is rich on imagination but seemingly only on paper as the action is quite tame. The film is also very colorful...but not too bright and especially shocking was the total lack of vicious sex. There's a bit of nudity sure but too few according to normal Franco standards. All the characters are sick in the head so the least I expected or hoped for were more perverted undertones or frenzied themes. Franco obviously had a bigger budget as usual to work with and I must say he spends that money well on more convincing set pieces and talented cast members. Particularly the veteran actor George Sanders Village of the Damned Psychomania is one of the best players ever to appear in a Franco production. Too bad even he can't save The Girl from Rio from being a huge letdown. A legendary Eurosmut filmmaker like Jess Franco could and should have done more with this concept. Shame shame shame...".

Die Sieben Mnner der Sumuru is another crazy exploitation with free nudity of beautiful women by Jess Franco the true successor of Ed Wood regarding bad movies including his muse Maria Rohm. The acting plot fight choreography and dialogs are ridiculous mixing a senseless spy movie with a sort of lowbudget scifi from the 50's. Most of the situations are laughable and ridiculous but a criminal driving a discreet hearse is something that even Ed Wood had never imagined. It is sad only to see George Sanders from All about Eve working in a film like that. For a carioca native of Rio de Janeiro it is hilarious to see our Modern Art Museum transformed in the Femina or Sumuru a.k.a. Sumitra called Samantha in the Brazilian version released by Continental Distributor in the Trash Collection. The good points are the footages of the carnival in Rio de Janeiro and the external takes of the Wonderful City in the late 60's. My vote is three.Title Brazil A Garota do Rio The Girl from Rio".

Yes this does take place in Brazil we must give it that. Sumuru or Sumitra as she's also referred to is like an evil version of Modesty Blaise played here by actress Eaton with that familiar coy smile which most of us first became acquainted with in Goldfinger. There are numerous closeup shots of her staring off camera slowly opening her mouth probably while watching something unpleasant however she is doubled in her key lesbian scene. She controls an entire army of female warriors colorfully costumed and rules a city called Femina or something just outside Rio de Janeiro?. These concepts which previously appeared in The Million Eyes of Sumuru sound terrific but despite some intriguing set design  visuals it follows the same campy atmosphere of for example the very dated Some Girls Do which came out around the same time and which also featured a female army. At first glance the sight of all these armed females usually lined up in a row catches one's interest but after 15 minutes or so you realize there's nothing else there beyond just setting up the visual.The plot follows what seems like a secret agent a male arriving in Brazil with 10 million dollars. He catches the attention of the local crime lord Sanders hamming it up as an elderly Bondtype villain who sends darksuited thugs in bowler hats to accost him. This sets everything up for a 3way conflict between the agent the crime lord and the mysterious Sumuru the crime lord wants Sumuru's secrets. Sumuru also keeps various prisoners in glass cages  maybe that's one of the secrets. This sounds exciting but there are problems which go beyond just a slow pace there are many shots which could have used a lot of tightening one shot of an arriving airplane for example stays on the craft as it settles to a near stop as if this had never been captured on film before. There's a similar approach to a typical sunset as if there's something unusual about it. The fight scenes are very substandard as if the filmmakers had to use the first takes. To add some production value there's a scene of the real Rio carnival about midway through. I'm guessing there were various budget problems especially evident in the climactic battle where fake sound effects and smoke cover up a lot of bogus action such as the lack of even reallooking guns  it calls to mind those times when kids use plastic guns and pretend bullets are being fired falling over unconvincingly. There are touches of sadism such as torturing a character to get answers and female nudity an early depiction of such after some restrictions were lifted. But mostly you'll be rolling your eyes.

	schema:reviewBody "Girl from Rio The 1969 out of 4 Coming from the same era as his FuManchu pictures this European spycaper comes from Jess Franco and actually is fairly decent as long as you don't expect too much from it. In the film which is basically a takeoff on Mario Bava's DANGER DIABOLIK former Bond girl Shirley Eaton plays Sumitra the leader of a female gang who plan on taking over the world by turning all the men into their slaves. The girl gang must try and fight a couple evil men one played by George Sanders who plan to try and stop them. There's no question that this isn't a very good film but at the same time it's actually better than you might expect it to be. The biggest problem is with the screenplay that really doesn't offer up anything overly original or entertaining as the film's pacing is always at a stopgo motion that ends up killing the film. We get a lot of funky visuals as there's no question this is one of those psychedelic pictures that I'm sure many potheads might enjoy. You've got a pretty good soundtrack some decent cinematography and it's good to see some familiar names showing up. Sanders was certainly slumping at this point of his career but he manages to be mildly entertaining here. Eaton also manages to turn in a decent performance and it really does appear as she's into everything going on and having a good time playing pretty much a female James Bond. She's certainly chomping away at the dialogue and appears to be having a blast. I think those unfamiliar with the work of Jess Franco might find themselves enjoying this because they're not really sure what they would normally be seeing from the director. Franco worked a few films into this genre but I'm personally not a fan of any of them so in the end this is a decent effort but there's just not enough soul here for me. I prefer his 70s output which featured more bizarre and poetic films.".

We get a lot of funky visuals as there's no question this is one of those psychedelic pictures that I'm sure many potheads might enjoy. You've got a pretty good soundtrack some decent cinematography and it's good to see some familiar names showing up. Sanders was certainly slumping at this point of his career but he manages to be mildly entertaining here. Eaton also manages to turn in a decent performance and it really does appear as she's into everything going on and having a good time playing pretty much a female James Bond. She's certainly chomping away at the dialogue and appears to be having a blast. I think those unfamiliar with the work of Jess Franco might find themselves enjoying this because they're not really sure what they would normally be seeing from the director. Franco worked a few films into this genre but I'm personally not a fan of any of them so in the end this is a decent effort but there's just not enough soul here for me. I prefer his 70s output which featured more bizarre and poetic films.";

Wyler is rather insipid but Maria Rohm Marta Reves Elisa Montes and Beni Cardoso are all enticing as the various women with which he interacts. Herbert Fleischmann is fine as a dapper henchman named Carl. But other than Eaton it's Sanders who's the most fun. He plays an antagonist who doodles on a tablecloth when bored and who doesn't seem to have much of a stomach for violence. He turns away when his underlings are roughing people up.Not exactly one of Francos' best but it's all fairly pleasant to watch anyway. Those who favour his output of the 1970s will note that it's not as sleazy as some of those films. All in all it's decent cheesy espionage fare.Six out of 10.".

	schema:headline " Welcome to Rio the jewel of South America where you're always sure to find a friend.";
	schema:reviewBody "I wonder if director Jess Franco and screenwriter Harry Alan Towers thought they were making the next James Bond with FUTURE WOMEN. It's certainly got the feel of a halfbaked 007 film but it's missing the charm class and skill. Unfortunately the version I watched was a poor VHS transfer and the audio wasn't always the most clear but I think I got enough to know what's going on. Jeffrey Sutton Richard Wyler is some guy who happens to have 10 million and he's brought it to Rio de Janeiro. As soon as he arrives he's on the radar of local crime boss Masius George Sanders who releases his goon squad to bring in the cash. Fleeing from Masius's men Sutton boards the wrong plane and becomes the unwilling guest of Sumitra Shirley Eaton on her allfemale island nation of Femina. Sumitra has brought him out to steal his 10 million and contribute it toward her war effort against the rest of the world but surprise he doesn't have it. Sutton was weaseling his way out to Femina from the start with false promises of big money so he could locate the missing Ulla Marta Reves and bring her home. But it won't be that easy. Sumitra and the nation of Femina are not fond of men and none has ever escaped alive. And if he manages that he's still got Masius waiting to snatch him on the mainland. It's a mission fraught with danger smoke machines and gratuitous nudity.I suppose Sutton is our main character even if we know absolutely nothing about him where he comes from who he is or until more than halfway through the movie what his goal is. He's a dull character embodying the smooth ladies man persona of 007 but he's got no personality to go with it. He never reacts to danger with anything but a crappy line and a punch that never connects because fight choreography wasn't in the budget. No sense of danger means no suspense so no one cares what happens. We don't meet Ulla until the halfway point so we don't even care whether she escapes or not and once again we're not even sure where she's escaping to or who she is. You seeing a pattern? As the audience we don't even have our bearings until 45 minutes into this 80 minute movie. I wasn't even paying full attention until about 10 minutes in when Sutton is strolling through Rio with his date and comes upon the craziest looking dude wearing a black mask black hat and frizzy red wig. Sutton never reacts he just offers his lighter to light the masked man's cigarette. Of course this absurd masked man turns out to be one of Masius's masked goons and it becomes a fun foot chase where Sutton is judo choppin' goons into submission. This movie loves its judo chops almost as much as its smoke machines. I don't know where Sutton received his training but I'm assuming it's the same as Austin Powers.But this movie is called FUTURE WOMEN among other things. How are the future women? Hilarious. They're scantilyclad with capes and generally armed with assault rifles. They practice firing machine guns at each other in a courtyard. The entire nation of Femina might as well be a single enormous empty building because it's all we ever see of it. Large empty spaces with rows of women. If you find yourself a prisoner of Sumitra you'll be imprisoned in giant plastic honeycomb cells with more smoke machines these ones keep you too weak to escape. Sumitra is played by Shirley Eaton who was famously painted gold for the iconic scene in GOLDFINGER. Now she's got a gold stash of her own. Sumitra's got a little stack of gold that she's stolen from previous visitors and she's very proud of it having boobytrapped it to detonate the entire freakin' island if a man were to attempt to steal it. I'm sure that won't come into play at some point. Interesting point I discovered in reading into the background of this movie Sumitra is based on the character of Sumuru from English author Sax Rohmer. Sax Rohmer's other famous creation the legendary racial caricature Fu Manchu. When Fu Manchu controversy became a little too hot a topic Rohmer created Sumuru as a new criminal mastermind.

	onyx:emotionText "I wonder if director Jess Franco and screenwriter Harry Alan Towers thought they were making the next James Bond with FUTURE WOMEN. It's certainly got the feel of a halfbaked 007 film but it's missing the charm class and skill. Unfortunately the version I watched was a poor VHS transfer and the audio wasn't always the most clear but I think I got enough to know what's going on. Jeffrey Sutton Richard Wyler is some guy who happens to have 10 million and he's brought it to Rio de Janeiro. As soon as he arrives he's on the radar of local crime boss Masius George Sanders who releases his goon squad to bring in the cash. Fleeing from Masius's men Sutton boards the wrong plane and becomes the unwilling guest of Sumitra Shirley Eaton on her allfemale island nation of Femina. Sumitra has brought him out to steal his 10 million and contribute it toward her war effort against the rest of the world but surprise he doesn't have it. Sutton was weaseling his way out to Femina from the start with false promises of big money so he could locate the missing Ulla Marta Reves and bring her home. But it won't be that easy. Sumitra and the nation of Femina are not fond of men and none has ever escaped alive. And if he manages that he's still got Masius waiting to snatch him on the mainland. It's a mission fraught with danger smoke machines and gratuitous nudity.I suppose Sutton is our main character even if we know absolutely nothing about him where he comes from who he is or until more than halfway through the movie what his goal is. He's a dull character embodying the smooth ladies man persona of 007 but he's got no personality to go with it. He never reacts to danger with anything but a crappy line and a punch that never connects because fight choreography wasn't in the budget. No sense of danger means no suspense so no one cares what happens. We don't meet Ulla until the halfway point so we don't even care whether she escapes or not and once again we're not even sure where she's escaping to or who she is. You seeing a pattern? As the audience we don't even have our bearings until 45 minutes into this 80 minute movie. I wasn't even paying full attention until about 10 minutes in when Sutton is strolling through Rio with his date and comes upon the craziest looking dude wearing a black mask black hat and frizzy red wig. Sutton never reacts he just offers his lighter to light the masked man's cigarette. Of course this absurd masked man turns out to be one of Masius's masked goons and it becomes a fun foot chase where Sutton is judo choppin' goons into submission. This movie loves its judo chops almost as much as its smoke machines. I don't know where Sutton received his training but I'm assuming it's the same as Austin Powers.But this movie is called FUTURE WOMEN among other things. How are the future women? Hilarious. They're scantilyclad with capes and generally armed with assault rifles. They practice firing machine guns at each other in a courtyard. The entire nation of Femina might as well be a single enormous empty building because it's all we ever see of it. Large empty spaces with rows of women. If you find yourself a prisoner of Sumitra you'll be imprisoned in giant plastic honeycomb cells with more smoke machines these ones keep you too weak to escape. Sumitra is played by Shirley Eaton who was famously painted gold for the iconic scene in GOLDFINGER. Now she's got a gold stash of her own. Sumitra's got a little stack of gold that she's stolen from previous visitors and she's very proud of it having boobytrapped it to detonate the entire freakin' island if a man were to attempt to steal it. I'm sure that won't come into play at some point. Interesting point I discovered in reading into the background of this movie Sumitra is based on the character of Sumuru from English author Sax Rohmer. Sax Rohmer's other famous creation the legendary racial caricature Fu Manchu. When Fu Manchu controversy became a little too hot a topic Rohmer created Sumuru as a new criminal mastermind. None of that seems to translate in FUTURE WOMEN but it's interesting to think this could've turned into a series of movies celebrating the evil SumuruSumitra. That could've been fun if they knew how to write movies. Instead we'll always have FUTURE WOMEN to remind us what could've been uninteresting secret agent types doing battle with scantilyclad women in smoky warehouses.FUN FACT George Sanders was Mister Freeze in a twoepisode arc of the 60's Batman TV series.

The Girl from Rio is a tacky late 60's spyadventure that combines elements of That Man from Rio 1964 Franco's Kiss Me Monster 1969 Invasion of the Bee Girls 1973 and Bond flicks of the same period albeit without the budget and compelling script. If you have a taste for those types of movies you'll probably enjoy Rio. Like Kiss Me and Invasion there's a lot of filler and the corresponding tedious sequences. A full 35 minutes of the runtime could've and should've been cut to make the movie more enthralling but then it wouldn't be feature length which is why filmmakers add dull filler material. What makes a movie like this worthwhile is the late 60's chic the outlandish spy rudiments and the babes. Eaton the goldpainted girl from Goldfinger 1965 leads the way on the latter front with capable assist from Marta Reves Ulla Beni Cardoso Yana Elisa Monts Irene and Maria Rohm Lesley. In an interview Eaton said she wept on the plane home from Rio because filmmaking was so exhausting and she desperately wanted to be with her husband  children. It was understandably her last film.

The woman were portrayed as humans who had reacted as humans would to their situation not as women who only reacted that way because they were female and thus were somehow lesser than men.Sumuru is a low budget film that doesn't try to pretend it is anything else. They don't attract attention to that fact by attempting a lot of fancy special effects they couldn't afford to do right.  There is just a tiny bit of cheesy but fun CGI otherwise everything looks lived in and like it could actually exist.  Sumuru also does not make the mistake of sinking into selfmockery but instead has humor sincerity and commitment in the performances of it's actors.This is especially true of Michael Shanks who proves himself a more than capable leading man and raised the performances of everyone around him. They all just seemed to act better in scenes with him. I was very pleasantly suprised. His performance showed a deft touch that was both light and sincere.  As the lead a lot rested on his shoulders and he set just the right tone.   Great comic timing but esp. effective and convincing in the quieter more emotional scenes.  His Adam Wade was sympathetic handsome despite the odd facial hair and masculine but without any of the silly macho posturing typical of such roles. Here's to hoping he gets more opportunities to display his versatility in higher class films that will earn him more notice in the industry.Alexandra Kamp as Sumuru though clothed in costumes that could not have been comfortable in such terrain came across as very regal but also approachable.  Her Sumuru was curious and intelligent with the courage of her convictions but was not so stuck her ways she refused to see past them if they would harm her people.  She's not the actor her leading man is but she portrayed her character's story arc quite effectively.  Sumuru is very likeable Queen.Another good performance was Terence Bridgett as Jake Adam's friend and partner in this venture. I'd be love to see prequel about his and Adam's past adventures.  He also had some rather odd hairstyling but he was funny and a good foil for Adam.  He and the young boy Will developed a nice rapport as did Will and his older sister Dove.  The actress who played Dove was pretty and also has a very good fight scene near the beginning of the film.The villainess Taxan played by Simona Levin is played over the top but it very much fits the role.  She chews the scenery entertainingly and seems to hiss her lines out in a manner fitting for her role.If someone is looking for lighthearted but earnest bmovie entertainmentthis is a good film in that vein.".

Okay the 'hardly there' outfit the Snake Goddess was wearing was pretty cringeworthy.";

I wasn't sure about the female lead but I suspect it was a difficult one to play the bad guy was well done...its easier to play a baddie in scifi because you can ham it up and this one does. In fact there are times when there is a lot of hamming from all directions which makes the film amusing..I think this is the intention. The film doesn't take itself too seriously as a result which is what makes it so entertaining. Plus there were actually some plot twists and turns which is nice is a scifi movie.

The soundtrack is of similar quality.I can only assume that the few overlycharitable positive reviews this movie has received are from blinkered Michael Shanks fans who will give a thumbs up to anything he's involved in.

	schema:reviewBody "Okay so a movie about twins and the main lead is none other than Mr Dilip Kumar. Ram Aur Shyam is a Dilip Kumar vehicle all the way and even the opening credits say Dilip Kumar in his first dual role as if it was an event of sorts. But while you expect something particular from the film it turns out to be different. First it is not a complete comedy of errors. Actually there's more drama in this one than comedy. Towards the end it even gets a dark tone which I personally did not predict and did not like at all. The comedy does work from time to time and it's nice to see the turns even though everything is predictable. Ram Aur Shyam is not the only movie of its sort and many such movies were made later like Seeta Aur Geeta. Which brings me to the next point and it is the fact that today while watching all these twin movies comparisons are inevitable. Clearly the best one of the lot is Seeta Aur Geeta an alltime great comedy which had the verve the light and lively comic mood the music and the excellence that Ram Aur Shyam lacks. Even Hema Malini's unforgettable performance remains unmatched. Where acting goes well as said this movie was made for Dilip Kumar and he does well but it is far from being his best. He is excellent as Shyam but overdoes the cowardice and the shy nature of Ram. The girls do very well even if one expects to see them disappearing under his shadow. Waheeda Rehman plays Anjana with grace and conviction while Mumtaz is wonderful as the streetsmart Shanta. The supporting cast do well. The music is very ordinary and forgettable. Ram Aur Shyam is not a bad film and it has its moments of comedy and great fun but they are limited and I would rather go and watch Seeta Aur Geeta instead.".

	schema:headline " A laughterbonanza from the Tragedy King";
	schema:reviewBody "Though Dilip Kumar was labelled as the Tragedy King of Hindi cinema he was quite skilled in comedy too. Today I am reviewing a movie which is a showcase of his comic talent. It's a classic movie which became a pioneer for twinsbased stories in Hindi cinema later. This movie is Ram Aur Shyam 1967 which features Dilip Kumar in contrasting twin roles  one is a weak coward and submissive person whereas the other one the twin is a daredevil and smart person. It's the latter which provided Dilip Kumar an opportunity to make the audience laugh and he did it with such finesse that till date his performance in this role is quoted as a classic comic performance.Ram Aur Shyam is the story of twins who got separated in their childhood and brought up in utterly different environments leading to development of completely opposite personalities of them. Ram Dilip Kumar grows up in a rich household which remains under the tyranny of Gajendra Pran whereas Shyam Dilip Kumar in double role grows up in a village with the affection of Ganga Mausi Leela Mishra and the childhood teasings of Shaanta Mumtaaz. For Ram also the love of his affectionate sisterinlaw  Sulakshana Nirupa Roy and niece  Kuku Baby Farida is there but they are helpless before Gajendra. Gajendra is greedy too and he decides to marry Ram to Anjana Waheeda Rehman who is the daughter of a wealthy man Nazir Hussain for the sake of getting a hefty dowry. Now comes the principle twist in the tale which forms the backbone of the story.Destiny takes Ram to the house of Shyam and viceversa. Now Ram who has always been getting bashed and humiliated by Gajendra gets warmth love and respect too. Shaanta finds his 'Shyam' to have changed into a shy and submissive person and instead of teasing him as she has always done to the real Shyam she starts loving him. On the other side Shyam enters the house of Gajendra as Ram and his daredevil activities prove to be a pleasant surprise for Sulakshana Kuku and the servants of the house and on the other hand a nightmare for Gajendra whom he bashes like anything. He happens to meet Anjana and her parents and falls in love. Anjana also starts loving him and she is quite happy to be the fiance of 'Ram'. The reality comes before everyone in the climax and the fact of Ram and Shyam being twins is also known to render a happy ending to the movie.Ram Aur Shyam was a pioneer movie in Bollywood because it paved the way for followups like Seeta Aur Geeta 1972 starring Hema Malini in lead role Jaise Ko Taisa 1973 starring Jeetendra in lead role Chaalbaaz 1989 starring Sridevi in lead role etc. the stuff being the same i.e. twins separated in childhood and nurtured in entirely different environments to grow up into entirely opposite kind of individuals. However the comedy Dilip Kumar did as Shyam in Ram Aur Shyam could not be repeated by anybody may it be Hema Malini or Jeeendra or Sridevi. Ram Aur Shyam can be watched any number of times to watch the brilliant comedy presented by the actor who is contradictorily known as the Tragedy King of Indian cinema.Dilip Kumar is the heart and soul of this movie and he has done well in the submissive role of Ram too. Both the leading ladies alongwith the supporting characters have also done satisfactorily. Nirupa Roy as the sisterinlaw of Ram and Baby Farida as her daughter and Ram's niece deserve special mention. Other than Dilip Kumar if someone has made his presence prominently felt in this movie it's none other than the most dreaded and notirious baddie of Bollywood cinema  Pran.Naushad has composed great music for this movie with the beautiful lyrics coming from the pen of Shakeel Badayuni. Two songs are immortal  Aaj Ki Raat Mere Dil Ki Salaami Le Le Rafi and Aayi Hain Bahaaren Mitay ZulmoSitam Rafi Lata and chorus. Other songs  O Baalam Tere Pyar Ki Thandi Aag Mein Jalte Jalte RafiAsha Iss Nagari Ki Reet Hai Ulti AshaMahendra Kapoor Aaj Sakhi Ri More Piya Ghar Aaye Asha and chorus Maine Kab Tumse Kaha Tha Ki Mujhe Pyar Karo Lata Main Hoon Saaki Tu Hai Sharaabi Sharaabi Lata etc. are also good to listen and to watch as well. Choreography in Aayi Hain Bahaaren Mitay ZulmoSitam is just outstanding and it's a treat to watch this song on the screen.Technical and production value aspects of the movie are all in order. The length of the movie is nowhere felt while watching because the complete movie is very interesting from beginning to end and at no place even an ounce of boredom has been allowed to creep in.All in all Ram Aur Shyam is a highly entertaining movie which should not be missed by either the fans of Dilip Kumar or the movie buffs in general. Those who have seen its remakes like Seeta Aur Geeta Jaise Ko Taisa or Chaalbaaz should also watch it for getting a different kind of entertainment rendered by the Tragedy King's comic timing.".

	schema:headline " A lively comedy which enthralls your heart !";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie speaks for itself  why Dilip Kumar is a living legend . A true blue tragic hero of all the times  capable of portraying an intense romantic hero as well  like in Madhumati  Dilip has given a performance of his life time  in a double role  with such intricate and subtle shades  as if two different actors are playing the lead roles.Dilip proved to be a role model for all the actors like Amitabh  Shah Rukh  and Manoj Kumar who studied religiously the style  the mannerisms  body language  and his soft dialog delivery  as well as avoiding loud acting  underplaying the character . Yet  one can say without reservations  or being unfair to others  that Dilip was original  and though critics some times expressed their unhappiness over his mumbling  subdued style of delivering dialogs  in Ram and Shyam  he is exuberant  vibrant  and mischievous  funny  all rolled in one  while in the opposite role  he is extremely shy  nervous  and fearful  traits which Dilip has shown remarkably well . Vaheeda is good in a rich daughter's role  and has shown a good chemistry with her leading man Though the plot line and the obvious dark and white shades are typical of that age of cinema  Pran terrorizes  and fits the bill of a staunch villain.It's the deft handling of some hilarious scenes by the director  like the one when the crafty fellow eats heartily in a city restaurant and walks away coolly without paying the bill  and the meek fellow gets thrashing as well as deprived of his jacket  because of mistaken identity !Compared to his contemporaries like Dev Anand and Raj  Dilip was not a very good looking hero  in the classical or the traditional standards of handsome or chocolate hero persona  but his tremendous screen presence  and cultivated naturalness  weigh more than just the looks . Many movies with double roles have followed  but Ram and Shyam will always remain quite unique  a milestone  and a hearty  breezy comedy  with all the necessary ingredients of a block buster in good measures  specially the music score  with memorable numbers  even today  like the birthday song  and the duet of Dilip and Vaheeda  Main Huin Saaki  Tu Hain Sharabi  Sharabi amongst others. A timeless product  which would never go stale .".

A true blue tragic hero of all the times  capable of portraying an intense romantic hero as well  like in Madhumati  Dilip has given a performance of his life time  in a double role  with such intricate and subtle shades  as if two different actors are playing the lead roles.Dilip proved to be a role model for all the actors like Amitabh  Shah Rukh  and Manoj Kumar who studied religiously the style  the mannerisms  body language  and his soft dialog delivery  as well as avoiding loud acting  underplaying the character . Yet  one can say without reservations  or being unfair to others  that Dilip was original  and though critics some times expressed their unhappiness over his mumbling  subdued style of delivering dialogs  in Ram and Shyam  he is exuberant  vibrant  and mischievous  funny  all rolled in one  while in the opposite role  he is extremely shy  nervous  and fearful  traits which Dilip has shown remarkably well . Vaheeda is good in a rich daughter's role  and has shown a good chemistry with her leading man Though the plot line and the obvious dark and white shades are typical of that age of cinema  Pran terrorizes  and fits the bill of a staunch villain.It's the deft handling of some hilarious scenes by the director  like the one when the crafty fellow eats heartily in a city restaurant and walks away coolly without paying the bill  and the meek fellow gets thrashing as well as deprived of his jacket  because of mistaken identity !Compared to his contemporaries like Dev Anand and Raj  Dilip was not a very good looking hero  in the classical or the traditional standards of handsome or chocolate hero persona  but his tremendous screen presence  and cultivated naturalness  weigh more than just the looks . Many movies with double roles have followed  but Ram and Shyam will always remain quite unique  a milestone  and a hearty  breezy comedy  with all the necessary ingredients of a block buster in good measures  specially the music score  with memorable numbers  even today  like the birthday song  and the duet of Dilip and Vaheeda  Main Huin Saaki  Tu Hain Sharabi  Sharabi amongst others. A timeless product  which would never go stale .";

It also provided interesting and accurate source material for anyone studying the art of the period and I use my offair video of it to bring the life of this wonderful and underrated artist to my students. It was a warm tribute to a man who was full of vigour even in old age but did not overromanticise him showing us the flaws in his character as well as his innate humanity. The film worked well as drama using good cinematic technique to underpin the story of an exciting and unusual life in a pivotal period of Western history.  It also used the fantastic aspects of Goya's imagination to underline the paradoxes of his life. This is a typical European art house movie of a type rarely made in the US or Britain but nonspecialist film watchers should not feel alienated by that. It is intelligent witty elegant superbly acted Paco Rabal in one of his last films is terrific  he was Goya to the inch beautifully crafted intense and dramatic.

	schema:reviewBody "The patterning motif of 'Goya in Bordeaux' is the spiral which Goya claims is like life.  So this is not the linear historical biography of the artist we have come to expect from Hollywood moving inexorably from birth through success and failure to death.  In its circular motion its conflating time history imagination art fantasy and dream the film 'Goya' most resembles is Ruiz's astonishing Proust adaptation 'Time Regained'. Here the story progresses through the labyrinth of an artist's mind where the narrative proceeds from a chance memory or incident rather than chronological order.  History is monumental written in stone immovable  'Goya' on the other hand emphasises fluidity instability and fragility  the status of any particular scene is always in doubt such is the complex nature of Saura's narration.  The film appears to begins with a dream  an old man wakes up in a foreign land he does not know where he is he walks down strange streets bewildered by the foreign language and customs having wandered down the obligatary white corridor before catching a vision of an old dead love.  The next scene where a lover and friend bemoan his tendency in his illness to peregrinate suggests that it wasn't a dream. This ambiguity continues throughout.  After all the narrative concerns a dying man whose life flashes before him memories flooding back of critical biographical moments in the artist's life  his work at Court his affair with the Duchess of Alba his exile in France for liberal sympathies  but these are never merely historical but revealing of Goya's aesthetic as it developed theoretically and in practice.  The biographical emphasis seems justified in that this development is linked to increasing misanthropy terror fear of madness and senility.  One of his fears is of being in unrestrained imagination and some of his later horrifyingly dark works are a far cry from the dutiful Court pictures even if these burst with a barely contained passion.  Goya's development  from patronage to exiled selfexpression  marks a crucial development in Western art towards the Romantic the solipsistic. Goya lived in times of tyranny barbarity slaughter revolution but history is always filtered through his lurid sensibility as if with Goya came the pessimistic idea that there is no such thing as objective reality. Saura borrows many devices from Ruiz  the shifting miseenscene that flows through time and space including the aging artist in a dark room watching a gloriously sunny aristocratic garden party decades earlier or the device of the artists' various selves existing in the same frame.  This sense of a personal history as opposed to a chronological one is emphasised in the flimsiness of the miseenscene a literal creation of light and screens. Comparing Saura to Ruiz however is like comparing Arnold Bennett to Virginia Woolf.  Saura is simply too heavyhanded to achieve the temporal fleetfootedness necessary.  His ideas are frequently literal or banal his need to transpose everything as dance climaxes in a  massacre ballet of obscene bathos.  Whereas Ruiz sublimely caught the Proustian rush Saura cannot hope to reach the visual disturbance and energy of Goya and contents himself with defacing his work blood spilling from paintings etc.  Where Proust's end was a beginning the decision to write the book he was actually finishing Saura weighs himself down with portentousness where Proust's ideas were grounded in a compelling plot of war and social comedy Saura gets lost in everdecreasing circles.  I'm sure there's a resonant comparison being made between Goya and Saura himself especially in the speech of regret preceding the massacre  both men liberals serving totalitarian regimes.  Again as with 'Tango' the film's main interest is its exquisite score.".

It is is an emotive biography 17461828 involving 1819th century famed Spanish painter named Francisco De Goya Lucientes Francisco Rabal and as young played by Jose Coronado and famous model Maribel Verdu for the famed painting . It's a slow vision of Saragossan painter Francisco Goya Lucientes' last days in Burdeos  ill and deaf  as he wanders through the streets and remembers the citizens uprising against Napoleon troops . It portrays his relationship with historic personages as Duchess of Alba Verdu  Moratin Joaquin Climent  Bayeu and the scheming favorite Godoy Jose Maria Pou. As Goya observes and reminds events dances  parties  inquisition  French invasion that inspired his work  as his reveries become tableaux of his paintings . As the highlights of the movie result to be when are brought to life scenes of known paintings as Disasters of war Saturn devouring his sons portrayal of Carlos IV family Los Caprichos  Black paintings  and lithographs  among others . Two of Goya 's best known paintings are The Nude Maja and The Clothed Maja . They depict the same woman in the same pose naked and clothed respectively. Without a pretense to allegorical or mythological meaning the painting was the first totally profane lifesize female nude in Western art . The identity of the Majas are uncertain. The most popularly cited models are the Duchess of Alba  with whom Goya was sometimes thought to have had an affair and Pepita Tud mistress of Manuel Godoy Godoy subsequently owned them .This is a costumer based on facts but predominates the slowmoving drama full of flashbacks with surrealist images  nightmarish scenes and colorful setpieces . The picture relies heavily on relationship between Goya  his wife Leocadia played by Eulalia Ramon real life spouse to Saura  his daughter performed by Dafne Fernandez and Duchess of Alba acted by Maribel Verdu . Glamorously and sumptuously photographed by Vittorio Storaro  Bernardo Bertolucci's usual . Lavishly produced by Andres Vicente Gomez  the gowns are extravagantly magnificent luxury rooms and paintings pass by in front of your eyes and spectacular though theatrical production design . The sets are superb at least as good as any other period piece films directed by Saura  furthermore great intervention by the group Furia Del Baus who carries out rousing choreography . Emotive and evocative musical score by Roque Baos. The motion picture is well directed by Carlos Saura  a good Spanish movies director. He began working in cinema in 1959 when he filmed Los Golfos 1962 also dealing with juvenile delinquency . Saura is a well recognized filmmaker both nationally and internationally and in proof of it he won many prizes among which there are the following ones Silver Bear in the Berlin Festival for  La Caza or The Chase 1966 his most successful film  and for Peppermint Frapp 1967 in 1967. Special Jury Awards in Cannes for La Prima Anglica 1974 in 1973 and for Cra Cuervos 1976 in 1975. Also the film Mam Cumple Cien Aos 1979 got an Oscar nomination in 1979 as the best foreign film and it also won the Special Jury Award at the San Sebastian Festival. In 1990 he won two Goya  The Spanish Oscar  as best adapted screenplay writer and best director. Saura became an expert on Iberian musical adaptations as Carmen  Amor Brujo  Bodas De Sangre  Sevillanas Iberia  Salome Fado Flamenco  and even recently Opera as Io  Don GiovanniOther films dealing with Goya's life are  The Naked Maja 1958 by Henry Koster with Anthony Franciosa and Ava Gardner  Goya by Nino Quevedo also with Francisco Rabal  Los Desastres De Guerra TV series by Jose Ramon Larraz with Enric Majo as Goya  Volaverunt 1999 by Bigas Lina with Penelope Cruz  Jordi Molla and Jorge Perugorria as Goya .".

	schema:reviewBody "Goya in Bordeaux 1999A beautifully filmed and imaginative look at Spanish painter Goya's final years in France. There are fantastical flashbacks really nicely created with translucent sets and changing lighting and there are imagined versions of scenes that led to his paintings highly colorful and gruesome. And effective.If this movie isn't a raging masterpiece it is mostly because there is no real plot. It's slow going even though it is meant to be deliberate and patient. It meanders along as he lives out his final isolated years and we are shown in spurts his work and his past. The old Goya himself is played with believable gusto by Francisco Rabal and the younger with surprising continuity by Jose Coronado. Neither are names familiar to American viewers but both are convincing which isn't always easy portraying a famous artist. If there is a deeper point here it is the journey we all make toward death. And from what I read Goya was afraid of death and would be afraid of old age just as much as this movie implies.If you like your artists heroic and inspired you might find this version of Francisco Goya a little earthy and selfabsorbed. But for me this was about right. He was an old man with little future too much pain to make significant new work and lots of memories. Of course this being a movie and being about life too there is an emphasis on his love affairs or at least his interest in one particular rich woman the Duchess of Alba. In truth there isn't a clear history of Goya being involved with this woman though there are several portraits of her not including most likely the famous pair of reclining figures one nude and one clothed though this is implied if not stated in the movie.All of this is neither here nor there for loving what is wonderful about the movie. Director Carlos Saura has created a magical world for this final great painter one filled with the grotesqueness we associate with his work but also with terrific inventiveness making the paintings come to life without simply restaging them. The best last sections of the film are a tourdeforce and indeed the whole movie is vivid and surprising. If we are sometimes slightly unenthused about the events going on which are often nothing much we are completely sucked in by the ever changing scenes and sets and hallucinatory worlds part real and part Goya's dying mind.In other words the best of this movie is simply amazing. And any movie with such amazing portions is worth watching at least in those parts.".

His threetimes interpreter Francisco Rabal little knew as he made this film that he too would end his days in the same city. Such is the coincidence of life and death.Goya 1999 made as Goya en Burdeos' hints at these and other casualities in a refined genteel way notwithstanding the sometimes temperamental mood of the Aragons painter. The genius of this film is how Storaro's magnificent photography and Saura's gifted and inspired directing actually brought to life so many of the painter's creations paintings only seen in Madrid art museums or in books. It was a delight to suddenly recognize in scenes in the film some of these beautiful works as if magically brought to life by technological tricks but with so much care. Rabal's interpretation is superb it could not have been otherwise this being the third and last time the old Murcian actor had to take on the task of being Goya. It is also worth mentioning Dafn Fernndez who gave an intelligently picturesque performance as was to be hoped for after seeing her wonderful part as Fuensanta in Pajarico' qv made one year earlier.It cannot be denied that Storaro's photography frequently becomes one of the main protagonists in the film's telling. No doubt this is in response to the peculiarities of Saura's directing and thus for me makes a nearperfect coupling. It must also be added that the music employed in the film has been exquisitely selected first with Roque Baos' own composing beautifully intertwining with pieces by Boccherini Couperin Tchaickovsky and Beethoven as well as by an anonymous 17th Century Spanish composer sounding very much like Luys de Narvez.A serious film for those who appreciate excursions into historical cultural backgrounds balanced by a stately unhurried production.".

The last films of Fassbinder also spring into mind at times especially when colour is achieved through projection of coloured light instead of the objects themselves containing colour which is understandable in the case of the German director since he started off in theatre but less so in Saura's case. And at certain moments the theatrical techniques used are stretched too far into the world of theatre seeming to forget that what we are supposed to be watching is cinema and not a videotaped play as in the use of a wall that at times is opaque and at other times becomes transparent.

I just love these 60s spytype movies with their armies of scantily clad women secret island liars and groovy secret agents. What an awesome time it was! And the fact that The Million Eyes of Sumuru was shot in China with a cast that includes Eaton Avalon Klaus Kinski Maria Rohm and Wilfrid HydeWhite of all people only adds to the already bizarre feel of the movie. Movies like this may not be for everyone just take a look at the IMDb rating but for me their just too much fun.I would love to see a cleanedup legitimate Region 1 release of The Million Eyes of Sumuru. I'm convinced I would have rated the film higher than a 610 had I not been watching the MST3K version of the movie recorded off of Minneapolis public access television in the late 1980s. The Million Eyes of Sumuru deserves better than that.".

A big problem in enjoying this beautiful fun is however that most available versions present this shot in 2351Scope film in shitty fullscreen transfers so you can see only half of the real image and missing much important picture information on both sides so you sometimes can hardly tell what's going on.

Avalon makes a few random cameos and then becomes the main character in the last third of the film. And he's the class of the acting talent. Even as a comedy this film fails  relying on chauvinism and tired stereotypes where satirical opportunities could have been exploited.The basic concept of this film might have made it interesting had the script been written before the shooting began and had the female characters been permitted to have personalities.The film was shot in Italy China and various other places and has an international cast. At one point I was starting to wonder whether the production team bothered with translators.I just finished watching it in its MST3K treatment from the first season of MST3K and I can not answer these questions any better than I could in the beginning. The movie seems to be about a secret society of women lead by Sumuru who are gaining control of all of the major economies military forces and political powers through men of course. It is never made clear how and why this is happening.Most of the action centers around the main male character  Nader  who has an amazing repertoire of bad oneliners and irritating pickup lines. This character is so poorly developed in the script and so horribly underacted that I never particularly cared what happened to him nor did I even attempt to understand why he offered no apparent resistance to Sumuru's demands. Add the improbability of Avalon teaming up with the Chinese secret service to rescue Nader from the clutches and lips of Sumuru's amazon army and you've got the makings of ... well... I'll spare you the witticisms... ... a really bad film.I was intrigued by the early appearance of the amazing Klaus Kinski but his role though satisfactorily bizarre is barely a cameo. Considering the vast limitations of the material the acting and cinematography are OK. This is one of the best season 1 MST3K episodes as Joel and the bots are absolutely hilarious in their treatment of this film.".

Like quite a few of his others it has a unique combination of low budget with exotic location shooting. In this case the action takes place in Hong Kong. The title character is Sumuru essentially a female Fu Manchu who plans on ruling the world by using her army of gorgeous women who go out individually and kill all of the world's leading men after getting up close and personal with them by way of their considerable female charms. These 'unfortunate' male saps are then dispatched by a device that turns them into stone. Anyway via this grand plan Sumuru will take over the world somehow.This is one of the films that surfed the wave of success created by the James Bond movies which were massive in the 60's. To that end it has a very agreeable combination of exotic locations and hot premier division women. The very fact that the plotline to this one actively focuses on a woman with an army of babes meant that this one got plus points from me more or less straight away. The 60's glamour essentially is what makes this one work for me. From the thrills and spills side of the fence it's pretty halfhearted this is a film after all which could be summed up with the word 'breezy' so it's best not to go into this one expecting any pulse pounding action.The star of the piece is Shirley Eaton in the role of Sumuru. She would go on to forever be known as the lady painted gold in the earlier Bond classic Goldfinger 1964 but it's nice to see her get a starring role here she also repeated the role in the follow up movie The Girl from Rio 1969 which is another poorly rated film which I happen to like a lot more than most others it seems. This one also benefits from the appearance of two other cult film stars in the beautiful Maria Rohm as a female agent who is 'turned' by the main 'hero' who was not much more than a sexpest I thought and we also have Klaus Kinski appear as one of the high ranking men who is targeted by Sumuru he even gets to sport a very silly wig in the process. On the whole this is a movie which seems to have something of a bad reputation which I personally think is somewhat unfair. It has beautiful women exotic locations and breezy action. That might not be enough for some but it was enough for me.".

Of course it's cheesy and silly but no different from other spy comedies from the 60s say the Matt Helm flicks. And the production values are much higher there's good location shooting and beautiful sets plus good camera work I watched the widescreen version. Capable acting there is little but the pretty female cast makes a bit up for that. The music is nothing special and the movie definitely has some lengths despite the snappy runningtime.SPOILERS The main problem is probably that the hero never gets much to do James Bond would have freed himself in the final act  well I guess our hero waiting passively for his rescue is part of the spoof but it was a lousy decision tensionwise. Secondly the villain organisation basically a small army of nubile young women aimed at creating a menfree reign is doomed to fail from the start in fact one wonders how it ever got that big because none of the pretty members from leader to lowest rung is able to keep her wits about her when left alone with a healthy male. That's a nice running gag at first but gets simply ridden to death. So overall it's just a minor Bmovie despite the high production values.But if you like other 60s spy comedies say Liquidator or the Matt Helm outings you'll like this one well enough. It's even a valid spoof of early James Bond in many scenes.".

	schema:reviewBody "I will spare any reader the lecture on Freud  if indeed I could even provide you with one. We have all heard casually or otherwise the psychoanalytic ideas pertaining to men women and fear before  fear of one's mother or the opposite gender or whatever else is on offer but of course all conveniently subconsciously we know what we think but have no idea that we think it. Somewhere at the heart of The Million Eyes of Sumuru there is a reason to fear women to fear their beauty and their company  to be sceptical as to their motives and to be mindful as to their ideas. The decade of the 1960's was a time of extraordinary change no less on the issue of women in the Western hemisphere  abortions easier access to a divorce better opportunities on various career ladders are but three items which revolutionised a female's place in society. The Million Eyes of Sumuru certainly a piece of its time is the strange amalgamation of these two articles crashing head first into one another women are powerful and independent  they have a newfound sense of freedom and power they are capable of things they were deprived of previously. They are to be at once both feared and found attractive. The fact that those responsible for the film considered it befitting to depict aspects of these psychoanalyticpostfeminist notions as some kind of horror piece is interesting. Alternatively the film is merely a somewhat strange and relatively incompetent 80 minute long thriller which is ultimately both too uninteresting and too confused of its own individual identity to be something really worth recommending. Shirley Eaton is the eponymous Sumuru a woman whose origins are not provided nor whose overall vision is ever fully explained. She is the stock movie antagonist  somebody who wants world domination and she plans said conquest from the confines of an island just off the coast of Hong Kong. She presides there with a small army of women aged between 18 and 35 they are beautiful but deadly  in the opening scene Sumuru kills 19 men with one bomb explosion on the mainland. Arriving home the women are coldly watching on as a comrade uses her thighs to choke a man to death. The whole operation reeks of a cross between the Czechbased Other World Kingdom and the infamous Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.This combination of terror and heightened sexuality is the thrust behind Sumuru's plan to send each of these gorgeous girls out to seduce and marry the richest men in the world. Sumuru assumes that once they meet grizzly ends most of the money will be left to their new muses  money which will all come back to Sumuru who'll thus be able to fund her campaign to take over the world.On another strand Nick West Nader and Tommy Carter Avalon are CIA agents holidaying in Italy. Carter the younger man likes his girls whereas West appears more prudent  early nights and an oral affirmation that he does not force himself upon anyone seems to characterise him. They become entangled in Sumuru's plan when a murder in their vicinity that she ordered was already connected to somebody they knew and after a bit of prodding and poking both men are in the FarEast. West is later forced into working for Sumuru as they seek to kill a local tycoon while Carter spends most of the film trying to find and save him.In spite of the globetrotting the highconcept idea the efficiency in how the enemy is conveyed to us and the plot of world domination it is remarkable as to how the film does not really lift off. We are distracted too often by other things Why is Central European Klaus Kinski cast as somebody from Hong Kong? Why doesn't the lead react as he should when he is provided a tour of the villain's lair? Why do characters act with remarkable inconsistently throughout as per their established outlooks on life? The film is not without a sprinkling of substance  it allows both Sumuru and West to seem to come to question their outlooks on life and the world. Eaton's character punishes one of her girls early on with a death sentence for the crime of falling in love but then appears to come to quite like our lead agent  providing him in the process ample opportunity too much to be consistent with her views hence why we sense it to be so central to return that fondness. West comparatively who begins the film with a cautious attitude towards women seems to fall under a spell of promiscuity the longer he stays on the enemy's island. By the end he seems to have fallen for his gaoler and realised the pleasures one can derive from sexually submitting to a woman. This however makes the film sound more substantial than it actually is. It is difficult to entirely work out what point the film was trying to make. Many have laughed the whole thing off as camp nonsense  an idiotic piece of its time and era. It seems to me it had something to say about the way men and women coexist that sex love and power are too interlinked with one another as elements to ignore one or all of them. The sexualisation of our culture in the years since it was made not to mention the more prominent role women have had in where we live have had an incredible impact on our civilisation  The Million Eyes of Sumuru seems to have been made by people aware we were heading into a braveish new world where girls sex power massinfluence and Technicolor would be more prominent but it is a very difficult piece to be entirely enthused by.".

Well as I've said in the headline the movie definitely does have its intriguing moments and there are quite a few meaningful lines in the script.However Sex and Death 101 is too volatile to really be successful in any of the genres it touches. The story takes a thousand twists and turns. It's too cynical to be romantic too shallow to be profound and too erratic to blow your mind. Characters are introduced and forgotten about in 10 minuteintervals and all of the main characters' friends just kind of disappear at the end when Winona Ryder's character finally comes into the picture. Make no mistake Ryder doesn't play a huge role in the whole movie. Her character seems awfully constructed and forced into the script. When the whole story is finally resolved it doesn't really make sense and leaves you totally uncertain of what the hell it was you just saw.Sex and Death 101 isn't the worst movie you could rent but it's certainly pretty strange. I don't even know whom to recommend this to. Fans of Winona Ryder will not be happy with the little amount of screen time she gets. Friends of romcoms will find fault with both the amount of rom and of com in this. To enjoy Sex and Death 101 you probably just have to accept the fact that you don't know what you're gonna get. And hey that's kind of what the movie is about too I guess.".

It's different  I'll tell ya that.So what does this movie bring to us? The blatantly visible low budget. A cast almost riddled with relatively unknown but promising actors.

The movie's premise ain't real but the events and reactions are. Which is that unique mix of traits that makes this movie a little more than the regular spiel that Hollywood throws at us.

I have to say I normally don't like romantic comedies so I didn't have any big expectations for this.The film is about Rodrick who receives an email with all the names of girls he have had sex with and those he will have sex with within a year. The problem is he at that time was meant to get married in not so long but the list doesn't end with his wife2be's name. Actually there are 72 more to come! I won't say the movie is free of clish but compared to what were used to with these kind of films it certainly is a good breath of fresh air. The plot is funny the characters are interesting the actors did a good job and well the movie was good as well. Also Winona Ryder is as beautiful as ever! Watch it but with reasonable expectations.Enjoy".

I have to say I normally don't like romantic comedies so I didn't have any big expectations for this.The film is about Rodrick who receives an email with all the names of girls he have had sex with and those he will have sex with within a year. The problem is he at that time was meant to get married in not so long but the list doesn't end with his wife2be's name. Actually there are 72 more to come! I won't say the movie is free of clish but compared to what were used to with these kind of films it certainly is a good breath of fresh air. The plot is funny the characters are interesting the actors did a good job and well the movie was good as well. Also Winona Ryder is as beautiful as ever!

	schema:headline " Very funny and surprisingly moving twist of the romcom genre";
	schema:reviewBody "With Sex and Death 101 Daniel Waters does for the romantic comedy genre what he did for the teen genre in Heathers. A convention twisting and nearreinvention. The film starts with a very highconcept idea which could have easily been used as the basis for the next Adam Sandler production at the studios. Not that there's anything wrong with that...actually if it's Sandler we're talking about there's always plenty wrong. So let's say Ben StillerOwen Wilson instead. Waters starts off the film with a fairly traditional setup of his concept but then quickly takes it off on a variety of unexpected paths. The roads less traveled. You might anticipate and I guess this qualifies for a SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!! that the Simon Baker character falls in love with one of the ladies on his list midway through but what happens to that true love is offthecharts unpredictable. There are lots of similar expectationdefying moments throughout and they're often laughoutloud funny.The choice to cast Simon Baker rather than the popular comedian of the week was also a wise one. Baker certainly has comedic chops but he feels considerably straighter and is more of a dramatic actor in the part than say Owen Wilson. Although Baker hardly looks like every man he does add an everyman quality to the performance which grounds it and makes Baker more of a straight man to the insanity happening around him.I've read a few reviews which criticize the film for mixing a number of tones and genre elements. It generally annoys me when critics take this easy lazy route to slag a film particularly one as daring as this. In this case any mixing is clearly a stylisticstorytelling choice and not a mistake. If you want things to play out exactly as you're comfortable and familiar with in every film just watch your favorite DVD's over and over.My prediction is that the film will have a decent theatrical run and be HUGE in the ancillary markets. Expect this to run on cable until your hair turns gray Office Spacestyle. But get out to theaters and see it if you can there. A film like this will play best with a large audience.".

The final coffee shop scene and discussion conjures memories of Daniel Waters' impeccable dialogue and pace everpresent in 1989's Heathers. Yes this isn't Heathers and thankfully it isn't Hudson Hawk either however Sex  Death 101 unlike both of the aforementioned films doesn't stay with you for better or worse. Again the final scenes are well worth the wait and highlight exactly why Winona Ryder is everybody's favourite outsider. Her ability to present warped innocence and make it seem endearing is wonderful to watch. The moment that we see Death Nell writing in her journal a throwback to Veronica Sawyer in Heathers really emphasises this...Ryder's representation of the madness of youth and sex and sadness all connected in one bizarre character. So as a film Sex  Death 101 isn't great but as an example of good screen writing and character development in the case of Death Nell it is interesting to experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sex and Death 101 is a dark and savvy little romantic comedy that gleefully dances away from many of the stale and stuffy conventions generally associated with the genre.Simon Baker stars as the allegorically named Roderick Blank a handsome seemingly insatiable lady killer who's decided it's finally time to put an end to his womanizing ways in favor of marriage to the beautiful Fiona Wormwood. Yet literally on the eve of his bachelor party Rod receives a mysterious email listing in chronological order not only all the women he's already slept with throughout the course of his life but all the women he is destined to sleep with in the time that still remains to him the total is 101 if you haven't already surmised that from the film's title. Adhering to the adage the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak Rod allows the list to essentially take over his life waiting for the next promised woman to fall into his lap sometimes quite literally then crossing her name off the moment he's had his way with her. But is this truly the route to a satisfying life even for a notorious playboy like Roderick Blank? Part science fiction and part metaphysical morality play Sex and Death 101 also boasts two wacky subplots that run contrapuntal to the main story one featuring Winona Ryder as an avenging feminist who comes in the guise of a serial killer luring unsuspecting misogynists to their welldeserved destruction and the other involving three mysterious figures mad scientists intervening angels? who kidnap Rod to inform him that he has been the victim of some bizarre cosmic prank and that he needs to destroy the list before it destroys him.Sex and Death 101 is not a perfect film by any means. Its attempts at surrealism are frequently heavyhanded and strained and its blackcomedy edge isn't always as razorsharp as it could be. But on the whole this is a wildly original and surprisingly incisive look at the different ways in which men and women view sex and romance and the different ways they use both those things to get what they want. Writerdirector Daniel Waters knows how to set even the most hackneyed romantic comedy clich spinning on its head. For instance the movie takes the obligatory gay best friend stereotype  who usually comes in the form of a flaming interior decorator or wedding planner  and turns it into a wisecracking lesbian smartly played by Mindy Cohn best known as Natalie from The Facts of Life whose duties as Rod's personal secretary go far beyond merely scheduling his appointments or knowing where his briefcase is.Although Rod is in many ways a typical character for a romantic comedy  afraid of commitment obsessed with nailing every woman who comes his way etc.  the route the script takes to get him to his admittedly rather predictable prowomanproromance epiphany is anything but typical. This freshness is further enhanced by the devilishly playful and utterly disarming performance turned in by Baker who completely captivates the viewer with his easygoing charisma and charm. The scene in which Baker and Ryder finally share screen time together is exceptionally well acted and staged. Even though the movie feels a little disjointed and unfocused at times Waters does a nice job dovetailing all the seemingly unrelated plot elements into a satisfying whole in the end. Sex and Death 101 is for those who like a little spice with their romantic comedies.".

There are moments of insightful sex isn't what is important in life expressions that however verge on forcing the viewer to relate to the main character Roderick Blank. It has a sweet unpretentiousness to it that is refreshing amidst the megabucks Hollywood romantic comedies with predictable stories but still feels like it should go straight to video and not bother with the theaters.An interesting premise with a plot twist that feels very predictable but ends in a surprising way its still not enough for me to recommend it to anyone as the film doesn't leave with you anything  no glowing feelings no revelations not even a basic contentment after watching a horror thriller or romantic comedy. Instead the film is bland with no character development and no explanation as to any character motivations. Why did Winona Ryder's character choose to act the way she did explained but not at all believable what about the motivations of every other character in the film? What is Roderick's motivation? Pure boredom? Although explained by the script there is no emotion from the actors no expression of anything remotely connected to feeling to depth. Nothing is really clear its all hinted at and the viewer is left feeling uninspired and unconnected from the characters and the story. The lead actors still did their best with itthe ensemble was horrid though and though this is Ryder's worst character ever perhaps it was all a fault of the writing who is to say? This film is like a tantalizing sandwich in the shop window. It looks beautiful at the start as it has good ingredients seasoned actors and has a unique and interesting recipe premise yet when you take a bite there' s no meat no filling no flavour. The viewer is left with an empty mouth empty head and a lighter wallet.".

Well... he realizes he's really not ready to get married and he starts having sex with lots of people... Sound familiar? Good Luck Chuck comes to mind. This seems to be a popular topic for movies today.So back to the details. That someone who sent the email isn't ever fully explained. Apparently it's a machine but no one knows what it really is who created it or if it really exists. There apparently are three men who carry out the machine's will but it isn't really clear who or what they are either. This was a severe flaw in the plot if you ask me. In order to understand the movie I couldn't think about the machine for too long.Anyway it's funny that Winona Ryder is listed as a main character as for the majority of the movie she really doesn't have a large role and only for the last 10 minutes of the movie does she actually engage in dialogue that seems to be related with the plot. Wait... what plot? Yes this movie barely has a plot beyond the fascination of seeing a guy having lots of sex. The ending of the movie attempts to add some depth to the story line but unfortunately it fails at such. The writers basically failed at every aspect of this movie in creating a meaningful story.

	schema:headline " If I could find 101 reasons for not watching this movie...";
	schema:reviewBody "Continuing with the thought that sometimes movies may honor its title and that may save them from being bad or make them even more terrible than they are I present to you the latter of the examples. Like Boys where Winona Ryder also plays a part Sex and Death 101 makes true justice to its title. The thing is that with a title like Boys there are interesting things to be said but Sex and Death 101That's all there is sex and death.If I want those things I can easily find them in a lame erotic film. For those who think that sex can be justified in a film and so on I tell you that I agree but there's nothing justifiable about the use of sex or even death in this film. Sex and Death 101 tells the story of Roderick Blank Simon Baker an entrepreneur who's about getting married and receives an email with a list of every women he's had sex with and will have sex with. Any guesses? Right! They're 101 women. From that moment on and I'm sorry if I spoil the ride for you but all of this and more is in the unappealing trailer if you've watched it Roderick leaves his soon to be wife in a ridiculous scene and starts doing what probably any man would do except that he does it in every scene and the only scenes that are not about it are about their friends a fat lesbian secretary and a bunch of married guys trying to stop him with whatever excuse they find. At one point writerdirector Daniel Waters I hope he has nothing to do with Mark runs out of these excuses and the need for a closure takes his film to the utter bottom. But that's not everything Waters' made of as a writer. There's a woman called Miranda the charming Leslie Bibb who's apparently on the list but touches Roderick's heart which leads Waters to create a joke that consists on everyone asking Have you fed her yet?. Another thing that's supposed to be funny is when his secretary makes Roderick check if her name is on the list.Oh and there's The Machine! How could I forget such original invention and the origin of Roderick's problems? It's an empty space with a strong white background and it has a crack in the wall. From that crack it spits cards that apparently know anything anyone would like to know. The guy who controls the Machine a possible Morpheus without glasses says it may be an oracle but he's not sure. If you thought I had forgotten that the Great Winona Ryder plays a part I hadn't.

	onyx:emotionText "Continuing with the thought that sometimes movies may honor its title and that may save them from being bad or make them even more terrible than they are I present to you the latter of the examples. Like Boys where Winona Ryder also plays a part Sex and Death 101 makes true justice to its title. The thing is that with a title like Boys there are interesting things to be said but Sex and Death 101That's all there is sex and death.If I want those things I can easily find them in a lame erotic film. For those who think that sex can be justified in a film and so on I tell you that I agree but there's nothing justifiable about the use of sex or even death in this film. Sex and Death 101 tells the story of Roderick Blank Simon Baker an entrepreneur who's about getting married and receives an email with a list of every women he's had sex with and will have sex with. Any guesses? Right! They're 101 women. From that moment on and I'm sorry if I spoil the ride for you but all of this and more is in the unappealing trailer if you've watched it Roderick leaves his soon to be wife in a ridiculous scene and starts doing what probably any man would do except that he does it in every scene and the only scenes that are not about it are about their friends a fat lesbian secretary and a bunch of married guys trying to stop him with whatever excuse they find. At one point writerdirector Daniel Waters I hope he has nothing to do with Mark runs out of these excuses and the need for a closure takes his film to the utter bottom. But that's not everything Waters' made of as a writer. There's a woman called Miranda the charming Leslie Bibb who's apparently on the list but touches Roderick's heart which leads Waters to create a joke that consists on everyone asking Have you fed her yet?. Another thing that's supposed to be funny is when his secretary makes Roderick check if her name is on the list.Oh and there's The Machine! How could I forget such original invention and the origin of Roderick's problems? It's an empty space with a strong white background and it has a crack in the wall. From that crack it spits cards that apparently know anything anyone would like to know. The guy who controls the Machine a possible Morpheus without glasses says it may be an oracle but he's not sure. If you thought I had forgotten that the Great Winona Ryder plays a part I hadn't. How could I when she's secondbilled and she's not even a supporting character but a mere excuse to finalize the movie? She appears in only one scene and gives as convincingly as she can it's not her fault that the script is so poor a speech that pretends to justify the time we've wasted and fails.And Simon Baker can do better.

	schema:reviewBody "This movie makes very little sense. The whole thing is exceedingly bizarre. But somehow the movie kind of works. Simon Baker turns in a fine performance in the leading man role and it his charm which more than anything else enables the movie to be considered at least a mild success.Baker plays successful executive Roderick Blank who is about to be married. And then something strange happens. He receives an anonymous email which lists in chronological order the names of every woman he has ever slept with. Bizarre to be sure but not a crisis as long as his wife to be is the last name on the list. She's not. She's number 29. There are 101 names on the list. Roderick initially shrugs it off as some kind of practical joke being perpetrated by his friends. Then again how would his friends know the names in order of every woman he's ever slept with? When Roderick accidentally yes accidentally has sex with woman number 30 on the list he realizes there's something going on here. Looks like that wedding's not going to happen after all. Apparently there's a higher power at work. What is that higher power you ask? Well you see there's this computer which apparently knows everything. And it occasionally spits out random pointless information...like lists of women that men will sleep with for example. This is all explained by the three men who work with the computer in a mysterious futuristiclooking office. These men are named Alpha Beta and Fred. Told you this movie was bizarre.Anyhow it's pretty apparent where the sex in the movie's title comes from. Yes a multitude of women come and go as Roderick crosses off names on his list. But what about the death part? Well that's where Winona Ryder comes in. She plays Death Nell a shadowy figure lurking mostly in the background of the movie who goes around seducing men and then putting them into comas. But only men who deserve it you see sexual deviants of some kind. Death Nell becomes a feminist hero Roderick goes on sleeping with all these different women and hey do you think perhaps these two characters might be destined to meet? Well I certainly hope so or else this whole thing is going to be rather pointless.For a supposed comedy this movie isn't particularly funny. No real belly laughs to be had here maybe a mild chuckle or two. It seems that Patton Oswalt in playing Fred is set up to be the designated funny guy but he's really not that funny at all. There are a few good moments here and there but there are a lot of times where the movie drags and there's nothing funny or even interesting going on. The plot perks up a bit when after sleeping with all these random women Roderick actually ends up in a quasiserious relationship with a doctor played by Leslie Bibb. But that relationship comes with complications. And we know that this woman is not the last woman on the list so inevitably it's back to the parade of women in Roderick's life. There are times where it seems the movie is close to falling apart completely but Baker who really has to carry things pretty much by himself manages to hold it together and in the end it's a relatively enjoyable movie. Baker is excellent Ryder does OK with minimal screen time and there's also room for another somewhat familiar face as playing Roderick's lesbian secretary Trixie is Mindy Cohn. Yes that would be Natalie of Facts of Life fame. You take the good you take the bad you take them both and there you have...a reasonably decent movie. That's Sex and Death 101.".

But then he squandered his talent and reputation by writing abysmal films like Hudson Hawk Demolition Man and even Batman Returns yeah that one too. Now he's back with a new film in six years which he wrote and directed.Just before he's to marry Fiona Roderick Blank Simon Baker receives an anonymous email with 101 names on it Fiona's is the 29th the first 28 are women Rod has slept with. The notion that he will have sex with 70 more people sends Rod into crisis mode especially after three odd men in an aseptic office confirm that a celestial machine has made an error. They suggest destroying the list but Rod finds that easier said than done. Working his way through it consumes him plus he realizes that death may await him after 101. Meanwhile a femme fatal nicknamed Death Nell Winona Ryder is putting men into a coma. Are they fated to meet? Thanks again IMDb I'll have to admit this is quite interesting premise. And the good thing is it hasn't gone wasted since the person behind this film is definitely having a right mind to do it right. It is clever film about crisis of men and their quest to search for sexual fulfillment. Because once you hooked to sex even there's a hell right in front of you you might not hesitate to dive into it. It raised a question about when one woman just wasn't enough how far could you go? It's also about fate when there's something that doesn't belong to you it's just doesn't belong to you. And if you're persistent to have it then you will lose it forever.OK let me stop you right here before you storm out to buy this DVD. It's just too bad that they did it right doesn't mean that they did it good. Because Sex and Death 101 is the movie that put too much ambition for its own good. In my opinion Daniel Waters was thinking way too much on this project. It supposed to be good dirty and fun little movie that eventually might create cult following. But what I saw is just such a promising project engulfed by director's selfabsorbed vision. It's doesn't sync with audience like his Heathers script which is like a wake up call for all generationx who consumed by popularity. In the mean time Sex and Death 101 was also talking about important subject alright but it can only be able to educate people about sexuality. It's just can't relate to audience especially target group like generationx who probably got older by now.And when director's vision has gone wrong everything in this film also has the same destiny. Simon Baker's narration didn't really mean anything and then it got worse when the story went on to unexpected turn. Also the story about godlike operation room is pretty unnecessary. Come to think about it I saw a similarity between this film and Danny Boyle's Life Less Ordinary because it has something to do with an act of god too!. Although LLO is a flawed film but it is an entertaining movie where you can almost feel filmmaker's burning passion on the project. But Sex and Death 101 is just cold as ice project where you could feel a touch of isolation miles away.But it has some redemption moments especially when the comedy was kicked in. I think I laughed out loud a couple of times so rare these days .'. There were the scene where Roderick ALMOST sleep with Sophie Monks and the scene where he vs. catholic girls on school bus even it's so absurd but it's just damn hilarious. And also a fine performance by Simon Baker even if he's not particularly Alist star but he's charming enough to make me bought him as a striking handsome ladies man he got to sleep with 101 women alright?. On the other hands Winona Ryder is simply dreadful. She supposed to be disturbing femme fetal but she act like she's on crack or something. Comes to think of it it's almost ten years since her last good role in Girl Interrupted I wish she will comeback real soon.Sex and Death 101 may have some sharp idea and hysterical black humor moment but it tried too hard to be something important and then chicken out in one of the most whimsy ending I have ever seen. I kind of admire the director's attempt to reach out for his royal fans and tried to reignite his good old days with familiar subject. But sorry Mr. Waters this wasn't the one yet.".

	schema:reviewBody "The basic idea does work for a nice comedy and the script author must be very disappointed what the producer had made out of it. Problem is that the director and the writer are the same person Daniel Waters. So one essential thing learned from this movies is that Daniel Waters should only write and never again be the director.I won't tell the story because reading it there wouldn't be much left for watching. If you want an average movie to spend 100 minutes then you can watch it. If you expect a great comedy and a nice time in the cinema then this movie is wrong for you. Escpecially because it has the appearance of a movie made only for video release but not for cinema.The overall problem is the cast. Simon Baker is good for romance movies and attorneys but not for a comedy like this. Actors like Adam Sandler and Steve Zahn would be the right man for Roderick Blank. Simon Baker lacks the comedic element in his acting.The secretary of Roderick Blank is also a prime playing role for a comedian but the female actor here lacks also the comedic quality.Patton Oswalt is the only actor in this movie with this quality.Overall the movie is too slow. Even the music used in this movie is just wrong for a comedy.".

So one essential thing learned from this movies is that Daniel Waters should only write and never again be the director.I won't tell the story because reading it there wouldn't be much left for watching. If you want an average movie to spend 100 minutes then you can watch it. If you expect a great comedy and a nice time in the cinema then this movie is wrong for you. Escpecially because it has the appearance of a movie made only for video release but not for cinema.The overall problem is the cast. Simon Baker is good for romance movies and attorneys but not for a comedy like this. Actors like Adam Sandler and Steve Zahn would be the right man for Roderick Blank. Simon Baker lacks the comedic element in his acting.The secretary of Roderick Blank is also a prime playing role for a comedian but the female actor here lacks also the comedic quality.Patton Oswalt is the only actor in this movie with this quality.Overall the movie is too slow. Even the music used in this movie is just wrong for a comedy.";

	schema:headline " Come see Winona Ryder's nose ridges";
	schema:reviewBody "When you're making a movie and the best thing about it is The Facts of Life Mindy Cohn's performance as a lesbian secretary you've got problems.Sex and Death 101 is a movie that tries to tell oneandaquarter stories. One full story is about Roderick Blank Simon Baker a guy who's all ready to settle down and get married when he gets a list in his email. The list is the names of all the people he's ever going to have sex with but while there are 101 names on the list Roderick has only had sex with 29 women so far. So over the next year Roderick uses the list as a guide to boink his way through the other 72 names. The quarter of a story concerns Death Nell Winona Rider a woman who's taking men that have been abusive or disrespectful of woman and putting them into comas. I say it's a quarter of a story because even though you know Roderick and Death Nell will be getting together her role is barely more than a glorified cameo.Firstly this film is a great example that you shouldn't make a whimsical romantic comedy with a writerdirector who not only doesn't understand women he doesn't even understand men. There's a scene where Roderick and his two guy friends are talking and watching a football game. There's a big play the guys jump up to celebrate then fall into a pile on the floor where they lay next to each other and talk for about a minute. Guys don't lie next to each other on the floor and have conversations. Young girls may do that. Straight men do not. I don't even think gay guys do that and that's the level of understanding Daniel Waters brings to the story.That lack of wisdom doesn't completely cripple the film because understanding human behavior isn't necessary if none of your characters are real human beings in any sense of the word. The characters in Sex and Death 101 are clever colorful and occasionally funny but there's not a single moment when you actually feel anything for any of them. The movie deals with the implications of knowing which women absolutely will and which absolutely won't have sex with you in a detached fashion but then forces poor Simon Baker to ridiculously overact when the story suddenly dictates that Roderick have an emotional crisis by falling in love with a girl who's not on the list.There is some decent female nudity in the film but not from any of the big name actresses not even Mindy Cohn and it's all in the first half before the story gets all wrapped up in the mysterious entity that sent the list to Roderick and how his story is intersecting with Death Nell's. And maybe I've never noticed it before but there's something seriously off about Winona Rider's nose in this movie. There are these very odd double ridges on the bridge of her nose that I don't recall ever being that distinct before.Fundamentally the trouble with Sex and Death 101 is that it lacks balls and I don't mean male nudity. The subjects of predestination exploitation and manipulation it deals with are fairly darkbut the movie always keeps them at arm's length. It's too delicate to mine the laughs out of the raw pain of Roderick's predicaments so the humor never rises above the sitcom level with the jokes telegraphed so clearly that you can see them coming during the movie you watch before you watch Sex and Death 101. So it's not an unfunny movie but it is one that you laugh at almost as much as you laugh with.".

There were some very funny surprises along the way as well.Poor man!! Winona Ryder turns up throughout the film as a parallel storyline as a mysterious killer. She is the dark counter play to the lighter male storyline.I see this film as a story about how good people can be swallowed up by bad experiences and fate but that how in the end true optimism and kindness will win out.It is a lovely film to watch if you want some laughs and a gentle but interesting and surprising storyline.Not for prudes though.".

He's currently at number 29 his soon to be wife but there are 101 names on the list. Figure that one out! How could this film go wrong? Well there are two reasonsFirstly you get lost along the way. The film could have been 1h 20mins at max but it's 2h. However if you get past the first half you'll manage to finish it. The second half is in my opinion better compared to the first but then remember that's not much. Secondly the humor is not working. Nor the sex. Basically the two main components of the film just fail. I guess it's supposed to be a dark sex comedy but it comes off as dry and edgy. I've seen better sex comedies from the 60s so don't even bother with this one. Perhaps it's a romance? No way don't even get me started about the ending. Is it a drama? It becomes one halfway through I can say at least that.All in all the only reason why you may want to see the movie is Simon Baker. There are some moments where it seems that he tried his best.

Inspired by the story of Marie a woman who advertises her services as a reader of literature Constance decides to do the same. Here the film takes on a kaleidoscopic effect as the lives of Constance and Marie become merged making it hard to distinguish what is real and what is fantasy. This structure is further complicated when the lives of Constance's clients become tangled with the stories she reads. The film is interspersed with readings from well known literary sources as diverse as amongst others Baudelaire Duras Tolstoy Lewis Carroll and de Sade's 120 days...";

Marie thanks to her nice voice her passion of reading her shiny presence make people happy and eventually makes the spectator happy. In a way like the hairdresser's wife 1990 a beautiful movie by Patrice Leconte la lectrice is one of these rare films where you smile during almost all the projection. It is the opportunity for Miou Miou to find one of her very best roles too and she offers us a delightful composition. She's the real major asset of the film.La Lectrice is a smart poetic movie with sparkling dialogs and ingenious sequences where the pleasure of words joins the pleasure of pictures. Another good point a rightly chosen classical music mainly used in the moments where you see Marie walking down the streets of Arles between two reading sessions. The music gives the movie an impression of lightness and wellbeing. Besides I feel that everything here breathes joy of living and even if the end of the movie remains a little dark Marie by refusing to read an extract from a Sade novel is becoming jobless we can detect a message of hope in Constance's intention of becoming a reader reading must be conserved in a society where books occupy a less and less important place.Michel Deville's movie won the Louis Delluc price in 1988.

Sylvette Hry 's hips and thighs are indeed beautiful and wellfilmedbut the sexual side of The Reader is mishandled.The director lacked the necessary cinematographic culture and subtlety for such a movie.In conclusionthe movie is average and less amusing and beautiful than it could be.Better scriptedand much better conceived and madethis could of been one of the best surrealist films.It was obviously above the director's aptitudes.It is interesting to think about who would of been suited for such a moviea direction could of been explored by Truffaut.It would of been even less surrealist than it is in its actual director's handsbut it would of had style and more charm. Truffaut was the man for the graceful fairy ingenuity needed here.Another direction could of been explored by Bunueland thenthe surrealism would of reached the heights.Anywayone feels here the existence of a material for much better movies.It has potential.".

Sylvette Hry 's hips and thighs are indeed beautiful and wellfilmedbut the sexual side of The Reader is mishandled.The director lacked the necessary cinematographic culture and subtlety for such a movie.In conclusionthe movie is average and less amusing and beautiful than it could be.Better scriptedand much better conceived and madethis could of been one of the best surrealist films.It was obviously above the director's aptitudes.It is interesting to think about who would of been suited for such a moviea direction could of been explored by Truffaut.It would of been even less surrealist than it is in its actual director's handsbut it would of had style and more charm. Truffaut was the man for the graceful fairy ingenuity needed here.Another direction could of been explored by Bunueland thenthe surrealism would of reached the heights.Anywayone feels here the existence of a material for much better movies.It has potential.";

	schema:reviewBody "Among outstanding film directors there are those who crash in with debut features that show something of the full extent of their talent Satyajit Ray with Pather Panchali Neil Jordan with Angel and of course Orson Welles with Citizen Kane and those like Ingmar Bergman who creep into the scene with films that are little less than mediocre but who develop slowly almost unobtrusively giving only occasional hints of the glories to come. Bergman first came to notice as the proficient scriptwriter for Alf Sjoberg's Hets a 1944 shocker with echos of The Blue Angel. Sjoberg's direction is impressive with much use of expressionist shadows and angles. The strange thing about Bergman's directional debut Kris two years later is what little he appeared to have absorbed from his mentor. Kris is a very two dimensional work that could have been made by almost anyone. This was followed by several similar apprentice works which again give very little indication of what was to come. I would date the emergence of the original Bergman voice from the appearance of Summer Interlude in 1951. Although on the surface this appears to be a very conventional tale of an idyllic romance cut short by a tragic twist of fate the sort of youthlovedeath cocktail that was the mainstay of so much Hollywood drama Kings Row Love Story and Dead Poets Society the treatment is often very personal in a way that we can almost feel an innate artist struggling to express something beyond the superficial. It opens with a visually stunning series of stilllife shots of the sort that Ozu always inserted between each short dramatic scene. We immediately feel this is a film that is demanding to be taken seriously. When the ballerina heroine takes a boat to the archipelago where thirteen years before she met the young man who was to become the love of her life memory is unleashed and we relive in flashbacks her past happiness. Sometimes Bergman is in complete control of his material as when the ballerina leaves the boat and uneasy memories seem reflected in the sound of the wind and there is a silent encounter with a mysterious elderly woman whose path almost touches hers  a device he was to use to even more chilling effect years later when Liv Ullmann passes an elderly lady in the corridor to an apartment flat in Face to Face. In other places his command is less certain and borders on clich  when the doomed young man speaks of his premonition of something dark and indeed the shot of a black cloud a moment after the accident that is to prove fatal. Bergman also makes the mistake of sometimes cluttering the narrative with supporting characters which add very little to the forward flow  the rather tiresome behind the scenes workers at the theatre. Although the film is a romantic tragedy it differs from the works of his central period in the way it comes to terms with life's misfortunes. The ballerina learns from her memories that her life has a continuation that it is still possible to forge new relationships. Bergman was to regain something of this confident belief in the worthwhile qualities of life in later works like Cries and Whispers and Fanny and Alexander but not until he had become resigned to rather than angered by God's silence. It is perhaps significant that in Summer Interlude where he had not quite sorted out his responses to life or the medium in which he was working the most powerful scene of all is where the ballerina rails at God's silence after her lover has been taken from her and craves for the opportunity to spit at God should he appear. There is not a single scene that expresses anything like this that I can recall in Hollywood drama. It indicates more clearly than anything else in Bergman's output up to this point the path he was about to take in expressing his dark vision of the world one in which the conventions of commercial cinema were to have no place.".

	schema:headline " His Master's surprisingly youthful Voice";
	schema:reviewBody "It's interesting to note that when scripting this film Bergman would not have been much older than his protagonist the 28 year old Ballet dancer Marie. Marie is someone who has spent the majority of her adult life building a wall around herself her primary purpose in this is protection against the ghosts of her past. Although we suspect the wall may not have fully achieved this aim it has succeeded in preventing her from truly making contact with the world and those who love her from ever reaching her. This is represented physically in the difficulty her young lover the journalist has in penetrating the theatre foyer at the beginning of the film. One gets the sense that Marie is doomed to drift through life forever looking backwards over her shoulder. When an exlover's diary is mysteriously delivered to the theatre she is forced deeper into herself to confront a past she has locked away for the last fifteen years. We are then presented with these memories that the diary provokes and this is when the film truly comes alive. ALIVE is the key word here as Bergman paints for us in a way that so few other's are able a vivid picture of the essence of young life and falling in love for the first time stomach butterflies and all. Her relationship to Henrik a older local boy she meets whilst staying with her aunt is depicted expertly in such a way that Bergman's dialogue dances and his scripting skills truly shine. In this field he must have been way ahead of many of his contemporaries their personalities are quickly and efficiently drawn so as to be absolute their teasing banter is playful unpredictable and a joy to witness. There is a magical scene in which the two young lovers begin to pencil various characters from their lives upon a record sleeve. Unexpectedly especially in a Bergman film! these drawings spring into life reenacting a comic version of the lives of their real counterparts. In terms of Bergman's filmography these scenes are unique in their lightheartedness. However this IS a Bergman film and as surely as autumn and winter must follow summer the light must be balanced by an equal amount of dark.As in Wild Strawberries the narrative structure unfolds in a series of flashbacks that masterfully deliver vital information in such an order that ensures their emotional impact. The ballet scenes are of note as they are shot with a beautiful quietude that reflects the understated nature of the whole film. 'Summer Interlude' seems to assert the importance of embracing the here and now of venturing into the shadows to confront one's ghosts and laying them to bare in the sun. The alternative it seems is not really living. This is not typical Bergman fare it is not nerve shredding drama on an epic scale nor is it a challenging psychological abstraction that pushes the medium of cinema. Rather this is a moving little tale of remembered intimacy small but perfectly formed.".

	onyx:emotionText "It's interesting to note that when scripting this film Bergman would not have been much older than his protagonist the 28 year old Ballet dancer Marie. Marie is someone who has spent the majority of her adult life building a wall around herself her primary purpose in this is protection against the ghosts of her past. Although we suspect the wall may not have fully achieved this aim it has succeeded in preventing her from truly making contact with the world and those who love her from ever reaching her. This is represented physically in the difficulty her young lover the journalist has in penetrating the theatre foyer at the beginning of the film. One gets the sense that Marie is doomed to drift through life forever looking backwards over her shoulder. When an exlover's diary is mysteriously delivered to the theatre she is forced deeper into herself to confront a past she has locked away for the last fifteen years. We are then presented with these memories that the diary provokes and this is when the film truly comes alive. ALIVE is the key word here as Bergman paints for us in a way that so few other's are able a vivid picture of the essence of young life and falling in love for the first time stomach butterflies and all. Her relationship to Henrik a older local boy she meets whilst staying with her aunt is depicted expertly in such a way that Bergman's dialogue dances and his scripting skills truly shine. In this field he must have been way ahead of many of his contemporaries their personalities are quickly and efficiently drawn so as to be absolute their teasing banter is playful unpredictable and a joy to witness. There is a magical scene in which the two young lovers begin to pencil various characters from their lives upon a record sleeve. Unexpectedly especially in a Bergman film! these drawings spring into life reenacting a comic version of the lives of their real counterparts. In terms of Bergman's filmography these scenes are unique in their lightheartedness. However this IS a Bergman film and as surely as autumn and winter must follow summer the light must be balanced by an equal amount of dark.As in Wild Strawberries the narrative structure unfolds in a series of flashbacks that masterfully deliver vital information in such an order that ensures their emotional impact. The ballet scenes are of note as they are shot with a beautiful quietude that reflects the understated nature of the whole film. 'Summer Interlude' seems to assert the importance of embracing the here and now of venturing into the shadows to confront one's ghosts and laying them to bare in the sun. The alternative it seems is not really living. This is not typical Bergman fare it is not nerve shredding drama on an epic scale nor is it a challenging psychological abstraction that pushes the medium of cinema. Rather this is a moving little tale of remembered intimacy small but perfectly formed.";

	schema:headline " The first masterpiece of the great Swedish master";
	schema:reviewBody "On the face of it Summer Interlude is a fairly straightforward narrative a ballerina Marie masterfully played by MajBritt Nilsson in her late 20s so in the ballet world nearing the end of her career seems detached from the world. She lives with a fairly stolid and boring tabloid journalist David in a wonderfully understated performance from Alf Kjellin but doesn't seem terribly invested in their relationship. On the day of the dress rehearsal before opening night a package arrives containing a journal  she opens the journal and suddenly she feels emotion again  as if part of an interior wall is starting to crack. She takes a ferry out to an island where she spent her childhood summers and flashes back to a summer romance that occurred there in her teenage years  and thus a complex beautiful and tragic story begins.This is considered by most  including the Swedish master himself  to be Bergman's first mature film as a director and with good reason. His previous offerings while showing glimpses of the promises he would deliver on later in his career were hampered by his limp flawed male protagonists. This is the first film in which he explores the female as protagonist a trope which would continue through most of his career and it's clear that he has a much better grasp on the female psyche than on the male  with one notable exception The Seventh Seal his male protagonists often come off as variants of the director himself. Marie is at once strong uninhibited and vulnerable as a young woman and Nilsson plays this role sublimely. As a mature ballerina she has the appearance of strength that comes from a deadening of the emotions rather inhibited and invulnerable  a woman behind a wall she was forced or persuaded to build around herself. Nilsson also takes on this role masterfully showing the versatility and virtuosity of an actress whose career peaked far too early.The male lead and Marie's love interest is Birger Malmsten as Henrik  also wonderfully played as by this point yet another incarnation of young Bergman himself. But unlike the male leads of previous films Henrik is played with such an earnest innocence and naivet that we can't help but buy into this wonderful performance. This isn't the director subtly displaying a sense of selfloathing but rather baring his soul through his marvelous script and direction. The ancillary roles are all excellent as can be expected from actors working under Bergman. Stig Olin is particularly fantastic as the master of the ballet company. Kjellin's regular guy is believable in both his distance and his frustration and lascivious Uncle Erland Georg Funkquist is delightfully seedy and erudite. Gunnar Olsson  the obligatory Bergman priest  is a very minor character but fits perfectly into the few scenes he appears in. The rest of the supporting cast is fantastic.As one would expect from a Bergman film  especially an early collaboration with his first significant cinematographer Gunnar Fischer and frequent editor Oscar Rosander  the visuals are stunning. I won't get overtechnical here but a wonderful mix of slowfades natural summer lighting and exceptional composition make this a visual gem. Working onlocation  a rarity for Bergman at this point in his career  he masterfully captures the feel of a short 68 week Swedish summer from the cuckoo that officially announces the start of summer to the owl that signals its approaching end. The lighting is masterfully achieved contrast the scene when Marie first bumps into Henrik on the island to that where she walks down the hospital corridor. Every scene  including the outdoor ones which are far more difficult  are perfectly focused and use exactly the right perspective.Thematically Summer Interlude is almost a crystal ball we can stare into to see the marvelous things the director would do in the future. Love and its reverse. Life and its reverse. The questioning of god's existence relevance and goodness. This is one of the first Bergman films to significantly use the mirror as a thematic element in two backtoback scenes near the end of the film  this theme would be repeated in many future films from the shattered mirror in The Magician to the dual mirrors in Cries and Whispers this would be a leitmotif that Bergman would employ time and time again. There is a chess scene in Summer Interlude that would directly evoke that of The Seventh Seal had the former not been shot 5 years before the latter. The distance between Marie and David tangibly feels like the silence between the sisters in The Silence.The overall TLDR synopsis This is a beautifully shot wonderfully acted portrayal of young love that evokes Bergman's recurring themes of love loss the distance that necessarily exists between people the silence of god selfreflection and the existentialist notion that we might as well move forward because otherwise all we do is wait for Godot. The first masterpiece of a director I consider second only to Tarkovsky and easily in my top 10 of his films  which is saying a lot. A solid 1010.".

Some of the film's best visuals include a bleak white sky that only a black silhouette of the protagonist can be made out walking against and a couple of excellent montages one being the opening shots of slight movements in clouds in a river and of rubbish on a footpath the other being a montage of steam skies and water as a boat sails along. Bergman also pays a lot of attention to sound here too and in particular there is something rhythmic about the chugging boat sounds and these sounds can be heard at times throughout the film even when the boat is not visible on screen. Silence such as at the doctor's office is also distributed well throughout.The directing work in this early Bergman film is on par with some of his best direction. His screenplay is however well below par. It is one of his least challenging scripts  a simple tale of love between two young persons with none of the philosophy or analysis about how human beings function that make most of his films so interesting. It is well made but often nothing more than sentimental fluff. The stop animation work is an awkward inclusion too and the film is full of unimportant events such as the ups and downs of the ballet that really have absolutely nothing to do with the story at hand. It is not one of Bergman's best films by far but still a good sign of things to come from him and fairly pleasant viewing. It is sort of similar to 'Wild Strawberries' and therefore it is rather amusing to hear the main character ask her lover whether he wants to pick some wild strawberries with her!".

She is too sad to get away the great sorrow and open her mind to a journalist who is her lately lover. This film not only tells the wonderful memories and the praise of life but also faces the shadow of death.

A bit too little story maybe that happens when you try to write about something that you experienced firsthand yourself as a 16 year old nerd boy  Best thing about this film is Annalisa Ericsson as a bad ballerina and the dirty rich old man portraid by Georg Funkquist. The lead actress MajBritt Nilsson is O.K. and does give a nice performance but her counterpart Birger Malmsten is terrible.Lousy teatrical acting. The border between what the mirror' reflect and the reality is great!  The fluid like state of the different time past and present is good.

Bergman's direction is as always superb. The cinematography positively shimmers and the images of the sunny Swedish countryside are beautiful to look at. The writing is thoughtprovoking affecting in its honesty and sweet in how it deals with the romantic elements. The story still has the dramatic intensity and structural complexity that helps to form the best of Bergman's films. The two lead characters are touching and are likable Marie being worldweary and Henrik being timid. The acting helps to reflect that especially MajBritt Nilsson whose performance is so sensitive that you wonder why she wasn't in more after this and Secrets of Women. Birger Malmsten is not quite in the same league but gives a wellcontrasted performance still. All in all a lovely film if not quite among Bergman's very best movies. 910 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Ingmar Bergman unfolds his 1951 drama Summer Interlude under a bleak canopy of the downhearted and disenchanted an umbrella of gathering doom and gloom as both the summer skies and its respective weather gently gives way to the harsher and colder characteristics of autumn as the rural locale in which the film is predominantly set becomes barer less lush and more frightening as things gradually wind down for a longer greyer haul. The said items greatly compliment a really stark professionally observed and thoroughly engaging mediation on life and attitudes of old twinned with doomed romance whilst one was younger a brilliantly played and fascinating in equal right observation of great intimacy on attitudes to life and those around one when one is younger simultaneously exploring that yearning for times gone by. From its frank opening act culminating in a woman deciding to journey out so as to confront both fears and the pain because of something which still resonates to its closing of the lead peeling certain things away from her as she additionally quite literally reflects into a mirror following a somewhat successful journey it is a devilishly involving romanticdrama which works brilliantly.The film covers young Marie Nilsson a Swedish ballerina whose mind and whose memories make up the bulk of the film's runtime as she ventures out to a more rural part of her country but only when the hard graft of bringing to life an incarnation of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake is temporarily halted. Her decision to do so is inspired by a collection of things she receives in the post her facial reaction occupying most of the frame as a diegetic alarm bell within the theatre she's working sounds off and acts as a fitting soundtrack overlying the imagery. Once back on the floor following the rolecall bell and practising again the film presents us with what appears to be two or three different soundtracks of internal and external music playing over the images as these rather dramatic dance procedures are presented to us in a relatively close up format whilst the impact of what was read or discovered barely a scene ago resonates. Post practise a session brought to a premature end following some technical malfunction with required stage equipment Marie leaves the building with her journalist boyfriend David Kjellin.We discover that she has had little time for him recently the manner in which the production crew drive Marie fresh in our minds Marie taking this opportunity to bury the proverbial hatchet by temporarily ditching David as well as everything and everyone else by leaving the mainland and heading on out to a more secluded rural spot featuring lakes lakehouses woods and isolated manor houses. Once there at this somewhat desolate cold murky and rather frightening place the film will cover events from thirteen years ago when she was barely out of her teenaged years and a love affaircomefriendship with young boy Henrik Malmsten doubling up as her first love. The harking back begins with the travelling by boat each item acting as its own landmark upon which Marie's memory acts on particular cues and Henrik's admitting to feeling for her through performance or third party spectatorship specifically that he has watched her perform many times as a ballerina and has felt how he does through these observations before having even met her.Once at the island during her flashback the warm weather and summer surroundings make for perfect conditions as she visits an aunt and uncle that live there the occupying of a small beach house all by herself and prospect of lake swimming and time off greatly alluring. The weather compliments the deliberately romanticised nature of her memories her attitude to most of those around her flirtatious and adventurous to say the least her more recent opinions on these things we come to feel nothing but regretful. Her bond with Henrik is highly charged in a sexual manner without there ever being much in the way of embrace a series of energetic altercations and interactions in what we assume to be the relatively searing heat seeing the pair of them wear little for most of the time as sessions of swimming in the nearby lake goes hand in hand with the erotic crawling around on allfours in front of each other on the shore constructing mere games while on occasion Henrik's own glee at eating wild fruit out of Marie's hands is additional content. Inbetween all of this sees the prancing and gallivanting around inspired by Marie's own occupation as a dancer the very item that is the reason Henrik feels as he does occurring.Where in the past Marie slept in her bathing costume and woke up with a warm glowing smile on her face as she leaped out of bed to tear open the curtains and then charge into the water to swim times change. Where once she was happy as could be and couldn't wait to get started in the mornings during this holiday away solemn and rueful looks around the locale that has remained the same occupy her lone statuelike figure as she hurtfully reminisces to herself. The film is a painful mediation but an honest and enthralling enough study of a young woman eventually coming to accept what has happened and we feel come to embrace what it is she currently has in her life. In every regard it is a superior piece of doomed romance captured elegantly on film.".

	schema:reviewBody "For those who first discovered Ingmar Bergman's work through the internationally acclaimed masterpieces of the late 1950s there can be a reluctance to go too far back in time before that. After all weren't the Swedish director's earliest films journeyman efforts where he did not have much control over the filmmaking process and he had not yet found his distinct style? I at any rate get a feeling like this from his 1952 picture Summer with Monika. I was delighted however to find that the even earlier Summer Interlude to be a strong film. While shot in 1950 it fully anticipates Bergman's mature career.As the film opens we are introduced to Marie MajBritt Nilsson a successful ballerina in Stockholm who is however visibly unsatisfied and emotionally distant from those around her. As she takes a ferry out to the Stockholm archipelago the film switches into flashback mode and we learn the whole story of what made her what she is. Thirteen years before while still a student and on summer holiday at the family cottage she had a brief fling with Henrik Birger Malmsten. This was a romantic  and very nearly sexual  awakening for them both and Bergman depicts it with all the wistfulness of an adult looking back on the heady days of youth just like the film's protagonist. Yet summer does not last forever and events move in a direction that prevents the two from staying together.As I said this is already mature Bergman in some of its concerns belief in God and dissatisfaction at God's silence interpersonal relationships and the feeling that people wear a mask when dealing with others and of course the fleeting nature of the bright and warm Nordic summer. I will not however call this one of Bergman's very greatest films. The ending after we return to the present day from the flashback feels wrong somehow the rhythm suddenly jarring and Bergman's point inchoate.Yet overall this is a satisfying picture to sit through and there are many details to appreciate. Nilsson's acting is ultracoquettish and the sexual frankness on display here is surprising this is in fact more daring than Summer with Monika a film with a wider such reputation internationally. The supporting roles by Georg Funkquist and Rene Bjrling as middleaged friends of Marie's family lend the film more depth their failed marriage is a moving counterpoint to the heady passion of the young lovers.".

Movie is black and white really slow about ballerina and I'm allergic to ballet and on top of it all it's Bergman who is known to be boring. I'm against prejudice but mostly unaware how much I'm susceptible to it. Exactly what I specified as reasons to write off this movie as unwatchable makes it a masterpiece. You just have to relax give over to it reject preformed thoughts and enjoy art. The moment I stopped hating it movie enchanted me. After rehearsal is delayed for the evening ballerina goes to stroll around nearby island where she spent summer as young girl and fell in love for the first time. She just visits spots from her past and remembers. Story is simple and slow but strong and deep. Acting is unbelievably emotional. Camera and directing are fantastic. I felt that authors gave special attention and love to every frame. Every cadre is masterpiece of black and white photography. In last few decades life speeds up more and more and cinematography follows. Today's generations are trained to watch complicated thrillers extreme sex and violence cheap humor sitcom romance and stories that move in speed of light. Film more and more becomes cheap entertainment without meaning. Movies like this one are here to remind us why is cinematography considered one of arts.910".

	onyx:emotionText "Honestly I have no idea why did I take this movie at all. After only few minutes I was at the edge of giving up o it. Movie is black and white really slow about ballerina and I'm allergic to ballet and on top of it all it's Bergman who is known to be boring. I'm against prejudice but mostly unaware how much I'm susceptible to it. Exactly what I specified as reasons to write off this movie as unwatchable makes it a masterpiece. You just have to relax give over to it reject preformed thoughts and enjoy art. The moment I stopped hating it movie enchanted me. After rehearsal is delayed for the evening ballerina goes to stroll around nearby island where she spent summer as young girl and fell in love for the first time. She just visits spots from her past and remembers. Story is simple and slow but strong and deep. Acting is unbelievably emotional. Camera and directing are fantastic. I felt that authors gave special attention and love to every frame. Every cadre is masterpiece of black and white photography. In last few decades life speeds up more and more and cinematography follows. Today's generations are trained to watch complicated thrillers extreme sex and violence cheap humor sitcom romance and stories that move in speed of light. Film more and more becomes cheap entertainment without meaning. Movies like this one are here to remind us why is cinematography considered one of arts.910";

As for the movie itself it's pretty much what most would expect from an Ingmar Bergman film....something that leaves you depressed and feeling that life has no meaning!!The film begins with Marie a veteran ballerina. When she receives an old diary she begins to think back to her youth and her doomed relationship with an ultraserious young man Henrik. You see them enjoying each other and looking to the future...all the while you KNOW it cannot end well....and it doesn't. By the end Marie has said that he hates God that life has no meaning and she's essentially waiting to die...all a bit much for a 28 yearold woman.The overall film is naturally unpleasant. It has lovely moments but considering how it all plays out...well let's just say it's NOT a movie that the clinically depressed should watch!! Worth seeing but not among Bergman's very bestmostly because although the film is shot so wonderfully it's existential angst is tough to watch AND it made me laugh in the flashback scenes at a nearly 30 yearold actress is playing a girl of only 15!".

Bergman's endings are poor a fair amount of time it seems to me but I would say this one is worse than usual. Otherwise I liked it a lot. I tend to find Bergman's presuperstardom films more exciting than the canonical ones. He's not as steeped in his own themes and the characters are allowed to seem more human and less like chesspieces of allegory. The sense of the Scandanavian landscape is great in this one of his relatively few films shot on location. One senses the great relief of the warm but brief summer of the flash back scenes. And the scenes in the autumnal present seem well bleakScandanaviancold bleak. I imagine these scenes have inspired more than one Black Metal album cover. The main actress MajBritt Nilsson gives a great performance as an adolescent girl in the flashbacks and as a grown woman facing the end of youth in the narrative present. Both she and DP Gunnar Fischer were Bergman regulars before being replaced by more celebrated artists. They deserve their due in what has come to be known as the Bergman lexicon. I think I can say that none of my very favorite films are by Bergman. For me none of his works are as great as the very best films of Ozu Antonioni Wenders or Bresson. But then again the Swede made so many really really good movies that it does put him in a category all his own.".

Bergman also was quoted on more than one occasion that this particular film was the first in which his independent voice was heard.Like Summer with Monika which appeared two years later Summer Interlude focuses on the relationship between a young couple spending their summer in the Stockholm archipelago. Despite a dark plot twist Summer Interlude ends up on an optimistic note in contrast to Monika which highlights the pessimism of a relationship gone sour.Bergman's protagonist is Marie MajBritt Nillson an emotionally cut off 28 year old ballet dancer about to perform in a final dress rehearsal of Swan Lake. Marie's ordinary world is the backstage at the theater where she works. Although it takes a while to get to the inciting incident where the story gets going we're content to observe all the backstage machinations as Bergman's truelife experience in the theater is proffered in high relief.While the dress rehearsal is delayed due to a technical glitch Marie receives a package containing the longlost diary of her collegeaged lover Henrik whom she had an intense relationship when she was 15 years old this propels her to take a ferryboat to the archipelago where the two young lovers began an illfated relationship marred by a horrible tragedy.We flashback to those halcyon days of youth with Nillson transforming herself into a carefree fledgling ballet student. She's staying with two friends of her deceased mother whom she refers to as her Aunt Elisabeth and Uncle Erland. The Uncle proves to be a lascivious character making it clear that he has designs on the teenager despite the complete inappropriateness of the situation. Marie innocently dismisses Erland's behavior and nothing comes of it until much later.The bulk of the story concerns Marie's relationship with Henrik. Bergman's portrait of Marie a mercurial waif of sorts but also completely devoted to her ballet craft is the best part of the film. One of the highlights of their interaction is a completely original comic animated depiction of the relationship that appears on a record label of all places! Henrik is less developed as a multidimensional characterhe's a brooding fellow who is perhaps on the verge of overcoming his fears about getting out into the world. That's all cut short when Henrik is killed when he mistakenly dives over a cliff into shallow water.Marie is so devastated that she blurts out that she doesn't believe God exists and will hate him until the day she dies. Flash forward to the present and Marie meets up with Uncle Erland who admits that it was he who sent her Henrik's diary. It was Erland who urged her to cut herself off from her emotions at the time of the accident wouldn't Erland have been a bit more subtle in his exhortations for Marie to bottle herself up as he was engaging in the not so subtle act of seducing her?. Nonetheless in the present Marie now makes it clear that she despises Erland for how he took advantage of her.Summer Interlude ends with an uncharacteristic happy ending. The woman who cursed God thirteen years earlier and endures the ballet master's cogent analysis of her current situation of emotional paralysis suddenly does a 180 degree allows her current boyfriend David to read Henrik's diary and then the next day kisses him before throwing herself optimistically into to the now live performance of Swan Lake.The abrupt transition between the wounded teenager turned adult and optimistic professional dancer doesn't quite ring true. Nonetheless all the hints of Bergman's masterpieces soon to come are there in Summer Interlude especially the masterful cinematography of Gunnar Fischer one of Bergman's longtime collaborators. Summer Interlude is worth watching in its own right as there are still many elements indicative of a true master film director at work.".

She then peruses a nostalgic pad written from her summer 10 years ago and is in a conflict with her nostalgia and the tragedy that entails through that nostalgia... This is where the movie shines it's profoundly stimulating for me to watch a story where it's unfolding through a period where the character seems to be unable to engage with the world and with the biggest anthropological study of how we're treated with it through the turning point at a happier time. It's I'm sure an overused staple in Drama or Romance today here it is used to great avail and it is the strongest part of the film. She grows deeply in love with Where she says that God is doing a scant job of helping her in her time of need was deep and very much as a criticism pushed Bergman indulged in his Lutheran Upbringing frequently in his movies I suppose it was a way of expressing philosophy to which he thought was the only way he could paint it on this canvas. Unfortunately here it feels like it was done with a slight reserve She goes in superficial relationship with Hendrick in the flashback sequence where only she can be the mirror into the heart. Maria loves Henrick but really in context I think she's impelled towards him even though you're given not much context as to how this relationship sparked any dynamic you're treated to the recklessness that is attributed to the love and all its might.It's deep and transfixing. Also rather unsettling it doesn't spark anything memorable about the Ballet Dancer she's lovelorn and dwells on her past her Uncle Erland wants her to elope with him despite the fact that she's already in a relationship the weird thing is he is so callous that even with the subsequent tragedy you still feel deep detachment as a criticism it is unsettling and really only plays the part of disrupting your psyche I suppose in conventional Drama it is a bit less realistic but even this infatuation is not really directed well so much to the point where the character is involved and this seems like a stitched up emotion in order to sweep her under the mat.And like Friday the 13th not that this movie is any shape or form related to that it is trash compared to him Bergman makes great use of his setting of the water and would do so onward the sorrows he displays and the insecurity of his characters shun our ideas about the irrationality of relationships and how we console ourselves with partners to feel important both cognitively and knowingly so.The ending is not very resonant but I think this was yet another wink at the audience that she becomes ingratiated to another man A Newspaper Journalist and now that he knows the truth of what happened to Henrick she can now throw herself at him as an empathetic person.My favorite part was in the Dressing Room where the guy talks about the ugly facade created by people and how her absent mindedness while style obscurely understood stands for grandest depths of the artistic medium... Bergman really is enamoured to any art and this is where his canvas would soon manifest in and respectively so.So in conclusion this is not Bergman's best by a long shot but it has his emotional elements it contains enough drama to traverse through and it's a charming nostalgic movie... it doesn't have any significance that any of his later films would have though.".

Bergman really is enamoured to any art and this is where his canvas would soon manifest in and respectively so.So in conclusion this is not Bergman's best by a long shot but it has his emotional elements it contains enough drama to traverse through and it's a charming nostalgic movie... it doesn't have any significance that any of his later films would have though.";

Much of the running time is spent on apparently routine activities but each scene serves a useful purpose in developing the themes settings and characters.The story ties together the fortunes of a traveling troupe of kabuki actors with in the forefront a crucial point in the relationships of Komajuro their leader. The setting in a seaside village offers a suitably languid atmosphere that sets off both plot lines very appropriately. One of the things that is so interesting about Ozu's films is that the settings are so definitively Japanese with plenty of wellconceived details and yet the way that he approaches the story and characters makes his movies seem universal confined neither by time nor place.The characters here are an interesting assortment of theatrical types and villagers. Many of them are relatively onedimensional but they are portrayed with skill and sensitivity making even the simplest of them seem worth knowing. Especially good is Machiko Ky as Sumiko who is also the most interesting of the characters. Ganjiro Nakamura is good too as Komajuro but Ky usually gets the best of their scenes together.Two particularly good scenes between the two are the tense dispute in the rain and the encounter in the train station. In the former scene Ozu's setup for the scene is a perfect complement for the characters' dialogue and actions. In the latter the characters convey deep feelings with the most economical and satisfying of means.This is the kind of movie for which subsequent viewings might even be more enjoyable than the first in the way that coming back to a familiar place can give you an odd sense of peace or security. And it leaves you with the feeling that it would be nice to come back again sometime.".

Set on an small island in the warm southern Japan summer a struggling kabuki troupe comes by boat to stay there for a few shows. They actually stay much longer than that because the leader of the troupe has some personal matters here.The characters in this movie felt so real its as if I know them. And I think back on them fondly. I and the cynic but unexperienced son was it Kiyoshi? the jealous femme fatale Sumiko the lovely mother of Kiyoshi the sweet flower Oyoshi and the others are almost like friends. Ozu succeeds in getting the very best out of the actors so they cease to be actors. Best is Ky Machiko as Sumiko and Nakamura Ganjiro as the troupe leader. I am not all convinced on Kiyoshi though esp. during the Sumiko confrontation.Stylistically this is a perfect film. Camera is fixed in well composed shots and we get to mediate on the surroundings and the people and let it all sink in. Look out for the quarrel scene its simply one of the most powerful scenes I've seen.Music carries the feelings in the movie even if its just too simple songs that I remember. The heat is felt and I'm there sweating with them.Some noted that this is good soap opera I disagree this is drama of the highest order the kind of drama you don't see much in movies at all. This was my first Ozu and its not everybody's favourite it seems still its hard to surpass this..".

Komanjuro goes to visit a woman who runs a sake bar and who we learn is a former lover and with whom he fathered a child though the child is unaware of this fact and believes him to be his uncleTheir son Kiyoshi has just finished high school and Komanju comes to see him as much as his former lover. He hopes that Kiyoshi will be able to become something in his life and not end up like Komanju himself a washedup actor drawing small crowds for his failing samurai productions.When Komajuro talks with his gorgeous young son we can see the excitement in his eyes in his face. The acting here is all rather flat or better it's reserved. Ozu adds a little joke to this later in the film when on a fishing boat Kiyoshi accuses his father of being too muggy in his performance. This adds to the impact of the few emotional and physical outbursts later in the film.The conflict in the film is that of Komajuro's double lives. When his current mistress Miss Sumiko  a jealous and conniving witch of a woman  discovers that he's been seeing some other woman she's enraged and plots what she believes will be his sort of downfall. By hiring a young woman Kayo to seduce Kiyoshi and embarrass Komajuro she plans on making the two seem like different generations of the same person both relating with unimportant actresses thereby ruining Komajuro's hopes of his son becoming somebody important.Unlike most Ozu is an auteur because of what he doesn't do. His unmoving camera which is famous sits placidly observing the characters with interest. I do sometimes wish that the camera would move around curiously interested in the conversations of the characters but maybe Ozu's point was that his camera is or we should be too interested to move and that the events of everyday life need not be jazzed up for entertainment purposes. He seems to mock this idea when he has Komajuro say to Kiyoshi about his plays that basically modern audiences can't appreciate good drama. The entire film is restrained on the rare occasion when people cry they cover their faces and softly whimper.The ending shot of a dark blue sky with red lights from a rolling train reminds us that whether it's 2003 in North America or 1959 in a small Japanese fishing village we're all the same people with the same problems.In and of itself the film is terrifically simple a simple story with simple acting simple music and made even more simple by the simplicity of the static camera. But what makes the film something special rather than just some family drama is the honesty. Ozu isn't after anything big here. Any enlightenment comes from Ozu's realization that the most important conflicts are in the home the ones no one sees the ones we all feel.".

	schema:reviewBody "I wrote this after I saw my first Ozu's film Tokyo Story about a year ago As with every great work the film has its own unique perfection in style rhythm details and artist's vision  but Tokyo Story is very universal in its appeal simply put it is for every parent every son or daughter  for everyone. It was made 50 years ago in Japan about people who lived far away but it is also about all of us our families our problems our guilt and our search for love and meaning. Ozu's film does not require one to be a movie buff or to try to solve complex symbolism to appreciate and love it. It brings smiles because it is a comedy for at least the first 23 and sadness with a high drama of the last 13 of the film. I feel absolutely the same about Floating Weeds. The film is quiet and deceptively simple but its simplicity reminded me the words of Michelangelo Buanorotti. When asked how he created the perfect statues from the shapeless marble lumps he answered It is very simple you just cut off all unnecessary pieces.Ozu's films are perfect  they touch us with rare warmth soft enveloping tenderness and power of human emotions not necessarily with striking visual or sound effects. Floating Weeds is a remake of earlier silent black and white Ozu's film The Story of Floating Weeds. The story is simple an aging traveling actor who is the manager of a kabuki troupe returns to a remote village where he secretly meets his former lover and her 19 year old illegitimate son to whom he is known as uncle. The older man finds happiness in communicating with his son who turned to be a fine young man. His current mistress filled with jealousy because of his attachment to his secret family hires a young beautiful girl the member of a troupe to seduce a boy. Something in this story attracted Ozu so much that he remade the film twenty five years later.Floating Weeds is a beautiful color film and it is the first color Ozu's film for me. The colors are bright and fresh tender and kind  they match the director's style perfectly. The delightful music by Kojun Saito reminds me of Nina Rota music in Fellini's films  nostalgic innocent and rhythmic.".

It's all there. The acting by an allstar cast at the time of Japanese actors including the gorgeous Ayako Wakao is uniformly excellent. The cinematography may be the best I've seen for any color film made in the 1950's. The overall pace was a bit too slow for my liking but it works well with a static camera taking every shot below eye level. This gives the viewer a visual perspective similar to looking at the actors on a slightly elevated stage just as the audience does when watching the plays put on by the itinerant group of actors that centers the film. Overall a wellcrafted work by a recognized master but not for the 'explosions  car chase' crowd. Rating 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Floating Weeds by Yasujiro Ozu is an exquisitely restrained film about a failing acting troupe that travels to a small town and engenders a conflict of generations in a Japanese family. As the film opens a boat moves slowly into the harbor a Japanese coastal village. A Kabuki troupe arrives and begins to pass out leaflets announcing their opening performance. Sadly the opening crowds are small. Komajuro Ganjiro Nakamura the principal actor in the troupe goes off by himself to visit Oyoshi Haruko Sugimura a former lover who runs a Saki bar. She has an adult son Kiyoshi Hiroshi Kawaguchi who Komajuro had fathered many years ago. Komajuro has hidden his identity from the boy because of his shame at being a traveling actor and Kiyoshi only knows of him only as uncle.When Sumiko Machiko Kyo Komajuro's mistress and leading star finds out about this relationship she goes into a jealous rage and hires a young actress Kayo Ayako Wakao to seduce Kiyoshi in order to humiliate his father. Kiyoshi however falls in love with Kayo. Komajuro disapproves and shows his anger but cannot exert parental authority since he has not told his son the truth about his parentage. As the troupe continues to draw small crowds Komajuro's inner pain becomes visible and he strikes out physically against Kayo Sumiko and Kiyoshi. It is only in the surprising conclusion that he seems to regain some sense of acceptance of his circumstances.Floating Weeds is a very intimate experience. The camera does not move but remains focused on the characters as they engage in discussions about commonplace events. As in Bresson the actors show little emotion and speak in a monotone with long silences between questions and answers. The overall effect however is not banality but a sense of the natural rhythm of life. Ozu is a loving observer of human nature not a moralist. There are no saints in this film and each character is vulnerable and deeply human. Komajuro has been stripped of his career his relationship with his son and his female companions who still beg him for forgiveness. He is alone but he has retained his humanity and we feel only compassion for him. The ending is in the phrase of Donald Richie a kind of resigned sadness a calm and knowing serenity which maintains despite the uncertainty of life and things of this world. Floating Weeds is a masterful film from a director who truly respects his audience.".

As I've mentioned The composition in terms of elements space and color is perfect in each shot and follows in a deliberate engineered pattern from the previous shots.The narrative isn't integrated in the way Kurosawa would do  and be considered unJapanese for. But the story does much of that for us.It is a story about pretense and staging with most of the actors playing characters who are actors and have trouble in being an actor.You'll have to work to be engaged in the story. But its rather easy to just sit back and admire the loveliness. Ozu is always worth it for this. I don't know many of his films but this is the most formal of those I know.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the opening scene with the lighthouse in the distance and a bottle on the beach in the foreground which is worthy of being a famous modern minimalist landscape painting the view is pulled back to a shot of the lighthouse from between two boats then to a store front. These shots are the equivalent of a powerful opening paragraph to a novel they draw you in in anticipation of what is to come. Throughout the film the artistry of the color cinematography does not disappoint. Each scene is composed as if it were a painting and the use of color is singularly striking. A blackandwhite viewing of this film would lose about 80 of its appeal.The story is that of a traveling Kabuki theater troupe arriving to perform in a small Japenese village. This is not the troupe's first visit to the village and the leader of the troupe Komajuro Arashi had fathered an illegitimate boy there some eighteen years in the past. When Komajuro visits the mother of his son for the first time in twelve years complications ensue.Some remark that this is a simple story simply told. As far as its being a simple story it is no simpler than say Othello which could be summarized as Proud soldier meets tragic end due to jealousy. The treatment of the corrosive effects of jealousy pride deception and male ego in Floating Weeds make for anything but a simple tale. As far as its being simply told it is in fact most skillfully told  as the movie progresses the combination of sound and image have a subtle accumulating effect on mood heightening awareness. It is frequently the case that the appearance of simplicity in a work of art as in Floating Weeds is difficult to achieve. The music is a cross between the score for a French comedy and a work of Arvo Prt but it adroitly reflects the shifting moods of the film which alternate between serious and comic sometimes being simultaneously serious and comic. Ozu does not allow his movie to become overly ponderous it is leavened with humor. For example when the troupe is enjoying a day at the beach one of the members says with seriousness The sky's so blue it's sad to which another replies Don't be silly I want to eat a big cutlet.It is difficult not to be offended by Komajuro's physical abuse of his mistress his son and his son's lover. And the general acceptance of male dominance is hard to digest. I am not sure what we are supposed to feel about Komajuro at the end but I found that his particular personality flaws distanced me from any deep caring about him or his fate. I had more concern about the future of his son and the women who were involved with him.".

In other words the typical Hollywoodstyle ending is NOT what you get from this movie.This film was originally made by Ozu in 1934though oddly this version is silent.

Is this story about the play or anything to be derived from that does it relate to the people of the town who are there for the first few minutes we can hardly make out anything. Yasujiro Ozu the director of this film seems to be a master of intrigue. The beginning is so very intriguing that the first 15 minutes made me sit through the whole film. Also the unrelated shots that are shot geometrically with perfect symmetry. Be it of the light house or the rain drops through windows or close ups or long shots. I was amazed by a family drama story being told with such perfection of framing It's a story of a father and so the father knows the son but the son does not know the relationship between the mother and this man and only at the end realizes that the man who often comes to his house is his father. There is a confrontation scene that's done well. But above all actors I loved the acting of the stepmother don't remember her name who determines to undo the conspiracy and unveil the relationship between her husband and a woman he frequently visits. It's a movie thats simple in many ways but yet the grandeur is bought to it by the intrigue and the sublime cinematography that's done beautifully. Through the journey of this film I have understood that Yasujiro Ozu himself was one of the finest cinematographers ever. I am going with 35 for a movie that is good but a 55 must be given for cinematography alone. This one must be watched for the way camera is handled.".

Through the journey of this film I have understood that Yasujiro Ozu himself was one of the finest cinematographers ever. I am going with 35 for a movie that is good but a 55 must be given for cinematography alone. This one must be watched for the way camera is handled.";

	schema:reviewBody "FLOATING WEEDS  OZU 1959. image1.jpego Revival viewed at the Encore Theater in Hollywood in 1975 on a double bill with Kurosawa's Dlodeskaden. Original review published in Rafu Shimpo Los Angeles Japanese daily newspaper. Film number two of the evening truly a stroke of programming genius was Ozu's virtually unknown 1959 masterpiece Floating Weeds Ukigusa. Also in color this is one of Ozu's most powerful films yet for some strange reason it has never been shown in this country outside of museums or obscure college series screenings. The film stars Ganjiro Nakamura a remarkable actor of Kabuki background and one of the great old men to be seen on film. Ganjiro is the eternal sukebei  the lovable strongwilled dirty old man  a role in which he has no peer. In this picture he has two mistresses a young one Machikyo Kyo of Rashomon and Ugetsu fame who is an actress in his traveling Kabuki troupe and an older one played by Haruko Sugimura who is surely one of the best actresses of all time anywhere. In addition he has a daughter Ayako Wakao by mistress number two and thoroughly disapproves of her boy friend Hiroshi Kawaguchi. At the time Wakao was Daiei's reigning female box office star with her fresh ravishing beauty and all around radiance. Here she is paired with the dominant Japanese actress of a decade earlier Kyo who was still very attractive and still going strong. The film deals with the conflicts arising out of these relationships and the resulting effect on the career of the old actor. The confrontation between mistresses Machiko and Haruko with Machiko screaming her defiance at the old man who has just thrown her out into a driving rain storm is one of the most powerful scenes in the entire normally gentle Ozu repertoire. This film a major Daei release of 1959 lensed by master cameraman Kazuo Miyaguchi and produced by legendary film mogul Masaichi Nagata is truly a neglected gem not to be missed if it ever comes your way. NOTE This film was the enhanced supercharged remake of Ozu's own prewar Black and white Ukigusa which came out in 1934. The name Wakao means Young Tail !".

Let me expand upon one particular angle that might make this film more accessible.Other reviewers have already commented on the films beauty in color the pace of normal real life in a seaside village and the intimacy of the film. Others have also mentioned in negative commentary that they really didn't like any of the characters. This point actually is the reason why the film for me passes beyond good to brilliant.Although the characters have charm and appeal they also have many unappealing flaws Sumiko's jealous vengeance Kayo's blind following of malicious orders Komajuro's blatant concealing of the truth of his being Kiyoshi's father and subsequent pathetic attempt to reenter his life and become his acting father and more. But this made me a more active audience membermuch like real theater doesmade me want to reach out and grab the actors saying You fools! What are you doing!? You can see them make the poor choices that lead to recklessness of Sumiko and the breakups of Kayo and Kiyoshi as well as Komajuro and Kiyoshi for example. The characters seem to think that they are trapped that it is their fate. And Komajuro and Sumiko feel that resignation as they come to accept each other and their flaws at the end. But for me it was a wakeup call that moved me out of my seat. The major human relationship problems could have been helped with better choices. The characters give up too easily on trying to understand each other. Instead of trying to save face by hiding their problems or violently repressing them Komajiro could have been forthcoming about his past with Sumiko Komajuro and Kiyoshi's mother could have gone straight to the truth with their son about Kiyoshi's father and about Sumiko's jealous rage in getting Kayo to seduce him. These choices seem to be more difficult to carry out but they would have nonetheless eased the tension of the plot and averted catastrophe. Communication and striving to understand each other even the ones most important to us is not an easy thing.By setting up these struggles on the screen Ozu empowers his audience to take their own lives beyond that of the characters limited to the fated script. I think it's the colorful beauty of the scenes the serenity of the seaside village the fact that the characters have likable aspects as well as alltoohuman flaws and the masterful construction of the film as a whole that helps drive this process. Movies do well to inspire us but they don't always do so by showing us flawless heroes to live up to or tell us what the moral of the story is. Sometimes we learn by understanding how others have failed while coming to our own conclusions on how they could have fared better.".

Even the simplest things  a decaying pier an aging boat a simple noodle shop is rendered both mundane and beautiful. Ozu never gives us fancy tracking shots or elaborate montages. Just the simplest of composed images and simple but always relevant little images to move the story on. The acting is wonderful from the leads down to the minor characters who make up the troupe. The gorgeous Michiko Kyo is admirably lacking in vanity as the visibly aging actress and she is thoroughly believable as the former prostitute turned actress not at the time considered a big step up in society who nearly destroys everything in a fit of jealousy.For those who hesitate to watch an Ozu film because of the perception of his being very 'Japanese' and 'arty' just get this film out and see why he was adored by ordinary fans.

Basically set in the summer of 1958 at a seaside town in the Inland Sea there is the arrival of a troupe of travelling players headed by lead actor and owner Komajuro Arashi Ganjir Nakamura the other players promote their acts. Komajuro goes to visit old flame Oyoshi Haruko Sugimura who had a son with him Kiyoshi Homma Hiroshi Kawaguchi but the grown up son who works in the post office believes the visitor is his uncle not his father. Komajuro's current mistress and lead actress Sumiko Machiko Ky becomes jealous of her lover being with his old flame and so that she cannot say anything to ruin him he takes her away and breaks up with her. To get some kind of revenge Sumiko pays fellow pretty and young troupe actress Kayo Ayako Wakao to seduce Kiyoshi after initially refusing she does give in to this and in the long time they spend together she does actually fall for the son and she tells him the truth he says it does not matter. Komajuro confronts Kayo when he finds out the couple are engaged she says it is no longer for money from Sumiko and angry he goes to talk to Sumiko who refuses any kind of reconciliation and with business bad he decides to break up the troupe and for them to play one last night. Oyoshi persuades him that if he is leaving soon that he should tell Kiyoshi about his true parentage he agrees but angry to see him and Kayo together he has a violent moment and beats them both and he leaves without saying much at all. Kiyoshi is prepared to talk to and forgive Komajuro but he leaves before he gets the opportunity and on the train Komajuro happens upon Sumiko who has nowhere to go so they reconcile and decide to go to Kuwana together. Also starring Kji Mitsui as Kichinosuke and Chish Ry as Theatre Owner. The cast and the direction was fine I can see why critics say it is the less memorable of the films from Ozu it is not a terrible film but is certainly does not have much interesting material besides the unknown father and son storyline I was not always paying attention so overall it is a moderately alright drama film. Okay!".

Basically set in the summer of 1958 at a seaside town in the Inland Sea there is the arrival of a troupe of travelling players headed by lead actor and owner Komajuro Arashi Ganjir Nakamura the other players promote their acts. Komajuro goes to visit old flame Oyoshi Haruko Sugimura who had a son with him Kiyoshi Homma Hiroshi Kawaguchi but the grown up son who works in the post office believes the visitor is his uncle not his father. Komajuro's current mistress and lead actress Sumiko Machiko Ky becomes jealous of her lover being with his old flame and so that she cannot say anything to ruin him he takes her away and breaks up with her. To get some kind of revenge Sumiko pays fellow pretty and young troupe actress Kayo Ayako Wakao to seduce Kiyoshi after initially refusing she does give in to this and in the long time they spend together she does actually fall for the son and she tells him the truth he says it does not matter. Komajuro confronts Kayo when he finds out the couple are engaged she says it is no longer for money from Sumiko and angry he goes to talk to Sumiko who refuses any kind of reconciliation and with business bad he decides to break up the troupe and for them to play one last night. Oyoshi persuades him that if he is leaving soon that he should tell Kiyoshi about his true parentage he agrees but angry to see him and Kayo together he has a violent moment and beats them both and he leaves without saying much at all. Kiyoshi is prepared to talk to and forgive Komajuro but he leaves before he gets the opportunity and on the train Komajuro happens upon Sumiko who has nowhere to go so they reconcile and decide to go to Kuwana together. Also starring Kji Mitsui as Kichinosuke and Chish Ry as Theatre Owner. The cast and the direction was fine I can see why critics say it is the less memorable of the films from Ozu it is not a terrible film but is certainly does not have much interesting material besides the unknown father and son storyline I was not always paying attention so overall it is a moderately alright drama film. Okay!";

	schema:reviewBody "A theatre troupe comes to a coastal town in Japan including the leader of the troupe who had previously visited twenty years earlier and fathered a child with a local woman. It starts off with too many characters engaged in random conversations. Although it takes a while for the main story line to emerge the film becomes more interesting once it gets to that point. As one would expect from Ozu the acting here is generally good if somewhat theatrical. The cinematography is quite colorful helped by the picturesque seaside setting. Unfortunately the plot is rather mundane and melodramatic with themes of seduction and infidelity more suited to a trashy Hollywood movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Viewed on DVD. Restoration  ten 10 stars. Pictorially this film is a work of art static scene by static scene the camera never moves. Color cinematography is simply gorgeous . Set decoration is stunning. Costumes are eyepopping beautiful. It is by far the most endtoend sumptuously mounted film from the classical period of the Japanese cinema! The director also leaves out most of his customary trademarks of ugliness overhead power lines clothes lines ungainly mass transient etc.. The script has been punched up sufficiently to hold the viewer's attention through patches of dramatic tediousness and outright boredom. Events are usually well telegraphed in advance so there are few if any surprises. The film is too long. There is the lingering impression that the director may have had a hard time letting go of his creation and bringing matters to an end. Acting is first rate some actors are from the director's excellent in effect repertory company. Sound is fine and crisply captures Westernaccented Kansaiben dialog. Subtitles seem just right. The score copies music from the Italian cinema of the era. Best watched on a large screen to fully appreciate the artistry. WILLIAM FLANIGAN PhD.".

	schema:reviewBody "Floating Weeds from 1959 is a film from Yasujiro Ozu's final period and also one of his first in color. He told the story before in 1934 only that was a black and white silent film. But he followed the plot of the first film very closely.The story has a mediocre traveling Kabouki troupe reaching a small port village in Southern Japan to perform. Their performances only attract a few townspeople but to Komajuro Ganjiro Nakamura the troupe's leader the visit is an important occasion to meet his old lover Oyoshi Haruko Sugimura and their grown child Kiyoshi Hiroshi Kawaguchi who is about to enter college and believes Komajuro is his uncle. When Komajuro's current lover the pretty Sumiko Machiko Kyo learns about this she blows in rage and persuades another actress of the troupe the pretty Kayao Ayako Wakao to seduce Kiyoshi. Kayao succeeds in the mission so much so that she falls in love with Kiyoshi. When Komajuro learns about their relation he doesn't take it so well Komajuro repeatedly beating Sumiko and Kayo while shouting to them you slut are scenes that would probably not be filmed today especially since he wants his son to have a life above that of a traveling acting troupe.This is not the very best of Ozu I put the so called Noriko trilogy there one of the crowning heights of cinema but is still very good. There are a lot of Ozu's characteristic style to watch here the camera put at a knee's height the so called pillow shots etc. The movie includes a famous scene with Komajuro and Sumiko fighting and arguing over a street where the rain is pouring. The performances are terrific especially those of Nakamura and Kyo. Chishu Ryu who was in dozens of Ozu's films has a bit role here as the theater manager.".
