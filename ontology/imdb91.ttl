The intriguing answers are provided in the film to the patient thoughtful viewer. This is not a film for the impatient viewer. Starlight accessible cosmic wonders begins and ends the filmsilence dominates the soundtrack except for sounds of crickets lowing of cattle and an occasional bird cry.This opening shot sets the tone for a film made with nonprofessional actors. The film won the Jury's Grand Prize at Cannes 2007. It is a spectacular film experience for any viewer who loves cinema. This is my first Reygadas film and I have become an admirer of this young man.Mexican filmmaker Carlos Reygadas writes his own scripts. He is one of the few filmmakers of importance today who does thatalongside Spain's Pedro Almodovar and Japan's Naomi Kawase.Reygadas' stunning movie Silent Light is centered on a collapsing marriage within a religious Mennonite community in Mexico speaking not Spanish the language of Mexico but a rare European language Plautdietsch that mixes German and Dutch words leading up to the eventual renewal and strengthening of this fragile family. Reygadas begins the film with a 6minute long timelapse photography of dawn breaking to the sounds of nature and ends the film with twilight merging into the night.The opening shot was lost on many viewers a noisy viewer kept talking three minutes into the film unaware that the film was running until I had to reveal this surprising fact to him at the 12th International Film festival of Kerala. The film's opening shot was so stunning that after the 6th minute the audience who grasped what was happening began clapping having savored the effect. The last time I recall a similar involuntary reaction from an audience was when Godfrey Reggio's Koyaanisqatsi was screened decades ago in Mumbai at another International Film Festival.There is something magical supernatural in nature if we care to reflect on a daily occurrence. There is a touch of director Andrei Tarkovsky in Reygadas' Silent Light as he captures the magical fleeting moments in life that all of us encounter but do not register as such. There is a touch of director Terrence Mallick's cinema as he connects human actions with nature a heartbroken wife runs into a glen and collapses trying to clutch a tree trunk. And there is a touch of director Ermanno Olmi in the endearing rustic pace of the film. Whether he was influenced by these giants of cinema I do not knowbut many sequences recall the works of those directors.That the film recalls Carl Dreyer's Ordet 1955 is an indisputable fact. Ordet was based on a play by a Danish playwright Kaj Munk. Reygadas film is based on his own script that almost resembles a silent film because of the sparse dialog. Both films are on religious themes on falling in love outside marriage and leading up to an eventual miracle. Reygadas uses these basic religious and abstract ingredients to weave a modern story that is as powerful as Dreyer's classic work by adding the realistic and accessible components of natureautomated milking of milch cows without milking the cows would be in distress and a family bathing scenedo seem to be included as daily occurrences that have a cyclical similarity to the main plotthe collapse and rebuilding of a marriage. Reygadas' cinema invites the viewer to look at nature captured by the film and discover parallels to the storyline. This film is one of the richest examples of cinema today that combines intelligently a structured screenplay creative sound management and marvelous photography that soothes your eyes ears and mind.Early in the film the family is introduced sitting around a table in silent prayer before partaking a meal. The silence is broken by the ticktock of the clock. The children are obviously unaware of the tension in the room except that they would like to eat the food in front of them. The adults are under tension. When the head of the family remains alone on the table symbolic statement he breaks into uncontrollable sobs. He gets up to stop the loud clock symbolic that evidently disturbed the silent prayer. This action becomes important if we realize that the clock never bothered the family silent prayers before. All is not well. Time has to stand still.Composition of scenes of scenes in the film remind you of Terrence Mallickthe balancing visuals of men and children sitting on bales of hay on traileragain recalling a cosmic balancing force in life Both Silent Light and Ordet revolve around a miracle where a woman's love for a male lover and tears for his dead wife leads to calming a turbulent marriage. The film is not religious but the Mennonite world is religious. Religion remains in the background In the foreground is love between individuals lovers husbands wives sons parents et al. What the film does is nudge the viewer to perceive a mystical cosmic world a world beyond the earth we live in which is enveloped in love. There is a cosmic orbit that the director wants his viewers to notesimilar to the erring husband driving his truck in circles as though he was in a trance on the farm while listening to music. Mennonite children who are not exposed to TVs seem to enjoy the comedy of Belgian actor and singer Jacques Brel in a closed van. While Reygadas seems to be concentrating on the peculiarities of a fringe religious group the universal truths about children's behavior and adult behavior captured in the film zoom out beyond the world of Mennonites. They are universal.The film begins in silence and ends in silence against a backdrop of stars in the night. The indirect reference to the Silent night hymn is unmistakable. For the patient viewer here is a film to enjoy long after the film ends.".

There is so little you can chew on no acting inhibited emotions no laughter even the acclaimed picture is unsatisfying don't see this movie for that reason. Everything is internal barely reaching the surface. If you can tune in though like in a meditation you will become ultra sensitive sense the subtle and begin to enjoy. Some scenes may even totally fill your spirit. One word of caution though if you intend to see this movie in a theatre it is very likely that some people will become uncomfortable and leave keep talking protest etc... which makes it even more difficult to watch it with serenity so renting it as a DVD may be a more suitable option.

	schema:reviewBody "Set in the austere Mennonite community of northern Mexico Carlos Reygadas' Silent Light is not about suffering and sin but about the enormous power of compassion and what it takes to be truly alive. Filmed in consultation with the Mennonites a Christian sect of European descent who speak Plautdietsch a German dialect the film is paced very slowly almost excruciatingly so but its meditative pace allows those with patience to enter the interior lives of the characters in a way that is normally not possible in cinema. With outstanding performances by nonprofessional actors that reminds us of Bresson and Tarkovsky the film's physical beauty brings poetry to ordinary events such as machines harvesting crops the milking of cows and the faces of children having their hair shampooed. Johan Cornelio Wall a father of five young children is involved in a love triangle that has made him remorseful and uncertain of God's approval. Torn between his wife Esther Miriam Toews and his lover Marianne Maria Pankratz he openly confesses his adulterous behavior to his wife as he entertains thoughts of abandoning his family. In obvious pain Johan sits alone at the kitchen table and weeps after Esther and the children have gone out following the morning ritual of breakfast and silent prayer but his remorse does not prevent him from continuing to meet and have sex with Marianne. After Johan goes to a garage to pick up a crankshaft for his tractor he tells his friend Zacarius Jacobo Klassen about his affair then when a familiar song comes on the radio turns up the volume and sings along in an outburst of sudden joy while driving his truck in circles. Later he stops by his parent's farm to tell his father about his affair explaining that he has told Esther about Marianne. His father a preacher hints that the devil may be responsible but also admits that he once also had an affair with a woman other than his mother. In one of the warmest scenes of the film Johan and Esther take the children bathing in a nearby pond a gesture of love that made his infidelity all the harder for Esther to bear. When they are driving alone in a ferocious rainstorm she complains of chest pains and has to get out of the car and walk to a nearby tree in obvious discomfort. A long and quiet film Silent Light touches on some profound themes but keeps its emotional distance. Because there is little emphasis on religious beliefs or the real nature of his emotional and spiritual crisis the film's final homage to Carl Dreyer is not placed in a context where it can achieve either radiance or power and comes off as a second hand copy. Yet though Silent Light doesn't quite overcome its inertia and reach the heights its visual beauty is consoling and at times overwhelming. An exquisite sixminute tracking shot frames the film an opening and closing sequence that attempts to connect our mundane lives to the ineffable beauty of the universe. As the illuminated stars slowly give way to sunlight and we are caressed by the ambient sounds of nature we sense the light slowly beginning to illuminate our planet as we move into a new age long forecasted in Hopi and Mayan tradition.".

Seeing these simple people from the inside is a large part of the interest here even though it's not a documentary. Reygadas makes it a point to get the pace of their lives which is apparently very slow! It's odd to see such deliberate photography in the mold of Ozu with the still camera and the offscreen activity now and then and to realize how difficult it is to pull that off. Only because it doesn't quite work here. It becomes an affectation even so that the curvature of the widescreen and anamorphic I think photography becomes a distraction. The approach however makes for a very quiet movie viscerally and because of that it penetrates the characters and gets to some moving issues.It's a deeply felt story for sure and that was enough to make me want to watch it. But there were times when I felt like I was sitting it out through conviction. It almost forced you to feel sad and to share the loneliness of these country folk who struggle on their farms not to survive but to understand love and meaning. Heavy stuff and laid out with amazing seriousness. And also shown in clear appreciative views. You will get the feeling sometimes that there ought to be someone out in this forlorn landscape who is happy and who has some sense of quick wit. But apparently not! It's a despondent experience and that actually is what I liked about it. But I'm not sure it is enough this drawn out sadness alone with lots of ambient droning sounds very vivid overwhelms the apparent plot of a love that isn't appropriate.Is it good? I think some people will totally love it. I'd recommend it for those who want to really lose themselves in another world in realistic and un adorned terms a world that is unspectacular on the surface and very probing and beautiful within.".

Their fine performances create a believable and frequently captivating world for the viewer. We are given insights into the daytoday lives of the family as the story slowly develops in stages grimly charting the inexorable demise of the relationship between husband Johan and wife Esther.Around the stark central narrative there are some charming scenes and some superb camera work. Even the scenes where the children playing in the pond are alltooaware of the presence of the camera carry a certain fascination. Having said that there are too many shots where the camera lingers to seemingly little effect except to make the viewer feel distinctly uncomfortable as one other reviewer has pointed out there is something rather unnerving about the kissing scene involving Johan and Marianne.I also feel compelled to add that there is a rather bizarre twist at the end of what would otherwise be a straightforward and powerful story. For me this threw into some confusion the preceding two hours of film and left the story hanging on an oddly unsatisfactory note. Despite the slow pacing and somewhat bewildering ending this is a strong distinctive piece of filmmaking and I would recommend that it be viewed in a cinema rather than on the small screen so as to get the best of some superb camerawork.".

One way is you make it an exciting storytelling with lots of twists surprises and well placed moments of tension turned to gold by great acting and tasteful camera angles and lighting.The other way is this.People will say this movie is boring. It is. They will say it drags itself. It does.But while it does it becomes painstakingly realistic. An average Joe doesn't spend his life fighting terrorists and being tossed around by the explosions he can't avoid and while an average Joe can have a war land on his head or a ship sink under his feet the really unlucky Joe will spend his life trying to make a living with no real chances of a worldwide tragedy turning him into a martyr or a hero.Stellet Licht doesn't feed you the story. The key to deciphering this movie is that you must notice most shots are in a sort of point of view mode that keeps telling you this could be you. What would you think right now? What would you do?.And while it doesn't feed you everything actions and dialogues no matter how simple they sound at first are deeply meaningful and provide amazing food for thought. Marshall MacLuhan once described movies as hot media demanding attention to find the meaning while leaving little space for your own participation as most is fed to you. A movie like The Preadator is hot it doesn't immerse you as much as it attacks your senses of hearing and seeing.In Stellet Licht while visuals and sound are of crucial importance in the beauty of the shots the movie keeps a constant dialogue with the viewer and it's this viewer who ends up making a great part of the movie. This would be the definition of a cool media. In the end everybody will have seen this movie differently and it will be a very intimate experience if only you lay the popcorn's aside and think about what is being shown to you.Watch it with your significant other and you will realize there is so much to talk about unlike with many other movies that leave you with trivialities and little more. So Stellet Licht is more than amazing story telling it's what a dear friend of mine calls art something that intertwines and confuses itself with real life.If not for everybody certainly not for those who expect a movie to spoon feed them and are not willing to incorporate and reinterpret the experience but for those who are willing to think and discuss some of the strong subjects of this movie Stellet Licht is a not just a movie but an enlightening experience.".

	schema:headline " Truly captures the life of Mennonites";
	schema:reviewBody "My comments on this film might be very different as the others. Having been raised as a Mennonite I could understand the majority of what was being said without subtitles. With that in mind I can honestly say that this film is very true to the nature of Mennonite life. Real actors would not have been able to portray the culture this well. The movie is slow paced and very quiet. Everything from the clothing to the speech were realistic. The long silences between speech was a little frustrating but non the less true to reality. Johan's struggle between his love for Ester and Marianne brought a human nature element to the film but I was a disappointed by his father's reaction to it. As a preacher he should not have said he would stand with Johan if he choose to leave Ester. Mennonite faith does not allow divorce. Ester knew about the adultery and yet stayed with Johan through all her pain because she was bound to him in faith. Only in dying could she find peace. This film was wonderfully done however it was slow and not everyone would be able to appreciate the thought and dedication it must have taken to make it as accurate as it was. If you are not Mennonite there are elements to this film you might not understand such as the hymn at Ester's funeral sung without music yet one I have heard many times before. The one thing that really disappointed me was the fact that the speech was not accurately subtitled and at times whole sentences where omitted and meanings where completely different.

	onyx:emotionText "My comments on this film might be very different as the others. Having been raised as a Mennonite I could understand the majority of what was being said without subtitles. With that in mind I can honestly say that this film is very true to the nature of Mennonite life. Real actors would not have been able to portray the culture this well. The movie is slow paced and very quiet. Everything from the clothing to the speech were realistic. The long silences between speech was a little frustrating but non the less true to reality. Johan's struggle between his love for Ester and Marianne brought a human nature element to the film but I was a disappointed by his father's reaction to it. As a preacher he should not have said he would stand with Johan if he choose to leave Ester. Mennonite faith does not allow divorce. Ester knew about the adultery and yet stayed with Johan through all her pain because she was bound to him in faith. Only in dying could she find peace. This film was wonderfully done however it was slow and not everyone would be able to appreciate the thought and dedication it must have taken to make it as accurate as it was. If you are not Mennonite there are elements to this film you might not understand such as the hymn at Ester's funeral sung without music yet one I have heard many times before. The one thing that really disappointed me was the fact that the speech was not accurately subtitled and at times whole sentences where omitted and meanings where completely different. I wish the movie would be retranslated. This film is best viewed knowing that it is not an exciting thriller but a glimpse into a culture that is rare and slowly going extinct. And of that this movie does an extremely good job.";

Silent light is build of less than 10 scenes total each one lasting from 5 to 15 minutes and scarce to not dialog and music. And here is where Silent light success lies being thematically so simple it achieves so much with such rudimentary tools. A conventional story told in an unconventional way. The lack of dialog and music is compensated with environmental sounds and natural light the lack of action is compensated with the inspection of open landscapes and the close ups of expressive faces. Each one of the fragments of this movie is mesmerizing and of increasing beauty. After seen the sunrise of the opening sequence you wonder how can Reygadas match that shot next. But he does the children bathing in the pond Johan singing to a radio song while driving his truck Esther crying in the rain and the funeral scene are all on itself some of the best shorts ever made. Pure cinematographic ecstasis and the stuff that all movies should at least partially hold. Paraphrasing another reviewer fan movies are the corpse that Reygadas kiss is bringing back to life. If this is not why the word poetry was made for then what is it?".

When the woman who introduced the film said it was in the vein of Tarkowsky I got interested. Not many films are made these days with that kind of poetic nature and visual invention. Then the film started. With a sunrise. The biggest clich in cinema? Not when you stretch it for six minutes. It is then supposed to be poetic. Then we meet the dullest family in the history of cinema accompanied by the steady rhythm of a clock. A clich? Yes but you see this is different because it stretches the dullness and boredom to the extremely painful level which made me relate to the man when he appeared to commit suicide. But in the end he just turned off the clock. This is symbolism because like all modern festival art films this movie is about regret the need to turn time back God and bladibla. The lead character is supposedly torn because he has found a woman who makes him feel the way he felt for his wife when he was younger as if he was at one with nature. Cue eternal shots of fields trees the usual. When we meet him and his lover together there is nothing to suggest even a remote sense of passion as their dry tongues interlock for en eternity against poetic lens flare while the actors mechanically eat each other as if it was a meal their grandma had cooked and they just didn't have the heart to turn down. But only after he has explained the nature of their relationship in quasiphilosophical terms to his friend who works as a mechanic which means we have to watch them fix a car for about ten minutes in a traveling shot that reminds me of the first year of film school. For most of the rest of the movie the guy wanders around looks at the sun the snow and so on and has the same discussion with a group of dispassionate confidantes. I won't spoil the blatantly obvious storydevelopments they generally happen about an hour after they would in a Movie of the Week but suffice to say it ends with a sunset that dares you not to scream at the screen. At least The One didn't think it was a Bergman movie. And I suddenly realized why cinema is seen as dying right now. For the most part we only have two alternatives. Mindless but well paced entertainment and fortunecookie philosophy 101 homework movies determined to show exotic people as if anyone who leads a different life than most of us are passionless emptyeyed people at one with nature. As an alternative I'd recommend a long train ride where you spend most of the time looking at the passing scenery and how the light hits it while once in a while glancing at at the faces of people who wish it was over all ready. Don't bring a book. It will be too much like living.".

	schema:reviewBody "I urge readers to watch this. The story is touching and human. A family man who is seized by a new inexplicable love that tells him the old love what he used to think as love was merely peace and habit and yet he can't be sure. Is the new one merely passion? Does he have a right to betray the trust? Deny himself happiness? It is the most profoundly troubling question that I imagine can arise in a lifetime.The film is merely one possible outcome how making a choice can upset the whole universe the question itself is much more difficult and deep. If you're 18 the gravity of it might not register you still have second and third chances ahead of you. But after a certain age I imagine it becomes entirely cosmic entirely about choosing the last person you're going to know and love. My only quibble about this is the stifled Germanic presence all through the film. I'm talking about the deliberately inexpressive faces pauses and careful poses people arranged in symmetries around objects none of which is artful in my world. Well art can be anything so it is not that so much as choosing the world you're going to live in and I'll have none of that stylized pouting in my home suffering can never be an aesthetic.Yet in this hard shell there is a softly pounding heart of beauty.One is how this harsh German presence is softened by the afterglow of a sweeter sun and rolling Mexican landscape which is where the film takes place. Mellowed in this way it brings to the fore a quality I admire in Protestants simple lives joy in austerity and nonattachment. Though it came from historical necessity it's still the closest thing to Zen we've known in Europe.The other thing is even simpler yet that much more beautiful. The film is shot in long quiet sweeps of ordinary nothing those who keep in touch know I am frequently vexed by this technique because it so often becomes merely about style instead of sculpted insight a garment worn a certain way. Transcendent vision in film which is at its most powerful is about unconcealing a fuller sense of world broader horizons. It cannot be a proclamation of love but a gesture that embodies what it means to words are just too easy and cheap whereas the visible action is itself the commitment.Here we have something that is elegant and simple in just the right measure.In the story we have new love that extends from the old a new feeling new beginnings one after the other not always the one desired or anticipated. All through the film we have a dozen or so subtle metaphors about just this feeling of unconcealing a new world of reaching an end which is only the start of the next landscape.My favorite are the following two. A combine threshes a wheatfield a violent clustered image of uprooting only to arrive at the end of the field at an open horizon of fields. And even greater during the river scene the man and soontobe betrayed wife embrace as their children wash below still close their bodies leave the frame and we're left for several lingering moments in the hazy unfocused space of their absence only for the camera to slowly find and focus on a blossoming flower.Breathtaking!So when she departs in the end and miraculously comes to again it the same inner blossom from nothing call it a sense of the mother still being in the world. The world does not end so long as we keep this anticipation of presence fields to see after this one new people to love never bogged down by loss. The hazy landscape of seeming nothingness already contains the flower in that scene it is neither there as we don't see it nor not there as it is there to be found and this all has its meditative sense. I'm glad for this film. From now on whenever it happens that I have to try and illustrate the Buddhist notion of emptiness or shunyata I will reach for this one scene.Something to meditate upon.".

None of this can save the film from it's leaden pace. What moments have heightened emotion tend to be lost in the whole stodginess of proceedings. Spelling out Johan's dilemma so blatantly and so early on is a curious piece of exposition that does not fit in this kind of film  Reygadas should have showed us this instead he tells us the film is certainly long enough to have done this. It does not help that Reygadas cannot generate the sense of transcendence that Dreyer achieved in Ordet. What was an intensely spiritual moment in that film seems like cynical sleightofhand here. While it is encouraging that younger filmmakers have actually seen films by a neglected master like Dreyer there is though a world of difference between imitation and influence.

In the beginning a very slow shot of the sunrise that get us into the mood and is telling us that we're not watching a Hollywood action film for sure. Carlos Reygadas Japn and Battle in Heaven is one of the greatest young filmmaker of our time. He inherited the passion and the visual perspective that Ingmar Bergman had in movies like Winter Light and Through a Glass Darkly. Silent Light has a great cinematography and almost no music it takes us right inside of the human heart to make us feel the emotions and the devastation of what a woman felt when she has lost the most important thing in her life love. Silent Light is pure beauty and it deserves the Oscar without pretensions.".

In the beginning a very slow shot of the sunrise that get us into the mood and is telling us that we're not watching a Hollywood action film for sure. Carlos Reygadas Japn and Battle in Heaven is one of the greatest young filmmaker of our time. He inherited the passion and the visual perspective that Ingmar Bergman had in movies like Winter Light and Through a Glass Darkly. Silent Light has a great cinematography and almost no music it takes us right inside of the human heart to make us feel the emotions and the devastation of what a woman felt when she has lost the most important thing in her life love. Silent Light is pure beauty and it deserves the Oscar without pretensions.";

In this film I leaned over to my partner twice and asked if he wanted to leave but he was sleeping so soundly that I decided to let him rest.The sound effects seemed to capitalize on crunching whether it was snow cereal or grass. The kissing scene was a major turnoff and was one of the few scenes that lacked crunching or ticking. Yes some of the photography was beautiful and could have been condensed to 15 minutes. This was one of the biggest wastes of 2 hrs that I have ever spent.".

	schema:reviewBody "After a long debate with my friend I've decided to still give this movie 4 stars even though it could've easily been 1 star. 4 stars being given for a decent effort made on the visual effects and some only some read on sound effects.This movie is awful. I don't pretend to be an expert on movies with deep meanings and subtle emotions but this pearl simply felt like a violent punch in the groin. It is the first ever movie that I've walked out of. It's probably not fair for me to judge this movie if I didn't give a chance until the end but I simply couldn't take it. In my defense over half the audience left before I did... I know... it's not a very good excuse.Anyways back to the movie. It was awful. It's not about the plot or even the acting. It's how it's all put together. Being a 20something brat I do admit that I enjoy actionpacked films as much as the next dude but I also have cravings for something a little more meaningful than some slasher movie at times and I hoped that Silent Light would answer those cravings. How disappointing.The movie is slow and it insists in a way that becomes so obvious that it's unbearable. Especially sounds effects. The kitchen clock ticking can be heard for about 15mins during a lunchdinner scene... I'm not sure what they went for with that but we get it after 3 mins no need to make it louder and louder. At some point the husband grabs a stool and shuts it off so he can break down in silence... what a relief to be able to cry without the hammering sound of that clock.... give me a break... can you get cheesier than this? Oh yes you can.... When the husband falls back to his roots and seeks advice from his father the father takes him outside where it spontaneously snowed 5 feet and they take a 7 mins stroll in the snow with overly loud sound effects accentuating the crunching sound of the snow as they step through the white field.... again we got the idea after 6 steps no need to do that trick for 3 hours...And nevermind the white subtitles over the white snowy background making it impossible to read what they were talking about.... that one made me laugh hard...The list goes on and on.This review is probably not that good by IMDb standards but I thought I'd share a couple of views on this terrible terrible piece of .... I don't even know what to call it.If I was clever I'd recommend many other titles that are much better but I can't think of any... maybe that's why this movie isn't for me....Don't take my word for it go out and watch it.... but you've been warned...".

	schema:headline " Silent Light and Ordet's Light";
	schema:reviewBody "Michael Ondaatje once said that there is a limit to what films can do in getting below the surface of things. This might well be said of Silent Light. On first reflection it seems a mystery how this film the third by Carlos Reygadas actually manages to work some magic on the viewer without recourse to establishing conventional feelings for its characters. There is no script here which allows a way of rendering people in any depth whatsoever dialogue is spare relaying information in brief clusters of signifying words. This is the last time... Peace  is stronger than love... Poor Esther a character says after lovemaking. The very fact that dialogue relays information stiltedly instead of communicating in a more natural way is a stylistic attenuation which doesn't build a convincing case for itself in the course of the film though eventually a bare minimum of dialogue does enable us to discern the basic dilemma here the issues a married man faces in keeping a mistress or not in a specific sectarian community.On the other hand within this economy there is a vital sense of how light affects appearances  all the varying qualities of light as that which in themselves might generate emotion. But that this happens to the extent which is fulfilling as an experience as many critics seem to think is questionable. Here characters function as IMAGES of people  rather than AS fullydimensional people  just as trees and landscapes function in most films as images of trees and landscapes that is without further requirements. There is a kind of purity resulting in all of this and it's as if a mystery of the generic not archetype is revealed as if each image appears as a pure template  of itself this IS the image of trees in a field at dusk this IS the image of a woman sitting across from a man in a passenger seat of a car this IS the image of a man alone at a table crying... There is a selfconsciousness at play in the sensitivity of the cinematographic light and thus a heightened sense of physical presence. And the performances by nonprofessionals are rendered in a way which recalls Bresson but with a more pronounced distancing. Yet at the same time and unlike Bresson the characters just don't register as fully inhabiting a world. Which begs the question just because human beings merely show up in a film can they qualify as characters?Having said all that I wonder what connection Mr. Reygadas estimated for his project with respect to Carl Theodor Dreyer's film Ordet which appears the intentional factor in making his own largely according to the conjunction of the same main event a miracle in both films. Silent Light is actually only a very slight homage to Ordet shared miracle notwithstanding for all the supposed similarities many critics have wished to concoct between the films. It seems hard to reasonably qualify Reygadas's reapproach to this miracle of faith not to reveal it here which one had no trouble accepting from Dreyer who was a man of deeply religious sensibility  a sensibility generally and notably absent in Reygadas a crucial point which leaves the comparison of both men itself wanting.A rather important omission in general from the critical assessments of the film is the remembrance that in making Ordet Dreyer did adapt a play  through which the matter of revealing the inner states and spiritual conditions of the characters depend on words and the nuances of meaning in language we are communicative expressive beings urban or rural after all. One of Dreyer's supreme gifts was to compliment the emotional weave of the ongoing verbal exchange between characters with visual compositions and lighting illuminating what was outside of the spoken. This perfectly complimentary method one even more refined in his last film Gertrud also based on a play  between word and image  exemplifies the interdependence out of which the meaning of his work arises. In contrast Reygadas favors the laconic approach of images over words and has difficulty producing the same depth of total response from the viewer. If he did indeed intend to seek out the inner lives of his characters albeit in a way apart from language he hasn't achieved much more than a surface of imagistic mystique wherein things tend to signify only themselves as templates without deeper resonance. On balance however it is notable that there is a distancing due to the subtle stylistic effects one can feel even when watching Dreyer's film a feeling of being at a remove from the events unfolding even while one senses being suspended in a spiritual dimension yet in the end one which still somehow feels like real everyday life. This unusual effect also seems to be present in Silent Light.Interestingly when the miracle of the former film appears here it is not a moving event in and of itself and yet paradoxically it effectively becomes such  due to the exquisitely clear lucid visual presentation the transference of the technical qualities of modulated light upon subjects into a miraculous appearance is total. The face of the smiling or crying one is the the face illuminated and transfigured by this light  the entire process of which is ostensibly the real subject of Reygadas's film. But in Dreyer's cinema the mutually dependent transference of meaning between words and images will always account for a more deeply satisfying experience far beyond mere technical control of the medium. Next to Ordet Silent Light will seem ever more slight the more critics try to inflate tenuous connections between the two. One is even tempted to apply Mahler's dictum that interesting is easy beautiful is difficult. Apropos of the ravishing images Reygadas conjures however one might go further here and say that the beautiful truly appears easy but nonetheless a deeper more rewarding interest lies elsewhere.".

	schema:reviewBody "Montgomery Clift is a writer hired to be Miss Lonelyhearts for a newspaper in Lonelyhearts a 1958 film also starring Robert Ryan Myrna Loy Delores Hart and Maureen Stapleton in her film debut.About 30 years ago  yes 30  I saw the play Miss Lonelyhearts with none other than Kelsey Grammar who had not yet gone to Hollywood. The play as well as the book are quite different from what ended up on the screen. In the film the ending was changed to a more upbeat one.This is a great film if you're contemplating suicide because this will take you right over the edge. It is relentlessly depressing with some pathetic characters and some unlikeable ones. Adam Cliftis a man with a hidden past that he keeps even from his girlfriend Delores Hart. All the viewer really knows at first is that he was raised in an orphanage and has a father in prison. The paper on which Adam works is owned by William Shrike an abusive cynical man Ryan who is horrible not only to his employees but to his wife Myrna Loy because of her infidelity 10 years before. This is a man who carries a grudge. When he meets Adam he thinks his sincerity is fake and becomes determined to wear him down. His first step is to hire him as Miss Lonelyhearts. Adam becomes very bothered by the problems his readers send to him especially because he can't help anyone. When Shrike dares him to meet one of the letterwriters he does so. It's Maureen Stapleton a needy woman with a crippled husband who can't make love to her.The performances in this film are very good but the film isn't. Clift apparently was very disappointed in it because it lacked none of the bite of the novel and none of the symbolism of Adam as a Christlike figure bearing the sins of others. Robert Ryan is very convincing as the hateful Shrike and Myrna Loy is beautiful and sad as his wife. Stapleton received an Oscar nomination for her effective performance. An accomplished stage actress Stapleton evokes the desperation of this lonely woman.Montgomery Clift by this time was almost at a point where he was dependent upon the kindness of strangers. He was too much of a risk for Hollywood to be interested. Like so many people who are victims of horrible accidents he had become addicted to painkillers and alcohol. If not for Elizabeth Taylor making a case for him he would not have been cast in Suddenly Last Summer. As it was Mankiewicz almost stopped shooting on the film. He is fragile and glassyeyed here in obvious pain and his voice slurs. The fragility works well in this role as does the sensitivity he brings to the part. He still had a beautiful smile which unfortunately he doesn't get to use much here.It's always wonderful to see Montgomery Clift perform even toward the end of his career. That interesting voice of his the intelligence and sensitivity of his work and the tenderness with which he approached a love scene were unmatched. His film career was relatively short but he left a powerful legacy. Lonelyhearts is not a great film but it stars Montgomery Clift so it's worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nathaniel West's Lonelyhearts is a haunting novella about how an idealistic young man is affected by his job as an advicegiving columnist for his town's newspaper.  It was intelligently adapted for the stage in the mid50's and the film version plainly uses that adaptation as a reference point as much as the novel itself.  In ways the film expands on the play's success opening it up to reveal an idealized 50's picturepostcard town on the surface before centering on the insensitivity lying just underneath. WriterProducer Schary and Director Donohue are to be commended for the atmosphere they have successfully created.  It is unfortunate that they did not have enough faith in the material to resist the temptation to give it a happy ending an ending which really is not in keeping with the events which precede it.It must have seemed like a great idea to cast Montgomery Clift in the lead role of Adam and a few years earlier it would have been but this compelling actor's personal demons had so impacted upon him by this time that it is impossible not to be distracted by his unhealthy state of being. His slurred speech unsteady gait and jerky mannerisms are entirely at odds with this character who is said to have never had a stronger drink than a cocacola.  He is too good of an actor not to have effective moments  he works beautifully with Onslow Stevens who plays his father  but this is a performance that holds our attention largely for unintentional reasons. Maureen Stapleton is sensational in her film debut as a writer to the column who manipulates Adam and her performance would be right at home in a more faithful and successful version of this novel.  Otherwise this is a wellintended film which fails both to adequately reflect the novel on which it is based and to succeed on it's own terms.".

So this is written a couple of weeks prior to TCM's broadcast. I didn't know the film existed as most of today's general public most likely doesn't.I agree that Montgomery Cliff Adam was hardput to get through his work. I have always been aware of the miseries in his life and the pain he experienced. On the other hand it is perhaps because of these difficulties that he could project such a great range of emotions this movie required. One user didn't think he deserved his reputation of having been one of the talented actors of early film because he hadn't made a 1000 of them. A great performance is a great performance even if it were the only one given. To view a variety of different roles by an actoractress is wonderful however you can't deny the reality of a single great performance. How many actorsactresses we've watched growup in movies who didn't change from novice to a skilled performer? Studio politics....Montgmery Cliff was exactly what this role calledfor his role detailed minutely the emotions of true life many people experience. The fabulous comparison of the absolutely normal lifestyle of The Sargeants Dolores Hart and Frank Overton and the family's young boys to the misery  and total drabness of Adam's life was well done by screenwriter Dore Schary and director Vincent Donahue. This IS a soapopera but a good done.Robert Ryan William Shrike was masterful his role was intended to be cynical and he was cruelly so. Myrna Loy Florence Shrike was a picture of a longsuffering verballyabusedbutloving wife. T'ain't fun! Dolores Hart Justy Sargeant gave a skillful performance as a young woman craving a happy marriage  and attempting to support a confused lover  while raising her father's children. Maureen Stapleton Fay Doyle was superb in a tortured wife's dilemma. Her meanbutloving husband Frank Maxwell didn't miss a beat. I still can't recognize what character Jackie Coogan played.The story  lots of them in here  of this plot is the star. John Alton's dreary cinematography was perfect for the unhappy tale. Not one user mentioned the great scene between Justy and dad Sargeant when he told her she had to make her own life and let her family do the best it could without her. The scene in which Adam 'fessedup to Justy about his dad having killed his mother  and his trips were to prison not for business  was stellar.I wouldn't want an iota of LonelyHearts changed  most great films come from great novels or stageplays so one has to expect changes to evolve. Judgment on THE MOVIE is what we're discussing here and LonelyHearts delivered its message diamondcut clearly. I am so glad the obstacles which kept people from forgiving or being forgiven to achieve happiness came at the end of this movie.......actual life is not always so kind. If you missed any of these miseries count yourself to be lucky.You cannot buy LonelyHearts on any media so far as I know. I'll be firstinline for the DVD. Do yourself a favor and view it whenever you can. Every individual should know the pitfalls of alltoooften lives. I rate it a 20  Bravo !".

I still can't recognize what character Jackie Coogan played.The story  lots of them in here  of this plot is the star. John Alton's dreary cinematography was perfect for the unhappy tale. Not one user mentioned the great scene between Justy and dad Sargeant when he told her she had to make her own life and let her family do the best it could without her. The scene in which Adam 'fessedup to Justy about his dad having killed his mother  and his trips were to prison not for business  was stellar.I wouldn't want an iota of LonelyHearts changed  most great films come from great novels or stageplays so one has to expect changes to evolve. Judgment on THE MOVIE is what we're discussing here and LonelyHearts delivered its message diamondcut clearly. I am so glad the obstacles which kept people from forgiving or being forgiven to achieve happiness came at the end of this movie.......actual life is not always so kind. If you missed any of these miseries count yourself to be lucky.You cannot buy LonelyHearts on any media so far as I know. I'll be firstinline for the DVD. Do yourself a favor and view it whenever you can. Every individual should know the pitfalls of alltoooften lives. I rate it a 20  Bravo !";

I am not a soap opera fan so I can't say how close to sentimental melodrama this gets but it is saved from 'Bness' as in Bmovie by the sensitivity that Montgomery Clift puts into this movie.  Having seen Robert Ryan in many war movies I was not as impressed by his dry cynical newspaper editor role. Not as routine as John Wayne playing himself or what he would have LIKED to be throughout all his movies but close.The last scene was well written as was much of the dialogue.  I liked the real sturmunddrang that Clift's girlfriend has to go through after his lies are confessed to her.  To watch Jean Stapleton go from victim to witch was quite interesting and the plot has some interesting twists.The suffering in Montgomery Clift's eyes as he portrays an 'Advice to the Lovelorn' writer who gets too close to his 'clients'  was not all acting. An automobile accident left him permanently marred and brought about his early death several years after this movie was made.You will not erase his haunted eyes from your brain soon. And don't think too long about the issues here How close can we 'civilized human beings' get to another's suffering without being swept away by it? It will hurt your brain.".

Ryan assigns him a new lonelyhearts column so he can be a local Ann Landers. Unfortunately Clift gets way too involved in his work both emotionally and physically.There was obviously some footage missing at least to my eye that would have explained exactly what Loy's and Clift's relationship was. The film opens in a bar hangout for newspapermen and it is there Clift is introduced to Ryan.Ryan's antipathy to Clift is also not well explained. We know he's a cynic and he's got some great lines in the script but his motivation for tormenting Clift who he recognizes as a sensitive soul are really not fathomable.Monty Clift oozed sensitivity from his very pores. So this role is one he can act with no stretch of his marvelous talent. But he should have been given something better to work with.Maureen Stapleton made her screen debut as a sad sack writer to the Lonelyheart column. She's very good indeed along with her husband Frank Maxwell. There relationship eerily parallels Loy's and Ryan's.For fans of the cast members see it but for others it will be disappointing.".

	schema:headline " Parts of this are very good but all the parts together don't add up to a great film...";
	schema:reviewBody "Much of this film is easy to like...it's just too bad that the sum of these parts don't add up to make a great film. However despite its many flaws the film is often interesting and nearly earns a 7.The film begins with Montgomery Clift sitting in a bartalking with Myrna Loy. It seems that she is the wife of a newspaper editor and Clift wants a jobso he's cultivated her friendship. However so far all his attempts to meet with her husband to talk about a job have come to naughtuntil the husband Robert Ryan enters the bar. During this initial meeting it's soon obvious that Ryan is an abrasive manand one of the most contemptibly cynical men I've ever seen in film. Each and every word he spoke dripped with disdain and sarcasmand he was a very easy person to hate. One reviewer felt this was too easy a role for Ryan as he did play quite a few characters similar to this. However none were ever this horrible and it still didn't change the fact that his character was electrifying and created a strong visceral hatred within the audiencenow THAT'S effective.Despite Ryan being a jerk he decides to give Clift a chance on the paper. At first it's inexplicablewhy would such a nasty piece of work do something nice? However later you learn that he's given Clift a job partly to mess with his mind and partly to make sure that this happy and optimistic man Clift could be ruinedmade into a cynic as well. How he intended to do it is to give Clift the lonelyhearts column to dofiguring all the hardluck stories he'll read about will crush his optimism. While this doesn't exactly happen Clift does take the job very seriously...too seriously. He is torn apart and tormented by the stories and his inability to solve these problemsand Ryan has a ball watching him suffer! And if you've seen many Clift films you'll know that he was an actor who seemed to love to sufferplaying similar characters in quite a few films. There's a lot more to the story than that this but I don't want to ruin it by saying a lot more.Some aspects of the film worked very well. Ryan and Loy made for a fascinating coupledespite their age difference which was handled well by powdering Ryan's hair a bit. His nastiness and her quiet misery was something to see! Clift also was quite good. However there was a huge casting problem in the film. Clift's girlfriend Delored Hart was completely wrong for the film. Part of it was just bad casting. Ms. Hart appeared to be only about 17 yearsold though she was actually 20 and with Clift looking significantly older particularly since this film was made after his serious car accident which took away much of his boyish good looksand looking at least 35 they were a strange couple. It's made a lot worse by the writing for her character as at times she acts like a 17 yearold and is a very weak person in the filmway too weak to have possibly been the partner of a strong but quiet Clift. He was simply too bright too strongwilled and too deep for such a shallow girlfriend.Another problem with the film is that although it often seemed gritty and cynical especially when it came to the plot involving the vicious and manipulative lady played by Maureen Stapleton and at other times the film seemed way too idealistic and sillysuch as at the end when the horrible Ryan inexplicably changes character. This simply would not happen in real lifeespecially with so little provocation. It seemed more like a plot device than a realistic portrait.Overall while the film has many shortcomings it also is quite intriguing and worth seeingif you can look past its limitations.".

Yes this is her introductory role but I think it could have been improved on a little. I also liked her in the movie REDS with Warren Beatty but her portrayal of Emma Thompson is MUCH different than the rather whiny wife in here. You can see here that Robert Ryan had aged considerably from his younger roles unless that's due to a really good makeup job.".

And to his wife Myrna Loy Sleep dwell upon thy breast for I shall not. Sounds like the Bard but it's original. He does insinuate a phrase from As You Like It later on about readers mewling and puking. He sneaks in Pope too Hope springs eternal and even paraphrases Pliny the Elder Dreams are the pillars that hold up our lives. But then Ryan's character speaks this way throughout acidic witty faux elegant cheerfully cynical. It's the kind of speech usually reserved for Clifton Webb or other supercilious poufs. However Ryan's character is far from a selfsatisfied snob. He's angry beyond imagining. He can't forgive his wife's brief affair of ten years ago. He drinks too much. He's about to pop like a zit. Ryan's intense performances gives the editor's character almost more bitterness than the viewer can handle.Not all the dialog is so ornate. Maureen Stapleton to Clift whom she has just aggressively seduced but who now is so guiltridden that he doesn't want to meet her again Listen! What did you call me up for? What did you want? You wanted some ACTION  and so did I! Or so original. Clift's girl friend Dolores Hart I want to know your every thought. I love you. Has anybody ever figured out how many tears you cry in a lifetime? Clift I know I can never run away from myself.But back to the movie. It's not at all bad if it's approach as a morality play. Ryan hires novice Clift to write the Miss Lonelyhearts column for the Gazette or the Chronicle or the Picayune or whatever it is. At first Clift and the rest of the staff ridicule the agony in the letters but Clift begins to be affected by what he sees as genuine misery and Ryan sees as just so much fakery. The editor challenges Clift. Go out and meet one of these whiners. It's Maureen Stapleton in a fine performance and she makes mincemeat out of Clift's principles. Clift's bourgeois girl friend Dolores Hart shuns his company and Ryan gloats. There is a nearly lethal confrontation at the end and everything is resolved more or less.Clift by this time was pounding a lot of booze carrying around a thermos bottle of grapefruit juice and vodka but he does well enough by the role of the naive reporter hunched over blinking heaving his body slowly up and down. Dolores Hart is beautiful in a perfectly conventional way. She was to become a nun shortly. It may have been a good move because she looks and sounds more like television than feature films. A little gratuitous nudity wouldn't have hurt before her departure. Mike Kellin adds a lot as a relaxed chipper stoic reporter.If the movie has a problem it's that it's overwritten. It sounds like the stage play it was. Nobody talks like Robert Ryan's character. Nobody even knows who the hell Pliny the Elder was. It's schematic full of episodic lessons about empathy and treachery a sour movie overall. Nothing is wasted. In this respect it's different from a more naturalistic movie about newspapers. See All The President's Men for a convincing portrait of journalistic dynamics and character development.I don't mean to sound too harsh. It's a good movie and portrays no more dismal a view of human nature than Nathaniel West's other works. West was like a grownup Holden Caulfield. For what it's worth the sociologist Erving Goffman quoted the line about a girl having no nose in his book dealing with deformities Stigma.".

God must've had a pretty careless worker on the assembly line when I came through he says minutes into the movie. His character Adam lands a job at the local newspaper after he befriends the feature editor's sad alcoholic wife Myrna Loy. Unfortunately the feature editor Shrike Robert Ryan has a sick fascination with seeing youth betray their promise because it lights up all the numbers on his pinball machine. For related reasons he assigns Adam to write the advice column.Quickly Adam realizes that other people's problems are depressing. With the encouragement of his wholesome fiance Dolores Hart he asks Shrike for another job within the paper. I would rather ignore them than lie to them he argues. I would rather be dead than laugh at them. His plea moves Mrs. Shrike and me to tears. Shrike however calls him a fraud and refuses to consider.Unwilling to rejoin the ranks of the unemployed Adam continues to write the column. It soon becomes obvious that he has problems of his own when he visits his father Onslow Stevens in prison. You hate me for killing your mother Adam's father says. Adam shakes his head and replies No. I could never hate you. This is one of the most devastating scenes in the movie.Things only get worse from there. Adam descends into the seedy underworld of his nameless mediumsized city. This apparently consists of Adam's apartment a cab and two bars. At Shrike's behest he calls a writer to his column Maureen Stapleton and beds her which was her plan all along. Distraught he gets drunk and punches a fellow employee at a baby shower. He wakes up two days later to find that his wholesome fiance doesn't want much to do with him anymore. He is disgusted with himself and resolves to quit his job and skip town. Before leaving he confesses everything to his fiance. At the last minute she forgives and joins him. Tragedy nearly strikes when the letterwriter's husband materializes with a gun. Adam however dissuades him from murder.The film has a guardedly happy ending. Although they reconcile Adam and his fiance face an uncertain future. Even Shrike shows signs of reforming. This was one part that I didn't find believable. By no means is Lonelyhearts perfect. Too many things go unexplained. What did Adam do before he was Miss Lonelyhearts? The movie makes it seem as though he went straight from the orphanage to his fiance's happy home and spent the whole time reading Freud and drinking orange soda.

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Vincent J. Donehue his first and one of his only and based on the Howard Teichmann play and Nathanael West novel with a screenplay by its producer Dore Schary this slightly above average drama is notable for providing character actress and eventual 4time Academy Award nominee Maureen Stapleton with her first Supporting Actress Oscar nomination in her screen debut. The rest of the cast which is outstanding includes Montgomery Clift Robert Ryan Myrna Loy Dolores Hart Jackie Coogan Mike Kellin Frank Maxwell and Frank Overton among others.Clift plays Adam White nee Lassiter an idealistic writer who gets his first job working as a Dear AbbyAnn Landers type responder at a newspaper run by a cynical editor William Shrike Ryan who hires Adam to see if exposure to reality will make the 'young' actor Clift was 3738 years old! man crash and burn. Stapleton plays a key role in Adam's education.Ambitious unemployed writer Adam meets and then uses Florence Shrike Loy to get an introduction to her husband William in hopes of securing a job at the editor's newspaper. Shrike who believes all people are fakes is surprised at Adam's naivet but hires him to be the paper's anonymous Miss Lonelyheart columnist who answers the letters of people that write asking for advice in personal matters.The editor wants to test the mettle of his newly hired writer whom he somewhat openly hopes is corrupted by the experience e.g. to prove his own personal beliefs. Apparently his wife was unfaithful to him with a young man 10 years earlier and Shrike wants to break Adam to make an example of him. Coogan and Kellin plays Adam's co workers entertainment writer Ned Gates who actually wanted the job Adam was hired for and sportswriter Frank Goldsmith respectively.As it turns out Adam is secretly already a fake because he lies to everyone including his girlfriend Justy Sargent Hart that his parents are dead when in fact his father played by Onslow Stevens is actually in prison serving time for murdering his wife and her lover when Adam was three. Overton plays Justy's understanding father presumably a widower who also has two sons his daughter takes care of all of them.Adam 'feels' for everyone whose letters he reads getting more and more involved in their lives from a distance such that he thinks he's unworthy for the job. Shrike who notices that it's taking Adam longer and longer to complete the column encourages him to find out if indeed all the letter writers are fakes. So Adam contacts Fay Doyle Stapleton who'd written that her husband Pat Maxwell suffers from an injury that hasn't allowed them to have sexual relations for the past eight years of their eleven year marriage.Miss Lonelyheart Adam and the letter writer meet and one things leads to another causing allergic to alcohol Adam to experience getting drunk for the first time in his life he'd learned that Fay had manipulated him into the affair and wants it to continue!Unfortunately two contrivances  the fact that Fay had previously seen Adam and that Adam later meets Pat who's aware of the affair but not Miss Lonelyheart identity during the column writer's bar hopping binge  are responsible for making the story less credible. However there is still some compelling dialog in the film's final scenes which include Shrike learning as much or more from Adam and partly Justy too as the 'young' writer eventually does.".

The rest of the cast which is outstanding includes Montgomery Clift Robert Ryan Myrna Loy Dolores Hart Jackie Coogan Mike Kellin Frank Maxwell and Frank Overton among others.Clift plays Adam White nee Lassiter an idealistic writer who gets his first job working as a Dear AbbyAnn Landers type responder at a newspaper run by a cynical editor William Shrike Ryan who hires Adam to see if exposure to reality will make the 'young' actor Clift was 3738 years old! man crash and burn. Stapleton plays a key role in Adam's education.Ambitious unemployed writer Adam meets and then uses Florence Shrike Loy to get an introduction to her husband William in hopes of securing a job at the editor's newspaper. Shrike who believes all people are fakes is surprised at Adam's naivet but hires him to be the paper's anonymous Miss Lonelyheart columnist who answers the letters of people that write asking for advice in personal matters.The editor wants to test the mettle of his newly hired writer whom he somewhat openly hopes is corrupted by the experience e.g. to prove his own personal beliefs. Apparently his wife was unfaithful to him with a young man 10 years earlier and Shrike wants to break Adam to make an example of him. Coogan and Kellin plays Adam's co workers entertainment writer Ned Gates who actually wanted the job Adam was hired for and sportswriter Frank Goldsmith respectively.As it turns out Adam is secretly already a fake because he lies to everyone including his girlfriend Justy Sargent Hart that his parents are dead when in fact his father played by Onslow Stevens is actually in prison serving time for murdering his wife and her lover when Adam was three. Overton plays Justy's understanding father presumably a widower who also has two sons his daughter takes care of all of them.Adam 'feels' for everyone whose letters he reads getting more and more involved in their lives from a distance such that he thinks he's unworthy for the job. Shrike who notices that it's taking Adam longer and longer to complete the column encourages him to find out if indeed all the letter writers are fakes. So Adam contacts Fay Doyle Stapleton who'd written that her husband Pat Maxwell suffers from an injury that hasn't allowed them to have sexual relations for the past eight years of their eleven year marriage.Miss Lonelyheart Adam and the letter writer meet and one things leads to another causing allergic to alcohol Adam to experience getting drunk for the first time in his life he'd learned that Fay had manipulated him into the affair and wants it to continue!Unfortunately two contrivances  the fact that Fay had previously seen Adam and that Adam later meets Pat who's aware of the affair but not Miss Lonelyheart identity during the column writer's bar hopping binge  are responsible for making the story less credible. However there is still some compelling dialog in the film's final scenes which include Shrike learning as much or more from Adam and partly Justy too as the 'young' writer eventually does.";

The only exception was the 1958 film Lonelyhearts for some reason I couldn't locate a DVD and had missed it when shown on TCM. I finally caught up with it on the network this week and all what I heard about the film to my perspective was misdirected. I had readheard it was a soap opera meandering and somewhat lifeless. As I saw this movie almost a week ago I can't help in not thinking about it from time to time. To me this was a moving film with amazing performances topped by Stapleton Ryan and of course Clift. Monty Clift...what a gift of an actor who in this role after his major auto accident plays his character with such intensity and emotion. Incredible. There are scenes where you can see the emotion in his eyes that are so moving and the thought processes of the impact of his actions are so simple but awe inspiring and transparent. He was truly an artist and the shame of it was because of all the pain and ups and downs in his personal life we never got to see his full potential. The amazing Robert Ryan is incredible as well as he plays a cynical character with variation and depth that you have to marvel at the dexterity he uses in communicating the pain and mistrust of anyone he comes into contact with. Great actor. Maureen Stapleton is brilliant with her longing for connecting to something she is missing in her life and right when you begin to feel sympathy she changes on a dime. Brilliant! The only reason I gave it an 8 was the structure of the script and the backstory of Clift's character was a bit weak and rushed. Never the less...very good film that is a near not to be missed because of the performances. Must see for Clift fans.".

But I've never seen a more convincing nervous breakdown in a flick and indeed Clift seems unglued and melting down in every scene. It is a mesmerizing performance matched only by Ryan's Olympian cold and scorn.Ryan bets Clift that if he were to investigate the weary and perplexed who write to him for help and advice he would find they are all acting and have ulterior motives. Clift is naive enough to take the bet and stumbles upon a young Maureen Stapleton already unattractive at the beginning of her acting career who is out for some extramarital action. Of course Ryan's cynicism is unsustainable as is Clift's moral naivete and this makes for a contrived ending to the film. Clift's Christlike resurrection is no more believable than Ryan's newborn warmth and understanding.".

While he occasionally leaves their floating home to fetch fishing tourists she never does. Only the visitors seem to think there is something strange about the situation. The man and the girl seem happy. At first. A handsome young man who visits the boat gradually makes her question her situation to the increasing dismay of the old man.To me Hwal seem to be a metaphor of possessive love and moving on. On the dramatic level some things don't make sense. On the metaphorical level they do to a greater extent anyway. When the old man shoots arrows at men who flirts or tries to paw the girl there is no police investigation or vindictive victims. This is just a way to show that jealousy makes you do stupid things that potentially can hurt others. When the boat where the old man and the girl used to live follows the boat on which the girl tries to leave with the young man it doesn't matter that the engine is broken or that no one is driving it. Old relationships are hard to leave behind.The downward spiral of jealousy and possessiveness are gut wrenching to watch. You just know something bad is about to happen. Love or rather the risk of loosing it makes you hurt each other. Accepting the loss accepting the pain and letting go is a way out.Just like other Kim KiDuk movies the pace here is tranquil the photography is beautiful and the main characters manage the express all the emotions they need using few or no words.I really liked Hwal but perhaps it's not the best Kim KiDuk movie I've seen. The ending is a bit confusing and the theme of possessive love and the setting of a floating home are also explored in the superior Bom yeoreum gaeul gyeoul geurigo bom 2003.".

	schema:headline " A shot of the weapon that inspired the film's title";
	schema:reviewBody "The story centers around a man in his sixties who has been raising a young girl since childhood on a ship that floats unanchored off Korea's western coast. Though the borders of her world are obviously quite limited she seems happy and the old man plans to marry her the day she reaches legal age. The two make their living by hosting fishermen aboard the boat and also tell fortunes in a rather bizarre and dangerous fashion by shooting arrows whizzing past the girl's head into a Buddhist painting on the side of the boat. This method of fortunetelling appears to have been invented by Kim though possibly inspired by the common practice of dropping a dart onto a spinning discThe film opens in striking fashion with a shot of the weapon that inspired the film's title. When fitted with an additional piece the bow becomes a stringed instrument. Sadly however the instrument doesn't fit into the film's plot beyond providing for occasional mood music. The bow is utilized more often as a means of fending off lecherous fisherman from the young girl who braves the dead of winter in a flimsy dress and who like all the women in Kim's films is pretty gorgeous. Soon however a sensitive male college student shows up on board and the old man discovers he's going to need more than a bow if he wants to keep the delectable young thing for himself.One of Kim's most common approaches to storytelling is to set up an isolated or marginalized world usually a physical space but sometimes a way of life like in 3Iron that operates by its own elaborate set of rules and customs. Examples include the redlight district in Bad Guy the lake in The Isle the motel in Birdcage Inn or the floating temple in Spring Summer etc... Part of the pleasure in watching his films comes in exploring and coming to understand these worlds and how they operate. For example in The Bow we are shown how the girl and the old man defend themselves in a series of repeated scenes. First we are shown the man's skill with the bow then we see how the girl's spatial knowledge of the boat and archery skills can serve as a second layer of defense. These scenes don't really add much depth to the human characters but they characterize the society of the boat itself.This is compounded by the fact that the two main characters do not speak to each other. It's true that one of Kim's strengths is to be able to tell stories using very little dialogue. The lack of dialogue between the leads in The Isle and 3Iron worked well because these couples could communicate with each other emotionally and the absence of words only accentuated their strange bond. However in The Bow the old man and the girl spend much of the film growing emotionally more detached. Since they don't talk the only way left for them to communicate is to trade angry stares which they do over and over and over again. In this way the lack of dialogue comes across feeling more like a gimmick than an integral part of the film.".

	schema:headline " Poetry in silence";
	schema:reviewBody "Probably Kim KiDuk's second most pivotal work to date Hwai The Bow tells a story of unconventional love  one full of obsession unfulfilled dreams and poetry. An old fisherman Seonghwang Jeon lives on a decrepit boat together with a coming of age girl which he rescued from death at sea when she was no more than 8 years old. She came to live with him on this boat where her only contact with the outside world are hobbyists who pay money to come to fish at sea. All that keeps them company are themselves and the delicate music of a bow instrument. After years of caring after the girl the old man has come to love her but not in a fatherly way. His longing is to marry the beautiful orphan once she reaches the required age...Kim KiDuk is capable of beautiful storytelling as is to be confirmed by such works of brilliance as Spring Summer Autumn Winter... and Spring. And The Bow comes extremely close to such exceptionality albeit never finally overcomes it's own weaknesses. Nonetheless this is an extremely enjoyable and delightful movie even though filled with unrealised passions and immoral egoism. Even though the script is extremely simple even threadbare it never lingers and keeps you enthralled throughout. Not only by the impressive cinematography but also the subtle acting and storytelling complemented by a riveting score.Nonetheless the issues with Kim KiDuk as a storyteller are quite apparent. The strength of his movie is in lyricism romanticism and ideas that do not necessarily fit in well with the modern cynicism of today. As long as the poetry is silent the magic overwhelms you. But the moment Kim KiDuk's characters start talking the spell is broken as everything becomes mundane and at times even corny. Thankfully for The Bow our two main protagonists do not utter a word throughout the whole movie whilst outsiders come few and far between. This allows the director to keep his movie consistent in its poetry something which he was unable to convey in more previous movies such as Dream or Time where poetry transforms into 'corniness' and the story sells itself short. Even in The Bow you have a couple of very awkward scenes which didn't seem to fit and came out as forcibly placed into the movie especially a rather awkward selfmasturbation scene near the end of it all.Nonetheless a required watch for anyone who likes a bit of Buddhist philosophy for dinner.".

	schema:reviewBody "'The Bow' comes in the work of prolific Kim Kiduk immediately after a series of three wonderful films  'Spring Summer Fall Winter ... and Spring' 'Samaritan Girl' and '3Iron' and a few year after his other masterpiece 'The Isle'. I have somehow missed seeing it when it came out or maybe it was not distributed in Israel. Now I caught up with the film on VoD and my impression is that it marks exactly the moment when the Korean director started a series of less successful experiments. Of course one cannot expect even from a great director like Kim and he is one of the best living creators in cinema to produce only masterpieces. Hopefully he has in front of him many years of fine film making and we are here to enjoy his films.Part of the problem with The Bow is that it repeats to some extent the format of the some of the previous successful films taking a story of childteenage initiation and mixing it with traditional Buddhist I believe but I am not very knowledgeable concepts. So for viewers of some of his previous films there is a strong and possibly intentional feeling of 'dejavu' enhanced by the fact that as the story here happens in an isolated environment surrounded by water. The Old Man Seong Hwanjeon is growing for the last ten years a Young Girl beautiful Han Yeoreum. They never speak. The only contact of the girl with the outer world is when visitors come for recreational fishing aboard visitors from the outer world that that she may not remember. Some of them would like to abuse her but she and her protector know how to defend themselves with the help of the only weapon at hand a traditional bow. Some other may come with better intents as the young man who falls for the girl and tries to save and take her back to the world. But this is what she wants? This is certainly not what the old man wants he plans to marry her when she reaches the age of 17.There is a lot to think about and discuss around this story. Tradition faces modernity is necessarily one better than the other? Does the girl really want to be saved? The old man may have saved an abandoned six years girl and grew her but is he entitled to marry her and continue to control her life to keep her isolated from the world. And is that world better than the smaller and innocent universe they were living in? His keeping the girl isolated may be judged by the world outside as kidnapping and abuse is this the case? None of these questions have an unambiguous answer and this is not a problem quite the contrary. Neither is acting wonderful! or the cinematography as good as you can expect in a film by Kim Kiduk. The problem I have is with the final which I will not tell too many details about in order to avoid spoiling the pleasure of the viewing. There is a very strong metaphor here involving of course the bow which produced me a shock and caused me an ambiguous feeling not because of the visuals I am used to much harsher things but because of its meanings and the way it is directed and acted. For once I would have preferred a different way of ending. Kim Kiduk decided differently.".

	schema:reviewBody "From the award winning director Kim Kiduk that gave us 'The Isle' 'Address Unknown' 'Spring Summer Fall Winter... and Spring' 'Samaritan Girl' '3Iron'.In this film 'The Bow Hwal' the old man the young girl and the young guy all do not have names. However the film still breezes through without identity crisis or confusion. With absolutely NO lines from the old man and the young girl all we hear from these two characters were whispers to people's ears laughter and crying. However it was a masterpiece of absent dialogue. With subtle facial expressions and actions such as aiming of the bow striking off calendar dates holding the girl's hand during sleep reconstruction of bed it spoke much much louder than words. A favourite cinematic style by Kim Kiduk.The director Kim Kiduk has also done a good job in creating unbearable suspense on what the old man whispered to the 'fortune seeking' people. I wonder if the Korean DVD will reveal these tidbits.The music used in the film is simple yet moving. I believe the musical instrument used was Erhu an ancient Chinese 'violin'. MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD   MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD In my opinion the last 10 minutes destroyed the film. It was almost a masterpiece from Kim Kiduk. The idea of supernatural elements and the old man's spirit having sex with the girl is too much to accept. After having sex the old man spirit allows the girl and the guy to go back to shore while he sinks together with his ship. It was a great film without a great ending. In comparison '3Iron' had a stronger ending than 'The Bow'.Mao points 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Hwal  The Bow is a very rich movie for those interested in Buddhism however in cinematic terms there are some fairly substantial and overt structural problems with the movie. For example the film starts with a jolt of clumsy expositional dialogue this is where characters have a very forced conversation that reveals the back story of the movie. Motifs are overrepeated shooting of arrows and nonsourced  nondiegetic music is layered on every time the old man starts to play his bow all the worse because it is fairly saccharine.Those with a yen for Buddhist films are however living on food parcels and so the film's flaws may be overlooked in kindness to the healing the film provides and the thoughts it provokes.The plot of the movie concerns an old man who lives out on the sea on a fishing boat. He provides divination services and also a platform for line fishing. Customers sit on pastelcoloured sofas and ease away the day. He has spent a decade bringing up a young foundling girl and intends the unnatural act of marrying her when she reaches age.To me one of the key points of Buddhism is that if you are angry with the world there are two ways to proceed change the world or change your attitude to it the latter is the more likely to work. Another idea would be to be like the smooth stone in a river over which the world flows softly rather than the jagged cause of turbulence. Dukkha a catchall concept of suffering that has no direct translation to English is minimised by the changing of the self. One facet of dukkha is viparinamadukkha which concerns the pain of unmet expectations and the pain caused by the impermanence of happiness. The old man in the movie suffers from this and has to learn to deal with it.I found myself accepting unpalatable truths about my life watching this movie and salvaged a couple of evenings of calm from it. I would recommend it to those seeking to do likewise. One point to raise is that Kim is not averse to animal cruelty in his movies in this one a chicken receives several deliberate blows from a character.Others have pointed to the entire movie being composed of symbols this is a particularly beautiful alternative way of looking at the movie although it amounts to much the same take home in the end.This is to my friend Mollie.".

Comparisons between this and past KKD films like 3Iron or Spring Summer Fall Winter... and Spring made by narrowminded critics is a little unfair and it's a damn shame.A film set entirely on a lonely fishing boat The Bow is about a 60yearold man who takes a young lost 7yearold girl in as his own raises her like a daughter and makes big plans to marry her when she turns 17. As the day of her 17th birthday approaches the more and more our naive young mute nubile is groped attacked and drooledover by visiting men there to fish. The old man to protect the girl wards the men off with his bow a weapon that is also used as a kind of hypnotic musical instrument based on the Erhu many times throughout the film. The bow protects and soothes her as the boat distances her from outside evils. Despite it's odd moments life is perfect and simple for our couple until a young man our heroine's age boards the ship and intrigues her with his caring disposition his kind face and his knowledge of the modern world outside of the boat. What is to come is a suspenseful tale of jealousy trust possessive love and innocence.Nothing can describe the confusing mix of emotions I felt watching The Bow very late at nightearly in the morning this week. A story of an aging man raising a young girl to be his future wife is kind of hollow with little depth thanks to it's use of very little dialogue but Kim KiDuk's masterful storytelling makes up for it relying heavily on subtle yet convincing physical expression and some help by a great soundtrack and breathtaking cinematography. With absolutely no spoken dialogue between our two main characters and a series of bizarre incidents see the way the old man and his girl read fortunes I was left out to sea to piece The Bow's puzzle together on my own no one or nothing to help guide me wrap my head around this mysterious couple experiencing everchanging and intense feelings of anger disgust wonder and ultimately sadness. As you can see this is really no different from what's expected of Mr. Kim KiDuk as he reminds us how confusing and cruel both love and life are and we can never be able to entirely control either one.The ending to The Bow makes some unexpectedly touches on the supernatural briefly which may throw some viewers into a quirky loop but our director pulls it off most gracefully without being too overthetop. The old man decides to set his girl free in the most shocking way one could imagine leaving us to question his seemingly selfish motives.".

The Bow similarly suffers from phoniness but even more so. It's a fairy tale of sorts about an old man probably in his late 60s who has been raising a young girl for the last decade. She is now 16. He plans to marry her the day she turns 17. Kim begs the audience not to find that too disgusting. I couldn't really do it. I also could never get past the film's corny earnestness nor its repetitiveness nor its slapdash symbolism. It has some nice images and the music is good for a while it becomes far too overbearing as the film moves on. The young girl Yeoreum Han when she's not being overtly sexualized is nice to look at the actress seems to have been in her 20s when the film was made but she really does look like a young teenager.".

The part where the old man plays his bow violin on the roof of the boat however belongs in a tourism video promoting the wonders of SouthKorea not a Kim KiDuk film. The music is cheesy. It's never a good decision to have an actor play a rugged instrument on screen and simultaneously play polished incredibly melodramatic music on the sound track.With the technicalities out of the way let's focus on the story. As far as Kim KiDuk goes the main idea could've been workable. Now it just takes some elements from 'The Isle' adds some painfully obvious and overdone symbolism plus some magical realism at the end that makes me think that Kim KiDuk is having a laugh at my expense. The bow as a symbol of love acceptable sure. It shoots arrows too  love hurts. It can be used to play the most touching music  love is beautiful. You can use it to predict future events  love is mysterious?? Not to mention the thing with the rooster and the hen. The type of symbolism the film contains I might expect from a romantic novelist not a renowned director. The ending is a story in itself but I honestly felt embarrassed for Kim KiDuk while I watched it. Should it have ended with the old man diving in the sea I would've probably viewed the film in a much more positive light.Sure there are some classic Kim KiDuk moments like the scene with the old man and the rope and even the wedding but overall this is very subpar. It's still probably worth watching one reason being to see what kind of sap a talented artist is able to produce apparently without flinching an eye.".

	schema:headline " Disappointing surreal drama from the gifted director of The Isle";
	schema:reviewBody "High expectations are not met in Kim kiDuk's The Bow a lightweight surreal drama that starts with a bang and ends with a whimper. A gorgeous young nymph Yeoreum Han lives on a boat with a crusty old man Seonghwang Jeon she has been promised to when she reaches the age of consent. As the big day approaches younger suitors provide stiff competition for the jealous old codger who expresses his disapproval by shooting arrows at them. Like the director's The Isle this is a film of little dialog and much visual poetry. It is handsomely photographed and well acted. Unfortunately it is unable to adequately resolve its central dramatic issue so it becomes wishywashy and protracted. The girl is a major object of lust and is almost worth the price of admission. An Asian lolita with the most stunning body eyes and demeanor she steals every scene and will hopefully soldier on to stronger material. The Bow is not uninteresting but it could have been so much more had writer kiDuk addressed his big third act problems. The score by Eunil Kang is hypnotic at times and the setting which features a rope swing off the side of the vessel is delightfully novel.".

Unfortunately it is unable to adequately resolve its central dramatic issue so it becomes wishywashy and protracted. The girl is a major object of lust and is almost worth the price of admission. An Asian lolita with the most stunning body eyes and demeanor she steals every scene and will hopefully soldier on to stronger material. The Bow is not uninteresting but it could have been so much more had writer kiDuk addressed his big third act problems. The score by Eunil Kang is hypnotic at times and the setting which features a rope swing off the side of the vessel is delightfully novel.";

	schema:reviewBody "With this epic movie Kiduk Kim really puts out another great story in The Bow and I was really surprised at the beauty of this movie.Taking place on an old rundown fishing boat The Bow tells the story of an old man played by Seonghwang Jeon who have raised a young girl played by Yeoreum Han for 10 years on the boat isolated from the outside world with the only contact with other people is by the ones coming to the boat for fishing and having their fortune read. The old man plans to marry the girl when she becomes of age but an unexpected spark between the girl and a visiting young man played by Sijeok Seo to the boat sets things spiraling out the old man's control.Something amazing about The Bow was the way that the story takes you through a myriad of emotions ranging from admiration curiosity and then on to spite and contempt. And the story was told and shot in a way that the emotions of both the old man and young girl were strong and everpresent.Shot almost without any dialogue the story was relying heavily on the acting performances of the cast and the ability to tell a story by the director. And wow it just came together like pieces in a puzzle. Everything was so amazing and worked out quite nicely. The actors did great jobs with their roles both the speaking and nonspeaking roles. But most impressively was Seonghwang Jeon the old man and Yeoreum Han the young girl in their roles. Wow the chemistry between them on the screen was amazing and the way they portrayed their characters made it like you were right there on the boat with them.The Bow was really a treat for the eyes to sit down and watch because the cinematography was so beautiful. The movie is really nicely shot with lots of great shots and that was really a necessary ingredient for the movie being able to portray and tell a story when there wasn't all that much dialogue going on.I found the movie to be a really great surprise and I loved how it swept me up and put me right there in the story. It was so compelling and beautiful. And if you are a fan of Asian cinema then surely you are familiar with Kiduk Kim's work already. But if not then The Bow is well worth putting into your DVD player and sit down to watch. It is the type of story that will stay with you for a long time.".

He has brought immense freshness to this theme as in Hwal there is an old man in a boat somewhere in the sea who loves his young girl friend with a view to marry her. His love is unique as it is more of a love based on dedication rather than lust. However in the course of time feelings change and a different reality emerges. This change of emotional events has been deftly handled by Kim Ki Duk as the film ends on a very abstruse note.

	schema:headline " It's More Than the Title...";
	schema:reviewBody "Films like 'The Deep' are few sporadic and are usually not accepted by many audience members but are usually the films that end up meaning the most in the end. I found that this film had a charm that I could not put my finger on upon viewing it for the first time. The book written by well known Peter Benchley of 'Jaws' fame was released on the heels of 'Jaws' success so the film was released a year later in '77 and was easily brandished as being a 'money film' but I assure you it is much more.Loosely taken from the book the film captures the essence of the title. When David Sanderswell played by newcomer Nick Nolte is on Holiday with his loverthe ALWAYS beautiful and aesthetic Jacqueline Bisset of whom the film rests well on Gail Berke the two uncover items while diving a small bottle of some sort sufficient with morphine and an unrecognizable piece of jewelry worn by sea and time. Naive to Bermuda the two continue their holiday with many people after what is in the bottle and just who wants it who should get it and what ELSE is down in the deep. Genuinely frightening and appropriately paced this film not only relies on the situation to keep interest but psychological undertones to further tell the story.One of the biggest things this film has going is the underwater photography shot with beautiful landscapes of coral fish and dedication to what the actors explorations achieve. Filmed in Panavision widescreen this film delivers the whole underwater experience as each scene is carefully timed and arranged photographically. The fact that filming was done creatively without CGI is all the more fascinating and you feel like you are actually there underwater experiencing. This is buttressed by John Barry's positively breathtaking score. Each note whispers a feeling under and above water springing in the air and whooshing through the water like an animal. The theme is gorgeous and reflects not only the characters attitudes but the theme of the sea and the deep itself. It is at times violent and at other times soft and peaceful. The writing can be said something for as well as the scenes are like a ballet with carefully choreographed actions and dialog through the special masks they wear that a whole scene could take place under water and does. Benchley adapted from his book and the story works well.The acting of the film could not be better. Nick Nolte is very believable as the rambunctious and adventurous David Sanders and he is played with such prowess and eagerness something that could be found in all of us toward the ocean. We really learn to feel why David feels so much about the ocean more so in the extended television version. Jacqueline Bisset is hauntingly gorgeous as Gail Berke the conscience and voice of reason of the film. Gail is torn by morality midway through the film something else we all can relate to. And as the danger caresses so to does Gail toward what she believes in and her love for David. Romber Treece is played out with spunk and passion by the late great Robert Shaw fresh off the celluloid of Jaws and makes the role his own. Treece being an islander knows the bad and goods of the material they have found under sea and acts more or less as a guide to keep the two out of danger while achieving his own satisfaction to the sense of desire he has to the call of the sea. The supporting cast is really great as well. Louis Gosset is daring and intimidating as the main villain Henri Bondourant one who kills at will and who provides the three main characters with plenty of conflict and Eli Wallach is sleazy and perfect as the only survivor of a wreck that later became the site of the treasure and drugs. The main three do their best to help with the psychological undertones of the film part of the real charm.'The Deep' is more than just a deep sea adventure but a psychological study of three human beings One an adventurous intrepid young man fascinated by what is dangerous and unknown to him The other his lover a woman of strong passion strength and beauty on the inside and out who is drawn to those she cannot access or comprehend The third a man who has been to hell and back who still feels obliged to his place of comfort the ocean. The chemistry between these characters is what builds the undertone. Gail is fascinated by Treece because he has been through so much and feels drawn to his reclusiveness and relevance. David is drawn to danger and cannot be denied his goal needs the pleasure of experience and Treece fascinated by both their innocent drives can only help them thusly. The actually deep a character itself is the combination of their lively psyches coming together. When they are deep inside they face danger in the form deadly animals explosions rigged in the wreck and most appropriately themselves. They are forced to look inside themselves further explored in the book and television version and the resolution to the film is felicitous.So when you look at it 'The Deep' is a clever look into the deep of our minds as well as our dreams our fantasies and our weaknesses as humans. If there is any way to uncover any of it this film more or less shows the way and all the more with the entertainment it delivers gives us a true experience of what any 'Deep' is like.".

	onyx:emotionText "Films like 'The Deep' are few sporadic and are usually not accepted by many audience members but are usually the films that end up meaning the most in the end. I found that this film had a charm that I could not put my finger on upon viewing it for the first time. The book written by well known Peter Benchley of 'Jaws' fame was released on the heels of 'Jaws' success so the film was released a year later in '77 and was easily brandished as being a 'money film' but I assure you it is much more.Loosely taken from the book the film captures the essence of the title. When David Sanderswell played by newcomer Nick Nolte is on Holiday with his loverthe ALWAYS beautiful and aesthetic Jacqueline Bisset of whom the film rests well on Gail Berke the two uncover items while diving a small bottle of some sort sufficient with morphine and an unrecognizable piece of jewelry worn by sea and time. Naive to Bermuda the two continue their holiday with many people after what is in the bottle and just who wants it who should get it and what ELSE is down in the deep. Genuinely frightening and appropriately paced this film not only relies on the situation to keep interest but psychological undertones to further tell the story.One of the biggest things this film has going is the underwater photography shot with beautiful landscapes of coral fish and dedication to what the actors explorations achieve. Filmed in Panavision widescreen this film delivers the whole underwater experience as each scene is carefully timed and arranged photographically. The fact that filming was done creatively without CGI is all the more fascinating and you feel like you are actually there underwater experiencing. This is buttressed by John Barry's positively breathtaking score. Each note whispers a feeling under and above water springing in the air and whooshing through the water like an animal. The theme is gorgeous and reflects not only the characters attitudes but the theme of the sea and the deep itself. It is at times violent and at other times soft and peaceful. The writing can be said something for as well as the scenes are like a ballet with carefully choreographed actions and dialog through the special masks they wear that a whole scene could take place under water and does. Benchley adapted from his book and the story works well.The acting of the film could not be better. Nick Nolte is very believable as the rambunctious and adventurous David Sanders and he is played with such prowess and eagerness something that could be found in all of us toward the ocean. We really learn to feel why David feels so much about the ocean more so in the extended television version. Jacqueline Bisset is hauntingly gorgeous as Gail Berke the conscience and voice of reason of the film. Gail is torn by morality midway through the film something else we all can relate to. And as the danger caresses so to does Gail toward what she believes in and her love for David. Romber Treece is played out with spunk and passion by the late great Robert Shaw fresh off the celluloid of Jaws and makes the role his own. Treece being an islander knows the bad and goods of the material they have found under sea and acts more or less as a guide to keep the two out of danger while achieving his own satisfaction to the sense of desire he has to the call of the sea.

Unfortunately they encounter competition who would go at great lengths to get what they want  even if it means murder  unless our protagonists' intrepid assistant Robert Shaw uses his valuable knowledge to keep the tables turned and remain one step ahead.This film is a delight from start to finish. From the opening sequences of clearing clouds and Bermuda coming into focus and the astonishing underwater photograpy to the action packed adventurous finally you simply can not take your eyes off the screen. The music from the one and only John Barry who bought you the unforgettable themes from James Bond and Born Free is mesmerizing and suits the picture elegantly. The cinematography is beautiful and gives you a lust for the holiday destination. Most importantly the plot written by the man who bought you 'JAWS' is original and riveting and high in adventure  I truly recommend this to all adventure fans.Cast selection was genius. At the time Nick Nolte was a new face to the silver screen and brought an unforgettable performance as an obsessed husband clearly hypnotized by the idea of Gold. Jacqueline Bissete is well how can I put this?  I would have liked to have been there with her on her holiday gosh is she beautiful or what?. It was Robert Shaw I believe who brought the most to the film. He is witty ignorant a knowitall and a man who isn't afraid of anything and this is what people come to see adventure films for. I can't imagine anybody else nailing the role like he has. Pure brilliance from a great British actor.Now how does a film with an interesting ORIGINAL plot great cast including a legend calm and mesmerizing music golden cinematography and a great 'quotable' screenplay come to such underrated status is beyond Bermuda's Triangle. The current rating that IMDb gives to this film will never do it justice. I only hope for those who haven't seen it to overlook the score it has been given and take some time to sit back and escape to the fantastic world of The Deep  an experience I will be taking for many years to come. For me a classic adventure of pure escapism!".

	schema:reviewBody "Nick Nolte and Jacqueline Bisset star in this solid B movie meant to entertain not challenge the average movie goer.  Allow your mind to suspend reality for a couple of hours and enjoy The Deep for what it is.  Fans of Robert Shaw Louis Gossett Jr. and Eli Wallach will be pleased to see them on screen but less than satisfied with their weak parts.When first released the scenery above and below the water in The Deep proved to be amazing. Jacqueline Bisset appeared draped in a wet tshirt causing audience members everywhere to either gasp gulp or sigh. Accompanied by multiple tropical fish Ms. Bisset's underwater scenes are just as satisfying.My recollections of seeing The Deep for the first time in the theater include sitting in the front row with head bent backwards watching oversize tropical fish swimming back and forth across the screen.

	onyx:emotionText "Nick Nolte and Jacqueline Bisset star in this solid B movie meant to entertain not challenge the average movie goer.  Allow your mind to suspend reality for a couple of hours and enjoy The Deep for what it is.  Fans of Robert Shaw Louis Gossett Jr. and Eli Wallach will be pleased to see them on screen but less than satisfied with their weak parts.When first released the scenery above and below the water in The Deep proved to be amazing. Jacqueline Bisset appeared draped in a wet tshirt causing audience members everywhere to either gasp gulp or sigh. Accompanied by multiple tropical fish Ms. Bisset's underwater scenes are just as satisfying.My recollections of seeing The Deep for the first time in the theater include sitting in the front row with head bent backwards watching oversize tropical fish swimming back and forth across the screen.  I get a hint of a stiff neck every time I review the movie in my head!I do recommend you rent or buy The Deep. Pop up some popcorn put your feet up and just let yourself be immersed in this entertaining and gorgeous at times movie.  M. Nels Pearson";

They find a historic wreck but nearby is a wrecked ship with a large quantity of morphine . Romer and Gail want the treasure their diving partners also want the drugs . Dangerous criminals realize the ship and dope are submerged somewhere in the area . When the bad guys learn that the couple has located the drugs Romer and Gail find themselves in mortal peril . Exciting and wellpaced underwater adventure about a marriage that in the process they are threatened and then must thwart the enemies. The team of divers faces danger when they attempt to retrieve goods from a Spanish ship  as they spend time in sharkinfested water and are helped by a treasureseeker  Robert Shaw  and his underling  Robert Tessier  and confront nasty druglord  Louis Gossett Jr . The four divers set off on a perilous expedition in search of legendary treasure of a mysterious galleon resting in ocean floor and take back drug into the ship .The pace moves along nicely and production values are on the high scale . This is an amusing seagoing adventure in which the ocean deep figure prominently  though this time guarding sunken treasure . The action is plentiful with undersea excitement with terrifying underwater sequences. The film is spirited lively and at times rather frightening light amusing . Made mainly as vehicle for Nick Nolte and Jacqueline Bisset  they show particularly in the technical excellence of the underwater scenes . They show off their considerable screen presence both attractive and slender . Lightweight entertainment notable for sunny outdoors and underwater photography as well as Bisset in a bathing suit a glamorous bikini and of course her famous wet Tshirt. Jacqueline Bisset fans will ask no more than the sight of their star in a swimsuit involved in this fastmoving sunken treasure yarn.This waterlogged story is packed with gorgeous cinematography by Christopher Challis who manage to keep this afloat with fab footage maritime as expert cameraman  furthermore pulsating musical score by the classic John Barry . The movie was spectacularly shot in Bermuda  Australia and British Virgin Islands . The motion picture is professionally directed by Peter Yates  Bullit  though drags in some places and is overlong . In the 2000s was realized a special remake of this story with Paul Walker and Jessica Alba in similar roles to Nolte and Bisset titled  Into the blue .".

The movie The Deep in itself is a soso story about a young couple David Sanders  Gail Berke Nick Nolte  Jackie Bisset on vacation in Bermuda. Davir  Gail together with the help of a local sea rummy and historian Romer Treece Robert Shaw try to recover a sunken treasure chest of Spanish gold coins and jewelry that sank under the waves during a hurricane off the coast of Florida in 1715. Some 230 years later a US navy supply ship named Goliath with a load of morphine anvils sank in the exact same spot on top of the French carrying Spanish treasure tobacco ship Griffin that secretly had the gold put on it by the Spanish governor of Cubato prevent the royal family as well as the Spanish government from knowing about it and keeping it all for himself.This all attracts a local Bermuda drug gang led by Henri Cloche and his top henchman Slake Lou Gossett Jr.  Dick Anthony Williams to try to get to the underwater site they knew nothing about the Spanish treasure and grab the morphine anvils. This all results later in the movie in a spectacular underwater battle between Treece and David with Colche and Slake. Slake drowns and Cloche become the lunch for a giant moray eel that was living inside the hull of the ship Goliath at the end of the movie.There's also Treece's helper Adam Coffin Eli Wallach who Treece save from the very ship Goliath after it sank in WWII who joins in with the drug gang in order to double cross Treece a good friend is hard to find and get a share of the drugs and money for himself. Treece was going to destroy the morphine anvils which is one of the reasons that Coffin put his lot in with the drug gang and sets up Treece's best friend Kevin Robert Tessler to get murdered by Slake later in the film. Coffin ends up in a coffin or whatever pieces that they can find of him later on when he tries to break into the lighthouse where he thought that Treece kept the morphine anvils but had a trap set up by him with explosives for anyone who tries to break in. Both David and Gail as well as Treece go through the ringer in the movie as their kidnapped beaten and almost drowned as well as eaten by the giant moray eel and in the case of Gail she's also put through by the drug thugs some weird and bloody voodoo ritual that almost drives her mad.

A fairly good sunken treasure film but it was Jackie Bisset wet Tshirt and all that was the real treasure in the movie The Deep and as soon as you saw her swimming underwater with a pair of lungs that can keep you afloat better the any life preserver.

Haitian Henri Cloche wants the ampoules because of the drugs they contain and is willing to do what it takes to get them David and Gail aren't that interested in the morphine though they are more interested in a medallion they found on the site it is much older than anything on that ship should be. They take it to local treasure hunter Romer Treece and eventually they determine that there are two wrecks there The Goliath and a French vessel called the Griffin which was transporting treasure as well as her declared cargo. Further dives produce more treasure but if they are to prove it is the lost Spanish treasure they will have to find an item from the list of lost pieces... they will also have to avoid sharks Cloche's henchmen and a particularly mean moray eel!I expected this to be another dangerous underwater animal film being rushed out to cash in on the success of 'Jaws' but thankfully it was much better than that it is really a decent treasure hunting adventure with some drug dealers thrown in to increase the danger. Nick Nolte and Jacqueline Bisset are officially the stars of the film and they aren't bad but it is Robert Shaw who steals the show as Treece a character that isn't dissimilar to the role he played in 'Jaws'. There are also notable appearances from Eli Wallach and Louis Gossett Jr. The underwater scenes are well shot and when there is action it looks confused enough to feel real. Above water there are some nice shots of Bermuda but it never feels like it is trying to act as a tourist brochure by showing all the best sites. The story is fairly simple but it is told well and there is a good amount of action... including a rather scary scene where somebody is attacked with an outboard motor! There are also a couple of references to real Bermuda treasure the gold and ruby cross is a clear reference to the gold and emerald 'Tucker's Cross' which was found by Teddy Tucker who had a cameo as the harbour master.".

Nick Nolte and Jacqueline Bisset are officially the stars of the film and they aren't bad but it is Robert Shaw who steals the show as Treece a character that isn't dissimilar to the role he played in 'Jaws'. There are also notable appearances from Eli Wallach and Louis Gossett Jr. The underwater scenes are well shot and when there is action it looks confused enough to feel real. Above water there are some nice shots of Bermuda but it never feels like it is trying to act as a tourist brochure by showing all the best sites. The story is fairly simple but it is told well and there is a good amount of action... including a rather scary scene where somebody is attacked with an outboard motor! There are also a couple of references to real Bermuda treasure the gold and ruby cross is a clear reference to the gold and emerald 'Tucker's Cross' which was found by Teddy Tucker who had a cameo as the harbour master.";

	schema:reviewBody "I kind of enjoy seeing this movie every few years for a number of reasons. The first reason is Jacqueline Bisset She is stunning all sun tan big blue eyes that look in slightly different direction impressively bebosomed nice legs  and we are introduced to her while she's scuba diving at Bermuda with her boyfriend Nick Nolte. She wears only her soaking wet Tshirt and a teeny bikini bottom. Later we are treated to her being felt up and undressed by bad guy Louis Gosset Jr. and his gang of black thugs. Still later a bunch of hoodoo priests hold her down on a bed cut open her nightie and paint her belly button with a severed chicken foot dipped in fresh blood. The thrills never end.The second reason is the colorful and evocative location photography. Bermuda looks terribly appealing here. The palms the brushy cliffs the finely grained sand of the beaches the saltencrusted cottages the eternal sunshine the soaking Tshirts. After they find a bit of treasure and a bit of morphine in the rotting iron hulk of a sunken warship Nolte and Bisset consult the local knowitall and sociometric hub Robert Shaw for advice. He lives in a cozy twostory white lighthouse atop a hill. The lovely couple also rent a pair of the motor scooters that are ubiquitous on Bermuda and are forced off the road in an arousing chase. The underwater photography is strikingly convincing though much of it was shot in a tank. The Caribbean has never been so aquamarine. It's like reading Shakespeare's song from The Tempest  Full fathom five thy father lies  only on mescaline.I guess the third is my admiration for the writer Peter Benchley. This was his followup to the blockbusting Jaws a year earlier. Benchley takes these vacations you see to Martha's Vineyard or as here Bermuda or as later elsewhere around the Caribbean learns a little bit about some features of the local culture builds a commercial story around it and then gets to deduct all his vacations from his income taxes. Research. There must have been a fourth reason too but I'm getting a little foggy. Maybe it's the bends! Oh no. I know what it was  the story. It's  well it's FAST. And violently expectable. There are three or four dives to the old shipwreck in the movie and there's not a one of them that doesn't involve multiple hazards. On the very first mainly recreational dive Jacqueline Bisset who can be identified because she's the one wearing the soaking wet Tshirt is poking her stick around in a hole in the rocks and the stick is grabbed by some unseen varmit that yanks her repeatedly against the hole leaving her positively breathless although not at all breastless.I mean it. You just KNOW that in the course of these dives a crate of ammunition is going to be shaken loose by a quivering of the feckless wreck and dumped down on Nolte trapping him in a compartment below. You know this just as you know that sharks will appear at some point and do something that endangers the lives of the divers. For bonus points a vicious moray eel appears suddenly its manytoothed mouth wide enough to encompass a human head which it does. There will be spear guns too and they will be used in the course of an underwater fight in which dark gurgling figures tumble slowly around one another while grappling  and simultaneously a fuze sputters nearer to the dynamite planted beneath them. And knives naturally. Oh and an exploding fireball above that lighthouse and another under the hulk.Then there are scenes in which we find out about treasure establishing provenance meaning authenticating the treasure and things like that. Very educational.Should you watch it? Why not? We all need a vacation of the mind.".

The diving scenes are very impressive and it seemed the actors did the actual stunts although this I'm not sure of. The killer eel added to the mystique deep below the surface but most of the mayhem is caused by ClocheGossettand his crew because they are after the buried morphine bottles Gossett is also solid here as he makes the most of his scenes playing a man who knows what he wants and how to get it. The location and atmosphere of this film added to my viewing pleasure including the great underwater shots even if they got a bit tedious after a while. If I were to recommend the Deep I would say watch this for a solid performance by Shaw who also lives in a cool house too. I believe he passed away not too long after this film from 1977 so that added a sad note for me but he is the best character here. Lastly it seemed an odd circumstance to end the film with a disco song as it didn't fit but overall I was pleased for most of the movie.".

The characters have onetracked minds and the almost incomprehensible storyline is nearly impossible to understand and follow. On the plus side though we do get to see Jacqueline Bisset in a wet Tshirt! and the underwater scenery can be exotic at times...though it eventually does become redundant and repetitive...Well okay this movie is kind of titillating in the beginning especially with the appearance of Bisset in that lovely wet Tshirt.  However the rest of this movie is undeniably soporific...THE DEEP tells the water drowned adventures of lovers David Nick Nolte and Gail Jacqueline Bisset who are seeking out buried treasure in the depths of the oceans. However instead of finding the fabled goal the two have managed to uncover tons of hidden loot. David and Gail have just discovered under the remnants of the ship Goliath that there are plenty of contraband drugs morphine and other unwanted goods that should have remained veiled. This my friend has evoked the anger of both a group of Haitian Voodoo men and criminal drug smugglers.  The ringleader of the operation is a baldheaded Louis Gossett Jr.  Their sinister exploitative products have been exposed...and they will do anything to get them back....even if it resolves to desperate measures such as capture torture and murder...Along the way the late Robert Shaw JAWS joins in on the thrills as a partially mad scientist who may help the islandstranded couple know the truth about the items contained in the ship. However Shaw is ambitious and he wants in on the money as well. His search for goal may imperil the couple's lives...THE DEEP is a boring trite and unsatisfactory film. This movie was a consequential misfire. The sultry and alluring appearance of Miss Jacqueline Bisset is a visual asset but that can not redeem this mockery of a movie. The direction is misplaced action occurs once in a millennium and the incoherence transforms this potentially interesting film into a mess that goes nowhere. A positive aspect of this film though is some of the underwater photography. It adds some visual spice to this movie and the eyewitnessing of some beautiful sea creatures makes THE DEEP an occasionally striking film. In particular some of the suspense is not bad too. The scene where Nolte under the seas must escape from a motley of killer maneating sharks is pretty decent.However the movie spirals into repugnant mediocrity halfway through and no longer do most people even attempt to sustain any motivation for this film or its characters... THE DEEP had good visions and plenty of thoughtful intentions but the film simply fails to live up to both the author's and the audience's lively expectations.  THE DEEP is in DEEP trouble.  Stick with Benchley's other movie adaptation from his novel JAWS 1975 instead.RATING 12 out of .".

But the film soon gets bogged down in long underwater sequences and the action is scarce. I think the main problem is that it focuses too much on its story and not enough on its characters  notice how little casual character interaction there is in this film Nolte and Bisset are supposed to be a couple and yet have only one scene to themselves. 12".

But the film soon gets bogged down in long underwater sequences and the action is scarce. I think the main problem is that it focuses too much on its story and not enough on its characters  notice how little casual character interaction there is in this film Nolte and Bisset are supposed to be a couple and yet have only one scene to themselves. 12";

Korea has remained divided for decades since and is subject to the possibility of a new war at any time. It was considered one of the most destructive and bloodiest wars of the 20th century with over 4 million koreans dead 23 of them were civilian. The Korean War will always be remembered as the Forgotten War since it came on the heels of World War II and was overshadowed by the Vietnam War.".

	schema:reviewBody "Nations do not fight wars. Citizens fight them and these citizens are honorable men and women who serve their country willingly or as history shows by decree of a desperate government.As a result patriotism has become the unlikeliest casualty. Once welcomed in the trenches of battle patriotism has lost its limbs fought back from life support and suffered shell shock. Once easily recognized patriotism has become a bit of a chimera an ideal more easily attached to definable characteristics than it is any single soldier. However in the bitter end patriotism is defined by the actions of these individuals who serve it is rewarded by the nations who sponsor this service and more often than not it is measured in hardships endured.Such is the complex everchanging battleground of writerdirector Kang JeGyu's 'Taegukgi The Brotherhood of War.'In 1950's Seoul JinSeok Won Bin and his older brother JinTae Jang Donggun are enjoying a strong family life of perfect happiness. Suddenly they find their lives turned upside down as soldiers of the South Korean government seize them  all men aged 18 to 30 are taken  and they are forced to take up arms  despite their lack of training  against the approaching North Koreans. On one brutal battlefield after another the bonds of family are put to increasingly demanding tests as JinTae  originally driven by his responsibility to protect his younger brother  continues to further exhaust his physical and emotional prowess despite the protests of JinSeok. He learns that he is a good soldier one with a talent for inspiring others as well as an unanticipated thirst for killing the enemy. Eventually these two brothers  once bound by a love for family  find themselves at odds within this new brotherhood of war and the pressures to prove one another continue to exact heavier and heavier tolls as the war escalates. As circumstances evolve the brothers inevitably find themselves on opposite sides of a losing conflict  but can either find a path to redemption or reconciliation that can save both of them?There are many elements of 'Taegukgi' that elevate the film from the status of standard war film to a message of hope set against the backdrop of war. The film's scope is grand dealing with the far more intimate themes of family brotherhood and personal responsibility when Director Kang JeGyu could have easily opted for banging the drum of nationalism. At its core 'Taegukgi' is the story of two brothers a strikingly poignant analogy for the entire North Korea  South Korea dilemma. While the battlefield choreography is as frenetic as it is harrowing it never takes the film's center this picture is founded on relationships  the human perspective to the world outside  and it never falters. Instead of focusing on history Kang JeGyu crafts every scene to highlight the thoughts actions and emotions of the participants of history and for that 'Taegukgi' deserves countless accolades.Much like exploring the heart of darkness as depicted in American classics as Francis Ford Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now' and Oliver Stone's 'Platoon' Kang JeGyu forces Jintae to explore his own budding evil and this journey is not without its own relative scars. Once a man has crossed over and embraced wartime madness can he ever truly find a way out? Arguably if 'Taegukgi' suffers from any setback it is that perhaps Jintae goes too far for an audience to accept his madness believing his brother to have been killed by North Koreans Jintae turns traitor once he is captured and seeks to wipe out every soldier serving South Korea. While the story offers the motivation for so drastic a change it's hard to believe that the man who once fought so valiantly against the spread of Communism would suddenly choose to embrace it.Still it's a small diversion  but it's necessary to bring the aspect of brotherhood full circle to have these two unique men face their darkest hour and to make one final statement on the role that family inevitably plays in every man's life.Recently thanks to the worldwide success of 'Taegukgi' and 1999's blockbuster 'Shiri' Director Kang JeGyu has signed an agreement with Hollywood's own powerhouse CAA to produce his next film in America. Only time will tell whether or not this agreement will afford some of the 'Korean sensibility' to American films but certainly having one of South Korea's premier directors breaking into the Hollywood film system is a tremendous advantage for fans of international film.Only the passage of time will earn 'Taegukgi' its rightful spot alongside the other great films dealing with the consequences of war.".

I instantly got the Korean Box Set  and have seen it many times since Unfortunately  the day I saw it in the theater was the last day it was showing in Austin. A BRILLIANT FILM. The film will just shake you to the core. The South Koreans are making brutally brilliant films. Amazing. Should be rereleased with a major advertising campaign.

Taegukgi is really the best antiwar movie I have ever seen. And believe me I have seen a lot. But no movie ever before has impressed me so much. In most Hollywood productions there is only one perspective the winners view. Many directors tried to make a movie that shows both sides of the conflict but all of them failed. Until now Taegugki is showing the situation mostly from the south korean view too but it is the first movie which shows also the other side. I was very surprised that the director showed also the crime that his own government committed to their own people at this time. That movie is the first war movie that is not glorifying war  it's horrifying terrifying scary  like in reality.".

The transformation he undergoes and the madness of war he evokes and invokes leaves quite an impact garnering notice.I knew I was in for something as soon as I saw the archaeological dig of a battlefield starting the film as a grandfather's story is slowly drawn out. The flashback sequence between two brothers is heartwarming as you see the elder brother watching over and sacrificing for his younger sibling and the bond that they have. Being an only child I wish I had a brother like that. Then the war hits and everything turns upside down as the gut wrenching begins.The haunting thing about this movie is that the enemy is your own people and they speak your own language and share the same ancestors and genetics. What's more you kill your own kin because of circumstance in a situation of kill or be killed. The simmering conflict between the two brothers deserves special attention because it will hit home as the core message of the movie is made by it.

Jintae wants to release his brother trying to be the best soldier and receive a medal of honor to send him back home. The problem is that many terrible things happens in a war and even the brother's relationship becomes little by little to deteriorate.''Taegukgi hwinalrimyeo'' is a sad and tragic story about North's and South's Korea war. I am not Korean so I cannot say the general feeling that Korean people had when they watched this movie or if everything was exactly how it happened but in my personal opinion as an outsider this movie is very good and well recreated showing what I imagined when I read about the Korean war. It cannot be a bad movie if it became one of the biggest successes in Korean film history eh? I can only imagine how painful it was for brothers sistersmothers and fathers to be separated during and after the War and watching movies like this one makes you think about how pointless and horrible a war really is.".

I have seen all the greats from Paths of Glory to Platoon to Apocalypse Now and many in between. However this movie takes the spot as number 1. Never before have I been so moved by a film in my entire life. It was the only film along with Ikriu 1952 that brought me to tears. To call this a film is a travesty it is more of an epic journey of two brothers drafted and the tolls that war have on them. This movie makes you feel like your on the battlefield with these soldiers. It's harsh realism only heightens the emotion. It is undoubtedly a masterpiece. Without giving too much away I truly can't see somebody not being affected by this movie. Just remember to keep the tissues close by for this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not a big fan of war films unless the war in question was at least a couple hundred years ago or somewhere in the future or the stars  but I did enjoy SAVING PRIVATE RYAN if enjoy is the best word to use for such an experience. Apparently director Kang JeGyu SHIRI enjoyed SPR too as its influence on his Korean war film TAEGUKGI is impossible to deny. SHIRI was the South Korean film that probably did more than any other to bring the country's cinematic new wave into being and especially into the field of view of the rest of the world at large. Its main accomplishment was arguably demonstrating that Korea could make a film that competed head on with Hollywood product in terms of slick production values but also perhaps in terms of vacuous scripts Although it is rather shallow compared to other Korean films though I think it's safe to say that SHIRI had more depth than Hollywood would have injected into a similar story.TAEGUKGI is his first film since SHIRI and he's definitely playing the Hollywood game again  tackling Spielberg head on this time. Like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN TAEGUKGI attempts to humanise war by giving us some specific characters to focus on in this case two brothers played by Won Bin and Jang DongKun  and then uses our personal connection to show us that war is actually a dehumanising experience. The film also spares no effort in showing us the ability of bullets knives and bombs to turn human beings into squishy piles of gore.There's a fairly obvious political symbolism in the story of two brothers and the effects the Korean war has on their lives and relationship  I don't know if it would be fair to read the ending as a view about the conditions under which Korean reunification might occur though. The ending of the film won't come as much of a surprise since it's basically foretold at the start with a scene set in the present day. The exact details might be a little unexpected though.If you like your modernish day war films and specifically if you liked SAVING PRIVATE RYAN then there's very little doubt that TaeGukGi will impress. It's big slick and well put together. Since it's not my favourite genre or topic of interest I can't say I loved it like a brother but was sufficiently satisfied with it given what it is.".

Jintae and his mother are tough workers who sacrifice themselves to send Jinseok to the university.

The commander promises Jintae that if he gets a medal he would release his brother and Jintae becomes the braver soldier in the company. Along the bloody war between brothers the relationship of Jinseok with his older brother deteriorates leading to a dramatic and tragic end.I have just watched one of the most spectacular movies of war of the cinema industry if not the best. The stunning and overwhelming Taegukgi Hwinalrimyeo is impressive and the brilliant direction of Jegyu Kang and his crew is among the most perfect I have ever seen with realistic and gore battles and fights. The cinematography is amazing and the camera work in most of the moments seems to be a documentary so realistic it is. The sad and dramatic story shakes the emotions of the viewer with another stupid war and worst between brothers. Probably this is the best and most visceral antiwar movie ever made. DongKun Jang and Bin Won are amazing and I felt deeply sorrow with the fate of the character performed by the gorgeous Eunju Lee. How can this movie be not nominated to the Oscar? My vote is ten.Title Brazil A Irmandade da Guerra The Brotherhood of the War".

For Koreans it symbolizes a conflict that never ended a civil war between a nation divided that has never been resolved. If you watch the movie in this context then the symbolism of the protagonists and the name has a much deeper meaning. Viewers have criticized the melodrama involved but there are events in war similar to the ones in the film that have happened. The film steps away from glorifying war and shows it as brutal and unforgiving and sometimes turns family members on each other. It is a state of complete breakdown of human rationale and consequences There is no real happy ending like in many Hollywood films and the violence is not glorified. This movie is a testament to Korean War veterans all over the world. It is to South Korea's credit that they could make such an important film for future generations.".

It is a state of complete breakdown of human rationale and consequences There is no real happy ending like in many Hollywood films and the violence is not glorified. This movie is a testament to Korean War veterans all over the world. It is to South Korea's credit that they could make such an important film for future generations.";

	schema:reviewBody "The nostalgic sepiatoned segment of Seoul 1950 depicting predraft happy moments the two brothers shared with friends and family is touching and heartwarming. But director does not linger there  in fact the pace of the storyline of Taegukgi South Korean name for their national flag is more than tight it's one event after another never stops. We see the characters main and supporting cast managing the situations as they come. Korean filmmaker Kang Jegyu of Shiri provided a powerful epic film experience. The war scenes of soldiers at camp in combat on the move literally covered a lot of grounds physically and historically timelinewise. Yes it's quite melodramatic. Very much like a Korean opera. An emotional wringer we go through watching the changing situations between big brother Jintae and younger brother Jinseok the sad tragic scene of Youngshin Jintae's fiance caught between the political muddle of Koreans killing Koreans over suspecting communists involvement she did nothing wrong other than getting food for family members' survival. Big brother was too sad and furious to continue gloriously fighting for 'country' as he felt the impact of lives loss went over to the North Korean army contradictorily fought for the enemy side. Fate did play a hand at every turn. Young brother escaped burning fate as he's about to get back home to mother and family he learned of his brother at the opposing war front. He realized how much he has wrongly alienated his big brother. Sigh! No one should be judged for what they do during war  circumstances in war time can change one's psyche and outlook. From The Power of Myth PBS series in his conversations with Bill Moyers scholar and teacher Joseph Campbell talked about the ritual of people joining the army putting on a uniform giving up personal life and accepting a socially determined manner of life in the service of one's society. In times of war they're acting not as individuals they're acting as agents of something above them to which they've given themselves. To judge them as though they were individual human beings is totally improper. To all soldiers defensive or offensive they are courageous souls who sacrificed their precious family ties and all risking their lives coping with the unknown. It is humane to respect both the living and the dead.The two leads are engaging Jang Donggun is the big brother he was detective Kim in Nowhere To Hide 1999 and Won Bin is the younger brother he's a young popular TV star in South Korea. The multitude of extras for the battle scenes is part of a grand production with effective cinematography score and sound effects enabling the film depictions being devastatingly real. The layers of plot and the 'all encompassing' facetseffects of war included in the mix may be too much for some  somehow 2 hours 20 mins. of Taegukgi just came and absorbed. I understand the release of this film in South Korea coincided with the fiftieth anniversary of the country's truce with North Korea. The film was very well received a blockbuster at home. Other noteworthy warrelated films Sergeant York directed by Howard Hawks 1941 with Gary Cooper's incomparable portrayal of WWI American hero Alvin C. York. Hong Kong 1941 aka Dang doi lai ming directed by Leong Po Chi 1984 the Chow YunFat movie of the indelible friendship of three during Japanese occupation how people react and act due to wartime situations for the sake of survival saving a dear friend  it's dramatic gutsy and romantic too. Grave of the Fireflies aka Hotaru no haka directed by Isao Takahata 1988 the impressive Japanese animated film which is very much about the effects of war  a beautiful story nevertheless through the eyes of a young boy and his little sister  however difficult a situation there is magic in life and in death.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was simply an amazing film! This movie sets mark for all war movies this is how war movies should be made! This is one of the best if not the best war films I've ever seen honestly..OK first of all the movie is almost perfect in every aspect. It doesn't fail you in any imaginable way it's just that good. Everything just simply flows in a harmonic way in this movie it amazes you more and more every minute. The directing is superb the cinematography is excellent the screenplay is brilliant and the story has some originality in it too so this is not just another war movie. It's also a very touching movie besides the action in it so it doesn't even go wrong there.I have to mention the battle scenes they are simply great. I haven't seen battle scenes like that since Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers. You will be entertained and you will be amazed again and again not forgetting the whole story dramawise. The role performances of the lead actors DongKun Jang and Bin Won are simply mind blowing. In the movie they are brothers and they just handle the job perfectly without any flaws and it is a real pleasure to watch those two actors working together they really have chemistry between them just great.Oh yeah and the music. It's simply beautiful and will blow your mind away as well it's just that good. The whole soundtrack is just fantastic though the composer Dongjun Lee is unfamiliar to me but hopefully I'll be hearing some of his music in the near future movies as it sounded so good in this one. I'd give this movie 9.510 but as that is impossible I will sadly have to drop the number to 9. It probably deserves more than that but this is the decision now. What am I talking here anymore? Just see this movie it's just that brilliant! Recommending to everyone.".

This is one of the best if not the best war films I've ever seen honestly..OK first of all the movie is almost perfect in every aspect. It doesn't fail you in any imaginable way it's just that good. Everything just simply flows in a harmonic way in this movie it amazes you more and more every minute. The directing is superb the cinematography is excellent the screenplay is brilliant and the story has some originality in it too so this is not just another war movie. It's also a very touching movie besides the action in it so it doesn't even go wrong there.I have to mention the battle scenes they are simply great. I haven't seen battle scenes like that since Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers. You will be entertained and you will be amazed again and again not forgetting the whole story dramawise. The role performances of the lead actors DongKun Jang and Bin Won are simply mind blowing. In the movie they are brothers and they just handle the job perfectly without any flaws and it is a real pleasure to watch those two actors working together they really have chemistry between them just great.Oh yeah and the music. It's simply beautiful and will blow your mind away as well it's just that good. The whole soundtrack is just fantastic though the composer Dongjun Lee is unfamiliar to me but hopefully I'll be hearing some of his music in the near future movies as it sounded so good in this one. I'd give this movie 9.510 but as that is impossible I will sadly have to drop the number to 9. It probably deserves more than that but this is the decision now. What am I talking here anymore? Just see this movie it's just that brilliant! Recommending to everyone.";

The battle scenes are intense and brutal even more so then Spielberg's classic film which is a movie i really like too. They also kick in at unexpected places. They are sitting around eating and suddenly bombs are exploding and limbs are flying. The acting is incredible and emotional even though i watched it in subtitles dubbed English voices are horrible. The facial expressions said it all. The story is a heartbreaking tale of two brothers who are drafted into the Korean conflict in 1950. By the end i came this close to tearing up. And i am a tough guy. Or so i think.Now i know a lot of people in America tend to overlook foreign movies because their afraid of reading or can't read but i am finding more and more that foreign flicks are a lot better than recent Hollywood movies. Hollywood needs to take a lesson and make more creative stories.This is truly a masterpiece of modern cinema a milestone in war movies and one of the best films i have seen in a long time.

Schanberg was a stringer for the Times during the Vietnam War and was stationed in Phnom Penh in the early 1970s as onceneutral Cambodia was overrun by outside interference US and North Vietnam and collapsed into an explosively violent civil war. Schanberg reported extensively on this war assisted by Cambodian photojournalist Dith Pran and this film does an adequate job of introducing the complexities of it  the rightist government which was nominally USbacked  not touched upon during the film quickly became paralyzed by inaction stunning levels of corruption and ineptness. Simultaneously the mysterious other side deemed Les Khmer Rouges by the deposed Prince Noorodom Sihanouk fought with nearincomprehensible ferocity maintaining an impenetrable veil of secrecy about their ideology and future plans for Cambodia. With the Cambodian governmentthe Khmer Republic soon in a swift freefall the American embassy was closed on April 10 1975 and Americans  along with some Cambodians  were airlifted out. After painful debate Schanberg and Pran opted to remain in an attempt at covering the nowimminent fall of Phnom Penh. Seven days later the Khmer Rouge K.R. captured the city  the dying government shuddering to a surrender and Schanberg and Pran went into hiding in the French embassy. The finest moments of the film are the depictions of the chaos desperation and crowding at the French compound  the intent and future behavior of the K.R. were not wellknown at this point right up to and for a considerable amount of time after their victory they operated in absolute cultlike secrecy and the sense of oncoming apocalypse is perfectly expressed with a subtle seeminglythrowaway line delivered at this point by a French diplomat Adieu ancien regime as an official from the nowoverthrown Khmer republican government was lead away at gunpoint and the sound of massacres could be heard all over the city. Pran was stranded in the country as the K.R. immediately launched one of the most infamous revolutions in world history ordering cities emptied of their populations in an attempt at creating an isolationist agricultural utopia and dismantling 'bourgeois' institutions. The ideology of the K.R. critical to understanding the tragic depths of the story and skimmed over in the film was essentially a blend of the most extreme theories of Mao and Stalin mixed with a strand of nationalism rivaling any variant of fascism in its ferocity. In this harshly reconstructed society urbanites and the educated like Pran were automatically considered enemies of the people likely to be killed as potential counterrevolutionaries. Forced into a gulag in the countryside Pran camouflages his background but is still subjected to the brutalities inflicted upon many of his comrades. Upon hearing that Vietnam has invaded Cambodia Pran flees into the bush gradually making his way to the Thai border. Word reaches Schanberg who has been searching for Pran for nearly four years Cambodia had been sealed off from the outside world and the two are reunited in a refugee camp in Eastern Thailand. KILLING FIELDS is a gripping film successful on many fronts. Filmed in Thailand the performances seem very authentic and the period setting is painstakingly recreated. The cinematography has an impressive John Ford grandeur. Thus my main problems with the film amount to hairsplitting the Mike ugh Oldfield score is abysmal and at least one otherwise great scene the US embassy evacuation is ruined by it. A little more digging into some of the political ideologies swirling around the actual events would give the later scenes Pran in one of the KR collectives needed context. Other commentators here have already noted the inapproriateness of Lennon's 'Imagine' at the films' end and the mercifully brief Schanbergathome scenes during the latter half of the film are a bit much.Very intense  as doctorsurvivoractor Haing S. Ngor  who won an Oscar for his portrayal of Pran  stated in 'A Cambodian Odyssey'  his own autobiography Had the film portrayed the actual severity of what had occurred no one would've been able to sit through it. This is easily among the most harrowing tales of friendship and loyalty to have ever made it to the big screen even with minor problems a film very much worth seeing.".

When lists of the greatest war films are decided I don't believe I've ever seen this film crack any list. And the reason is simple The Killing Fields is often ignored because it doesn't come from a soldier's point of view and neither does it feature any adrenalinepumping battle sequences. The fact that a strong portion of the film about 25's comes entirely from a Cambodian man's viewpoint might throw off a few viewers here and there. And yet the film does just as fine a job as any antiwar film in creating a frightenining chaotic world.The performances all around superb without exception. Haing S. Ngor who was tragically killed a few years ago delivers a riveting emotionally wrenching turn as the guide who is trapped in Cambodia and forced to fight for his life. He deservingly won the Oscar though it's a shame he was snubbed for the best actor award. Inarguably he's the film's central character and he also has more screen time than topbilled Sam Waterston. Despite my complaint on that matter Waterston is also excellent as the journalist with a guilty conscience.The Killing Fields is a suspenseful and exhilarating experience a journey through an apocalyptic landscape that features one shocking image after another. Watch and you'll see why the film is so acclaimed.".

Scenes of high emotion tension drama horror and even one or two pieces of light relief well it has got Australia's Graham Kennedy of comedy fame.The standout scenes for mine are those in the French Embassy I can never watch the final scene from this sequence with a dry eye.An excellent film and the soundtrack is not a bad investment either.".

Times correspondent named Sidney Sam Waterston and his relationship to journalist assistant and guide named Pran Haing S Ngor  . Extraordinary feature debut for Ngor who won Best Supporting Actor Academy Award . Haing S. Ngor a reallife doctor who had never acted before and who lived through the deeds depicted at the movie  he became the first Southeast Asian and the first Buddhist to achieve an Oscar  furthermore also first film for John Malkovich who makes an awesome portrayal as intrepid photographer . Ngor's own experiences  in real life he lived Cambodian war  echoed those of his character and usually played Vietnam roles  Tortures of war Heaven and EarthIn love and war Vietnam Texas Eastern condor until his violent death by an Asian band . This exciting story depicts the war chaos  Cambodian turmoil and primal bloodletting but most of the movie is a shattering recreation of hell on Earth . Marvelous cinematography by Chris Menges who also deservedly won Oscar and filmed in Phuket Railway Hotel Hua Hin Thailand and Royal York Hotel Toronto Ontario Canada . Screeching and sensible musical score by Mike Oldfield that accompanies perfectly to the film . Roland Joffe's direction shows a generally surehand with a bit of melodrama at the end . Alain Resnais's seminal documentary Nuit et Brouillard 1955 was a touchpoint for both director Roland Joff and prestigious producer David Puttnam when they were preparing this magnificent movie. This excellent movie contains a relentless criticism to Pol Pot regime  but also US and an exact description about historic events . In power the Khmer Rouge carried out a radical program that included isolating the country from foreign influence closing schools hospitals and factories abolishing banking finance and currency outlawing all religions confiscating all private property and relocating people from urban areas to collective farms where forced labor was widespread. The purpose of this policy was to turn Cambodians into Old People through agricultural labor. These actions resulted in massive deaths through executions work exhaustion illness and starvation. In Phnom Penh and other cities the Khmer Rouge told residents that they would be moved only about two or three kilometers outside the city and would return in two or three days. Some witnesses say they were told that the evacuation was because of the threat of American bombing and that they did not have to lock their houses since the Khmer Rouge would take care of everything until they returned.Money was abolished books were burned teachers merchants and almost the entire intellectual elite of the country were murdered to make the agricultural communism as Pol Pot envisioned it a reality. The planned relocation to the countryside resulted in the complete halt of almost all economic activity even schools and hospitals were closed as well as banks and industrial and service companies.During their four years in power the Khmer Rouge overworked and starved the population at the same time executing selected groups who had the potential to undermine the new state including intellectuals or even those that had stereotypical signs of learning such as glasses and killing many others for even breaching minor rules . The Khmer Rouge forced people to work for 12 hours nonstop without adequate rest or food. They did not believe in western medicine but instead favoured traditional peasant medicine many died as a result. Family relationships not sanctioned by the state were also banned and family members could be put to death for communicating with each other. In any case family members were often relocated to different parts of the country with all postal and telephone services abolished. They committed crimes against humanity  the Khmer Rouge government arrested tortured and eventually executed anyone suspected of belonging to several categories of supposed enemies. Today examples of the torture methods used by the Khmer Rouge can be seen at the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum. The museum occupies the former grounds of a high school turned prison camp that was operated by Khang Khek Ieu more commonly known as Comrade Duch. Some 17000 people passed through this centre before they were taken to sites also known as The Killing Fields outside Phnom Penh where most were executed mainly by pickaxes to save bullets and buried in mass graves. Of the thousands who entered the Tuol Sleng Centre also known as S21 only twelve are known to have survived.".

	schema:reviewBody "Oh this brings me back alright. It was the last days of 1984 and earnest college students like me had much to talk about. Wasn't it wonderful that Walter Mondale had chosen a strong woman like Geraldine Ferraro to be his running mate and wouldn't the Democrats sweep the Northeast at least for that brave move? Does buying a Coke at the local convenience store signal support for the apartheid government in South Africa? Did anyone else see that amazing film about the human price of American involvement in Southeast Asia?It's nearly 20 years later and I've managed to shake the ill effects of my youthful liberalism easily enough in most cases. This film however packs the kind of punch that isn't explained away by political trendiness.The Killing Fields is a great film that tries and succeeds in capturing much of the carnage and tragedy of Cambodia as the radicalized Khmer Rouge and the U.S.backed regime of Lon Nol controlling Phnom Penh clash in a fight to the death to benot be the next domino in the Communist rollover in Southeast Asia. By particularizing the conflict to that of the truelife relationship of two men New York Times reporter Syndey Schanberg and his Cambodian apprentice and aidedecamp Dith Pran the film forces a level of empathy that is at once uncomfortable and absorbing. It is possible to walk away from this film hating the manipulation the Americabashing the easy liberal guilt. But it's impossible to walk away from the human experience borne witness to before the movie's done if one has any pretense of being human and that's its great strength.Oh it's polemical alright. We hear comments about how the Khmer Rouge's excesses were the direct result of Nixon's secret bombing campaign. U.S. Counsel After what the Khmer Rouge have been through I don't think they'll be exactly affectionate toward Westerners. Schanberg Maybe we underestimated the anger 7 billion in bombing would unleash. It makes its point absolves Pol Pot and condemns Kissinger with the same broad brush and it feels a bit jaded and hollow for that but I don't know. Schanberg betrays the attitudes of a kneejerk liberal and I outgrew that and maybe I feel superior for that but Schanberg had AK47s pointed at his head by 12yearold brainwashed boys and I didn't so shut up already know what I mean?The performances are incredible in their verisimilitude particularly the leads. Sam Waterson burns with righteous anger as Schanberg and I like his performance for what it is and how he creates that extra level of tension but he's a butterfly compared to the condor that's Dr. Haing S. Ngor one of the Academy's most obscure best supporting actor recipients there was even a joke about it in an episode of The Simpsons but someone who didn't just walk the walk. He relived his experience surviving a holocaust that was per square mile even more savage than the Holocaust itself. The fact he won a Best Supporting Actor award Waterson instead was nominated for Best Actor and lost to F. Murray Abraham for Amadeus is one of those perversities of film history given he carries more of the film than Waterson who slinks to the background twothirds of the way in but also that he personalizes the story in a way that makes the incomprehensible immediate and involving.We lost Ngor to a senseless murder a few years ago and have little left to explain what was going through his mind as he relived an experience that cost him his wife and child when he actually lived through it. Roland Joffe does a nice job in the DVD commentary though a commentary I put up there with P. T. Anderson's Boogie Nights and William Peter Blatty's The Ninth Configuration for being worth the price of the DVD and then some by itself. He recalls Ngor's reaction to one child actress whose hard face in enacting a scene convinced Ngor she wasn't just pretending to be Khmer Rouge and Ngor's request that Joffe participate in one critical scene by muttering real torments Ngor suffered at the hands of the KR as a way of enhancing his performance. At one point trying to convince him to come aboard Joffe said something about Ngor owing it to his country to bear witness to his story and that of Dith Pran and that did the trick though Joffe seems to wonder if the same sort of manipulation Schanberg pulled on Pran wasn't going on here too.It's a great movie because it doesn't shy away from uncomfortable truths because it never loses sight of the human dimension and because it gave a pretense of understanding to one of the great human traumas after World War II. We never wallow in gore but the cost of this war is always with us while we watch. The experience is both endurable and humiliating.I just wish they reshot that ending with Imagine. Joffe in his commentary even notes the lyrics are the sort of thing Pol Pot would have gone along with. It feels forced. Did Yoko Ono give her approval after they explained the scene her dead husband's song would appear in or after they told her the first nasty execution scene would be shot while Band On The Run issued forth from a soldier's radio?A great movie of an awful moment in human history. If we have any chance of overcoming man's sorry past it will be because movies like this one get made once in a while.".

THIS FILM IS ABOUT A WAR IN CAMBODIA. Cambodia is a neighbour of Vietnam. It's set in 197379 just after the Vietnam War!!!!!Anyway back to movie. It's brilliant not too sentimental not too cold. The acting is simply marvellous to be honest I didn't know any of the actors except for Malkovich cinematography is a touch of genius. Some people complained about the score. Well I can agree that the lyrics of Imagine in the context sound like a Khmer Rouge anthem but the rest is beautiful Oldfield did a good job.The scene when Schanberg watches some TV programme about the Cambodian War while listening to Puccini's opera is so moving just like the sight of thousands of Cambodians being evacuated by the Khmer out of Phnom Pehn.910".

	schema:reviewBody "Without doubt THE KILLING FIELDS is one of the greatest films ever to have come out of Britain . The cinematography is outstanding  watch the numerous scenes where someone runs past the camera and the camera follows them only to have the camera follow someone else when they run past it  or the way the camera spins around when the journalists are captured outside the hospital  but this film is rightly remembered for one man  Haing S Ngor  a Cambodian doctor who had his own horrors to tell after nearly being captured by the Khmer Rouge  !!!! POSSIBLE SPOILER !!!!! the scene near the end where he sees the red cross refugee camp in Thailand  is one of the most moving in the history of cinema .I wont bother to list all the great things about the film  but I will reply to some criticisms . First of all the anti American slant . Well I think we can all agree that Americas intervention in South East Asia in the 1960s has been the greatest mistake in American history . Their war in Vietnam and the bombing of Cambodia and Laos caused the massive instability that led to the rise of Pol Pot and as THE KILLING FIELDS shows when the Americans fought and lost they abandoned the Cambodian people to their fate. I also agree that the music can be intrusive but has anyone noticed that we get string orchestras for Dith Pran and ordinary Cambodian civilians and mechanical synthesisers for KR killers ? I think theres a reason for this . My only other criticism is that after reading Christopher Hudsons novelization the script makes makes some of the characters vague like Noakes and Rosa for example . But theres not much wrong with THE KILLING FIELDS  a throwback to a time when Brits made films that werent comedies  though Ill be the first to admit that this film wont be to everyones taste .And as I write this review many years after it was made THE KILLING FIELDS does have an added poignancy today . Dr Haing S Ngor was brutally murdered by a street gang for no reason at all several years ago . And we see Sydney Schanberg looking across the New York skyline with a very prominent shot of the twin towers of the WTC".

	schema:headline " Powerful Important Film";
	schema:reviewBody "I've finally seen The Killing Fields more than 20 years after it was originally released.This is one of the most powerful important films ever made. It is so important now as ever for everyone to understand what evil truly is. This movie shows evil in its worst form the form of mass murder thinly disguised as ideological cleansing.What makes this film so special is not only the barefaced method of its delivery including some horrid shots of the dumping grounds of the murdered but the way the film keeps a decidedly Southeast Asian feel. The filmmakers worked to keep that style in the scenery the music the set design and most importantly by keeping the Cambodian journalist frontandcenter in most scenes. In fact the only time the film doesn't work is when it focuses on the New York Times reporter the main reason I give this film a 9 instead of a 10 are the pacestealing scenes stateside.

	onyx:emotionText "I've finally seen The Killing Fields more than 20 years after it was originally released.This is one of the most powerful important films ever made. It is so important now as ever for everyone to understand what evil truly is. This movie shows evil in its worst form the form of mass murder thinly disguised as ideological cleansing.What makes this film so special is not only the barefaced method of its delivery including some horrid shots of the dumping grounds of the murdered but the way the film keeps a decidedly Southeast Asian feel. The filmmakers worked to keep that style in the scenery the music the set design and most importantly by keeping the Cambodian journalist frontandcenter in most scenes. In fact the only time the film doesn't work is when it focuses on the New York Times reporter the main reason I give this film a 9 instead of a 10 are the pacestealing scenes stateside. Far too often we only see such stories from our own viewpoint it's incredibly refreshing and bold to film a story like this from the viewpoint of the foreign country whose ruin was precipitated by the careless policies of our own government.Wonderfully filmed well acted brilliantly scripted The Killing Fields is a timeless important classic.

Each and every component combines together to form not only a hardhitting political statement but also a focus on a deep and pure friendship.Images of the injured bloodied distraught and destitute leave lasting effects and obviously prove uncomfortable to watch sometimes but they put us in the positions of the journalists who were stepping into the war zone of Cambodia at the time. In contrast there is the compelling scene in which Sydney Schanberg plays video footage of Nixon blatantly lying about America's involvement in Cambodia and also shows Cambodians who have been injured by the fighting. While this still evokes feelings of sadness it stirs up more angry emotions aimed at the dishonesty of the government and if looking at it from a wider perspective most politicians. This is one of The Killing Fields' great strengths  its ability to make us feel a range of emotions throughout the course of the film.At no point is there any attempt to glamorise the subject matter or try and put a Hollywood spin on it. For instance when the group of journalists are captured by the Khmer Rouge and forced into the back of the tank the closeups show the sweat and fear on their faces in the near darkness with no wisecracking lines or dramatic music just the sounds of the tank travelling to an unknown destination.The music moves away from the traditional sweeping classical score apart from the hauntingly beautiful main theme and relies heavily on synths and other electronic sounds. This actually works to great effect  possibly better than a classical soundtrack would  emphasising the confusion and fear of the people and the drama of the fighting. However it is John Lennon's Imagine played in the final scene that encapsulates the message of the film and provides a subtle yet powerful ending.All the cast excel but it's Sam Waterston and Haing Ngor who particularly shine and make their characters' relationship seem completely believable. It would have been ridiculous to have asked Ngor to put any more into his performance due to his own experiences under the Khmer Rouge regime.To put it simply you really must watch this film.".

Its provocative and dangerous subject matter stresses the importance of communication and the freedom to communicate. Based on the Khmer Rouge occupation and genocide of Cambodia in the 1970's the film tells the story of two men catapulted into chaos and peril. The movie is first and foremost a historical account. The events are based off the true story of Dith Pran and Sydney Schanberg. Given that I had not known much about the Cambodian genocide of the 1970's prior to seeing this film I must herald the piece as a successful feat of cinematography that served as both informational as well as inspirational. The film is believable realistic and heart wrenching. I immediately felt for the two main characters as they quickly exchanged trust and fell victim to the powers of political violence.

'Wash away' is being used in a light context though people such as doctors students teachers etc are being killed. Children are being honoured and respected as their minds have not had the time to be corrupt by the western traditions. This explains the fact that many of the Khmer Rouge are in fact teenagers. We experience through our eyes the many horrid nightmares Dith experiences at the hands of these young tyrants.Review A pretty typical story of an individual being caught in a 'wipeout' program much akin to the many holocaust films out there. What makes this film stand out is that it shows the viewers a different regime in history with very much the same effects on its population as the holocaust. The acting is superb by all degrees in fact the main actor Dith Pran real name Haing S Ngor has actually been through the horrors of Pol Pot's regime. In conclusion a nice movie to watch just to see the power of a regime other than the Nazi's as well as a man who has to go through all of it.810  Won't be forgotten in a good way!".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1975 the revolutionary group Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia and initiated a regime that reportedly claimed two million lives. At the time the Vietnam War was still going on Cambodia was a strategic territory for the American army and the country was full of journalists. The basis of the movie's story comes from the lives of two of them New York Times journalist Sydney Schanberg and Dith Pran Cambodian photojournalist and interpreter who coined the term Killing Fields. Written by Bruce Robinson based on their writings the movie follows in fact two stories one is the fall of Phnom Penh the capital and the evacuation of the international embassies as witnessed by Sydney and Pran and Sydney's return to the USA and the second more radical narrative shows the horrors of the Khmer Rouge as witnessed by Pran after he's captured and sent to work in a Killing Field and his epic escape to freedom.From Phnom Penh Sydney and Pran report the events of the civil war between the government and the Khmer Rouge with the revolutionaries clearly gaining control of the country. The international embassies start evacuating their personnel. Sydney and Pran opt to remain although Pran sends his wife and family away. As the Khmer Rouge revolutionaries enter the city they're initially received with joy and prospects of peace everyone tired of the war. Even Pran joins the festivities. However the Khmer Rouge split in different factions due to internal power struggles continue to fight in the capital. Sydney and Pran find refuge in the French embassy until it's also evacuated and all Cambodians hiding there are turned over to the revolutionaries.For the time the movie was quite revolutionary in casting a nonamateur actor in the role of Dith Pran. They found Haing Somnang Ngor a doctor living in the USA to portray Pran. Like Pran Ngor had also spent four years in the killing fields before escaping. He won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in 1985 for this role. He played the role with naturalism and lightness displaying a restraint in emotions in situations where an actor would typically go into melodramatic mode. The choice of Ngor is ahead of its time for another reason. AngloAmerican movies tend to work on the logic that audiences can only care for the plight of foreign countries if the experiences are mediated through a character from their culture that's why war correspondents are usually the main characters in such movies. Although now thanks to movies like Letters from Iwo Jima and Hotel Rwanda this is changing casting a Cambodian actor to tell the story of a Cambodian prisoner of the Khmer Rouge was audacious then.Sam Waterston also delivers a powerful performance as Sydney an authoritarian boss who blames himself for having used Pran to further his career only to abandon him. Back in New York he starts an international campaign to find his friend always wondering whether he's doing enough for him. The movie is also helped with performances from John Malkovich and Julian Sands as two other journalists Craig T. Nelson as the US Army officer in charge of the American evacuation and Spalding Gray as the morallytorn American Consul wary of abandoning the country to the revolutionaries.The scenes in the Killing Fields still have decades later and after graphic violence has become generalised the power to affect because of how the movie shows the psychological roots of the crimes. It's not that the images are excessively violent it's that the movie depicts a philosophy of inhumanity. Regimes don't just producer horror for its own sake the violence is just a tool to implement ideas. Rather than just showing the horrors the movie shows the philosophy which the violence was used to enforce the viewer is taken into the classrooms where children are being taught to hate the concept of family and any personal relationships that may threaten blind loyalty to the party children are given power over life and death intellectuals teachers journalists are executed for their skills people are forbidden from growing crops because that's a sign of free initiative even though thousands are starving to death The movie confronts us with those ideas and we can't help but ask How the hell did anyone ever think these ideas could work in a society? Not everything holds up as well in the movie. Many good scenes are ruined by Mike Oldfield's intrusive cacophony of synthesizer noises. Nowadays when we listen to electronic scores with less patience than our ancestors did back in the '80s a lot of this music sounds horrible. Oldfield one of my favourite living musicians is by no means an inept film composer however half the score when he turns to traditional orchestration is majestic. Pran's Theme and its variations are appropriately elegiac and Requim for a City with its chorus of grieving voices is a haunting attempt at showing through music the misery of the one million Cambodians forced by the Khmer Rouge to abandon the capital in a forced march to the countryside to work on the Killing Fields.Twentyseven years later what the movie has to say about the darkness in the human soul and the determination to overcome it remains fresh.".

You feel as though you are right there with these men as they experience desperation amid the shocking violence of war. The palpable mood of gutwrenching fear and tension that the actors project goes far beyond the standard Hollywood fare. This movie is a subtle collage of sound sights and emotion that is very rare. The cast is uniformly excellent and in technical terms the directioncinematographyediting soundtrack sets and screenplay are as good as it gets. It should have won Best Picture as far as I am concerned. Haing S. Ngor deserved his Oscar and Sam Waterston should have won Best Actor too. This is an incredible story and an incredible movie.

	schema:headline " Brutal and Realistic Depiction of WarTorn Cambodia";
	schema:reviewBody "The Killing Fields follows the story of A New York Times journalist Sydney Schanberg and his Cambodian translator Dith Pran. Schanberg is there to report on Cambodia's border being bombed by the U.S. during the last years of the Vietnam War. These bombings make Cambodia vulnerable to the takeover by the Khmer Rouge regime which becomes Schanberg's new story.Schanberg and his colleagues are journalists who want people to know what really is going on as opposed to the watered downnonexistent radioTV coverage about Cambodia's problems. John Malkovich's photo journalist character makes a snide remark about a certain BBC reporter who must sneak reports past the Khmer Rouge soldiers in the beaks of chickens that somehow make it to Thailand.Schanberg gets Pran's family out of Cambodia to America as the American Embassy and everybody else is getting out of Cambodia because they know that the Khmer Rouge is going to takeover the capital city. But Pran stays behind with Schanberg. Pran sees the Khmer Rouge parading through town and believes there might be peace but his hopes are dashed as the Khmer Rouge soldiers kidnap Pran and the journalists for awhile. Things in Cambodia go from bad to worse and the journalists are given one last chance to leave but no Cambodians can go. The journalists try and doctor a passport for Pran but it fails. Schanberg and the other journalist believe Pran will die at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. Malkovich blames Schanberg for Pran's fate. Schanberg begins to symbolize America in the way we bombed used Cambodia Pran and left it behind just when they needed our help.Disturbing scenes of children caring guns a young girl suffocating a prisoner and skeletons floating in a ditch show the atrocities of this dictatorship.

	onyx:emotionText "The Killing Fields follows the story of A New York Times journalist Sydney Schanberg and his Cambodian translator Dith Pran. Schanberg is there to report on Cambodia's border being bombed by the U.S. during the last years of the Vietnam War. These bombings make Cambodia vulnerable to the takeover by the Khmer Rouge regime which becomes Schanberg's new story.Schanberg and his colleagues are journalists who want people to know what really is going on as opposed to the watered downnonexistent radioTV coverage about Cambodia's problems. John Malkovich's photo journalist character makes a snide remark about a certain BBC reporter who must sneak reports past the Khmer Rouge soldiers in the beaks of chickens that somehow make it to Thailand.Schanberg gets Pran's family out of Cambodia to America as the American Embassy and everybody else is getting out of Cambodia because they know that the Khmer Rouge is going to takeover the capital city. But Pran stays behind with Schanberg. Pran sees the Khmer Rouge parading through town and believes there might be peace but his hopes are dashed as the Khmer Rouge soldiers kidnap Pran and the journalists for awhile. Things in Cambodia go from bad to worse and the journalists are given one last chance to leave but no Cambodians can go. The journalists try and doctor a passport for Pran but it fails. Schanberg and the other journalist believe Pran will die at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. Malkovich blames Schanberg for Pran's fate. Schanberg begins to symbolize America in the way we bombed used Cambodia Pran and left it behind just when they needed our help.Disturbing scenes of children caring guns a young girl suffocating a prisoner and skeletons floating in a ditch show the atrocities of this dictatorship. Somehow Pran manages to survive in a prison campwhere he is starved brainwashed and tortured. He finally escapes and reunites with Schanberg.There are some scenes in which some subtitles would have been appreciated. The Killing Fields has been criticized for leaning to the left in its view of what happened in Cambodia and I agree with that. It's really amazing that a movie like this ever got made considering the Hollywood machine. I recommend The Killing Fields for fans of Vietnam movies.

	schema:reviewBody "Possible spoilersThe Killing Fields attempts to tell the story of the Cambodian holocaust through its two main characters NY Times journalist Sidney Schanberg and Cambodian Dith Pran. Unfortunately the film only succeeds in telling Schanberg's view of the Cambodian Holocaust.As mentioned by a previous reviewer Pol Pot the architect of the tragedy is not mentioned once. Schanberg's unwillingness to see the Khmer Rouge for what they really were is briefly touched on but that is excused by the journalist attempting to blame the holocaust on the Nixon Administration and their bombing campaign. While it can be argued that there may have been more humane ways to attempt to prevent the Communist takeover realistically there weren't any other options available to the Nixon administration given the legislative handicaps placed on them by the Congress regarding action in Cambodia. It would've been nice to see that point addressed as it would have been nice for the film to acknowledge that four days before the Khmer Rouge victory Schanberg wrote a column for the NY Times entitled Indochina without Americans For most a better life. The horrors being committed by the Khmer Rouge in eastern Cambodia had been reported by refugees for well over a year by that point and yet Schanberg and the Times refused to acknowledge it.It is bad enough that this film perpetuates the canard that the Americans were to blame for the holocaust because of their bombing campaign. What is absolutely unacceptable is that while passing judgment on US policy this film never once brings up let alone finds fault with the North Vietnamese policies in Cambodia. It was under the auspices of the North Vietnamese that the Khmer Rouge was founded in 1959. It was in Hanoi that Pol Pot and 30000 other KR's found sanctuary and training. It was Hanoi that initially violated the neutrality of Cambodia taxing and conscripting peasants into their cause of conquest. It is the very height of absurdity that this film blames the US while not once mentioning either Pol Pot or the NVA's role in what occurred.All that being said the story of the Cambodian holocaust is very important history that should be known by all. It is my hope that this tale will be given more balanced treatment in the future by someone in Hollywood. But given its current aversion to making films about the crimes of Communism or ones with plot I won't hold my breath.".

	schema:reviewBody "The acting is very good. I'm not just saying that because I'm impressed brown people from foreign countries can act as I suspect many are. Some of the guards are impressively menacing for example. It's hard to give John Malkovitch credit because he's always good.The story is a little selfindulgent much of it is about the Americans. I'd venture to guess that the actual Killing Field period takes up less than 40 of the film's time.The score is lousy but then really a lot of scores at the time this was made were terrible. Yes there are some gems. But there's a whole lot of rubble.Ultimately my problem with the movie is that if you're looking for a fair understanding of what happened in Cambodia this isn't it. It's an attempt by some people to wash their hands of their own culpability and to whitewash the atrocities committed by those whose political philosophy they are sympathetic towards.The show does nothing of any real significance to demonstrate the unparalleled horror that the Khmer inflicted on Cambodia and instead hopes to write it off as the result of American bombing. Silly.Leave aside the unmentioned fact that the bombings were sanctioned by the Cambodian government which had thrown out the Prince who was allowing the country to be used by the North Vietnamese. That's not an unimportant fact. I hope viewers understand that Cambodia is how the North Vietnamese infiltrated the South  get a map and look at where Saigon and the Mekong Delta are and you'll suddenly begin to understand why there was so much fighting in that notorious swamp and why Nixon bombed Cambodia. Secret? To whom? It was no secret to the Cambodians. The fact that some Americans drone on about its secrecy is merely evidence of their own selfimportance. What does the secrecy of the bombings  to the American mind  have to do with the fact that leftist Cambodians were teaching children to hack their families to death with machetes? If the bombings made them do it why the need to indoctrinate children away from the idea of family? One has zero to do with the other but everything to do with a philosophy of Party and State. But you're talking about a regime the Khmer that managed  in a country with a population density somewhere around presentday Wisconsin  to round up and slaughter somewhere between 1 out of every 6 and 1 out of every 4 people. Even the Vietnamese didn't commit these kinds of atrocities and we flattened the place. They had cities to bomb and bomb them we did. As we did Germany and Japan. The Khmer always intended to do the things they did but it would be too much for Chomskyites to admit that this is the logical conclusion of their radical inclinations.It would be good to really get a handle on what was done. I suspect we'll have to wait a long time before we ever get a fair treatment of what happened to the Kulaks what happened in the real Gulags during the Great Leap Forward the Cultural Revolution the North Vietnamese conquering of the South and what the Khmer did.The use of Communist Viet Nam appears only as the plot device albeit a historic one that allows the protagonist to attempt his escape of course by a real Khmer patriot now suddenly worried about where his country is going. It mentions the border scuffles in a single line. Nothing about the fact that waves of human beings were fleeing Cambodia by any means possible to Thailand Burma and Viet Nam which was already conducting its own pogrom against the South while gearing up to go to war with their former sponsors the Chinese. Red on Red indeed.And yeah Imagine is a silly song. Communists butchered many many people because those people were attached to their religions. This is just spitting on their graves.".

	schema:reviewBody "How this movie got made with a supposedly 70 million budget and without being completely retooled is beyond me. The storyline and dialogue are beyond amateurish. Characters say things no real person would ever say and almost never react to things that were said before. No one seems to be grounded in the real world. The acting of the leads is fine given that the writing is such a dud...but several actors in supporting roles really drag the production down. The hero's hair probably should've gotten its own credit it was so oddly attention grabbing...not to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the pic. Finally for a movie about L.A. being besieged by giant reptiles this film is shockingly boring. What a shame! If you do see this your mind will be constantly racing thinking up ways that you could have taken the SFX scenes and built a far better movie around them. Sadly it wouldn't have taken much.".

	schema:headline " A review of DWar";
	schema:reviewBody "To review DWar sometimes called Dragon Wars or Dragon Wars DWar with any real depth would be an exercise in utter futility. I mean that really. The film is a big loud special effects bonanza the likes of which have been seen plenty of times on United States soil but DWar is unique in the fact that it is not an American production but an Asian one specifically of the South Korean kind.But just because it's a South Korean movie with American actors does that really make it good? It's a yesnomaybe so type of answer. DWar comes to us from South Korean import Hyungrae Shim who announced the project back in 2002 and has spent the last five years getting it off the ground. It's received mostly negative reviews here in the U.S. and in South Korea where it set box office records for an opening week with an estimated five million viewers within a nineday timespan but the movie's special effects and action sequences are undeniably stunning. But it's a shame about the story and characters.Supposedly based on an ancient Korean legend a 200meterlong Imoogi a giant serpent called Buraki is denied a chance at immortality when two young lovers who are destined to perform the ceremonial rights run away and perish in their escape. 500 years later in Los Angeles the man is reincarnated as American news reporter Ethan Jason Behr who as a child was given a powerful pendant by an elderly antiques dealer named Jack Robert Forster and now has to find the reincarnated woman Sarah Amanda Brooks before her 20th birthday.Sure enough in special effects sequences that seem right out of any Asian monster flick made in the last 50 years the dragon Buraki reappears with his seemingly invincible army of demonic warriors to continue his 500year pursuit of what is rightfully his. Lots of explosions guns and destruction as ancient slams headon into 21stcentury military technology and Ethan and Sarah try to find a way to stop Buraki and his army before he destroys the city.DWar is a film that looks and sounds amazing in theory but the execution is so poor that you'll rightfully feel that you've been cheated by the time the credits roll. Make no mistake Buraki and his minions look pretty cool and plenty menacing and the destruction they bring about in their action sequences is nothing short of breathtaking. In this regard Shim has surely done his job in presenting DWar as a noholdsbarred scififantasy action epic.On the other hand the film's human players are drastically shortchanged and given cheap hokey dialogue and scenes that rarely connect. It seems that the only reason they're here is to give us something to root for which is not in any real way genuine. DWar unfortunately comes off as something a lot closer to the poor American adaptation Godzilla 1998 than anything that is uniquely Korean. Another problem is that the story seems to take itself a little too seriously with cheap humor that doesn't get anything greater from us than a weak little laugh. The acting and direction seem mediocre at best so that you do feel a little sorry for the hokey performances of American heavyweight Robert Forster and upandcoming Jason Behr which is a real shame because Hyungrae Shim is obviously a capable talent who knew what he wanted to do here and surely enough had the means to do it. His head seems full of ideas but the problem is with the execution of those ideas maybe he was trying to do too much without really working out the material in greater detail. And the ending a wouldbe Raiders of the Lost Ark special effects showdown seems pretty cheap too.I really wanted to like this movie believe me but DWar is a mediocre attempt at something that really had potential to be spectacular. But maybe it's because I'm an American. Maybe you'd have to be Korean to understand the mythical themes about that classic battle between good and evil. It's just too bad that the finished product of DWar appears to be like any other Bgrade monster movie than the extraordinary idea that the director had in mind.510".

I'll list the good parts of this movie The creature effects. All of the creatures were welldone their movements were realistic and they fit into the other imagery well. To be honest the creature effects were the ONLY reason I gave this movie a 2 rather than a 1. Now the bad things The acting. Good Lord I've seen bad acting but this movie takes the cake. Not a single one of the characters is even close to believable. It's like the director sent out a casting call and picked all the worst tryouts from it. I tried very hard not to giggle too loud cause I didn't wanna upset anyone else in the theatre but the acting really was THAT BAD. The storyline The entire story is full of plot holes from beginning to finish. You can pick at least 5 plot holes out of any given 30 minutes of film. The plot holes of course are complimentary with the cheese. This is probably one of the most clichd not thoughtout and outright dumbest stories I've ever seen put on screen since I had the grave misfortune of sitting up one night and watching Parasite on the SciFi channel. The dialogue This is a world where everyone says the cheesiest and most clichd thing they possibly can at every chance they possibly can. In this world it seems like every line has been spoken before in at least 30 other lowbudget creature movies. It is the world of cheese and clich. The special effects. While the creature effects were downright awesome the special effects fail miserably. Yes they are better than those seen in other movies but a lot of it is in the presentation. And this movie has no presentation whatsoever. It looks kinda like the special effects used on the Power Rangers TV show to be honest. To sum up Dragon Wars is worth neither your time nor your money. The concept is good but it is trapped in the bad directing acting dialogue and cheesiness of the film. Wait til the next big monster movie comes out. It's gotta be better than this cause Dragon Wars is absolutely horrible.".

That's right. This movie is a huge hit in Korea whether it is a masterpiece or crap. The increase rate of total viewer number is such that there is saying that DWar will surpass the total viewer record of 13 million a record set by last year's The Host.For this particular film there are ongoing struggle between two sizable forces. The Korean orthodox filmmaking faction represented by 'Choong Moo Ro'  the Korean version of Hollywood  is the major force of filmmaking in Korea. This is where almost all Korean movies were born.And there is an unorthodox film making faction. In fact it is so small in size and force to compare fairly with the other side. Therefore it is treated not as much as a faction but just a timetotime phenomenon that pops up once in a while.Director Shim belongs to the latter and his film DWar is the single most successful as of yet in Korean market case.Shim was and I believe he still is one of the most famous therefore successful comedian in Korean of all time. That is a fact everyone even the Choong Moo Ro faction acknowledges.However the fact that he is a successful comedian worked against his transition to a film director.I don't know about other countries but in here the comedian used to be treated as 'low class job' because what they do looked silly so when he became a director he was ruthlessly criticized by the orthodox faction.Those criticisms still exist today as you can find those in Korean film related sites.So what happened? Almost um... no that's a wrong word. All of the critics rated DWar at the bottom end sometimes even lower than some of the real crap film which did not survive in domestic market for more than a week. Their rating was very simple. If a forreal crap film made by the orthodox faction has terrible plot they would shrug and say 'it's creative.' This in turn fueled the rage of people using the internet called Netizen here and they took their fight to the orthodox faction creating a BIG MESS as a result.With such a huge struggle going on general population overheard the news of it and many of them became more curious about the film of issue the DWar I suspect this event ironically played a big role DWar getting this record breaking sale in domestic market.Now about the film itself.As I've seen it I don't think it is a knockout that some people say but I don't think it's such a bad movie that some others say.The plot is there however lacking it's smoothness in transition between the scenes. And the plot itself is not bad.The problem is how the film weaves the story. In that part there is a major 'Whoopsie' that in turn creates three major serious but not totally lethal I think problems.The fact that total running time is about 90mins may have affected it but since Shim must have played a part in editing it might not be a good excuse.First it brings some confusion in understanding the storyline.Second it affects the actors and actresses making their acting look awkward and out of place sometimes.Third it makes the first half of the movie quite boring since that part is where the film explains the overall plots and develops them. Actually there was some good humor evenly placed the director Shim's trademark sort He used to be a Comedian if you have forgotten to ease the boredom but it's quite 'Korean thing' so I doubt it might work in offshore market.Okay so is the DWar really crap? I wouldn't say so. Personally I was bored to hell in the first half of the movie but was mesmerized to the CG scene in the second half.The second half of the movie where the action really starts is where the 'fun' begins. That is if you endured the first half without major outburst of anger and exited the theater by kicking the door open Well the battle scene is quite good considering its CG was all domestic I mean Korean technology and it was really their first shot at it.Compared to Transformer? In evaluation of absolute term Transformer is better. I mean c'mon what did you expect? The total cost for DWar is around 70 billion won which is approximately 75 million. How much did the Transformer cost? I don't know. But I don't think it's anywhere near 75 mil.That fact in mind CG in DWar is not half bad. It's even impressive in some way as long as you don't measure it with major Hollywood blockbuster film standard. I mean you don't compare Lamborghini and Ford Mustang by same standard do you? So there you have it.DWar is not a 'recordsetting' blockbuster but it's not a 'Straight to DVD shop' crap.Some of you might quite enjoy it while some of you won't.".

That is a fact everyone even the Choong Moo Ro faction acknowledges.However the fact that he is a successful comedian worked against his transition to a film director.I don't know about other countries but in here the comedian used to be treated as 'low class job' because what they do looked silly so when he became a director he was ruthlessly criticized by the orthodox faction.Those criticisms still exist today as you can find those in Korean film related sites.So what happened? Almost um... no that's a wrong word. All of the critics rated DWar at the bottom end sometimes even lower than some of the real crap film which did not survive in domestic market for more than a week. Their rating was very simple. If a forreal crap film made by the orthodox faction has terrible plot they would shrug and say 'it's creative.' This in turn fueled the rage of people using the internet called Netizen here and they took their fight to the orthodox faction creating a BIG MESS as a result.With such a huge struggle going on general population overheard the news of it and many of them became more curious about the film of issue the DWar I suspect this event ironically played a big role DWar getting this record breaking sale in domestic market.Now about the film itself.As I've seen it I don't think it is a knockout that some people say but I don't think it's such a bad movie that some others say.The plot is there however lacking it's smoothness in transition between the scenes. And the plot itself is not bad.The problem is how the film weaves the story. In that part there is a major 'Whoopsie' that in turn creates three major serious but not totally lethal I think problems.The fact that total running time is about 90mins may have affected it but since Shim must have played a part in editing it might not be a good excuse.First it brings some confusion in understanding the storyline.Second it affects the actors and actresses making their acting look awkward and out of place sometimes.Third it makes the first half of the movie quite boring since that part is where the film explains the overall plots and develops them. Actually there was some good humor evenly placed the director Shim's trademark sort He used to be a Comedian if you have forgotten to ease the boredom but it's quite 'Korean thing' so I doubt it might work in offshore market.Okay so is the DWar really crap? I wouldn't say so. Personally I was bored to hell in the first half of the movie but was mesmerized to the CG scene in the second half.The second half of the movie where the action really starts is where the 'fun' begins. That is if you endured the first half without major outburst of anger and exited the theater by kicking the door open Well the battle scene is quite good considering its CG was all domestic I mean Korean technology and it was really their first shot at it.Compared to Transformer? In evaluation of absolute term Transformer is better. I mean c'mon what did you expect? The total cost for DWar is around 70 billion won which is approximately 75 million. How much did the Transformer cost? I don't know. But I don't think it's anywhere near 75 mil.That fact in mind CG in DWar is not half bad. It's even impressive in some way as long as you don't measure it with major Hollywood blockbuster film standard. I mean you don't compare Lamborghini and Ford Mustang by same standard do you? So there you have it.DWar is not a 'recordsetting' blockbuster but it's not a 'Straight to DVD shop' crap.Some of you might quite enjoy it while some of you won't.";

All we got was a mindless hour and a half. The CG was not as bad as I was expecting but the plot is so awful along with the acting it made up for it. Its basically a Chinese legged of dragons returning every 500 years...Sounds like a good remake of Rain of Fire? No The plot tries to be deeper than it should be leaving not only plot holes but with magic and a very small actual war between dragonsrather big snakes it just gets ridiculous. The director attempted to add a bit of humor in the movie which fail. Me and my friend laughed through the whole thingalong with all 5 of the audience and cant believed we spent money on this. The short trailer on TV makes up for most of the action while crap makes up the rest.

	schema:reviewBody "Over the weekend I had a chance to visit with Korean filmmaker director Mr.Shim Hyung Rae here in Korea home to the Yonggu Arts and Entertainment Company. As we toured the rather spacious Digital Production studios located in a secluded area near Kimpo Airport  I got a sense of what really happens behind the scenes during the post production phased of a CGI film. DWAR's the title of his latest movie and dragon war props appeared everywhere and were used in several sequences of the scifi thriller five years in the making . Although I knew that Shim HyungRae had a reputation that preceded him I could not help but wonder if DWAR was simply a remake of his previous movie aptly called REPTILIAN. After the first five minutes into the extended preview of DWAR however I knew that such conceptions I had of a boring remake was not only far fetched but a misnomer. The way computer science and technology are mastered here made it perfectly clear that the director has come a long  long way from REPTILIAN a very low grossing film. Not only does Mr. SHim succeed in the use of a real plot this time but he casts real American actors not to mention a compelling drama that takes us back 500 years to a period of ancient history known as the Chosun Dynasty. But the director's message is just as relevant as it works it way through to present day Los Angeles. Even Mr. Shim himself is convinced that he's no longer a mediocre film maker as he plys his trade as a creative tourdeforce in directing CGI films.Will DWAR defy any other description other than a blockbuster ? That question remains to be answered since the movie is set to be released this summer when we all get the chance to experience the absolute conquest of mankind . I did breathe a sigh of relief during a private screening and I was able to see some familiar faces on the big screen. The movie cast includes American actors such as dreamy Jason Behr and the hero Ethan Kendricks who must save Los Angeles from an army of ATROX soldiers.I figured most of the ATROX droidsclad in black armour were probably cheaper by the dozen to hire but as I found out later they were not hired extras but life size figures that were made from heavy metals and stored safely for future takes ! That was enough to convince me that there seemed to be a greater magnitude to this scifi flick than meets the eye.There's even a newborn baby that appears all too real but she too was made from an incredibly realistic computer rendered model. I took careful production notes about the advanced computer animation process that was used and I was also shown how the crying baby was preserved in glass and an exact replica of someone's first born.As we winded up the tour the most pressing question in my mind was what becomes a legend most for Mr. Shim a long time veteran in the film making business who has made over 20 films. The answer seemed to emanate from his most ambitious project The IMOOGI's of course! That's a Korean word for a mythical creature that evolved over time and it's in D WAR that the IMOOGI attempts to morph into a defiant dragon.In closing I'd rate D WAR a solid B for its exciting visuals and explosive scenes that keeps a pace all its own. Also in production for Mr. Shim's next movies are GOSEONG LEGEND and a computer animation feature based on the life of myriad fishes in the sea.ANNONG !IRENE NAKANO HARVARD U.

I won't detail the story but let me correct some poor reporting There IS a story  a very rich story at that! But it was not the story indicated in the few ads that were run.This is a story and effectsdriven vehicle wherein the South Korean tale of the Imoogi is told via memories of our lead character. It could have been a wellbalanced work adding in the characterdriven plot lines however the acting herein was so poor as to drive this film down into the annals of the B actionhorror flick.The effects are awesome! The treatment of the Eastern Dragon after transformation was nothing short of a pure work of art! This is not just another monster movie. The story line and overall finished product far outweigh any Godzilla movie of which TOHO ever dreamed.However.The film quality is poor. A better quality would have lent a great deal to this work but even the best quality would not have overridden the stiff performances and fake smiles. Though it did not detract from the overall effectiveness of the work it did lessen the enjoyment somewhat.Frankly the Lord of the RingsStar Warsworthy CGI combined with poor acting quality and brilliant style left this production feeling more uneven and unprepared for filming as if the actors themselves did not have their hearts in this work.All in all? We were highly entertained by both the story and the visuals but we cannot decide whether this should be rated as a fantastic B flick or a decent A film.It rates a 9.910 on the B Scale which is about a 7.410 on the A Scale from...the Fiend .".

I never thought such horrible acting existed it was all just too funny. The story behind the movie is decent but the movies scenes fail to portray them. I have never seen such a stupid movie in my life which is why it I think its worth watching. I give this movie 10 out of 10 for being the most pathetic movie ever created this movie seems like it was solely created to become trash. I mean the scenes seem so fake and the actors act like the camera is in front of them. You will get a kick just watching how lame this movie is me and my friend could not stop making jokes during the movie the darthvader guy who tries to get the girl got ran over not once but twice and the second time he got ran over it sounded like he said sh! although he doesn't speak English lol. If you watch this movie you will think to yourself that all those other movies you didn't like you took for granted they are way better than this. This movie should be seen out of curiosity as well as what kind of movie DEFINES lame. The evil serpent encountered the girl so many times it was ridiculous the evil serpent just roared and roared and let her get away every time. The evil serpent had so many chances it was like god was trying to say hurry up and eat the girl how many miracles do you want. The transition between scenes leaves you wondering did I miss something? So many plot holes from scene to scene. I was laughing like crazy when they decided to Escape To Mexico to get away from the serpent. Hmmmm hopping the border will save you from a serpent from Korea? interesting... very interesting.... I guess hopping the border solves all problems. Another scene that completely stupified me.. they met for the first time and had a romantic scene at the beach they kissed and didn't even know each other... the scene was so clichd and the was no substance at least in other movies it might seem logical afterwhile but i mean they JUST MET even though they are reincarnations there feelings were like they instantly loved each other instead of it rather developing. Anyways this movie is worth watching for the sake of opening your eyes and seeing the light. Bad Hollywood movies will seem like heaven when compared to this. In the end its worth watching you wont get bored you will be occupied criticizing every moment every scene in your head.".

I've never seen this kind of action. The way Burakee sweeps the roads made me feel thrilled. And the last part  Spoiler  when the Yimooki turns into a Dragon and flies to the sky it was very impressive. It's a totally different dragon we imagine. I like the ending very much.

Also... you really can't be that blatant with your title unless your Blue Monkey. Blue Monkey can do whatever the hell it wants. The second sign of a rocky relationship between us was the story's insane progression.

Old shop keep reveals several terrible truths. That Bauraki a supposedly evil snake was cheated out of his chance to be a god. tells the kid that he's a reincarnated warrior and that somewhere in LA is his reincarnated lover and gives him a junk piece of jewelry. Shop keep also reveals that despite his obvious whiteness he's a 500 year old Asian. fifteen years later dreamy reporter remembers this perfectly and starts acting half crazy trying to find this random girl. cgi hijinks follow and in the last ten minutes my brain melts out of my nose. Why? Continue on dear reader if you have the Balls.so Sarah the reincarnated lover has her own flashbacks. I have the benefit of having an Asian best friend and in the scene where she starts to freak out and make a bunch of posters with Asian characters on them he tells me that whoever made this movie has no idea what their doing. Its a Korean legend and she's reincarnated from a Korean princess but everything is in Chinese. Later that night her dragon tat starts to hurt she calls the police cause it looks like she's having a heart attack. See in this mixed up crazy world they apparently handle heart attacks differently because the next time we see her she's locked in her room with a guard outside and a nurse claims she's crazy. I have a new phobia now and its that if i'm ever in trouble the first responders will just assume i'm crazy. I have another point of contention with my harsh mistress Dwar. There is a scene when Patrick Dempsey Jr Dreamy Reporter is in a caf' with sassy black friend. In the scenes prior Miffed Near divinity Bauraki has killed an elephant slithered through a suburb and killed one of Sarah's friends. See people were afraid to come out after 911 happened but we must have all toughened up after that deciding coffee and pastries were worth risking our lives for. Business as usual no way a giant snake will stop me from getting my caffeine on. If i stay inside and fear for my life the terrorists and serpentine divinities win. After being given a satisfying dragon on Helicopter battle my cruel lover Dwar treats me to a pi and vinegar filled scene to end it all with. Bauraki has a fortress of his own and its right under LA i guess. They don't really say but Dreamy Reporter and Sarah get knocked out in a car crash that would kill lesser men and when they wake up yep dragon palace. some retarded dialog later a good dragon snake god pops out of nowhere and the snakes wrestlemake love whatever. And i'm not kidding good snake out of nowhere. Maybe you think i'm blowing it out of proportion i'm not there is no mention of this thing in the movie then suddenly... there! Few seconds later and good dragon becomes dragon god sets Baurki on fire Sarah turns into a ghost and goes with Dragongod dreamy reporter left in the middle of nowhere roll credits... thank godNow our relationship as rocky as it was had its good times. There was a guy that look like shredder from turtles and talked exactly like a tuskan raider from star wars. I'll call him Tuskan Shredder. He could do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted to it just could never be useful. He could walk through a wall in a scene where that wasn't helpful. He could go in your dreams when that wouldn't do any good and he could light ten random soldier guys on fire but not when it mattered. He was also allergic to touching that junk jewelry. I like him cause he was hit by a car twice in the same scene and made fantastic tuskan raider noises. The actors for the most part were great... if great somehow meant terrible. Jason Behr whom i thought was awesome in Roswell i slowly find out can only act one way and that's pretentious spacey and Patrick Dempseyish.The one thing i love about this filthy prostitute Dwars is its lead actor Bauraki. That Giant snake acted his heart out. I'd dare to say that he was better at playing a cgi serpentine demigod of evil then John Barrymore was at playing Richard the III or Hamlet. There was emotion in every scene stealing the thunder from his lesser mortal supporting cast. When he ate an elephant i felt like no one past present or future would ever eat an elephant with as much feeling. He was more then an actor he was a force of nature and he put his heart and soul into every second of this cursed project. Yes damn it my favorite actor in this film was a cgi snake. I've got the balls to admit that do you?Here's to hoping Bauraki get's more work and isn't type cast that Jason Behr finds a range of emotion other then dreamy stare and that i never have to watch Blue Monkey again. So DWar its over. I want my CDs back and let's just be friends".

We are thinking one way and suddenly we are taken back to another time and another situation involving Daniel. We saw him in the lonely road where Isa happens to be taking on his way home to Turkey. Right after he has been left behind we meet him again in different circumstances as he is teaching math to a group of inattentive students who are preparing for their summer vacations.Daniel after meeting Juli buys a Mayan sun ring that she promises will let him meet a woman who will have a ring to match his that same night and that woman will be his true love. When sees the lovely and exotic Melek who is wearing a tee shirt with what appears to be another Mayan sun he believes the prophesy has come true. Melek who is traveling to Turkey tells him about how she is going to wait under a bridge for the man who is destined for her. Daniel is so taken with this beautiful creature that he decides to follow her all the way to Istanbul. The only problem is that in taking to the road Daniel discovers himself and gets to meet his true love at the end.The film is made more enjoyable by Mortiz Bleibtreu's work in it. This young actor has a face that registers all the emotions running through him at the time. He makes the movie work because of his intelligent approach to the role. Equally charismatic is Christiana Paul who plays Juli. Lovely Idil Uner is seen as Melek and Mehmet Kurtulus is Isa and Branke Katic plays Luna.The film is a road movie that shows some beautiful European countryside and byways as the trip progresses from Germany to its end in Istanbul.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the very surprising In July Im Juli at our International Film Festival last fall and was stunned by how good and how funny it was. German romantic comedy sounded like an oxymoron but others who had seen it urged me to give it a try. Wow!This film was a marvel as a piece of entertainment. It's tight fast funny surprising and charming. Part romantic comedy and part road picture the story is full of twists and delights as it takes you on a ride across Europe switching languages as we go  German English Bulgarian Turkish. The look of the film is great with dynamic camera work and beautifully framed scenes. The editing and pace are wonderful and the music choices are ideal. Acting by both stars couldn't be better for the story as they are charming touching and funny. The story itself will keep you guessing and then wrapup with an end that's both satisfying and refreshing. Who would have thought a German film could have such lightness and playfulness? This is strictly an entertainment film it's not deep or significant  the usual German film forte. But the film is a whole lot of fun. The audiences here at the film festival loved it and it was a nearmiss for audience favorite right behind another more serious German film but this is quite an achievement for a film that's just light entertainment.Hopefully this film will find greater distribution and encourage it's filmmakers to make more movies. Right now I know of no plans for wider distribution of this terrific gem. I hope that changes soon. Distributors?".

German romantic comedy sounded like an oxymoron but others who had seen it urged me to give it a try. Wow!This film was a marvel as a piece of entertainment. It's tight fast funny surprising and charming. Part romantic comedy and part road picture the story is full of twists and delights as it takes you on a ride across Europe switching languages as we go  German English Bulgarian Turkish.

Even though he is originally Turkish his films never been in Turkish movie theatres before. How weird is that? My two friends and I went to see this film after a tiring workday. We were all full of stress hoping to chill out. After the film we were the happiest people on planet. I haven't seen a film that makes me feel this good for a long time. I felt both proud and jealous for Fatih Akin. He has great directing skills. The electricity between the actors and the director is awesome. You can easily see that everyone who involved this film is happy to be there. And the audience was also so happy to be there and meet this bright young director. I saw couple of German films that directed by young directors some of them second generation Turkish ones lately. I must say most of them were really inspiring and brave films. They have the humanity and originality that makes wait for the next example. In the film we see a variety of eccentric Luna free spirited Juli boring Daniel dull the guardians at the Romanian and Turkish borders people. But in the end they are all good in their hearts. We see no one truly bad or plain. I watched the director on a talk show the other day. He was also so positive and that tells us how he managed to direct such a feel good movie. It is a great idea to end the film in Istanbul a magical city for a magical ending. Those who haven't seen the In July yet. You don't know what you're missing. You cannot find this taste in any mainstream movie. Go and see this really good film. Thank you Fatih Akin for making this movie. I can't wait to see his next work.".

Right from the beginning the film feels trustworthy  and it gets better all the time. The film is funny romantic yet always on the brink of being melodramatic with a glimpse of tragedy here and there. It's an irresistible combination that Germans almost never achieve. And maybe they wouldn't have done it even with this script  director Fatih Akin is from Turkey! Bleibtreu who had a wonderful bitpart as a dumb tarantinesque killer in Knockin' on Heaven's door is very appealing here but it is the tall and beautiful Christiane Paul from Das Leben ist eine BaustelleLife is under construction who delivers the emotional knockout punches.

	schema:reviewBody "What I found special about the Im Juli is that although the story feels like a fantasy the characters are very warm and real. All those meetings and coincidences looked a little unbelievable first time but now I think everything makes sense if we see the story as an allegorymeaningful but at the same time light and funny.The playfulness of the script might perhaps make some miss the message of the movie but the message actually is there and is a strong one. As I see it Im Juli is a story about hope and about finding life and happiness. Searching for the one meant for you in furthest places to realise that what you've been searching for was right next to you all along.I liked the idea of the first part of the movie being a flashback until we get back to the sun eclipse we had seen at the beginning. After the sun comes out again it looks like dark gets out of Daniel's mind and the sun shows him the right way this time that Juli was the one he had been searching all along. The whole journey changes Daniel incredibly much as with her sun amulet Juli learns him to do the same as her trust faith and go on searching for happiness. The ending was really perfect all the 4 characters' roads coming together and Daniel finally seeing the ultimate proof that he had found what he was looking for.What I enjoyed about the movie is that although the message is a serious one the story is so light and everything goes on really fast and surprising. The whole journey through so many different countries and passing beside so many different people and cultures was really interesting and refreshing as were all the characters in the movie. All the actors playing the Turkish guy Luna or the officer at the Romanian border looked they were really enjoying their roles and brought most of the movie's humour great subtle and nothing Hollywood like.All in all I thought it was a really enjoyable movie so different from the usual productions we get from Hollywood. Really a movie you shouldn't miss!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is aided tremendously by the performances of its very charismatic stars Moritz Bleibtreu and Christiane Paul. For a movie that relies on two people to carry it it is imperative they appeal to the audience and fortunately both succeed. This German movie is everything a road trip movie should be fun surprising unabashedly romantic filled with welldeveloped characters and plot twists interesting enough to hold one's attention throughout. It is testament to the solid writing that we genuinely care about both of the main characters and like them so much that we simultaneously want them to attain their own desires as well as those we have chosen for them. I didn't really find any false steps in this movie and every time it seemed to venture into an undesirable area it ended up advancing the plot in a positive way. No it isn't terribly realistic some of it seems contrived and in ways it is somewhat predictable. These faults are forgivable however because it is so well done. Another thing that sets this movie apart from the pack is that it is one German movie that does not actually attempt to deal with the country's Nazis past for once. For me it has the added attractions that some of it was set in Hamburg where I lived for a time as well as being in German which was my major in college. However that is a personal preference and not everyone will find that terribly appealing. If road trips or romantic comedies are your bag I recommend this one highly.".

	schema:headline " Wonderful German take on the romantic comedy";
	schema:reviewBody "It is very nice to see how a director from a country besides the U.S. creates a romantic comedy. This type of film isn't what one would expect from Germany and perhaps that contributes to its charm. Certainly Christiane Paul who portrays the title's namesake is luminous. Every frame she is in she lights up the screen. It has been said that they success of a romantic comedy depends on the audience falling in love with the main characters as they are falling in love on screen. If this is true then both Christiane and Moritz Bleibtreu who plays Daniel Bannier do a marvelous job of seducing the audience both are very likable and by the second reel you are cheering for them to be together.The plot has the basic framework of a road movieromantic comedy. Daniel is closed off and stuffy and Juli is the free spirit who is his guide to individual freedom and expression. Daniel meets her at a street fair and she immediately recognizes him as the one who is his destiny. She sells him a ring with the symbol of the sun that is supposed to unite him with his one true love who will also be wearing a solar symbol. Daniel doesn't know it at the time but Juli has a tattoo of the sun on the small of her back. That night he meets a pretty young woman named Melek who is carrying a backpack bearing a picture of the sun. He takes this as a sign and pursues her. At drinks together she informs him that she is meeting someone under a wellknown bridge in Istanbul. He is disappointed that she is meeting someone who she might be in love with but after they part ways he decides to go to Istanbul and meet her under the bridge on the night of her meeting with this other man.Meanwhile Juli having seen Daniel and Melek together becomes depressed and decides to leave the city. As she stands at the crossroads of the highway she says her goodbyes to her friend and states that she will go wherever the next ride takes her no matter where they are going. Sure enough Daniel stops for her and they begin their journey together. Along the way Juli falls even further in love with Daniel even though he is on a quest to meet another woman. As they make their way the usual kinds of twists and turns that one expects in a comedic road movie crop up the car breaks down they lose all their money and are forced to depend on the kindness of a quirky bunch of characters to complete their journey. All the while Daniel is learning to let go of the very tight grip he has on his life. As he loosens his hold his heart also opens to Juli and when she leaves him to complete his odyssey alone an act of unselfish love and an indicator that Juli is learning lessons herself he finally realizes that the girl he truly wanted was with him all the while.Near the end of his trek he runs into the very girl he is going to Istanbul to meet and finds her very happy to see him. Here he must make a choice to stay with Melek who obviously wants him to stay or complete his adventure to the bridge where Juli may or may not be waiting for him. I'll leave you to find out the rest but rest assured there will be no unhappy ending here.As Hollywood tries to come up with increasingly improbable scenarios to breathe new life into the romantic comedy German director Faith Akin follows a familiar path and allows the heart of these characters to draw us into the story. The exotic places they travel through becomes a separate character as well and Akin allows the beauty and mystery of these locals to seduce as much as the main characters do.The charm of this movie is in the reminder that humans the world over feel the same excitement and happiness when falling in love. Akin wisely relies on the desire each of us has to feel that love and the delight of seeing others experience that joy as well. It will never grow boring watching two likable characters fall in love especially when they are willing to fight trek thousands of miles and endure any hardship to be with the one they love. With In July Akin spins a wonderful tale of love growth and discovery. You won't go wrong spending a couple of hours with this film falling in love yourself.".

The movie is not a 3 stooges film  for which I am extremely thankful. It is good to see a funny film from Germany that does't get into some knock on WWII.

	schema:reviewBody "I'm somewhat surprised that so many people gave this movie such a great review. One person hated it.There needs to be a happy medium here. On the whole the film was pretty lame. Yes it has a nice romantic ending. Fine. Lots of film have charming endings. I don't begrudge this. It also starts off well. It seemed to have potential for a nice romantic movie though even then it wouldn't be as funny as some seem to think it is I think for me the film went off the rails after he is thrown off the boat. I really don't understand what happened here first off. They are sleeping need the water and he wakes up tells her he will go for food. Some fisherman think he is trespassing or something and throws him into the water. But and my companion said this too isn't he still right near where he started? Why go on a long ride far away  in a country where he doesn't know the language  and leave Juli behind? The film then just got more and more dumb. An extended sequence where some somewhat crazy person robs him. He tries to get his money back but then is chased though right after he accosts her it is clear to someone else she is a thief. He hangs on top of her van in a high speed chase she's stopped by a bunch of police but then he is able to drive away with the van somehow. He meets up with Juli again largely by chance and is able to cross a border by claiming to be married to her and giving the guard the stolen van. They then steal a car. These are both supposed to be nice people mind you but they just steal a car. Oh later he is able to easily escape from prison. And so on.I'm willing to suspend some belief but this got to be too much. The film again the person who watched it with me agreed also simply isn't that funny. The fact various absurd things happen doesn't change this. We don't even get much time of the together. The scene where a trucker fakes getting fresh with him so that Daniel will fight with him is sweet though it seems to come a bit too early in the story. But I don't think there was enough romance in the film either.There are many road movies where two people fall in love including American films like The Sure Thing which is how it should be done. This is somewhat enjoyable as a lark but overall it is not really well done at all. The leads are decent though I like the woman better but really there aren't great either. Maybe this is a culture thing though again I saw various European films and liked them.This simply isn't that good. It's okay but apparently has a strong following among some people. One more thing  some don't like the drug use. This is silly. The drug use amounts to one fairly cute again nothing overly special scene where they share a marijuana cigarette something he apparently never did before. The other scene involves his drink being spiked so that he could be robbed. That's it.".

And so on.I'm willing to suspend some belief but this got to be too much. The film again the person who watched it with me agreed also simply isn't that funny. The fact various absurd things happen doesn't change this. We don't even get much time of the together. The scene where a trucker fakes getting fresh with him so that Daniel will fight with him is sweet though it seems to come a bit too early in the story. But I don't think there was enough romance in the film either.There are many road movies where two people fall in love including American films like The Sure Thing which is how it should be done. This is somewhat enjoyable as a lark but overall it is not really well done at all. The leads are decent though I like the woman better but really there aren't great either. Maybe this is a culture thing though again I saw various European films and liked them.This simply isn't that good. It's okay but apparently has a strong following among some people. One more thing  some don't like the drug use. This is silly. The drug use amounts to one fairly cute again nothing overly special scene where they share a marijuana cigarette something he apparently never did before. The other scene involves his drink being spiked so that he could be robbed. That's it.";

	schema:reviewBody "As someone who has a fondness for both Turkish and German cinema I am glad this film made it to American shores and that Faith Akan's followup film Head On has just opened in NY if only NY was not 11 hours away by car!. I have noticed that many outstanding German and Turkish films have not been distributed here but hopefully the dual critical successes of Goodbye Lenin! and Distant can change that. I must admit that I liked In July more the first time but it still holds up on a second viewing. I think there are two scenes in the film which are questionable. The Romanian border scene seems a bit forced and the boat scene where the two leads share a joint seems out of place in a film that is not surreal in any other sequence. But the characters are quite wellrounded and there are unexpected plot twists which keep the pace moving. Interestingly enough both Turkish and German cinemas have produced outstanding 'road movies' over the years so it should be no surprise that a TurkishGerman director achieves success in this genre. Two such films are Wim Wenders' Kings of the Road and the Yilmaz GuneySerif Goren film Yol which means The Road in English. For those interested in German films with Turkish themes there is also Kutlug Ataman's Lola and Billy the Kid which is a bit shocking because all the main characters are Turkish and the film has gay themes but it is a film which works even when one takes away the novelty and its shock value. But this is the better film of the two. I also like the exterior shots of the historic Turkish city of Edirne in the film and of course it is hard not too make good use of the Bosphorous landscape which Istanbul has been blessed with.".

It's not that I can't think of anything original but that others seem to have felt the exact same emotions as I did when watching this film.I saw this movie when I was about 12 13 maybe 14 years old. So it didn't have the same nostalgic sense it had for so many. But what it did was make me ache for those memories. I wanted in the words of another reviewer to be 12 and that cool. I wished I had been like that that I had had friends like that laughed like that and had adventures like that.The 'milkmoney' scene was probably one of my alltime favourite scenes in movie history. Up until I saw this movie I had never held much regard for River Phoenix but the poignancy and sincerity which River added to the role of Chris Chambers touched me to the point of tears. I read in yet another review that in this scene River was asked to think of a time when he had been hurt by an adult and that even after the cameras stopped rolling River sat there still sobbing and hurting. And I felt every tear and heard every word as though I were there with Chris.This movie made me laugh cry rejoice and fear with Chris Gordie Teddy and Vern. I loved the campfire scenes and today I look back on my own childhood and remember with a laugh the amazingly similar things I used to laugh and wonder about with my friends. I remember dreaming about being a writer and an actress I remember standing up to bullies I remember walking or riding with my friends I remember being afraid and crying onto a friend's shoulder.I guess what this movie does for everyone is take them back in time even though the situations may have been different chances are you'll find the similarities and remember with a smile that yes your life was once that cool. In the words of Vern a great timeI especially loved the ending. That they found out who was strong and who just talked tough. I loved the last scene with Chris and Gordie and the closing monologue.I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve...Jesus....does anyone?".

	schema:reviewBody "Without a doubt this movie is probably the best coming of age flick around it has terrific acting and an incredibly touching plot that keeps you going throughout the whole film. I think the reason I love this film so much is because everyone in some way could relate to it. When you're a preteen and have a close group of friends and face something so intense together there's that special bond that no matter how much you loose touch with each other one day you just think of them and that one incident.Stand by Me is about 4 preteen boys whose summer is about to end and they are about to start junior high. They've obviously grown up together and are nervous of the world they are about to face where they are no longer kids but just about to become adults. When their friend Vern tells them about a kid their age that is missing that he found out by listening in on his brother where the kid's body is the boys think it would be so cool to find the body and become the local town heroes. They have one problem though there are these big tough guys who want to find the body first it's a matter of who will reach it first. But of course it's the bonding of the boys that really gets you into the film.These are some of the best characters I have seen on film we start with Gordy. Gordy is an intelligent writer who lost his big brother his idol in a car crash recently and can't get any love or respect from his father and it's obvious that he gets it from his friends. That's what keeps him going. Chris is the leader of the gang and Gordy's best friend he comes from a very bad family and is dubbed the bad seed everywhere he's the kid who you knew in school and just knew he'd turn out bad but there's a deeper side to him. The speech that River Phoenix turned out for Chris was so beautifully dilvered as a child who's been disappointed so many times by an adult.Teddy is another bad kid sort of speak he has a bad home life where his father is crazy and nearly killed him a few times. He has a quick temper but you can tell that his friends keep him down to Earth and help him through the worst times. Then there's Vern the funny fat kid who is pretty much scarred of everything and in some ways is the 4th wheel. Still Vern you can tell is a great friend and the other's appreciate him despite how he can hold them back.The acting is just phenomenal. Now the directing Rob Reiner is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time he took these young boys and pushed them to their limits he was so smart about it as well. He said in an interview that he had to get preteen boys who were close to the personality of the character in the film so it would come natural to the preteen actors and you could tell that this film was his baby he put so much thought and love into this film. That's what makes this film so special nothing could ever compete with a coming of age film like Stand By Me.1010".

Now the directing Rob Reiner is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time he took these young boys and pushed them to their limits he was so smart about it as well. He said in an interview that he had to get preteen boys who were close to the personality of the character in the film so it would come natural to the preteen actors and you could tell that this film was his baby he put so much thought and love into this film. That's what makes this film so special nothing could ever compete with a coming of age film like Stand By Me.1010";

	schema:headline " One of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story ever.";
	schema:reviewBody "Stand By Me is yet another one of the stories made into a movie from the author who has had more stories made into movies than any other author in history Stephen King. Clearly the central character here is Gordie Lachance from whose point of view the story is told and who obviously symbolizes King himself given many of his characteristics as well as some of the content of the film. This movie is literally filled with actors who have achieved varying degrees of success over the years such as Jerry O'Connell who played Vern River Phoenix who could have been bigger than Leonardo DiCaprio if he hadn't died Corey Feldman who has grown into an unenviable but visible existence Kiefer Sutherland who has become an excellent and very well known actor John Cusack can be seen in a small role as Gordie's late brother and of course Richard Dreyfuss who played the narrator and Gordie as an adult has remained famous but originally achieved fame more than a decade before Stand By Me was filmed or the original story was even written.Stand By Me takes place in the summer of 1959 the general time period that Stephen King is most skilled at presenting and four friends set out to find the body of a kid who was killed by a train hoping to find what they predicted would be astronomical fame. Unfortunately the town's bullies are also out to find the body for the same reason which leads to the films ultimate final climax. Even though this is a very clever story with which to tell a fall from innocence story it is the brilliant characterization and the incredible acting that really make this a classic film. It is extremely rare that a film comes along that stars young kids and is so moving and powerful. Also every one of those kids is made three dimensional in creative and smooth ways making you feel like you really knew them by the end of the film. Vern is the fat kid who always gets picked on Teddy and Chris both have abusive or deranged fathers not to mention Chris's cruel brother and Gordie is a young boy who lost his brother three months earlier in a violent accident and who has been largely ignored by his parents ever since. In one memorable scene Gordie wonders how Teddy can be so enthusiastic about his father's alleged military achievements when the man once held his head to a stove nearly burning his ear off. Gordie is mystified because he could care less about his own father who hadn't laid a hand on him since he was three years old and got caught eating bleach under the sink.'Stephen King pokes fun at his own craft many times in the film such as in Gordie's vehement line Fck writing. I don't want to be a writer it's a stupid waste of time!' Not only that but there are also obvious references to his other works such as when the boys first realize that no one brought food and Teddy says This is great what are we supposed to do eat our feet?' People who actually read instead of just lazily watching the movies will recognize this as a major part of the plot of another of King's short stories Survivor Type' from which Cast Away borrowed heavily. And why don't you people read these books? The Body' which Stand By Me was based on is only 148 pages long you could read that in a couple of hours and the experience is totally different from a movie. It's even more disturbing that The Body' was published in the same book Different Seasons as a couple of King's other famous stories  Apt Pupil' and of course Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.'Stand By Me is a story of how one event can unexpectedly change lives. It seems to be a story about friends and how important they are but this possible theme is clearly dispelled in a line from the narration spoken at the end of the film  As time went on we saw less and less of Teddy and Vern until eventually they became just two more faces in the halls. It happens sometimes friends come in and out of your life like busboys at a restaurant.' Instead the film is about learning from a life changing experience and actually making changes or modifying your life in some way because of it and this is heavily emphasized at the end of the film.Stand By Me is a timeless film. Stephen King's story is skillfully brought to the screen under the direction of Rob Reiner and the 1950s are brought back to life just as successfully as King so often does in his stories and novels with the slicked back hair the hot rods and in the film and excellent 50s soundtrack. There is so much more to this film than just the superficial story  things about the characters and the story but also about the tremendously talented man who wrote it all.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am 14 years old and I absolutely love this movie. But don't let my age fool you. I'm not just going to sit here and talk about how hott River Pheonix was.This movie is well rounded in my perspective. Everyone can relate to at least one of the boys in it at one time in their life. The actors are matched perfectly with who their character portrays.Corey Feldman's character Teddy is the boy who's sensitive about his dad but tries to hide it Jerry O' Connell's character Vern is the chubby wussy kid but still part of the club Wil Wheaton's character Gordie is the sweet intelligent friend who tells stories to the other boys and is ignored by his parents and River Phoenix's character Chris is the boy in the neighborhood that's been labeled a bad kid and feels he'll never get out of their town the peacemaker and Gordie's best friend. This movie just sucks you in as soon as you start watching it. It's not overly mushy and sad but it's not so tough that only a sixteen year old boy could stand it. You feel for each character no matter how mean or nice they are. My personal favorite is Chris Chambers which i know this will probably drive you guys nuts that almost every other person does too but River Phoenix is just so touching. The campfire scene is great the milk money seen is great and one of my favorites is the train scene. You can definitely see the terror in their faces. It's funny that they all act so tough except maybe Vern although he tries and they still like talking about goofy and dancing and singing along to Lollipop. You also just want to be there with them. Feel that kind of friendship that so many people long for. It's such a feel good movie but not in the sense of a 10 year old's feel good movie. It makes you feel complete when you watch it. It's not jam packed with action sequences or it doesn't have fluffy pink bunnies hopping around in it either. It's just one of a kind. Definitely worth my time and yours.The newest DVD of Stand By Me Special Edition has Walking the Tracks The Summer of Stand By Me where all the main actorsexcept River and Rob Reiner are interviewed. They also talk about working with River Phoenix. There's also the Stand By Me music video with River Phoenix Wil Wheaton and obviously Ben E. King. Not to mention an extra CD with some awesome oldie's songs like Everyday Lollipop Stand By Me and Mr. Lee.".

The film is full of great insights into the minds of a group of four boys who decide they want to see what a dead body looks like and it sparks their interest even more that they actually knew this dead person. A young boy's mind is full of many things they feel lost sometimes strong at others but mostly they feel invinceable.

Mike Gary Andy and myself were inseparable. And as this film prophesizes correctly the group has since split up and now I am only good friends with one of them. This movie makes you remember what it was like to have friends when you were 12 and it makes you glad that they were there when they were.The story involves these four kids going on a weekend hike to find a dead kid that apparently got hit by a train. Now if that is all the movie was about it would probably be pretty boring. But this film explores the fears and anxieties of what it was like to be 12 again. Twelve year olds deal with a plethora of issues and it is not often that adults listen to what kids have to say or see what they deal with. But this film is honest about it's assessment of how they feel.The four boys are played brilliantly by Wil Wheaton Jerry O'ConnellCoosh from Jerry Maguire  Corey Feldman and River Phoenix. The story moves along and hits a nerve because of the life that these four actors brings to their characters. There is a real sense of comrarderie between the four of them. But ultimately it is Phoenix that brings the most life to his character and I would say that the milk money scene with him and Gordie Wheaton is one of the more touching and poignant scenes ever filmed.What Stand By Me does is brings you back to a time when friendship was more pure and innocent and meant more. You can't help but get caught up in the nostalgia. Perhaps this film means more to me for personal reasons  as I've already stated  but it is a wonderful film and it should be enjoyed by everyone.The last line of the movie is so true. Do we really ever have friends as good as the ones when we were twelve? I doubt it.".

It is an almost forgotten film about a time and a youth nearly forgotten as well. And I will say as a writer the novella that this film was based upon The Body has and always will be the inspiration for my style of writing.First of all I enjoy the title that was chosen for the film. Stand By Me fits what the characters in the story are facing.  I think that all who have seen this film will agree that the problems are all things that we can relate to.  All of us know someone like these characters. Most of us have met the boy down the road who had a brother with a bad name and a father with an alcohol problem automatically being labeled as a bad kid. And the boy with the military father abusive and a little whacko. The fat kid picked on and ridiculed for his weight.To me Gordy represents all of us. I found myself seeing a little of me in Gordy as I watched the film. I don't know if any one else shares this but it was true. Gordy was not very strong at first and was not sure what he wanted except to be with his friends. Still coping with the loss of his brother and the fact that his father was disrespectful to him Gordy still stood up for what he believed in. And in the end he surprised the characters and the viewers by standing up to the bullies that had plagued them all.This film is certainly one of my top favorites. In fact it lies in my top three probably at 2 or 3. I feel that it is a film that everyone should see at some point in their life due to the fact it changes your look at youth and their trials. Few films are able to do that and I think that this one was an inspiration for others that will do the same in the future.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hands down this is my favorite movie. With the Sandlot in second place. My mom got this movie for me when i was about 12. I saw it the first time and realized that i had friends like that. The movie is definitely one every teenage kid should see. I think it is more of a movie for boys but girls can get out of it the same as the boys can. But the movie overall is great because its just about a four friends who have no experience with the real world. They find out about a dead body and go in search to find it. At first they just do it to be famous and get a reward. But the quest of the boys throughout the movie reveal things that even themselves didn't know about. After it all the boys find out about reality and how it isn't glamorous. They realize that the body could of been them and they respect that. In my opinion the point of the movie was not to have you think of when you were 12 and your good friends but to think of what you have now and what you do with it. In the end Gordie tells us what happens to each and how each kind of go their separate ways. Such as the last scene of the movie. This is definitely a movie to not only rent but buy. I tip my hat to Reiner.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stand By Me is probably the best film ever to come from a Stephen King story. The Green Mile sucks by the way. The story is told from an adult writer's point of view as he recounts an adventure he shared with his three best friends in the waning moments of the summer before junior high school began. We see the four boys head out into the wilderness to see the dead body of a boy who was apparently hit by a train. The boys encounter bullies other trains leeches vicious dogs and many other things on their trip. And they have some pretty deep and emotional conversations along the way.This is a very awkward age in the life of a young man. You can tell by listening to their conversation topics which range from boobs to whether or not Mighty Mouse can beat up Superman. The youngsters are portrayed flawlessly by four terrific young actors. Who would have thunk that Jerry O'Connell would turn out to be the most successful of them? At times they laugh other times they pick on each other. Sometimes they seem on the verge of fighting but when challenged by the older gang of bullies they stick together. Richard Dreyfuss who plays the adult writer narrates the action as things move along. Their trip is full of surprises and emotional insight.Stand By Me is not quite a classic in my book but it is very memorable. The script is a little too pessimistic for my liking. Right down to when River Phoenix describes an incident where he's caught stealing milk money from school and his teacher ends up keeping it for herself. There is also a complete lack of positive supporting characters during the scenes set back when they were kids. Only John Cusack in a cameo role is shown as a positive older character. No wonder these kids felt so unwanted! All the adults around them were jerks! The script uses more swear words than are actually necessary to convey the anger these kids sometimes feel. And you'd think any dead body that had been hit by a train would be more damaged than the one they find out in the woods. Wouldn't this kid have heard the train coming in time and jumped well out of the way? If he was trying to kill himself then you'd think he would have stood in the way and been completely pulverized. I know these may seem like petty beefs but they are enough to knock the review down a star or two.It seems like the film is trying to portray the dead Brower boy as the death of these kids' innocence or something to that effect. As someone who's been their age I can understand some of what they were feeling. And I totally agree that some of the people you thought were your best friends eventually just turn out to be faces in the crowd at school a few years later.Despite it's faults this is a powerful film you aren't likely to forget. It's one of Reiner's best and the outstanding cast does some wonderful work themselves.8 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

	schema:headline " When it comes to coming of age films it is the best";
	schema:reviewBody "It happens sometimes. Friends come in and out of our lives like busboys in a restaurant.Stand By Me is Rob Reiner's love letter to friendship and nostalgic memories. It's ironic that Reiner's film looks at the past with such high regards because we can do the same with his filmography. His best films were all made in the 80's and we can squeeze Misery and A Few Good Men into that list as well although they came out in 1990 and 1992 respectively and despite not having directed many great films over the past few decades we can still look back at his early films and appreciate his classics. Stand By Me reminds us all of our early childhood and the friendships we made. It doesn't matter what decade we grew up in we all cherish special memories of adventures we shared with our friends and how they helped shape us. That is what is so universal and appealing about Reiner's film even though we may never have grown up in a small town or had similar outdoor adventures it still recalls us back to a time where we were discovering new things about the world and standing up for our friends when they were in trouble or running with them when we got caught playing in our neighbor's yards. Stand By Me focuses on these memories and it's not just about the adventure in itself but the bond these friends shared together. It's probably the go to movie when we are comparing or referencing other coming of age films and in my opinion one of the best ever made considering how much I appreciate the genre. I'm sure the film itself was a life changing experience for many who grew up watching it and dreaming of having similar adventures with their friends.Based on Stephen King's short story The Body the screenplay for the film was adapted by Raynold Gideon and Bruce Evans. It takes place in 1959 and centers on four 12 year old friends from Castelrock Oregon who overhear a conversation about the location of the body of a dead boy who had been missing for several days. The news about the disappearance of this boy had spread all over town so these kids decide to embark on an adventure through the woods and bring back the missing body so they can be received as heroes. Since the journey would take more than a full day they plan to tell their parents that they are staying at each other's home. Gordie Will Wheaton had recently lost his older brother played by John Cusack in the flashback scenes a few months prior to this in a car accident so he knew his mourning parents wouldn't even mind him being gone for a few days. His best friend Chris River Phoenix came from a troublesome family and despite knowing he'd get into trouble if they'd discover his lie he didn't think it would be any different if he stayed with his drunk father. Teddy Corey Feldman still has the scars from the abuse he suffered from his mentally unstable father and currently lives with his mother. Vern Jerry O'Connell the clown of the group who isn't taken very seriously is the one who came up with the idea of looking for the body but he also is the first to back down when it comes to it. The four finally decide to go ahead with their plan and begin their adventure which will eventually shape who they are. The story is narrated by the grown up version of Gordie played by Richard Dreyfuss somewhere around 1985.The strong performances in this film are one of the reasons why it continues to work today. River Phoenix was such a natural and is so charismatic that he steals every scene he's in. The chemistry he shares with Wheaton's character is strong and it reminds us all of that best friend we had in our childhood. Corey Feldman must have had the best agent because he starred in some of the best films that were released in the 80's Gremlins The Goonies The Burbs and The Lost Boys. Jerry O'Connell is probably the one that has undergone the greatest physical transformation but he was perfect for the role of Vern and he reminded us of that friend who always seemed to be the butt of every joke. These four young actors carry the film and despite not having the most exciting of adventures the way the story is told is what makes it such a fascinating one. There are small moments like the one where they gather around the camp fire to listen to Gordie's story or when they are crossing the pond and discover its full of leeches that stand out. The film is told through Gordie's recollection of these events and each scene feels like an authentic memory someone would have of such a life changing experience. The 50's soundtrack also plays a key role in the film since it adds to the overall sense of nostalgia. Reiner's film reminds me how much I actually have enjoyed Stephen King's nonhorror stories this along with Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile are my favorite film adaptations of his work. Since its 1986 release all the coming of age films that have followed it seem to heavily borrow from it. Stand By Me is the measuring stick for films in this genre.httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

They called it catharsis best translated by 'cleaning the souls'. Well measured by the tremendous effect on all of us writing reviews on the film STAND BY ME has the power and qualities of ancient tragedy. This jewel of a film touches and shakes the best sides in us. I have watched it over and over again and even if I watch it several times a week I still sit and laugh and cry and it leaves me sad and confused and grateful feelings that can last for hours and sometimes days.So what is the mystery behind this masterpiece?First of all it teaches us that good filmmaking isn't about the dollars spent on the production but about the people who make it.And it's about a unique and humble I hope you understand what I mean director Rob Reiner doesn't try to show how good he is leering at the Oscarjurythe story is told without any visual effects the pace is slow and the cinematography is unspectacular but he succeeds in inspiring his young actors to perform honest feelings and letting the story develop by its own terms. An example is the milkmoneyscene. It is told that Reiner wasn't satisfied with the performance of River Phoenix. They tried again and again. Finally he told River to remember a situation of his own life where a grownup had let him down. Guess if he succeeded with it! River Phoenix started crying and he couldn't stop crying a long time after the shot was taken. That's why this film is pure gold it doesn't show professional acting it shows young boys who open their hearts in front of a camera. They can do it because they can relate to similar experiences and because the message is important and universal. We all can relate to similar situations. These scenes make me remember events from my own youth that I had inhibited for a long time because I didn't like to remember them. That's the pain!But it's not only the director and the actors who should earn all the credits. I read the novel after watching the film and since that time Stephen King is one of the great contemporary writers in my book. I just don't understand why he doesn't write more of THE BODY kind. To me this book is pure poetry including all those fourletterwords that Maltin e. a. don't like because they don't understand why they are necessary! But the most amazing thing is the script doesn't only catch the quintessence of the novel it's partly even better! This perfect balance between humor and seriousness! It doesn't manipulate the audience. In the book grownup Gordon sits in his car when he had read about his friend's death. I drove out of town parked and cried for him. Cried for damn near half an hour I guess. In the film Gordon doesn't cry. He doesn't need to. Everyone in the audience feels like crying because they understand the tragedy! There are only 13 pages of dialogue and narration and there really is not one line too much. It's so good I almost know the whole of it by heart. Take the ending In the book the famous writer Gordon Lachance tells about how he met Ace Merrill again some twenty years after the Ray Brower event grown fat and the only one alive of his old friends and enemies. How much better is the film's ending! This important line about the friends we had when we were twelve years old is only a line in King's book commending the good time the boys have at Milo Pressman's junkyard! If there had been an Oscar for impressive film endings this film had deserved the first!And thank you Jack Nitzsche for the intense score. It's Gordie's theme when he's not with his friends. In the group Gordie is the smart boy with the sharp quick fresh replies. Without the friends at home or in the store he barely speaks a word. And then we can hear that fragile Jack Nitzsche variation on Stand by me. It's like Gordie crying where are you Chris? Come stand by me'. That's brilliant and exactly what great filmmusic should be serving the film's dramaturgy.Well I don't know how many hours it took me to express my love to this film in a language that isn't my own. It seems impossible. It is exactly as Stephen King expressed it himself end of chapter 29 Even if I'd known the right thing to say I probably couldn't have said it. Speech destroys the functions of love I think  that's a hell of a thing for a writer to say I guess but I believe it to be true. If you speak to tell a deer you mean it no harm it glides away with a single flip of its tail. The word is the harm. Love isn't what these asshole poets like McKuen want you to think it is. Love has teeth they bite the wounds never close. No word no combination of words can close those lovebites. It's the other way around that's the joke. If those wounds dry up the words die with them. Take it from me. I've made my life from the words and I know that is so.'10 out of 10 no doubt about it!".

Take it from me. I've made my life from the words and I know that is so.'10 out of 10 no doubt about it!";

	schema:reviewBody "Stand By Me is without a doubt one of the finest pieces of film ever made in the history of humanity. A truly excellent movie that really strikes and affects you with all its glory. It leaves no one untouched whether you're 12 or 112 years old. Simply because it deals with life and friendship and all that comes with it. Both the good and the bad.Everyone can relate to it and feel what the characters feel. Because we've all been there. We have all done similar things to what they are doing we have all been dealing with the same issues in life as they are faced with and we all still are.Few films are able do depict the theme of life and friendship as successfully as Stand By Me. In my opinion there are practically no flaws in this production everything from the plot and the screenplay to the characters and the actors are top notch. Also the music is great.Watching the movie one feel everything from happiness and laughter to fear and grief. Laughter because we remember how fun it was being a child. With everything being new and exciting in life. And facing it all together with our friends. Fear and grief because of how hard it can be having to grow up and let go of the past. Let go of our old friends and our old life. One can't help but to feel nostalgic. At least I do. It makes me think about life in a larger sense. Thinking about my childhood I realize how long ago it was or at least seems to be. The movie frees a lot of emotions and thoughts regarding both my own life and life in general.This movie also has one of the best opening scenes in film history. I almost burst into tears every time I see it. It's as close to perfection as it gets. It's so beautiful and sad. Simply the perfect way to launch the rest of the movie. How the beautiful soft music first almost reaches out and touch you while seeing the landscape. Then a close up on the car and the main character reading the chocking news of his dear old friend's death. Thereafter such a smooth passage back to his childhood with focus on the kids passing by on their bikes and the music still in the background. Excellent!To conclude I have also one little flaw or at least I think of it that way. It's regarding the whole Lardassscence. When I was little I could never figure out why it was in the film. I couldn't see the connection to the rest of the film. Being older and hopefully a little wiser D I now see that it's a way of showing Gordies talent for making up stories the talent that have him becoming a writer one day. However I feel this could have been illustrated in a better way. I've always felt that scene is just a little bit over the top and I still do. Otherwise Stand By Me is close to a masterpiece. No one should go through life without seeing and experiencing this wonderful film.".

I have not read as of yet and I'm sure I will The Body. I have seen Stand By Me several times and I am conflicted in many of the great portions of this film and the ideas behind the movie vs the fact that it just doesn't sit with me as entertaining.Stand By Me is considered perhaps one of the forefront coming of age films and for good reason. It's the story of four best friends set in the fiftiessixties told through the eyes of the Gordie Lachance who has lost his role model best friend older brother to an accident. Haunted by the loss of his brother and the fact that everyone seems to have only cared about his older brother including his parents he is compelled to encourage his group of friends to go on a trek across the county to find the dead body of a missing boy. Unfortunately the bad kids and bullies in town also discover that this body is nearby and they race to find it first. During their trek they discover more about each other and they stand together to overcome their fears about their own lives.I do whole heartedly agree in the pure heart of this film the coming of age the different personalities of each boy in the film. It does aim to find a little something of everyone in each boy and it accomplishes that. The cast especially for young actors is very good. Wil Wheaton as the lead character appears to be weaker than his best friend played by the late River Phoenix but in the end he is really who holds them altogether and overcomes the most of all of them. River Phoenix ironically plays the bad boy best friend who seems to have very little future but has taken Wheaton's character under his wing and encourages him to make something of himself. Corey Feldman fills in his usual role adequately. Jerry O'Connell as the made fun of fat kid also plays his role well. Keifer Sutherland who can't help but look like a jerk and an evil fiend also plays well. The cast is basically The Brat Pack and yet for an eighties film it's quite darker than most Brat Pack films. Wholely realistic is the kids' views on life their fascination with death cigarettes adult things and their adult language. Their trying to be as grown up as possible without any real adult role models.My issue is that the film just doesn't hit me. It never satisfies me or entertains me. I find it entirely too short very very predictable and without any real depth of plot. I know everyone sees this film as a classic and certainly it has it's strong points as I outlined but overall it just falls short for me. The soundtrack and I absolutely love these songs feels forced like Reiner is trying to force the feeling of the era on us rather than create it all around them. In this case I don't expect anyone to believe my opinion because I am sorely outnumbered but I don't care for this film much at all.510".

	schema:reviewBody "The movie Stand by Me is a story about four close twelve year old friends growing up in rural Oregon who are bitten by the curiosity bug. The main Character Gordie Wil Wheaton and his three friends Chris River Pheonix Teddy Corey Feldman and Vern Jerry O'Connell set out on an adventure to find the body of Ray Brower. They had heard of his whereabouts by Vern's older brother and they were determined to find him. They incur many setbacks during their journey. They are bullied by the older boys of the town who are also trying to find the body and get the fame attacked by the junkyard dog Chopper almost getting run down by a train and attacked by the swamp leaches. The boys learn many lessons on their journey but more importantly they learn about life. The actual goal of Rob Reiner director of the film was to show that growing up has its ups as well as downs. All four of the main characters have had some trouble in their life. He showed this when Gordie's athletic brother was tragically killed in a car accident. By doing this Reiner elaborates to the audience that bad things do happen to the best people. Chris and Teddy also have very neglecting fathers at their homes. Even though it is all fun and games on the hunt for the body they still have a troubled life lingering in the background that they can not get away from. And good old Vern has an older brother who wreaks havoc in his life. He is actually one of the older bullies also on the hunt for the body. Reiner cannot make his point much clearer. One of the things I really loved about this movie is how few rules the young twelve year old boys had. The first evident thing is when the movie opens and they are smoking in their tree house. These boys smoke shoot handguns in town and cuss like sailors throughout the movie and know one seems to notice. Wow the times sure have changed since I was a young child.".

I am only thirteen and this movies was made the year I was born but I can still relate to this film so much. I have seen the movie about 12 times and every time I watch it I understand it more and more. I saw most of the movie when I was about 10 yearsold and the message didn't really sink in then. Now that I am older I can understand the message and relate to it better. The actors really pull you into the movie and script to see what it really was like back then.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie a few years ago and I instantly thought it was great. It's a memorable story adapted from an unusual literary venture for Stephen King about four 12yearold boys in 1959 who go in search of a dead body. Everything about this movie was memorable the script the acting and most of all the four boys. All of them had distinct personalities and backgrounds and didn't blend into each other like so many other movies like this. My favorite character was Chris Chambers who was not only cute but a bad boy with a heart of gold also the breakout role for River Phoenix. This is a mustsee for anyone who likes a good movie. The only problem I had with this movie was that I found it unrealistic. The 12yearold boys in the movies cussed every two words smoked cigarettes regularly and talked admiringly in detail about some girl's boobs. I found this unusual even for 1959. I was 12 once and most of the boys I knew rarely cussed never smoked anything and were just a smidge too far from puberty to talk about a girl's boobs in detail. However these small qualities are redeemed. This is a great movie from the great Stephen King.".

It's a memorable story adapted from an unusual literary venture for Stephen King about four 12yearold boys in 1959 who go in search of a dead body. Everything about this movie was memorable the script the acting and most of all the four boys. All of them had distinct personalities and backgrounds and didn't blend into each other like so many other movies like this. My favorite character was Chris Chambers who was not only cute but a bad boy with a heart of gold also the breakout role for River Phoenix. This is a mustsee for anyone who likes a good movie. The only problem I had with this movie was that I found it unrealistic. The 12yearold boys in the movies cussed every two words smoked cigarettes regularly and talked admiringly in detail about some girl's boobs. I found this unusual even for 1959. I was 12 once and most of the boys I knew rarely cussed never smoked anything and were just a smidge too far from puberty to talk about a girl's boobs in detail. However these small qualities are redeemed. This is a great movie from the great Stephen King.";

After seeing two kids ride past his car we are taken back to when he was 12 years old...Gordie Lachance is a sensitive boy with three other friends scared cat Vern flamboyant Teddy and leader of the pack Chris. Together they are four close friends in a simple group of friendship. One say Vern enters their tree house panting and tells the pack about a kid's dead body he heard had been found by his brother of whom hadn't told the police. Suddenly they all form a plan to go search for the kid's body imagining their popularity for finding it.Thus begins the two day cross across their hometown Castle Rock. Sooner or later the four discover a bond they never knew they had as their personal feelings and lives corrupt with each others.Opinions What makes this movie so separate from other movies about kids and friendships is this movie really does captures the aspects of friendship and kids everyday hard lives like a kid with a family who he feels ignores him a kid who feels society will never appreciate a kid from a bad family a kid who feels of getting his importance from his father storming the beach at Normandy.Every kid in this movie has a realistic conflict and the kids acting is so real I feel my friends act the same way at school the real and close friends that stood by me. This movie is not about finding the dead body but really those two days the kids are together and realize how much closer they are than they thought. Even though this movie was made in the 1980s it's a shock kids still act this way today.While many may complain of the fourletter words in the movie but I have to say kids like to cuss to feel cool in my school. They call each other names and dis or as they say in the movie rank each other.In conclusion this movie should be watched by many and don't let the R rating fool you for the best movie about kid friendship I've ever seen in my life. They probably will never be a greater movie ever made. This is the closest you can be to superior! Total 9.7 out of 10".

Jaanam Samjha Karo was the first and last time Urmila Matondkar and Salman Khan worked together and I must say their pairing was good. It's definitely a shame filmmakers never had Urmila with Salman ever again in any film. Anyways Janaam Samjha Karo is a typical romantic comedy with some action but it's well handled for the most part.The story is the same old formula where the guy is a Casanova but the girl changes the guy. This story has been used many times in the past but not every movie using this formula has succeeded. The film contains everything from funny one liners typical romance action and good songs. The movie does drag nearing the end but the final fight and then the end is good. However the very end is a bit stretched out making the drama boring. However the direction and the script work well and do full justice to the film.Direction is good scenes are well handled and despite a few flaws like drags and stretches the film flows well. The biggest flaw would have to be the scene right before the title song. Salman Khan comes to dance ans flirt with Urmila and the way they act looks like they know each other when this is their first meet. However this is forgiven with the comedy that happens later. There are many light hearted scenes there is no vulgarity despite Salman's character being a vulgar one.Salman Khan steals the show with his one liners his expressions are good. He doesn't look bored when acting he puts full energy into his dancing his action. Overall Salman does a good job. Urmila Matondkar proves why she is such a great actress she doesn't overact. Her expressions are well timed and she also gets good dialogs to mouth. Despite that one scene where the script makes her overact she acts well. Late Jaspal Bhatti is funny he evokes laughter the most in the film. Shammi Kapoor is good as the grandfather of Salman. Shakti Kapoor is good as the villain he makes the act look real but his Casanova act is irritating. Sadashiv Amrapukar is good as well his change nearing the end is too sudden but well shown. The rest provide decent support.On the whole Jaanam Samjha Karo is a light hearted movie despite some a few crude jokes. The film successfully evokes laughter and successfully forms a drama where two opposite characters fall in love. Unlike many films this one is well handled and the flow of the film is good.".

This movie is amazingly heartshaking and shows very 'sad but warm' view toward life which is typical to Korean people. I thought other foreigners would not understand this delicate feeling and underrate this quiet film as a boring one but I was wrong. The attraction of this film might be hard to avoid to foreigners too. Even without subtitle...I would like to mention some points others have missed. Of course this film depicts love between a man and a woman. However the very theme is way beyond that. Actually it is about time value of remembrance and death. In this film the focus is not on the 'love affair' between two people. As some pointed out they do not kiss they do not hug each other even without holding hands. So love itself is not completed whether positively or negatively in the film. Rather what haunts Jungwon a leading actor is his impending death. He's running out of time he can't hold it leaving a few behind including his father and of course Darim a metermaid. So the problem is how he can face the death and leave something valuable in his short life not how he can make love with Darim.This kind of theme sounds very familiar to us. There are lots of movies regarding patients with uncurable disease such as 'Love Story'. However what makes this film outstanding is the way Jungwon deals his death. He is a loser but tried to do his best while he's alive IN A SILENT WAY. He does not tell anybody around him about his death. He hides something in his mind but without rage hate vengeance. He just tried to do best while he was alive. This limited communication and obedience to fate is the typical mindset of Koreans and the point most Western people don't understand or at best misunderstand.This theme is very effectively expressed by the director of this film surprisingly his debut. Some say he's much influenced by Japanese director Ozu Yasujiro who directed Tokyo Story. Indeed I remember I read in some magazine that the director himself admitted he was influenced by Ozu. I'm not that knowledged to analyze his style comparing to Ozu's but they have some in common and some not. Low angle and static camera especially remind us Ozu's style. But in terms of theme again this Korean director seems to have somewhat warmer and hopeful vision.It is expressed concisely with Jungwon's last photograph. Very well done and really heartbreaking scene I think. Actually the director first had the idea of this film when he participated the funeral of a very famous Korean folk singer who died young of mysterious suicide. They say he saw the photograph of the singer at the funeral and thought of a film on death and remembrance. And possibly hope for the remnants I think...I highly recommend this film to anybody who has deep interest in film art as well as Korean culture. This film in my opinion can be rivaled with other movies like Tokyo story and a sort of American Beauty. It is that great if without language barrier. DVD version is going to be out in the market this February so it might be a little help for foreigners with English subtitle.".

	schema:reviewBody "A photographer in the small city of Gunsan in South Korea learns that he has a terminal illness but downplays the seriousness of it to his family and friends. We never find out the nature of the disease but the main focus of Hur Jinho's poignant first film Christmas in August is not his illness. It is the grace in which he conducts his life  his ability to accept what life has in store without remorse. Sadly it was the final film shot by cinematographer Yoo Youngkil before his death and the film is dedicated to his memory.The photographer Jungwon is played by Han Sukkyu at one time Korea's most popular star. A handsome man in his early thirties with an infectious laugh he is so warm and full of vitality that it is difficult to picture him as nearing the end of life. Jungwon owns a small photography shop and lives at home with his hard of hearing father Goo Shin and sister Oh Jihye teaching his dad how to play movies on the VCR and writing instructions for him to take over his shop if he were to die. As Jungwon goes about the daytoday business of getting his affairs in order Darim Shim Eunha a meter reader comes into his store with an urgent request for some photographic enlargements.Abrupt and impatient he treats her with disdain but later apologizes and she becomes a regular customer. Without overt expression of romantic feelings their relationship develops a growing intimacy. Love is not something they say or do. It is their ground of being the place where they come from. To protect Darim from suffering Jungwon does not tell her that he has only a short time to live but this does not make the situation any easier for her. Inevitably his increasing absence from the shop causes her to feel betrayed and frustrated to the point where she throws a rock through the shop's window. Although Jungwon's decision to withhold his illness from Darim is open to question it feels organic to his character in the film and is not used simply as a plot device or an excuse for the character to live life to the fullest by playing around.One of the most touching sequences in the film is when an elderly woman returns to his studio to take a memorial photo of herself. Jungwon makes sure the picture is an exact likeness knowing that soon he will be taking his own picture of remembrance. Christmas in August is an unpretentious film that never resorts to melodrama to make its point. It is about taking pleasure in ordinary moments riding a bike sharing a joke eating ice cream being thoughtful and considerate and feeling good about what life has to offer. It is a love story where love means having to say you're sorry. Although there have been many films on the dying process Christmas in August propels the genre in a new direction and in the process offers an unforgettable commentary on the human condition. Incongruously this film about death is an experience of the utmost joy.".

	schema:reviewBody "How often do we live our romantic life as on the big screen with torrid affairs and passionate encounters? Almost never if what I see as normal life around me is anything to judge by. Romances as previously stated are hardly ever earthshaking affairs that leave you at the top of the world or batter and bruised.Romance in its every day form as lived out millions of times over around the world is a slow subtle and quiet affair. Something that grows in you ever so slowly probably without you even noticing it slowly taking over your being. No one can tell me when I am in love. For if someone did I would not believe him anyway for no one but me would know. And even then it is just a feeling a certain knowledge that you are feeling this exalting emotion. That you want nothing but the best for someone that you would never want to see them suffer a moment of sadness. That you are willing to take a great degree of pain for them. I would not go so far as to say be willing to die for your loved one for we are all human and we do not know what we are capable of in the face of death until that moment is upon us.Is the love between the main characters of the film ever so subtle and understated no less noble than that between Romeo and Juliet? The unstated emotions the unsaid feelings convey far more than any repeated shouts of I love you. The restraint shown by the lead actor displayed ever so poignantly in the scene where he watches his love interest through the cafe window yet never did he move to make himself known to her was simply heartwrenching to watch. Would most of us be selfless enough to remain hidden knowing that her emotions and feelings could not possibly be reciprocated?On another note how will I deal with my own certain death? While I can claim I have been seriously ill I can not in all honesty say that I have ever come close to death. Will I be so calm putting all my affairs in order and leaving instructions for others to take up what I leave behind? I suspect I will be calm for I will have little choice in the matter. Can I be so selfless? Again the answer will have to be in the negative. I can empathize with the anguish knowing that your life is forfeit that fate has dealt you a fatal blow and that future events however little there are of them left are no longer under your control.Life is nothing more than a series of small events the culmination of which may seem great for some in retrospect. But only very rarely.".

	onyx:emotionText "How often do we live our romantic life as on the big screen with torrid affairs and passionate encounters? Almost never if what I see as normal life around me is anything to judge by. Romances as previously stated are hardly ever earthshaking affairs that leave you at the top of the world or batter and bruised.Romance in its every day form as lived out millions of times over around the world is a slow subtle and quiet affair. Something that grows in you ever so slowly probably without you even noticing it slowly taking over your being. No one can tell me when I am in love. For if someone did I would not believe him anyway for no one but me would know. And even then it is just a feeling a certain knowledge that you are feeling this exalting emotion. That you want nothing but the best for someone that you would never want to see them suffer a moment of sadness. That you are willing to take a great degree of pain for them. I would not go so far as to say be willing to die for your loved one for we are all human and we do not know what we are capable of in the face of death until that moment is upon us.Is the love between the main characters of the film ever so subtle and understated no less noble than that between Romeo and Juliet? The unstated emotions the unsaid feelings convey far more than any repeated shouts of I love you. The restraint shown by the lead actor displayed ever so poignantly in the scene where he watches his love interest through the cafe window yet never did he move to make himself known to her was simply heartwrenching to watch. Would most of us be selfless enough to remain hidden knowing that her emotions and feelings could not possibly be reciprocated?On another note how will I deal with my own certain death? While I can claim I have been seriously ill I can not in all honesty say that I have ever come close to death. Will I be so calm putting all my affairs in order and leaving instructions for others to take up what I leave behind? I suspect I will be calm for I will have little choice in the matter. Can I be so selfless? Again the answer will have to be in the negative. I can empathize with the anguish knowing that your life is forfeit that fate has dealt you a fatal blow and that future events however little there are of them left are no longer under your control.Life is nothing more than a series of small events the culmination of which may seem great for some in retrospect. But only very rarely.";

Having read through the synopsis of the movie it really sounded like a movie that was well worth buying and watching.And it was!This Korean drama is a strong romance that really tells a very great story withing actually delving into the physical aspects of love. The unspoken attraction between Jungwon played by Sukkyo Han and Darim played by Eunha Shim was really breathtaking and so romantic. There was not a single kiss embrace or anything like it but the scene where Darim took hold of Jungwon's arm as they walked on the street and he was telling the ghost story said it all that scene was just so beautiful.Jungwon is terminally ill with some sickness that we never learn what actually is and he has come to terms with his condition and wants to continue his life as normal when Darim walks into his photo store one day and a friendship is forming a friendship that blooms into a love that unfortunately goes unsettled.Christmas in August was really beautifully acted and brought to the screen because both Sukkyo Han and Eunha Shim really played their characters so well and the chemistry between them was just amazing. There isn't a lot of characters in the movie so they were having to really carry the movie with excellent performances which must be said that they also really did.This is a sad romantic story but it is really beautiful still despite it not ending out with everyone living happily ever after which is a tendency to happen in romantic movies. Christmas in August is highly recommended that you spend an approximate 110 minutes on watching because it is so worth it. And if you liked movies like Failan then you will definitely love Christmas in August as well.".

AlphabetPIX  Lovely Name  Word Art You Create with alphabet photography AlphabetPIX AlphabetPhotography ChristmasinAugust Christmasgift PersonalizedGifts Powerful 13 February 2001  by Karfoo Hong Kong  See all my reviews How often do we live our romantic life as on the big screen with torrid affairs and passionate encounters? Almost never if what I see as normal life around me is anything to judge by. Romances as previously stated are hardly ever earthshaking affairs that leave you at the top of the world or batter and bruised.Romance in its every day form as lived out millions of times over around the world is a slow subtle and quiet affair. Something that grows in you ever so slowly probably without you even noticing it slowly taking over your being. No one can tell me when I am in love.

That you want nothing but the best for someone that you would never want to see them suffer a moment of sadness. That you are willing to take a great degree of pain for them. I would not go so far as to say be willing to die for your loved one for we are all human and we do not know what we are capable of in the face of death until that moment is upon us.Is the love between the main characters of the film ever so subtle and understated no less noble than that between Romeo and Juliet? The unstated emotions the unsaid feelings convey far more than any repeated shouts of I love you. The restraint shown by the lead actor displayed ever so poignantly in the scene where he watches his love interest through the cafe window yet never did he move to make himself known to her was simply heartwrenching to watch. Would most of us be selfless enough to remain hidden knowing that her emotions and feelings could not possibly be reciprocated?".

AlphabetPIX  Lovely Name  Word Art You Create with alphabet photography AlphabetPIX AlphabetPhotography ChristmasinAugust Christmasgift PersonalizedGifts Powerful 13 February 2001  by Karfoo Hong Kong  See all my reviews How often do we live our romantic life as on the big screen with torrid affairs and passionate encounters? Almost never if what I see as normal life around me is anything to judge by. Romances as previously stated are hardly ever earthshaking affairs that leave you at the top of the world or batter and bruised.Romance in its every day form as lived out millions of times over around the world is a slow subtle and quiet affair. Something that grows in you ever so slowly probably without you even noticing it slowly taking over your being. No one can tell me when I am in love. For if someone did I would not believe him anyway for no one but me would know. And even then it is just a feeling a certain knowledge that you are feeling this exalting emotion. That you want nothing but the best for someone that you would never want to see them suffer a moment of sadness. That you are willing to take a great degree of pain for them.

	schema:headline " This is not only a Buddhist idea but one of the facts of life.";
	schema:reviewBody "In Spring Summer Fall Winter ... and Spring Kim Kiduk a South Korean director whose past films were often fueled by violence does a complete aboutface. This film is a pastoral poem about the changing seasons and a meditation on the cycle of life. In a tranquil and timeless setting of a temple floating atop a manmade lake in a forest surrounded by mountain spires that cut the monastery off from worldly concerns an old monk teaches his young disciple the wisdom of Buddha over the many seasons of their lives.But don't let the movie's mysticism fool you This South KoreanGerman production has created festival buzz here. Sony Pictures Classics snapped up the picture in the second week. As it is chosen to be South Korea's entry into the foreignlanguage film Oscar competition Spring should become an art house hit in North America. Set against the background of this floating monastery the picture's only set the film follows the lives of a child monk and his master through four different seasons of their lives. Kim infuses these episodes with Buddhist principles which teach kindness toward all forms of life and the goal of inner peace. Yet the world does intrude into the serene hermitage bringing with it life's pleasures and sufferings. Under the watchful gaze of an old monk Oh Youngsu a little boy Seo Jaekyung learns what sorrows his own cruelty can cause. As a teen the boy Kim Youngmin experiences the power of love and of lust when a young woman Ha Yeojin enters his life. Turning his back on the hermitage he joins the world of man only to return years later in anger and terror when his desperate need for possession has turned to murder. Before police can arrest him his master sees that penitence has cleared his heart and soul of all hatred. In winter the old monk makes his funeral pyre. Then his disciple now a mature man played by the director himself returns to the sanctuary of his youth. He seeks peace and quiet so he might fulfill his destiny. When a woman brings a male baby to the temple the monk undertakes a journey of atonement to place a holy statue on a frozen mountaintop. Now he is ready to raise and instruct a new monk. Much of the movie is steeped in Buddhist mysticism. Each of the five episodes features a different animal  a dog a rooster a cat a snake and finally a turtle. For each season Kim Kiduk observes the change of weather and the relationship of man with nature. The film emphasizes the power of meditation and in the episode concerning the murderer who seeks enlightenment the need to perform a sutra to cleanse the heart of all jealousy and anger. Kim Kiduk keeps dialogue to a minimum and actions simple in what is virtually a twocharacter piece. Humor arrives organically often resulting in hearty laughs. Backed by a terrific South KoreanGerman production crew Kim Kiduk is in total control of his material its rhythms and its tone.Spring  Child Monk takes life of animals out of innocenceA child monk ties a stone to a back of fish. Same plight awaits a frog and a snake. The child monk roams the brook in search of the fish and the frog as his punishment allotted by the old monk. Summer  Boy Monk in love learns obsession The monk is now 17 years old. To the lonely hermitage a girl comes to convalesce. Before long warm feelings towards the girl sprouts in the boy's heart. Their ripple in the water turns into an act of love.Fall  Young Monk in agony of malice The boy returns to the hermitage in the mountains as a young man in his thirties after committing a murder. The old monk whips him finding the young man attempting suicide in front of the statue of Buddha. Old monk order him to etch the Pranjaparpamitasutra meanwhile he finds peace in his heart.Winter  Mature Monk in days of enlightenment The monk now in his full maturity retraces his steps to the abandoned hermitage in the mountains. A woman wearing a veil visits the hermitage with a baby. She leaves her baby behind and runs away. And then spring  Another child monk  cycle of four seasons The old monk living with another child monk is having a peaceful time in the hermitage...the circle of life keeps on. Kim Gideokb has been known for making films that are involving but often difficult to watch. In his eight previous works which include ''Som The Isle' ''Nappun Namja Bad Guy' and most recently ''Haeanson The Coast Guard' Kim has taken on such controversial and agonizing topics as the life of a prostitute the lovehate relationship of a woman and a pimp who kidnaps her and a soldier slowly going insane. For his new film ''Bom Yorum Kaul Kyoul Kurigo Bom Spring Summer Fall Winter... and Spring' Kim says he tried to change the pace and outlook of his films and show a different side of himself. ''I feel like I've been living my life in a rush so I wanted to slow down a little and make a movie like this' Kim said after a press screening.The film traces the life of a Buddhist monk as he goes from being a young orphan to an adult monk. Kim uses the passing of the seasons to parallel the monk's development and his experiences of desire jealousy and rage.With a small cast all of ''Spring' takes place in and around a temple on Chusanji Lake located in Mt.

	onyx:emotionText "In Spring Summer Fall Winter ... and Spring Kim Kiduk a South Korean director whose past films were often fueled by violence does a complete aboutface. This film is a pastoral poem about the changing seasons and a meditation on the cycle of life. In a tranquil and timeless setting of a temple floating atop a manmade lake in a forest surrounded by mountain spires that cut the monastery off from worldly concerns an old monk teaches his young disciple the wisdom of Buddha over the many seasons of their lives.But don't let the movie's mysticism fool you This South KoreanGerman production has created festival buzz here. Sony Pictures Classics snapped up the picture in the second week. As it is chosen to be South Korea's entry into the foreignlanguage film Oscar competition Spring should become an art house hit in North America. Set against the background of this floating monastery the picture's only set the film follows the lives of a child monk and his master through four different seasons of their lives. Kim infuses these episodes with Buddhist principles which teach kindness toward all forms of life and the goal of inner peace. Yet the world does intrude into the serene hermitage bringing with it life's pleasures and sufferings. Under the watchful gaze of an old monk Oh Youngsu a little boy Seo Jaekyung learns what sorrows his own cruelty can cause. As a teen the boy Kim Youngmin experiences the power of love and of lust when a young woman Ha Yeojin enters his life. Turning his back on the hermitage he joins the world of man only to return years later in anger and terror when his desperate need for possession has turned to murder. Before police can arrest him his master sees that penitence has cleared his heart and soul of all hatred. In winter the old monk makes his funeral pyre. Then his disciple now a mature man played by the director himself returns to the sanctuary of his youth. He seeks peace and quiet so he might fulfill his destiny. When a woman brings a male baby to the temple the monk undertakes a journey of atonement to place a holy statue on a frozen mountaintop. Now he is ready to raise and instruct a new monk. Much of the movie is steeped in Buddhist mysticism. Each of the five episodes features a different animal  a dog a rooster a cat a snake and finally a turtle. For each season Kim Kiduk observes the change of weather and the relationship of man with nature. The film emphasizes the power of meditation and in the episode concerning the murderer who seeks enlightenment the need to perform a sutra to cleanse the heart of all jealousy and anger. Kim Kiduk keeps dialogue to a minimum and actions simple in what is virtually a twocharacter piece. Humor arrives organically often resulting in hearty laughs. Backed by a terrific South KoreanGerman production crew Kim Kiduk is in total control of his material its rhythms and its tone.Spring  Child Monk takes life of animals out of innocenceA child monk ties a stone to a back of fish. Same plight awaits a frog and a snake. The child monk roams the brook in search of the fish and the frog as his punishment allotted by the old monk. Summer  Boy Monk in love learns obsession The monk is now 17 years old. To the lonely hermitage a girl comes to convalesce. Before long warm feelings towards the girl sprouts in the boy's heart. Their ripple in the water turns into an act of love.Fall  Young Monk in agony of malice The boy returns to the hermitage in the mountains as a young man in his thirties after committing a murder. The old monk whips him finding the young man attempting suicide in front of the statue of Buddha. Old monk order him to etch the Pranjaparpamitasutra meanwhile he finds peace in his heart.Winter  Mature Monk in days of enlightenment The monk now in his full maturity retraces his steps to the abandoned hermitage in the mountains. A woman wearing a veil visits the hermitage with a baby. She leaves her baby behind and runs away. And then spring  Another child monk  cycle of four seasons The old monk living with another child monk is having a peaceful time in the hermitage...the circle of life keeps on. Kim Gideokb has been known for making films that are involving but often difficult to watch. In his eight previous works which include ''Som The Isle' ''Nappun Namja Bad Guy' and most recently ''Haeanson The Coast Guard' Kim has taken on such controversial and agonizing topics as the life of a prostitute the lovehate relationship of a woman and a pimp who kidnaps her and a soldier slowly going insane. For his new film ''Bom Yorum Kaul Kyoul Kurigo Bom Spring Summer Fall Winter... and Spring' Kim says he tried to change the pace and outlook of his films and show a different side of himself. ''I feel like I've been living my life in a rush so I wanted to slow down a little and make a movie like this' Kim said after a press screening.The film traces the life of a Buddhist monk as he goes from being a young orphan to an adult monk. Kim uses the passing of the seasons to parallel the monk's development and his experiences of desire jealousy and rage.With a small cast all of ''Spring' takes place in and around a temple on Chusanji Lake located in Mt. Chuwang National Park North Kyongsang Province. A 30ton set built specifically for the film the temple floats like a wayward raft on the lake accessible only by a small boat.With the construction of the temple and the logistics of filming on water Kim says there were a lot of people behind the film that made it possible. ''They made something that it seemed could not be done work' he says.The floating temple was used to show ''the speed in which life can change the way that one can wake up and find that East has become West and West has become East that irony of life' Kim said. ''Spring' also shows Kim making his debut as an actor. Kim portrays the older monk in the film's winter scenes a role he originally conceived for the veteran actor Ahn Sungki or renowned scholar and philosopher Kim YongOK. Both were unavailable due to schedule conflicts.After deciding to take on the part himself Kim made the already physically demanding role which included meditating in freezing temperatures even more so. In one scene Kim climbs up a steep mountain with a large stone tied to his waist while carrying a stone statue of a Buddha with both arms something he admits he wouldn't have asked another actor to do.A devout Catholic  Kim at one point in his life seriously considered priesthood  the director says the film in part was driven by his relationship between his own religious values and the culture around him.''All Koreans have lived surrounded by Buddhism and Buddhist culture is the foundation which we acknowledge and accept' he says.And though the changing of the seasons in the film is to show the life of one monk Kim says it reflects the cycle of life in general.''If we were able to remember life's lesson from spring we wouldn't repeat them' Kim says ''but like winter which rots away the leaves and freezes over everything like the seasons' patterns our patterns in life will make us forget and repeat our past mistakes.

The modern day conveniences of life and the hustle and bustle of work sometimes fog our eyes to the constantly moving world. Thankfully we have films like Spring Summer Fall Winter  and Spring to help guide us back to our roots. Through each season director Kiduk Kim shows us the journey of one young boy as he learns life through the hands and mind of an older monk. Through events that are beyond his control this young boy learns about love lust jealousy hatred and eventually rage. He makes choices that ultimately effect his life causing turmoil and distress yet somehow continually finds his way back to the floating house on the lake where his journey began. It is during his final visit home he learns of his final journey in life. As a new soul is handed to him he embarks on a final journey using his master's lesson to pay homage to the life he has lead. When I watched this film the first story that came to mind was that told by Trina Paulus in 'Hope for the Flowers'. It is the story of two caterpillars that embark on a journey into butterflies. Along the way they experience a full range of emotions that are attached to life and death. In the end they become two of the most beautiful creatures in the world. This is how I viewed this entire film. I felt as if I was watching a young caterpillar the young boy experience life and journey along the path to become the beautiful butterfly. The beauty of the scenes and the simplicity of this story not drenched in words only kept this image vibrant. The spiritual themes of this film are present but not bold. They are not hitting you in the face and forcing you to understand but instead showing you and demonstrating the power of those willing to believe. This is a quiet film that leaves much up to our imagination. We never leave the valley that surrounds the lake we never know what year is currently going on outside of the forest and we are meant to understand that this story could take place anytime. Kim gives us themes that can be used to express any period of time and is especially poignant in today's terror filled world.I loved everything about this film. From the simplicity of the opening doors to introduce each scene to the stunning and hypnotic ending that makes you believe in the human spirit. If you walk away with anything from this film I hope it is hope. Hope for everything on this planet and especially a hope for our fellow man. Mistakes are made to learn by. Take these errors and accept them to move closer to the world you have always dreamed about. Be that young boy that is able to transform into the man he desires.See this movie and feel a warmth like no other. This is quite possibly one of the best films of the year. Amazing!Grade  out of ".

The fact there are no walls means their use is not forced but elected. They represent morality and discipline. Morality is not defined by a higher power but by society and the self. By adopting the constraints the doors engender selfdiscipline is attained. As soon as the young man transgresses these selfimposed boundaries to sneak across to the young woman then disaster follows. THE DEAD ANIMALS The Master allows the young boy to let the animals die. He does not become an all powerful father figure cleaning up after him but allows him to make mistakes and suffer the consequences. Buddhism does not have a higher power but rather promotes selfawareness. THE MILLSTONE AND BUDDHA Represent the twin stones of regret for killing the fish and the snake. What you do unto others you do unto yourself. He has carried that karma around with him all his life until he transcends them both carrying them to the top of the hill near heaven. Here he cuts himself free and attains redemption through struggle. THE MASTER Is a great teacher but does not lecture. Hardly a word is spoken but lessons are learned. A good teacher points the way for a student to discover selfevident knowledge for themselves. THE MOTHER The veil representing guilt and shame are ultimately the cause of her downfall. Hiding from the outside world can bring about ruin.THE YOUNG BOY Both at the beginning and the end represents us.

The old monk becomes a witness to the interplay of human qualities without judgment yet with a complete and quiet moral presence. The foibles of child cruelty is met with a simple retribution which imparts a lasting lesson. Judgment is always withheld and warnings are given simply. The effect of all of this rings long and lasting much like the impression of a delicate Korean silk print simple in design with plain brush strokes and stylized representations of nature yet lasting in impression often to the point of being unforgettable. I buy few videos and DVDs preferring to see things I really enjoyed again and again. But I've ordered this one.".

I buy few videos and DVDs preferring to see things I really enjoyed again and again. But I've ordered this one.";

	schema:reviewBody "I remember when I saw this film on screen last year I was struck by the rhythm director Kim KiDuk used in the film. It's deliberate too deliberate for most I'd suppose. But like a reading good piece of philosophy the filmmaker allows the viewer to get as much as they may find in the work. The story is more of a fable than a really conventional narrative a baby is delivered to the steps of a Buddhist house on a lake where the boy is raised by a master. He grows up and falls temptation to the desires of the world. He decides to leave only to return and find himself again. In the end as winter comes things come full circle. Each of the 'seasons' of the film are handled delicately with the kind of simplicity that may appeal even more to children the segment of the first 'spring' with the child transcends religion and goes into the basic stance of nature. The scenes of finding lust in 'summer' is not terribly graphic but it puts the point on what is right and wrong in the customs and traditions of the religion. Then in 'Autumn' there are harsher lessons to be learned and this also contains the best acting from the old master and the young angry pupil. And 'Winter' becomes the most meditative of them all with next to no dialog. Indeed that may be the turn off to most viewers to say that the film isn't supported by dialog is an understatement. And its not necessarily documentary realism. What I sensed from the film and what stuck with me for a few days afterward was the spiritual attitude behind the style the confidence that the rhythm had a connection with the subject matter. It's one of the most soulful films to come out of the Eastern world in some time. It's less a traditional drama than a unique experience for better or worse really more for the better.".

	schema:reviewBody "After watching the movie a second time I was determined to find out what the Old Monk had drawn on the deck of the hermitage. The only clue I had was the scene's subtitle Prajnaparamita Sutra  it helps restore inner peace. Those were the words the Old Monk used to describe the sacred teachings that the Young Monk had to carve out as penance for his crime of passion. When I looked up the Prajnaparamita Sutra on the internet I found out it was known as the Diamond Sutra of the Buddha. The Buddha spoke the wise words in a monastery near Sravasti saying that this sutra should be called the Diamond that cuts through illusion because it has the capacity to cut through illusions and afflictions and bring us to the shore of liberation. There are 32 sutras or sections and the 32 sections are also marks that are used to meditate on the Tathagata  which means the suchness of all things dharmas. The meaning of Tathagata is does not come from anywhere and does not go anywhere. The insight into the truth of the sutras consists in a realization that the idea of a self is not an idea and the ideas of a person a living being and a life span are not ideas either. A selfrealized or awakened Buddha is called a Buddha because heshe is free of ideas.The Buddha in the Diamond Sutra is also called the WorldHonored One and his message can be summarized by two axioms 1 Someone who looks for me in form or seeks me in sound is on a mistaken path and cannot see the Tathagata. 2 All composed things are like a dream a phantom a drop of dew a flash of lightning. That is how to meditate on them that is how to observe them. Now I will have to watch the movie a third time and meditate on the 32 marks that the Old Monk draws with the cat's tail on the floor of the ashram. I will also feel the urge to count and see if there are really 32 marks.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Spring Summer Autumn  or Fall if you will Winterand Spring' is as the title should imply a fable very much in the 'cycle of life' cache so simply crafted and yet so flowing with gentle complexity at the same time. It works wonders both as an episodic coming of age saga concerning one man's lifelong quest for inner peace and balance and a refreshing type of character study where actions and physical mannerisms are thrust more attention than words the dialogue here is minimal yet the two key characters still display a surprising amount of depth  every subtle tear and drop of sweat adds up  and I found myself completely drawn in by it. The background settings are as delightfully picturesque as background settings come and the movie's pacing is both gradual and thoughtful while still leaving room for some slight drizzles of drama and a handful of haunting even harrowing moments which capture the rougher side of living but nothing to detract from the overall calming sensation you're left with. The result is a seriously unique slice of life and inspiration and hats off to Kiduk Kim for it.Overall things are left ambiguous enough for us viewers to draw our own merry conclusions and so rich in all those little minor details which build up the bigger picture that you could spend hours assessing them right down to the very last shade of blue and dissecting each and everything for all the symbolism and abstract concepts they might embody. It's one of those flicks that has different meanings to different people I guess. Personally I'd be happy enough taking it on its direct face value level  things are what they are they're there because they're there and what you're seeing is exactly what you get. Cast all possible symbolism aside and it's still a perfectly effective offering about the trials and triumphs of one man's life. And yes this particular life's complicated enough without all those ittybitty extra meanings.The Holy Man's everchanging assortment of animal companions are probably the best example. We go through the various seasons always with a puppy chicken cat snake or tortoise successively at our sides and viewers are liable fill up an entire message board debating whether it's the positive or negative aspects of our protagonist they're meant to symbolize  the chicken being lust and brashness and the puppy being youthful ignorance the cat being idleness etc.But really their exact species in most cases is pretty incidental  their reason for being there doesn't need to be anything more complicated than simply to emphasize time and the changes it entails. A different animal with every new 'season' further marks the shift in time since our last visit to the temple. Note also that the snake arrives on the scene exactly as the older man departs you don't really need to be familiar with Buddhist practices to follow this one although it might be helpful to know that apparently that is actually an established selfcremating ritual which comes of knowing the exact moment of your death in advance and not a suicide by any means and you can take it as a hint that it may well be his reincarnated self it's lovely BTW to finally find a flick where snakes are represented in a positive frame. In light of that isn't it also kinda tempting to subscribe to the possibility that the remaining four could also be the reincarnated souls of the temple's former residents whoever they might be? That notion satisfies me a lot more than that of the chicken just standing in for some hot burning passion or whatever.Then there's the mysterious woman who arrives at the temple with a cloth covering her face. And that's all she really is  a mysterious woman who arrives at the temple with a cloth covering her face. Her exact identity isn't revealed and nor does it have to be. And we don't really have any means of working it out either so why worry about that? It is clear though that she's a desperate person in such dire straits that she's forced to conceal her real identity and depart ways with her son and we can still feel for her on that.In short this film is what you make of it and it more or less goes without saying that it only becomes a complicated puzzle if you make it one.My own personal quest for inner peace still continues but needless to say this movie provided me with 103 beautiful minutes of escapism and bliss.".

Kim KidukFilms that leave me feeling spiritually uplifted are often subtle and understated in their evocation of the transcendence of the human spirit. On the other hand those that try to impress us about how spiritual they are often fail to achieve their desired goal. Such is the case for Spring Summer Fall Winterand Spring a South Korean film by Kim Kiduk that works hard at conveying a spiritual experience but comes across as labored and selfconscious. While the shots are beautifully composed the film offers little more than prepackaged enlightenment reiterating the accepted clichs about the long and painful process the uphill battle full of struggle and effort and so forth.Set in monastery on Jason Pond an artificial lake in North Kyungsang Province in Korea surrounded by a forest of ancient trees each season represents a chapter of life and the achievement of a hardearned lesson. An old monk Oh YoungSoo teaches his young charge Kim Jongho about the value of all sentient beings. After the boy playfully ties a rock to a frog a snake and a fish the old master shows him what it feels like by tying a huge rock to the boy's back while he is sleeping. In the morning he is told to find the animals and free them or he will have to carry a rock in his heart the rest of his life. Unable to do so the boy grows up with a burdensome guilt.By the following season the young monk has become a 17year old adolescent and is mesmerized when a beautiful teenage girl dressed in blue jeans shows up in his floating paradise She has been brought by her mother because she is sick and wants the monks to cure her. After some time spent in prayer the old monk tells the mother When she finds peace in her soul her body will return to health. The soul cure is found pretty quickly when the young monk undoes his robe letting us know that all women need to do to achieve health is to find a man. The old man confuses love with lust and utters such strange teaching as lust awakens the desire to possess and that awakens the intent to murder. When the girl is sent away following her cure the boy also leaves the monastery and the film takes a nonBuddhist turn toward obsession and revenge until the cycle comes full circle.Spring Summer Fall Winterand Spring cultivates a mood of serenity but from the opening moment to the final credits it struck me as inauthentic. Buddhism is a disciplined system of mental and spiritual development designed to develop compassion and lovingkindness for all beings. Its practices include daily meditation that calms and clears the mind and allows us to gain a clearer sense of who we really are. This does not guarantee that we will never make mistakes but it is not credible to me that a boy raised from birth in the Buddhist tradition would be capable not only of cruelty to animals but to other human beings as well. At the end of the film I felt neither moved uplifted or even involved. If enlightenment means to lighten up the best medicine for this sort of hokum is to laugh gently. After all this too will pass. There is a cycle to everything  even bad movies about spirituality.".

Possibly Kim Kiduk is trying to work off his reputation for making movies replete with violent sexual imagery but he's not fooling anyone. Spring contains  admittedly in a much more restrained form  most of the themes from his earlier works The Isle and Bad Guy. Onto this however is pasted a hefty dose of Buddhist teaching. Or from another perspective an interesting juxtaposition of old and new.Beginning in the Spring of an undefined year close to the present the film is set on and I mean on an isolated lake. A child acolyte lives out a life of quiet contemplation punctuated by occasional acts of petty animal cruelty. His master a monk observes his young charge with increasing disapproval and orders him to undo his evil or face the consequences in his own life. It soon becomes apparent that he means this in anything but the figurative sense.Moving through the seasons Kim explores the cycle of life with his acolyte experiencing youthful love or lust anger violence and finally acceptance contrition and peace. The film ends with a new acolyte and a new cycle implying an endless repetition with subtle variation.Spring is not exactly a subtle film but it is beautifully done. Kim uses silence like few other filmmakers matching Kurosawa or Bergman at their best. He punctuates these long slow movements with abrupt changes in tempo  such as the arrival of Yeo. The pace quickens and the mood changes. The courtship of the adolescent boy and girl are some of the gentlest scenes in cinema though culminating in a suitably Kimlike energetic coupling.With popular Buddhist and Confucian ideas now so firmly established in cinema thanks in part to their bastardisation by George Lucas the ideas in this film aren't exactly going to leave its audience in need of a large glass of perspective and soda to quote Douglas Adams. Lust leads to possessive urges which lead to violence ones violent actions lead on to violence against oneself peace and redemption is found not through approbation but understanding oneself.I can't quite dispel the notion that The Isle with its sly humour and darker plot is a better film or that Spring is if not completely then at least partially up the bottom of its own artiness. That said it is a very very pretty film. Its story is intelligent if not aweinspiring and it is a delightful change of pace from most modern cinema. Most of all it is probably one of Kim's most accessible films and I shall certainly be watching it again  if only to see Oh Yeongsu practising his calligraphic art with the tail of a live cat. 710.".

I found the discussion group on this film see IMDb's Message Board for this film title VERY helpful in illuminating the symbolism which I partially grasped the first time I saw it and in decoding some Buddhist principles.The setting and the photography that captures it are strikingly beautiful and satisfying.

	schema:reviewBody "This story of the life cycle of a Buddhist monk and an apprentice living in near isolation on a floating pagoda in the middle of a lake is beautifully filmed. The images and music create a distinct mood  the scenes of the apprentice doing T'ai Chi ? on the snow and ice are poetic. But I had some real problems with the story.First some technical concerns. Many scenes seemed contrived or not believable. For example when the old monk ties the stone on the sleeping child can it be believed that the kid would not wake? Or that he would not notice his new burden sometime during the night? The interior of the pagoda was exceedingly sparse but no end of things kept coming out of it ropes stones ice chisels clothes paints and so forth. The doorway in the middle of the empty room irritated me every time someone felt obligated to walk through it when walking around it would have been much easier. How did these people earn their living? In thinking about the scene where the apprentice is hanging from the ceiling in a sling on the end of a rope with a candle burning under the support I wondered just what the mechanics were of arranging that. The old monk seemed pretty weak too weak to tie the apprentice up and hoist him several feet into the air. And what was supporting the rope from the ceiling? Was there a pulley up there? How was the rope affixed to its ceiling support? Where did that aluminum can come from that the police were shooting at? It was the only item ever to mar the pristine beauty of the lake and at just the appropriate time. And the old monk was able to flick a stone and hit it on the first try? And he just happened to have a small pebble in his hand right then? Painting all those carved characters with a cat's tail would require a mighty patient cat. And where did all those colored paints come from? The hole that the apprentice chipped into the ice was nowhere big enough for the woman to fall through. And so on.Now that I have run through some of the petty concerns of a literalist I can move on to what really bothered me about this story. The overall message appears to be that isolating yourself from society is the path to some higher state. Even if that were true it seems like a selfish goal. Much more challenging and useful is to attain balance in the midst of the chaos that is living in the world. The old monk utters the words Lust awakes the desire to possess. And that awakens the intent to murder as if to express some deep insight. However it is the rare person who has not experienced lust but only a tiny percentage of those ever have an intent to kill. These words from the wise man seem patently false. But in the context of this film the words have a more potentially worrisome significance. Perhaps the import of the words carried such weight for the apprentice that the intimation planted in the mind effected the deed. The lessons meted out by the master seemed exceedingly harsh. If tying a stone to a snake were to kill the snake and the snake were to die then the kid would have to carry that burden with him for life? What a traumatic thing to say to an innocent kid. If as a kid I had had a super moralist following my every move as this kid did I would have gone nuts. I found the sadomasochistic beating to be disturbing and repellent. And what is the deal with the worshiping of icons? I though the sacred was in the mind and not in physical objects? If everybody were to absorb the teachings of the master then our race would soon die out since sex seems to be avoided at all cost. I have found that an intense day of tedious activity indeed produces exhaustion as did the apprentice but it never seemed to be a path to the catharsis and peace that the apprentice experienced after his ordeal. And the master could beckon an empty boat to him or impede the rowing of two vigorous men by force of mind? Give me a break.There is too much Eastern philosophy and mysticism here for this Western viewer.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some movies are conceived as Valentine cards sweet stories with clear morals set in a world designed to reward purity of heart.Usually these are revolting. In this case that is mitigated by two factors.One. If you are a western viewer Buddhist notions of integrity are exotic enough to engage by themselves. To judge from the critical acclaim from critics in the west that's true and I found it true myself even though I know something about it.But what I would like to recommend to you is not that you accept this at face value. Its as mawkishly sentimental as any Robert Redford bit. And you can't quite take it as a film made in the Buddhist manner. It isn't at all not even close.But the manner in which it IS made is wonderful. Its spatial cinema that rare thing that I comment on from time to time. This has a wonderful setting absolutely wonderful. The entire film is in a temple that floats in a placid lake sometimes moving. The surrounds are lovely mountains but that by itself is not enough.And its not just that the place and space is photographed in a rich lovely manner. Its how the camera seats itself in the temple so that even when you are in the forest nearby the cliffs and trees form temple walls. Its all about the temple not the two men portrayed and circularly merged into one man.Watch how the camera establishes itself first on one of the architectural features as an edge or frame then moves to an individual. Watch how the filmmaker moves your familiarity with the space into a central feature of the story towards the end. As it happens the script of the story is written on the stage of the space in ink dipped in a cat's tail and then carved with a knife then again painted and finally aged into the place itself. Its a masterful cinematic effect. Just masterful and trumps the moral and all else.Watch it for that. It ain't Buddist but it is transcendent. The parts of the space weigh on you like the stones attached on the outside at the beginning and the inside at the end.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

Indeed the first two chapters Spring and Summer were promising leading up to a plot which manages to hold the attention. After this is starts to go downhill and the final third is just awful with a few very silly scenes. Also lacking is any kind of subtlety. You expect a quite thoughtful meditation but really you get a series of really simple dumbeddown messages like it is bad to hurt animals or there are consequences to evil acts. The director is not content with making a point once or obliquely he has to make the point three or four times each chapter. This points to a basic lack of editing directorial concision. For instance the child monk in Spring is naughty mean to three wild animals a fish a frog and a snake. The master chastises him an makes him rescue the animals. The whole series of scenes where the child finds each animal in turn and then has to rescue each animal afterwards are needless filler. One animal would have made the point far more clearly and forcefully. Given the quality of the visuals available and the basic concept of the story a much better movie could have been made.".

Really it is the proverbial circle of life.  The seasonal changes are the perfect backdrop for his vision of the changes in our lives. By far the most interesting portion of the film is during the teen years when the ill female visits.  More life is experienced in this 20 minutes of filmmaking than in 2 hours of most.  The symbolism of the boat is most appealing although the buddhist spiritual scenes threw me off course at times.  Did enjoy the director's comments on the stones burdens we all carry in our life and how at the end we usually reflect on those times. Definitely worth seeing as a metaphor of the circle of life.  Some of the scenery is beautiful and peaceful.  By the way that is the director as the master at the end of the film.".

However the plot is something many Western viewers probably won't be too thrilled with unless they have a very very open mind and are willing to see a film with an unusual structure and many odd allegorical elementssort of like Buddhism actually. The film consists of many wonderful and amusing moments but also has many intense and even horrifying moments so be prepared for an emotional roller coaster.The film is about several seasons that are spread out over many years. The film begins with a little boy who is the apprentice to a monk who lives on a shrine built in the middle of a lake Spring. It then moves to the boy's early adulthood Summer then after the boy has left and committed a horrible crime Fall followed by the boy's return to the shrine many years later after his master has committed suicide Winter and is then followed by a woman bringing a new apprentice to the shrine Spring once again. The film is very well made and interesting but ultimately it may leave you a bit confused and even irritated that in many ways the film is as much about redemption and rebirth as it is about death and nothingness. The film is definitely one that will strongly appeal to some and turn others off due to its sad and confusing tone. An odd and strangely beautiful film chock full of religious imagery and oddness. It's definitely worth a look given that the viewer appreciates international films and is open to nontraditional storytelling.FYIThe DVD said it was rated R for 'strong sexuality' and while there is indeed some nudity it isn't all that intense you see a guy's butt while he is making lovenothing else is shown. In fact possibly more disturbing to kids and teens and some adults are some of the very adult themessuch as ritual suicide by fire and murder. While I wouldn't show this to kids this MIGHT be appropriate for older teensuse your judgment and see it first before showing it to them.".

The young one will learn about love and jealousy and will learn by heart the prices of loving too obsessively. With a very different rhythm and a sense of quietness very unusual the movie tells us a tao story inside the most spectacular mountains of Korea.

	schema:reviewBody "..but an appalling advertisement for Buddhism and I am no Buddhist. There is much to enjoy in the superb visual richness of this film but I was left deeply concerned about its presentation of Buddhist principles and practice. If you hope see a film about a novice Buddhist monk being taught the great mysteries learning to respect all forms of life and exploring the nature of cause and effect in dialogues with his 'master' you will be deeply disappointed. Instead viewers are privy to a few religious rituals that fail miserably in preparing a novice monk for a compassionate wise or peaceful adult life. Time and time again in the movie the novice monk fails to relate compassionately to either himself or those about him and there are several scenes of simple but repeated and extended cruelty which made me cringe as a human being.I found the various subtexts of the film as I saw it disturbing  that desire for sex ie. desire for union of polarities  transcendence is essentially a path that leads to suffering for all and that the only way to find redemption for oneself is through time and ritual rather than through practicing selfknowledge kindness and observing the nature of cause and effect.Ultimately I found this quite a depressing film about the potential of the human spirit. The message of the film that human beings canonlylearn through suffering worries me most. The movie begins and ends with a human being causing suffering to other sentient beings admittedly through ignorance. That to me shows very little insight into the real beauty and essence of Buddhism and it's also not very hopeful at all! After seeing this film I want to be a tree for they have the most beautiful untroubled existence in the film. The scenery in this movie merits much of my seven star rating.".

	schema:reviewBody "Spring Summer Fall Winter and Spring is one of those unique films. A film that is beautiful watch and incredibly tough to digest. Without a doubt this movie requires deep thought but with careful examination this movie is definitely one that strikes into the deepest of hearts and souls. The film's chronicle of a young monks journey from an innocent youth to a troubled adolescence to a reborn adulthood is extremely deep with all kinds of messages that emphasize the importance of spirituality and the dangers of lust and sexual obsession.The film technically speaking is beautiful to behold. Korean movies generally come out of the same mold. In other words they are very colorful and the picture of their films are sharp and vibrant. This is especially true in the widely popular Memories of Murder Or Salnui Cheouk and Kim's followup film 3Iron Or BinJip. The environment of the forest is especially engaging to the eye and it adds to the isolated atmosphere of the film as well as the isolated personalities of the characters. Techinically speaking Kim does a fabulous job with this film and the beautiful cinematography is one of the many reasons why Kim is slowly becoming one of the more recognized Asian filmmakers of his generation.However cinematography can't do it alone. The theme of the film as well as the development of characters is extremely important in a film. Kim goes with a different approach in this film that most filmmakers aren't bold enough to do he relies on silence and actions rather than dialog much like his followup film 3Iron in which his main male protagonist doesn't say one word. It sounds eccentric but the characters do show their personalities well and the theme of the film is also carried out in a way that words could never do. While this further shows Kim's greatness a great deal of credit goes to the actors as well. Their excellent performances with such a limited script is commendable and a premiere example of a new kind of art form that is developing in film during this century.Without a doubt film purists and arthouse film lovers will adore this film but overall anyone who has an open mind should feel at home with this film. Granted like his other film 3Iron this movie is not the kind of film that you can sit back with your friends and laugh away with a tub of popcorn. Instead it is a serious film that displays that film is art and a brand of literature and like those two genres this movie should be studied and analyzed in order to get the most out of this film. Spring Summer Fall Winter and Spring is a pensive film but for those who put the time in analyzing this film will be rewarded with a message and work of art that is like no other. Kim's latest film 3Iron was a study of love and relationships. Spring Summer Fall Winter and Spring is a study of the growth fall and rebirth of life.Final Analysis Excellent! Highly Recommended!".

All the action and there is little action but more frames of action takes place on this hermitage.

The door that opens at the beginning of each one of the five seasons could be interpreted as a gate linking the two worlds our world and their world. To goin and goout in the idyllic space where the hermitage floats every people must go through this gate.In fact the film is a very simple allegory about the cyclic evolving life. The beginning and the final of the film encloses a cycle in the first season we find the old monk and the little boy the boy growsup evolves learns suffers loves is punished and selfpunishes him for his mistakes. After all these experiences the boy an adult now is capable to guide through life another human being. In winter he is the adult monk and he has a little boy as a protg. And the cycle starts all over.Also the film is about the thresholds that we must overpass in our life from the childhood till the adulthood and the fact that these thresholds are very similar for all of us.Allover the movie there are very subtle Buddhist symbols like the five animals a dog a rooster a cat a snake and finally a turtle each one of them being associated with one season.The film is a superbly visual experience and has a musical theme that repeats in the beginning of each of the five seasons creating for me at least a dreaming sensation.".

This goes the same with Laurel and Hardy. I taped this movie off of TCM and I watched it later on and I found this was a lot more funny and lot more heart than say BIG DADDY. To me they are the only comedians to have been so cuddley they could've been dolls. The movie is a mix of THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER and THE KID. The boys are hired as chefs for a social woman who is planning a dinner for a king. The king is a boy who dreams to be a football player and runs off to pretend he's ordinary and he runs into Stan and Ollie. His uncle wants him dispose and hires Stan and Ollie to put them on a murder rap for the king. This is very funny movie highlights include the boys referring a boys football game and Stan stealing a steak from a lion. The sentiment of the film works best for them because it makes you feel more close to them then ever.

	schema:reviewBody "All the great movie comics made poor comedies in comparison to their best ones. For every THE BANK DICK and IT'S A GIFT W.C.Fields did a MRS. WIGGS OF CABBAGE PATCH or ALICE IN WONDERLAND. For every DUCK SOUP and A NIGHT AT THE OPERA the Marx Brothers did a LOVE HAPPY or a STORY OF MANKIND. Chaplin's MODERN TIMES and MONSIEUR VERDOUX is balanced by A KING IN NEW YORK and A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG. Keaton's THE GENERAL and SHERLOCK JR. have the negatives of WHAT NO BEER or BOOM IN THE MOON. For all of Abbott and Costello's THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES or BUCK PRIVATES one has to look at DANCE WITH ME HENRY.The same with Laurel  Hardy. Their last ten films for M.G.M. and 20th Century Fox are dismissed. I think the reason is that these films lack the atmosphere built up by Hal Roach and his production staff. But what is forgotten is how often Roach and Laurel the real creative half of the team failed to agree on film production. SWISS MISS appears to have been butchered in part by Roach. There are probably other examples particularly as Laurel wanted more expensive budgets on his films such as the nightclub in OUR RELATIONS while Roach constantly tried to clamp down on expenses.When they joined MGM Laurel  Hardy were still quite popular but the leading comic team of that moment 1941 was Universal's Abbott  Costello. Though similar in physical juxtaposition thin Stan and Bud v. fat Ollie and Lou the personalities were widely different. Stan was not a wise guy like Bud Abbott and Ollie had more misplaced selfconfidence than timid Lou Costello. But the films that were given to them were somewhat like those of Abbott  Costello. The latter's BUCK PRIVATES is mirrored in L  H's GREAT GUNS. It was like the MGM studio did not really know what to do with them  and probably that is true. Don't forget how Louis B. Mayer had little sympathy with comedians  witness his actions against the Marx Brothers and Buster Keaton. Why should Laurel  Hardy get any better treatment? The last ten films then have to be judged by this background of neglect. As such one looks for whatever is positive in them. Sometimes it is surprising.SPOILERS COMING UP The best moments in NOTHING BUT TROUBLE deal with Stan and Ollie trying to cook and serve their employers Henry O'Neill and Mary Boland and the conclusion with Philip Merivale's poisoning plot against his nephew. The business with Stan offering a saw to cut the piece of purloined steak is wonderful. But the business with Merivale is quite unique.It is similar to the situation in the Marx Brothers' THE BIG STORE where in the concluding chase in the store Douglas Dumbrille the film's villain starts taking over the comic punctuation of the sequence and carries them off quite well in fact he takes over the film.

	onyx:emotionText "All the great movie comics made poor comedies in comparison to their best ones. For every THE BANK DICK and IT'S A GIFT W.C.Fields did a MRS. WIGGS OF CABBAGE PATCH or ALICE IN WONDERLAND. For every DUCK SOUP and A NIGHT AT THE OPERA the Marx Brothers did a LOVE HAPPY or a STORY OF MANKIND. Chaplin's MODERN TIMES and MONSIEUR VERDOUX is balanced by A KING IN NEW YORK and A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG. Keaton's THE GENERAL and SHERLOCK JR. have the negatives of WHAT NO BEER or BOOM IN THE MOON. For all of Abbott and Costello's THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES or BUCK PRIVATES one has to look at DANCE WITH ME HENRY.The same with Laurel  Hardy. Their last ten films for M.G.M. and 20th Century Fox are dismissed. I think the reason is that these films lack the atmosphere built up by Hal Roach and his production staff. But what is forgotten is how often Roach and Laurel the real creative half of the team failed to agree on film production. SWISS MISS appears to have been butchered in part by Roach. There are probably other examples particularly as Laurel wanted more expensive budgets on his films such as the nightclub in OUR RELATIONS while Roach constantly tried to clamp down on expenses.When they joined MGM Laurel  Hardy were still quite popular but the leading comic team of that moment 1941 was Universal's Abbott  Costello. Though similar in physical juxtaposition thin Stan and Bud v. fat Ollie and Lou the personalities were widely different. Stan was not a wise guy like Bud Abbott and Ollie had more misplaced selfconfidence than timid Lou Costello. But the films that were given to them were somewhat like those of Abbott  Costello. The latter's BUCK PRIVATES is mirrored in L  H's GREAT GUNS. It was like the MGM studio did not really know what to do with them  and probably that is true. Don't forget how Louis B. Mayer had little sympathy with comedians  witness his actions against the Marx Brothers and Buster Keaton. Why should Laurel  Hardy get any better treatment? The last ten films then have to be judged by this background of neglect. As such one looks for whatever is positive in them. Sometimes it is surprising.SPOILERS COMING UP The best moments in NOTHING BUT TROUBLE deal with Stan and Ollie trying to cook and serve their employers Henry O'Neill and Mary Boland and the conclusion with Philip Merivale's poisoning plot against his nephew. The business with Stan offering a saw to cut the piece of purloined steak is wonderful. But the business with Merivale is quite unique.It is similar to the situation in the Marx Brothers' THE BIG STORE where in the concluding chase in the store Douglas Dumbrille the film's villain starts taking over the comic punctuation of the sequence and carries them off quite well in fact he takes over the film. Here Merivale does in particular when the poisoned canap is mixed up so thoroughly by the boys that Merivale does not know which important socialpoliticalfinancial figure at the party is going to eat the poisoned piece. Momentarily he thinks it is Mary Boland but it just appears she swallowed the wrong way. But Merivale goes through the tortures of the damned until the end of the sequence. And as it turns out there is a neat wrap up to the matter just before the film concludes.It is sort of symptomatic to the trouble of Mayer's lack of concern approach with his pure humorist  he so did not care about the actual finished product that he was willing to let the film's villains take over the comedy.

This one from 1944 held a couple of notable differences for me. First off because it was an MGM movie the production values were a lot better having more to do with the improvement in filming technology than anything else I imagine although the budget would probably have been a factor as well. But the other thing was how much Stan had aged and filled out his features it seemed to make him less funny. Ollie not so much he looked more like the 'old' Ollie than Stan looked like the 'old' Stan if you get my meaning.Parting from the Roach Studio format was also apparent. There was more of an emphasis on a story that included other players so it took the Boys out of the action from time to time. The main plot seemed a little troubling to me an elderly Prince Saul Philip Merivale was in league with a colleague named Ronetz John Warburton to poison the preteen King of Orlandia David Leland apparently in order to affect the line of succession. Obviously with Laurel and Hardy on the case this wasn't going to happen but it does seem a grisly topic for one of their stories.Though the backdrop of World War II is never mentioned by name one can't miss the reference to using ration cards at the market a staple of the era. I wonder what modern day viewers think of that if they've never learned what rationing was all about. For their trouble though the slab of horse meat Stan and Ollie swiped from the hungry lion proved disastrous as a dinner menu item at the Hawley's. But it did lead to that funny scene with the twoman saw trying to carve it up for eating.The young actor portraying King Christopher looked familiar however it was shocking to look up his credits page on IMDb and learn that David Leland died at the age of sixteen some four years after this picture was made. He looked like he might have had a successful career moving forward so there's that unhappy element on which to close this review. For his part Leland's character was presented as a typical royal who preferred to be a commoner and he had a finely tuned rapport with Stan and Ollie.".

	schema:headline " Slightly funny but sad Laurel and Hardy movie";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1932 when jobs were as hard to find as a girdle on a welder so the narration says Laurel and Hardy went to Europe to find work. They return years later during World War II when jobs were as easy to find as a girdle on a welder. They return to the same agency where they had previously been unable to find a job to find potential employers now in line where potential employers were. In a scene that could have been expanded for some funny bits with the society matrons desperate to have a chef and butler they meet desperate Mary Boland who immediately takes them home and spoils them with the determination to keep him. My last butler stayed with me for 3 years. He writes me every know and then from an island called Alcatraz she says. They go to get groceries to prepare Oliver's Steak a la Hardy and meet up with a young teenaged boy hiding his identity as an exiled king David Leland who has a desire to play football. After playing referees to the football team he joins up with for one game interrupted briefly by mother a credited Connie Gilchrist on and off faster than the unbilled boys in the game then try to steal steak actually horse meat! from a zoo lion. Leo earning his keep perhaps? The steak is so tough it can't be cut by anything but perhaps an axe ruining Boland's dinner. Then the hiding king is discovered and Boland dismisses Stan and Oliver which lands them in a mission. The boy King is identified and in danger of a plot on his life but Laurel and Hardy are then hired as his butler and cook much to his delight for a huge party that ironically Ms. Boland and her husband Henry O'Neill attend. Laurel and Hardy are brought into the plot on the King's life and it's rather predictable what happens from there.While there are some amusing moments in this late Laurel and Hardy film it is not really all that funny yet much better than Air Raid Wardens The Bullfighters and Utopia. Not saying muchthose three are duds! I always enjoy Mary Boland especially her unique voice I can't help thinking of her line in The Women where she says to Paulette Goddard Let's have a little drinkie shall we? every time I see her. She's not quite a Billie Burke nor is she Marie Dressler Dame May Witty or Florence Bates either. Her society matrons are always fun I could imagine her in a 40's version of Gilligan's Island as Mrs. Howell. In fact she did several films with similar themes Down to Their Last Yacht and Four Frightened People I also enjoyed the performance of David Leland as the very charming boy King I was shocked to discover he died only a few years after this. But in a Laurel and Hardy film they dominate the film. They were likable at any age but its very sad to see them doing these types of gags while obviously having aged very much. They appear tired yet determined like all old troopers to keep going. Don't expect much when watching this but it's mercifully short under 70 minutes so it can be viewed as a barely passable time filler.".

Once again I had heard this was a pretty bad film but while it's miles from Hal Roach material the film contains a few laughs and has a little charm to it. It's too bad Warner isn't including this in their upcoming set but my recording from TCM which seemed to be remastered will do just fine. The best moment takes place in a zoo where LH must try and steal a streak away from a lion. Another nice moment is when Laurel is trying to ref a football game. Most of the gags are lazy and fall on their face but the film is a decent time killer.".

And while it is not an unpleasant movie it is so unlike their earlier films and so unlike the traditional formula that it is a very sad movie to watch. Dunderheads at 20th Century Fox and MGM insisted on messing with the Hal Roach approach to filming the guys and the result just aren't very funny or engaging in their postHal Roach Studio films. In this film you see two tired sickly and unfunny old men instead of comic geniuses. For most fans of the duo they would have preferred the boys just retired after Saps at Sea as it was all WAY downhill from there. It's just sadvery very painful and sad to watch Stan and Ollie playing nursemaid to a runaway Prince. Plus with not a single effective gag it's pretty tedious and ineffectual as a comedy. Fortunately their next film THE BULLFIGHTERS was a bit better.By the way this isn't the team's worst 1940s outingthat would definitely be THE BIG NOISE. However NOTHING BUT TROUBLE certainly is pretty close as is THE DANCING MASTERS. MGM should have been ashamed of themselves for this turkey.".

There's also a plot to murder the boy ha ha ha.This is mostly quite a painfully unfunny film save for one or two quickly forgettable moments and the worst reason it rates low for me is because it's way too wholesome and sweetened with Stan and Ollie's characters really speaking and acting nothing like their classic screen persona's as they try to be guardians to the young King. The worst case here is poor Stan Laurel who comes off normal and not at all like his typical dimwitted or childlike character throughout most of this movie. Also hurting this comedy is that too much time is spent on the boy instead of the comedians. Fans are always talking about how bad Laurel  Hardy's 1940's movies are and having seen them all now I can disagree strongly in favor of the 6 Fox films and maybe even MGM's AIR RAID WARDENS. But there's no doubt for me that NOTHING BUT TROUBLE is pretty bad and it takes the crown as what I'd call worst Laurel and Hardy film.

	schema:reviewBody "Is The Avengers a good film? No. Is it the worst film ever made? No. I first saw the movie at the cinema upon its release and at that time I did think that it was one of the worst films I'd seen up to that point. I've watched it 2 or 3 times since then and my opinion of it has improved well very slightly at any rate. Apart from a pervading incoherence I think the film's major problem is its slightness it's only an hour and a half long and the plot is very simplistic to say the least. It's not hard to imagine audiences feeling a bit shortchanged when it first came out especially as the film was a bigbudget wouldbe summer blockbuster. Another big problem is the casting of Uma Thurman as Emma Peel. Thurman has shown herself to be a fine actress in movies such as Pulp Fiction but she just looks out of her depth here I never believed in her as a toplevel scientist for a second and her English accent doesn't sound natural. Nicole Kidman to whom the role was first offered would surely have been better in particular she's displayed flawless English accents in films such as The Others and The Hours. An English actress I also think would have made a great Peel is Joely Richardson but the studio would probably have vetoed such a choice on the grounds of her not being a big enough name. Ralph Fiennes was a real enigma in this film  there was nothing wrong in principle in casting him as Steed but he looks ill at ease throughout the movie as if he'd rather be elsewhere. I can only assume he'd already twigged that the film was going to be a turkey. What's worse Fiennes and Thurman have absolutely no chemistry between them which wastes the snappy dialogue they have with each other throughout the film. The supporting cast fare a bit better with seasoned pros such as Sean Connery Jim Broadbent and Fiona Shaw making the most of their underdeveloped parts. The retrochic world of the original TV series is nicely recreated and there's no shortage of nice cars costumes and locations but what's good about the film is easily drowned out by what's bad The Avengers is ultimately a shallow rushed and messy affair severely hampered by the performances of its two leads. Handled properly the film could have been a wonderful success for all concerned the first chapter of an entertaining and lucrative franchise stretching well beyond the 1990s instead it's one of the most embarrassing flops of that decade. The original cut of the film was apparently two and a half hours long but following negative reactions from audiences at test screenings the studio hacked the film down to its present one and a half hour length. This doesn't actually come as much of a surprise as there is a lack of proper narrative flow to the film suggestive of chunks of explanatory scenes having been cut out. Just one example towards the end of the film just before they enter Sir August's underwater lair Steed and Peel enter a phone box and Peel says how now brown cow? down the phone. The phrase seems to be a password to enter the premises but how does Peel know it? There's been talk here and there of the possibility of Warners releasing a director's cut or special edition DVD restoring the original two and a half hour version. I think this would be a good idea and I'd definitely be interested in watching the full version of the film. It's highly unlikely to be any kind of masterpiece but it's difficult to imagine that it wouldn't improve upon the movie as it stands. At the very least you'd have to assume that it would be more coherent. Sadly I don't think the chances of Warners going down this line are high I have the feeling that this is a movie the studio would rather forget about than draw attention to.".

	schema:reviewBody "Warner Bros. fantasies have always had a certain memorable flare. Dating back to films like Superman and Blade Runner a viewer could always be guaranteed at least a ticket into another world. The  Avengers would have been that next big thing for Warner Bros. had it not been so shoddily edited at the last minute. It should be duly noted however that this film had all the signs of a thanksgiving turkey It's release date which was moved from late June to the dog days of August. Then the fact that no press screenings have been allowed for critics. No good can come of these prophecies.The Avengers which at best is a second rate version of the original Batman has all the features of your top blockbuster A Big name or two a plethora of explosions and enough specialeffects to put Godzilla to shame. The Plot follows the exploits of the legendary secret agents John Steed Ralph Fiennes and Emma Peel Uma Thurman as they do battle with a maniacal meteorologist Sean Connery who has intentions on controlling the world's weather. Simple enough. Or so one would have thought. It would appear that some 25 minutes ! was excised from the film as a result of poor test screenings. As history has told no good comes from test screenings. As a result the film becomes so utterly confusing that the viewer would sooner give up rather than be insulted by a film that insists on staying one step ahead of you at all times. Only potentially good films are butchered in an attempt to make the film more appealing to youngster's attention spans. But make no mistake about it this film is certainly not for children. Perhaps the last half hour will provide enough enjoyable action and it does believe me! to distract them but up until then the film consists of awkward dialogue inane action Gigantic teddy bears anyone? and an uncomfortable overdose of strangeness.The cast at one time might have been game but only once in a while does Ralph Fiennes even crack a smile. Thurman has apparently got the English accent down perfectly but the only problem lies in the fact that she forgets to give a performance worth remembering. And last but certainly not least Sean Connery. Sadly he doesn't even look like he wants to take over the world. Only once in a mumbled rant does he evoke some feelings of evil. That being said The Avengers is a technical masterpiece. Providing the viewer with a universe of dazzling sets that should at least be nominated for an oscar imaginative visual effects and beautiful costumes one almost forgets that England doesn't look like this anymore. Unless of course you live there. The score composed by Joel McNeely proves to be one of the coolest scores ever produced. Inducing excitement tension and a little smoothness provided by some nifty jazz notes. All of which the film is unable to do itself. For those who won't enjoy this film it is mercifully brief. So brief to the point that it's strange. It jumps from a one hour section of the beginning to a half hour of climactic action that the viewer blinks and the movie might just be rolling into the credits. One can only hope for an improvement with a director's cut. Until then this film should gain cult status before it makes it's way to video. Which I'm sure will be soon.Out Of Four  ".

Simple enough. Or so one would have thought. It would appear that some 25 minutes ! was excised from the film as a result of poor test screenings. As history has told no good comes from test screenings. As a result the film becomes so utterly confusing that the viewer would sooner give up rather than be insulted by a film that insists on staying one step ahead of you at all times. Only potentially good films are butchered in an attempt to make the film more appealing to youngster's attention spans. But make no mistake about it this film is certainly not for children. Perhaps the last half hour will provide enough enjoyable action and it does believe me! to distract them but up until then the film consists of awkward dialogue inane action Gigantic teddy bears anyone? and an uncomfortable overdose of strangeness.The cast at one time might have been game but only once in a while does Ralph Fiennes even crack a smile. Thurman has apparently got the English accent down perfectly but the only problem lies in the fact that she forgets to give a performance worth remembering. And last but certainly not least Sean Connery. Sadly he doesn't even look like he wants to take over the world. Only once in a mumbled rant does he evoke some feelings of evil. That being said The Avengers is a technical masterpiece. Providing the viewer with a universe of dazzling sets that should at least be nominated for an oscar imaginative visual effects and beautiful costumes one almost forgets that England doesn't look like this anymore. Unless of course you live there. The score composed by Joel McNeely proves to be one of the coolest scores ever produced. Inducing excitement tension and a little smoothness provided by some nifty jazz notes. All of which the film is unable to do itself. For those who won't enjoy this film it is mercifully brief. So brief to the point that it's strange. It jumps from a one hour section of the beginning to a half hour of climactic action that the viewer blinks and the movie might just be rolling into the credits. One can only hope for an improvement with a director's cut. Until then this film should gain cult status before it makes it's way to video. Which I'm sure will be soon.Out Of Four  ";

	schema:reviewBody "John Steed is an agent for the Ministry he is trained to perfection and one of the best despite his belief that the enemies of the past are no longer relevant. When a research laboratory into a weatherbased defence system is blown up the main suspect is one Dr Emma Peel although Dr Peel is adamant that she is innocent. With her being their only lead into the bomb the Ministry assign Steed to work alongside her and use her to get to the bottom of the mystery  well after tea anyway.At the time of release I decided to give this film a miss as I felt I had heard too much of the critics having a field day to really be able to view it with a clear eye. Years later though I decided to give it a go on the basis that each year will see a blockbuster getting a kicking from all critics  sometimes deserved but at other time it is just a poor film that critics jump on it. However by the time I had reached the point where Sean Connery reveals his plan to a bunch of partners dressed as dayglow teddy bears I realised that things were not going to go well. Up till this point I had felt that the film was developing a nice little sense of humour that spoofs the idea of the typically English gentleman spy however tongueincheek humour is hard to do right and it is very easy to turn the film into a very silly affair that is not so much funny as it is embarrassing.And so it was with The Avengers a film that has some reasonable moments but is generally an unengaging and rather silly mess that can only be enjoyed as such. The problem is this is a very expensive film for one that is just meant to be silly and it really needed to be fun exciting and enjoyable as well not just feature some silly points. For me the bear costumes were silly but enjoyable it is such a weird sight that it stayed with me but the majority of the rest of the film were just plain silly. The weather plot was poorly done and it never engaged me once.The cast look good on paper but they are lost in the material and can do little with it. Of course in the case of Connery it may have helped a little bit if he'd even tried but he is poor throughout and just looks like a man getting paid. Fiennes is well cast and he is very English it would have been a good performance had the rest of the film got the tone even half right. Thurman is not an actress I really rate and she has turned in too many average performances recently and here is no exception. Fans may appreciate her squeezed into tight costumes but for me that doesn't come close to covering a very poor performance where she gets it all wrong. Support from Broadbent Izzard and Macnee sounds like a good prospect but really they have nothing to do and are pretty pointless in reality.Overall this is not a laughingly terrible film it is just lacking in any real consistent value. Some bits are amusing but mostly it is all misjudged with the humour being too silly to work and damaging any dramatic value the film may have had. The actors are mostly poor thanks to the material and an apparent uncertainty about what they are meant to be doing. It isn't the child of Satan or anything but I would be hard pressed to give you one reason why you should watch this.".

Incredibly stylish amazing sets great acting and as lighthearted and witty as the original TV series.The two leads are excellent and contrary to what has been claimed do indeed have a wonderful chemistry between them. I would argue that Ralph Fiennes is incapable of giving a bad performance and Uma Thurman is rather wonderful too. Their dialogue is very well written with quips aplenty. Sean Connery is hilarious and obviously relished his role as the baddie and Jim Broadbent is equally amusing. The plot is wafer thin and zips along splendidly. I wasn't aware until I read other comments here that the film was butchered by studio executives. If that is indeed the case I add my vote for a Director's Cut. 90 minutes was definitely too short.The initial failure of this film at the box office was undoubtedly due to its subtlety. Understatement and tongueincheek humour have never been a premium on the other side of the pond and I imagine that in Blighty the TV series is seen through such thick lensed rosecoloured spectacles that any movie version was bound to be heretical.Which is funny  granted that Diana Rigg played the sexiest TV character in history and that Patrick McNee was perfect as John Steed but anyone who actually watches these old episodes will be aware of their surrealness and complete inability to take themselves seriously hats off to the writers. These are exactly the elements that the movie version captures so well. Hats off to Mr Chechik the director and Canadian  significant? After so many turgid and gloomy blockbusters Bourne trilogy new Bond  entertaining but not exactly a barrel of laughs it was fantastic to discover this lost classic. Watch it!".

But I was thrilled to find the film had the same wonderful sense of absurdity as the show. I think a lot of people are unaware this is a complete comedy.  This being the case it's not surprising people think it's bad but that's their problem.  The comedy style is not a popular one it's a particular style of generally British humour best described as complete and utter nonsense.  If you have no appreciation for absurdity then you will NOT like this film.Nothing in The Avengers should be taken at face value it's all a load of s.  Steed and Peel are full of s that's the point.  No one acts the way they do they are both constantly trying to out cocky each other.  The world of The Avengers is a place where small things are taken with the utmost seriousness and important things are not taken seriously at all.The Avengers purposely doesn't explain things it's not supposed to make sense that would ruin it.  It's the little things in The Avengers that make it shine.  Small asides from leftfield that seem to go over most peoples heads.Fiennes and Thurman are different than Macnee and Rigg but I'm not sure they're much worse.  Fiennes could perhaps have been a bit more cheerful. Thurmans whole screen presence is so vastly different from Riggs that it's impossible to compare but I did enjoy Thurmans version of the infalable Peel.  Connery going nuts was fun to see too.  BTW Eddie Izzard not talking was the point of him being there get it.  Having Eddie Izzard in your movie and not having him say anything is to my mind very funny.It's very hard to explain to people who flock to films like The Waterboy why a film like The Avengers is so funny.  Most people I guess will just never get it.  I got it and I'm glad that there ARE plenty of other people who did too.

	schema:reviewBody "I know this has been universally slated by the critics but that was bound to happen when they got prevented from seeing it before hoi poloi. Their noses got put out of joint and even Schindler's List would have got a panning under those circumstances. Not that the professionals have an exaggerated sense off their own worth unlike us enthusiastic amateurs hem hem.. Even so this is not a good film but it really ain't as bad as all that. Sure Uma Thurman is capable of greater things. Yes Ralph Fiennes looks like a little lad playing at grownups in his dad's clothes. Yep it is all a bit heavy handed and lacks a lot of the charm of the television series and the entire team makes the mistake of confusing archness with campness . Certainly they fell into the trap of overdoing the pyrotechnics which the original TV series pointedly eschewed. And yet and yet.......... I was about 11 when the TV series first hit the small screen and about 14 in its Swinging London heyday. I loved it. And to be fair they have captured quite a lot of the spirit of the original.

Their noses got put out of joint and even Schindler's List would have got a panning under those circumstances. Not that the professionals have an exaggerated sense off their own worth unlike us enthusiastic amateurs hem hem.. Even so this is not a good film but it really ain't as bad as all that. Sure Uma Thurman is capable of greater things. Yes Ralph Fiennes looks like a little lad playing at grownups in his dad's clothes. Yep it is all a bit heavy handed and lacks a lot of the charm of the television series and the entire team makes the mistake of confusing archness with campness . Certainly they fell into the trap of overdoing the pyrotechnics which the original TV series pointedly eschewed. And yet and yet.......... I was about 11 when the TV series first hit the small screen and about 14 in its Swinging London heyday. I loved it. And to be fair they have captured quite a lot of the spirit of the original.

	schema:reviewBody "As it turns out the one group of diabolical masterminds that The Avengers' can't outwit is film editors.  Still despite its welldocumented flaws this movie doesn't quite deserve the peasantswithpitchforksandtorches reception that it got from fans of the 1960s British TV series.  For those who come to it with no expectations well your expectations won't necessarily be exceeded but there are some fun bits. The movie version is as mindless as typical Hollywood summer action fare but no worse.  First the good news screenwriter Don MacPherson does draw on a wealth of wacky plot points from the series like that show the movie does have stylish fashions and sets it doesn't take itself too seriously.  But the heart of the show was the rapport between Patrick Macnee playing suave agent John Steed and his various leading ladies. In Cathy Gale the brisk buxom Honor Blackman created a leatherclad woman warrior who was still a feeling person. With her fashionmodel figure and classical theater background Diana Rigg made Emma Peel the ultimate in intelligence and charm. Voluptuous Linda Thorson was perhaps too young but she brought a combination of physicality and bubbliness to Tara King.  Macnee provided graceful support to these three very different actresses and the show arguably reached its height during the blackandwhite Diana Rigg season. While Rigg made an arch androgynous Emma Peel her chemistry with Macnee produced role models for femalemale relations.  It's a difficult formula to emulate and there may have been worse choices that Ralph Fiennes as the movie Steed. The Rock comes to mind. But while Fiennes is attractive and seems kindly offscreen onscreen he generates all the warmth and charm of weekold bath water.  And while Macnee did as few stunts as possible  as even a cursory glance at a TV episode clearly shows  he at least looked formidable. Fiennes looks like a gust of wind would blow him away  unfortunate considering the film's weatherrelated plot.  In contrast the athletic Uma Thurman creates her own special effect as Emma Peel. Her dangerous curves seem to defy the laws of physics filling catsuits in ways that the underendowed Diana Rigg couldn't imagine much less match.  And Thurman's Emma starts out well with her early scenes providing much of Rigg's breezy playfulness. Alas the more time she spends with Fiennes the more she mimics his mumbling diffident performance. As the scenes jump around almost at random Thurman's version of Emma becomes equally fractured.  Sean Connery gives a onenote performance and one wishes that only dogs could hear him. Of course the choppy editing doesn't give him a chance at grace notes. The megalomaniacs on TV episodes were often eccentrics in a script filled with eccentrics with highly personal grievances and plots.  The movie lacks those charming supporting characters and in this underpopulated movie Connery is the obvious bad guy right from the start. Still even if the cast is adrift there is some genuine feeling between the Steed and Peel characters. It's a pale copy of the MacneeRigg pairing but one suspects there was a better movie here that got derailed on the Hollywood assembly line.".

	onyx:emotionText "As it turns out the one group of diabolical masterminds that The Avengers' can't outwit is film editors.  Still despite its welldocumented flaws this movie doesn't quite deserve the peasantswithpitchforksandtorches reception that it got from fans of the 1960s British TV series.  For those who come to it with no expectations well your expectations won't necessarily be exceeded but there are some fun bits. The movie version is as mindless as typical Hollywood summer action fare but no worse.  First the good news screenwriter Don MacPherson does draw on a wealth of wacky plot points from the series like that show the movie does have stylish fashions and sets it doesn't take itself too seriously.  But the heart of the show was the rapport between Patrick Macnee playing suave agent John Steed and his various leading ladies. In Cathy Gale the brisk buxom Honor Blackman created a leatherclad woman warrior who was still a feeling person. With her fashionmodel figure and classical theater background Diana Rigg made Emma Peel the ultimate in intelligence and charm. Voluptuous Linda Thorson was perhaps too young but she brought a combination of physicality and bubbliness to Tara King.  Macnee provided graceful support to these three very different actresses and the show arguably reached its height during the blackandwhite Diana Rigg season. While Rigg made an arch androgynous Emma Peel her chemistry with Macnee produced role models for femalemale relations.  It's a difficult formula to emulate and there may have been worse choices that Ralph Fiennes as the movie Steed. The Rock comes to mind. But while Fiennes is attractive and seems kindly offscreen onscreen he generates all the warmth and charm of weekold bath water.  And while Macnee did as few stunts as possible  as even a cursory glance at a TV episode clearly shows  he at least looked formidable.

	schema:reviewBody "January 1968 31 members of North Korean Special Unit 124 infiltrated South Korea with the ultimate mission of attacking the Blue House Presidential Palace in Korea and assassinating President PARK Chunghee. When KIM Shinjo the only member who was captured alive was asked 'What was the purpose of infiltration?' on a live TV program he shouted 'I came to slit the throat of President PARK Chunghee!' and made the whole country's blood run cold. At the same time Inchan escapes the death penalty for being an accessory to a crime when he accepts an unexpected proposal from Jaehyun  a general at Silmido H.I.D. Project and is transported to Silmido Special Unit. Silmido Special Unit is a unit composed of dysfunctional social outcasts and criminals under the death or life sentences. Sangpil and Wonhee are also among the members of this unit. When they arrive at the island Jaehyun gives them the classified national duty which is to explode the North Korean presidential palace and behead KIM Ilsung the North Korean president. It is a retaliatory project. To its all 31 members it is the ultimate patriotic mission with pride and loyalty and it is the only chance they have to start a new life that is promised once the mission is successfully accomplished. With their hopes and promising vision they survive through the most hellish inhumane 'killing' training and are reborn as human armories. They are the human killing machines with strong comradeship and respect for each other. Finally the day arrives and they receive an order from the head office to carry out the mission. With their supreme confidence they depart for the North. However the project is suddenly revoked and they return to Silmido with much discouragement and stress. After then the hellish training continues but there is no more mission. The psychological frustration and physical tolerance start to reach their limits. And soon the members start to lose their focus and unity. In order to regain complete control of the unit the head office performs public executions of its own members. Meanwhile in 1970 with growing nationwide peacemaking movement between the North and the South the government quickly decides to demolish Silmido Special Unit and executes all its members...".

I think this is what the film here paints.The film depicts a group of prisoners who are on death row and just when they are about to be executed an assassination attempt occurs but fails miserably on Park Chung Hee. So the government gathers these groups of death row prisoners and trains them up so they go into North Korea to execute Kim Il Sung. However as the political climate changes so does the mission and you'll see why this is a sad filmI really wished he had....... I won't mention it because it is a spoiler!".

The men form strong bonds with each other and their guards read captors Their bonds are not based on friendship as in most Hollywood movies but on loyalty which is also the salute mantra of all the soldiers on the island. It is the theme of loyalty that pervades the movie....loyalty to each other to your country and what you get in return for that loyalty. There are some truly incredible moments in this film  including an extended action sequence that instead of going for gymnastic pyrotechnics focuses on the human interaction between the characters who have been forced to act in certain ways based on where their loyalties lie. Look out for Sergeant Jo my favourite character from the film who for most of the movie plays the typical hardassed drill Sergeant. His performance alone would be enough to make this movie great but all acting in the movie is excellent. See it.".

	schema:headline " South Korean incident from late 1960s is heroic movie material";
	schema:reviewBody "Apparently based on actual incidents this epic film ought to have been just a straightforward Dirty Dozen action film with a sketchy plot loads of violence and bootcamp brutality displays of macho camaraderie and a schmaltzy message about dying for your mates and country Silmido is all of that on one level yet turns out to be more. Perhaps its Korean setting and the very contemporary nature of the politics invoked  the Korean War technically hasn't finished  help shove the film into a realm audiences inside and outside the country can relate to but I'm not sure that explains the feeling I have that Silmido would affect a lot of people who have no knowledge of the country's history in a very personal way.The plot is easy to follow in the late 1960s after some North Korean agents have been captured and executed by South Korean military forces after confessing that they were on a mission to kill President Park Chunghee the South Koreans themselves toy with the idea of sending men on a similar mission to kill North Korean leader Kim Ilsung. Under orders from the government the army sends over 30 hardened criminals on death row and other outcasts to Silmido island to undergo a brutal training regime that will transform them into elite assassin force Unit 684. For much of the film viewers are treated to harrowing if wellstaged scenes of unrelenting Spartan training and often sadistic torture the proceedings can be hard to watch sometimes and the film's pace never lets up. When the men have been disciplined and honed into an efficient fighting force the government orders change and the army is now faced with a fanatical killing machine it does not know what to do with.The plot is mostly predictable men who can't handle the training drop out and there's a token death the army leaders and soldiers who train the wouldbe assassins are suitably granitefaced and apply the requisite beatings and excessive machinegun fire punishments. There's room for slapstick humour in one scene where a man runs into a river before his minder even has a chance to brand him with a hot poker! The music soundtrack is stirring and heroic to excess and there is plenty of Koreanstyle OTT melodrama compared to other east Asians Koreans have a reputation for being highly emotional and intense people and Silmido milks the emotional potential inherent in scenes between individual characters who have personal crosses to bear and old scores to settle.Where the film really lifts its game is in what goes on between the army and the government represented by stock character stereotypes outside Silmido island the general political situation changes South Korea decides it's better to coexist with and even do deals with Kim Ilsung and senior bureaucrats and politicians waive away the creation of Unit 684 as though the 31 remaining men in the unit are just so many flies to be swatted away. The hoplites' loyalty to their country and fighting zeal count for nothing but their very testoteronecharged fanaticism the bonds of loyalty among themselves and to their superiors and their readiness to face death so that they can truly feel alive now make them a serious threat to South Korea's security. At this point in the film nonKorean viewers realise there are two ways to go the plot could just let the men go off to North Korea with the army and government cynically figuring that the North Koreans can handle them their own way or the men could selfdestruct. As Koreans know already the men do selfdestruct but the ways in which they do it turn out quite unpredictably. Their demise is at once heroic and pathetic and the film's coda is quietly powerful and depressing in a way that only skillful and clever Korean filmmaking can make it.The incidents of Silmido are particular to Korean history so much so that I don't expect Koreans born after the period of military rule which ended more or less about the late 1980s or early 1990s to know those events but the film's themes of political expediency bureaucratic indifference the cynical exploitation of loyalty camaraderie and patriotism a government's inability to consider the consequences of creating a killing machine with only one shortterm purpose in mind and the psychological effects that intense military training might have on people are surely issues that will resonate with viewers beyond Korea. Above all there is something exhilarating about men who in training to face certain death discover purpose and new life and you can't help but feel that in spite of their brutal training and psychological transformation they experience a kind of freedom and become supermen far beyond the confines of the society that originally produced them.".

	schema:reviewBody "For a movie that was the most seen in its native South Korea for most of 2004 it was a huge disappointment. Shows that Hollywood is not the only place where people can make overemotional melodramatic movies. The film was over 130 minutes long but not a lot actually happened and everything that happened was pretty much what one expected the plot was that transparent. Granted if one himself was Korean one would perhaps get into it more but for me it didn't do much anything. Suffice to say that as the case tends to be with Korean cinema the plot revolves around the relationship between the northern and southern parts of the peninsula. South Korea decides to recruit and train an elite assassination squad from deathsentence prisoners to kill Kim IlSung.A tedious plot doesn't bother me much if the characters are good but unfortunately that is not the case this time around either. They are stereotypes and most of the acting is mediocre and too often just over the top as it tends to be in Korean cinema. Too much time is spent on the numerous montages and the characters remain distant one dimensional cardboard cuts. They should've spent more time establishing the characters and less showing us how tough and cruel the training and the soldiers are.One thing it does remind us of is that a lesser of two wrongs is still wrong.".

It was told it Flopped in India because of religion If you see the film you will understand. Salman wears a Islamic Chain and a Hindu Chain together there is a reason why he does this doesn't mean you give the film a Flop some critics will never learn. Although it was a LITTLE borrowed from Hollywood films Bourne Supremacy and Long Kiss Goodnight. This bollywood version is FAR BETTER in every way. I'm not gonna say what the film is about its Best if you see it yourself. The storyline may sound boring but its not This is a Movie Genius Review. Salman Khan delivers one of the Best performances of his life. The Very Sexy Sushmita Sen gives a good performance. Diya Mirza looks sexy as ever kind of a Aishwarya look alike. Great Twist and some nice songs. Forget some of the critics with no taste giving this a flop I recommend this.".

The title quite suggests a movie that is something on the lines of a romantic drama or something of this sort. But the film is not. It does have its romance and drama like every other Hindi movie but more than anything it's an action thriller. The storyline is quite interesting and it's extremely twisted and unpredictable. But the movie itself does not really offer anything incredibly special and is overall a rather ordinary product which on top of that is unoriginal. That's the case with most Hindi movies of its sort and sadly so. The film has a stronger second half but in the end it does not make that great an impact. Salman Khan plays the leading role and he does quite well. His role requires him to look confused and he manages to look successfully awkward. Diya Mirza is pretty and likable. Sushmita Sen is okay in a relatively small role. Sharat Saxena is fine as the loving father. One song that Ireally liked is Yeh Bekhudi which is beautifully sung by Sonu Nigam and very well pictured on screen. Tumko Na Bhool Paayenge is a surprising but not particularly impressive film but still it can be seen once.".

Although the movie is not AS bad as its boxoffice fairing would say but its hardly any great shakes either.TNBP can be broken down in two parts 1 The first half shows Salman's dull life with his parents in a village where he visualizes weird things abt his past every now and then. 2 In the 2nd half u see Salman out in search to piece together who he used to be as he slowly gains his memory back.The pros to me were definitely the well directed action scenes that mostly involved Salman Khan  whose at his best when he's beating up the gundas here. Other positives were a couple of twists in the story that def. caught me by surprise and kept me interested till the very end. One thing is for sure once the initial twist occurs b4 the intermission TNBP will keep u glued to the screen till the end. ConsMost of the first half is just plain boring cuz nothing happens other then some lame jokes and actors looking bad while trying to speak in their village's accent. The cinematography has a dry feel to it throughout which makes the mood of the film appear quite dull. U can obviously tell not a lot of money was spent on this movie. The songs only happen to be unnecessary stop gaps.Other then that i would say TNBP is a decent movie that's worth a watch once for Salman's presence and some interesting twists in the storyline.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is an attempt at...well it's an attempt at something I just can't figure out what that is.  Maybe the director set out to make a movie about a man trying to reconstruct his past  a la Memento but he ended up making just another derivative Salman Khan movie.  The plot if you care is about a guy who can't remember his past and so like any Indian hero leaves his family in search of his true identity... The first hour has Salman trying to act.  The second hour has Salman breaking necks.  And the third hour has Salman breaking necks while trying to act.  This movie is inspired by the Hollywood film The Long Kiss Goodnight which wasn't much of a movie to begin with.  Performance wise Sushmita Sen is the best which should give you an idea of the quality of the acting.  Salman continues to show his disinterest for his profession  he never misses a chance to take off his shirt and display his deteriorating physique.  Diya Mirza still can't act whereas the guy who plays Inder is just a waste of space. The action sequences are just a cutandpaste exercise and the story is interesting for about half an hour before it gets predicatble and slowly gets to its climax.  If you'ld like to waste three hours of your time  think Kabhie Khushi Kabhie Ghum  then you're in for a real treat. Otherwise rent something else.".

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is an attempt at...well it's an attempt at something I just can't figure out what that is.  Maybe the director set out to make a movie about a man trying to reconstruct his past  a la Memento but he ended up making just another derivative Salman Khan movie.  The plot if you care is about a guy who can't remember his past and so like any Indian hero leaves his family in search of his true identity... The first hour has Salman trying to act.  The second hour has Salman breaking necks.  And the third hour has Salman breaking necks while trying to act.  This movie is inspired by the Hollywood film The Long Kiss Goodnight which wasn't much of a movie to begin with.  Performance wise Sushmita Sen is the best which should give you an idea of the quality of the acting.  Salman continues to show his disinterest for his profession  he never misses a chance to take off his shirt and display his deteriorating physique.  Diya Mirza still can't act whereas the guy who plays Inder is just a waste of space. The action sequences are just a cutandpaste exercise and the story is interesting for about half an hour before it gets predicatble and slowly gets to its climax.  If you'ld like to waste three hours of your time  think Kabhie Khushi Kabhie Ghum  then you're in for a real treat. Otherwise rent something else.";

This is a review of the 140 minute version. The past twenty years or so have turned Inchon into one of the film industry's great jokes. Its huge budget and the meagre box office returns it made have also destined it to forever be remembered as the biggest flop of alltime. If ever a film deserved to be labelled as infamous then Inchon is it. Laurence Olivier topbills as Gen. Douglas MacArthur. Highly decorated for his WWII heroics MacArthur is called upon to repel an army of communist forces from North Korea who have invaded their South Korean neighbours in 1950. Against the will of his colleagues MacArthur masterminds an ambitious landing at the awkwardlysituated port of Inchon. Interwoven into this invasion story are several subplots including the story of Barbara Hallsworth Jacqueline Bisset an American lady who leads a group of orphans to safety and her husband Maj. Frank Hallsworth Ben Gazzara who is ordered to seize and hold a strategically important lighthouse in Inchon harbour. It is extraordinary that a budget of over 45 million was allocated to such a badly scripted film. The dialogue is utterly laughable almost in the style of an exceptionally bad cheesy TV miniseries. Left helpless in the firing line by the terrible script the actors many of them greatly talented give undisciplined performances. Olivier's turn as MacArthur for example is surreal in its awfulness. The battle scenes are done on a big scale but fail to convey authenticity or realism. And worst of all there's a peculiar religious subtext as MacArthur repeatedly rants on about the Godgiven justness he senses in the cause of America and her allies. The film has curiosity value it's perversely interesting to see so many stars in such deep trouble but beyond that it offers nothing worth your time.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am one of the few people on this Earth who actually saw Inchon during its brief theatrical run in 1982 and did not see it again until a cable recording came my way very recently. It was fascinating to revisit this train wreck of a movie that took what should have been a fascinating event in history and instead with a bloated budget of 40 million and the interference of the Moonies turned it into something that ultimately isn't the worst thing ever produced for the screen but at the same time is something that could have been made cheaply for TV at a fraction of the cost.The thing Inchon most resembles is the godawful 1979 ABC miniseries Pearl which took the events of another famous event in history and gave us a soapy silly melodrama about a bunch of boring fictional characters. In Inchon the goings on of Ben Gazzara Jacqueline Bisset who looks stunning Richard Roundtree and the wasted David Janssen could just as easily have been at home in some made for TV potboiler that utilized stock footage for the big moments. It's because Inchon had an Alevel budget and an inordinance of expensive set design and extras etc. that in the end made its flaws magnified in ways that a cheap TV miniseries like Pearl could keep obscured.The acting...sheesh Olivier does get the look of MacArthur right but Terence Young was clearly asleep when giving him instruction on how to deliver his lines and the script he was given didn't help matters either. As for the rest they're okay in a TV movie kind of way but that's largely damning with faint praise. Jerry Goldsmith's score is great as is the cinemtaography.I will say one thing though to a couple reviewers though who think the greatest sin of this movie is its anticommunism. That is really about the ONLY thing you can give this movie a plus for because the North Koreans of Kim Il Sung were a brutal thug regime and their invasion of the South was not a case of as one reviewer falsely implied one where atrocities were equally committed by both sides. The prologue to the movie that summarizes how Kim Il Sung flew to Moscow to receive permission from Stalin to go ahead with the invasion is dead accurate in its description of the real history and it sadly offers the initial hope that we're going to get a movie more in the mold of The Longest Day or Tora! Tora! Tora!. Instead we got a movie that was as noted in the mold of Pearl and almost exclusively utilizing the bad fictional subplots that nearly wrecked Midway. So yes Inchon is bad but not necessarily for the reasons that some people would like to have us think. It was ultimately more the fault of the scriptwriters the actors and the director that Inchon turned out to be as bad as it was than the heavyhand of the Moonie cult though their PR for the movie certainly dragged it down further.".

Laurence Olivier is a highly esteemed wellestablished actor with many film accreditations under his belt from a career in the film industry that has spanned well over six decades. Why he chose to sign on to this monstrosity of a film is just beyond belief.INCHON had the misfortune of being released in 1981 the first year the infamous Golden Raspberry Award a.k.a. Razzie came into existence and it grandly swept nearly every category including Worst Picture and Worst Actor.Upon it's theatrical release INCHON was heavily panned by the critics and played in theaters to which no one bothered showing up. It was pulled almost a few weeks after its initial release. The production and creativity involved with this highlyexpensive film project involved nearly 5 whole years in the making a crew of 250 technicians 3000 actors mostly extras 18 tanks 12 armored personnel carriers 24 jeeps a plethora of explosives and special effects and a bloated budget of nearly 48 million dollars. Did I also forget to mention that this film was financed by the Reverend Sun Myung Moon?Yes in published interviews with Reverend Moon he has openly stated that 'God' himself TOLD him to make this movie. With that controversy aside INCHON itself is a repulsive scrap of film. The premise for INCHON is loosely based on the incidents involving the United Nations forces landing at Inchon port city of Seoul during the Korean War on September 15 1950. It is a wretched retelling of General Douglas MacArthur's amphibious victory in the early stages of the Korean War.Laurence Olivier portrays MacArthur supported by an international star cast which would include Ben Gazarra Richard Roundtree David Janssen and Jacqueline Bisset who looks absolutely ridiculous in the role as the wife of an Army Major. Unfortunately the biggest problem here is that the director Terence Young finds it impossible to overcome the poor script which generally leaves only the wartime melodrama and pyrotechnics for interest.There is absolutely nothing positive about INCHON to talk about. The unedited version runs for nearly two and a half hours. It is a painful experience to watch this offbase and factually incorrect travesty. Furthermore I find it extremely embarrassing to watch Laurence Olivier making a fool out of himself by appearing in this noisy and absurd garbage when he should have been finding time to redeem his reputation after starring in the Razziewinning THE JAZZ SINGER.Shame on everyone involved in this movie. It is extremely impossible to find a copy of INCHON at your local video store and no cable channel would dare run it which is just as well. Trust me you don't want to see this movie.My Rating  0 out of 10".

The war was after all the first in which the commies did not succeed in turning over a domino so to speak.The movie got off to a bad start with one of the actors Ben Gazzara launching into a long narrative monologue about the father of General MacArthur while on an airline flight. First of all General Douglas MacArthur is the key figure of the movie and his father was already long dead and irrelevant to the plot. Second the longwinded monologue is not ordinary conversation of the type that one would expect between airline passengers! With the possible exception of university professors who can't be fired and dictators who can't be criticized nobody gets away with such longwinded irrelevant narrative monologues in normal life.Absurdities pile upon absurdities and irrelevancies pile upon irrelevancies. Soldiers synchronize watches whose second hands aren't moving and one gets a closeup of such an action. If you are going to show a closeup of any action then make it real. Maudlin events at an orphanage take up much footage. Well the Korean War was a carnage for civilians of all types wasn't it? Soldiers taking Inchon fail to show fear  and I can't imagine anyone going behind enemy lines not being scared out of his wits unless a psycho. Taking the lighthouse at Inchon soldiers notice that the lighting and lens assembly was made in France anyone who knows anything about lighthouses  and I live in a state that has lots of them  knows that the lighthouse mechanisms and lenses from about a century ago all came from France.The best movie about the Korean War remains MASH and it centers upon support units. The brilliant invasion of central Korea at Inchon deserves far better treatment than this quicksand.".

A nice documentary type film like The Longest Day would have been ideal. The back story certainly wasn't needed.And that horrible makeup job that Laurence Olivier was given must have been done by Tammy Faye Bakker's people. He looks like a refugee from Madame Tussaud's. He sounds nothing like Douglas MacArthur. Olivier had the further misfortune to have his role come so soon after Gregory Peck portrayed MacArthur in MacArthur.The story is that Olivier at some point in the early Seventies feeling he had nothing to prove any more to be at the pinnacle of his profession. So he began taking parts strictly for the cash. As this film was produced by the Reverend Sun Yung Moon no one ever said the Moonies lacked cash. Olivier uses the same American type accent he did in Cat On A Hot Tin Roof and in another of his for the money only projects The Betsy.The rest of the cast Ben Gazzara Jacqueline Bisset David Janssen Toshiro Mifune etc. act with the smug confidence that they're Moonie checks just cleared the bank. The landing at Inchon done at the dawn hours within a narrow framework of time determined by the tides and on the western side of the Korean peninsula was militarily drawing to an inside straight. No doubt Douglas MacArthur deserves all kinds of kudos for what he did even his sternest detractors have said it was brilliant. Said it did not get a film worthy of the achievement.Inchon may have done one thing though. Laurence Olivier if not the only actor to win both an Oscar and a Razzie in his life certainly became the first to do it.".

MacArthur was something of a prima donna and manly enough not to be shy about his belief in God. as mentioned by other reviewers here the venom drizzled on Inchon comes in large part from people's animosity toward any mention of God in general and the Unification Church in particular. the version i saw included scenes with Rex Reed and David Janssen who delivered the story about the death of Arthur MacArthur not the Gazzara character.

OK so it's not a masterpiece but Jesus!... there are Adam Sandler movies that didn't get this kind of flak!I'm not gonna talk about the budget who paid for what and all that stuff. Let's stick to the movie. The major problem is Robin Moore's awful screenplay. The war subject is treated superficially and the love story is dull and not believable. Ben Gazarra is an American officer stationed in South Korea. He's married to Jacqueline Bisset but their marriage sinks and he hooks up with a local girl. When the Korean war starts he feels obligated to take his wife out of the country. They meet talk for about five minutes and get back together. It's ridiculous not to mention the fact that Bisset and Gazarra had zero chemistry.As far as the rest of the cast goes Olivier does a great job as Macarthur. I never really cared for his American accent but he was such a consummate actor such a master of his craft that even when he was not at the top of his game he was ill at the time it's still a pleasure to watch him perform. It's also a delight to see the wonderful Toshir Mifune even if they gave him a tiny role that doesn't do him justice. The Korean girls  actresses Karen Kahn Lim and Lydia Ley Mila  are pretty good. David Janssen e Richard Roundtree have small rather pointless roles.Battle scenes are above average. Jerry Goldsmith's musical score is good. The editing sucks apparently more than half an hour of finished film ended up on the cutting room floor. Sound is also weird machine gun shots sometimes remind us of cartoon gunshots.Overall it's a flawed production but very far from being the horrible disaster people made it out to be. To my knowledge it hasn't been released on VHS or DVD and that's very wrong. The worst thing I could say about Inchon is that rather than a Hollywood expensive Alist movie it looks like a Lifetime movie of the week. Or a B movie. That's it.If you have a chance to watch it by all means do.".

I must say it was very hard to find but I finally found it.

Nothing compared to cheep crap which is done through computer this is the real thing.3 Actors and storyline are great I mean what else do you want I really got touched.Conclusion This movie has been obviously discarded by the media and why I think this movie could have hit the 1982 top but rather disappeared as the mist. My guess why this is so? I think the reason for all these bad comments and scores is only and only because of the person who financed this movie The Rev. Sun Myung Moon. Religious leaders and media were very strongly opposing Sun Myung Moon in the 80's and logically a 50 million movie wouldn't be welcome.So don't believe all the nonsense written about the movie watch it yourself and then you will know.".

The script and story is pretty standard for the genre you've seen all of this in Twister Armageddon many of Emmerich's movies and so on but the writing is just... immature. As if the script came straight from a high school play. I must still praise some of the comedy bits which are indeed funny and make certain characters more likable. Unfortunately the dramatic bits are as unintentionally funny as the comedic ones and that is a problem. The final part of the film is where the disaster unleashes and ends up being a poor payoff. The special effects cinematography editing are uninspired. This film suffers from poor direction and you immediately feel like you'd rather catch an old disaster flick on cable TV. But what absolutely kills the disaster scenes are the tearjerking attempts. It's like the director is trying to squeeze a dehydrated fruit and fill a glass with orange juice. It still deserves a 3 because there is some heart to it and it maintains your interest with some of the quirky characters. Plus a few comedic bits are also worth it.

The story introduces a large cast of characters and it's sometimes hard to figure out who's who puts them in place in Busan South Korea and then unleashes the water.It's well photographed and there's a very well done scene where numerous characters are united by their watching a huge fireworks show over the harbor. The director is comfortable using the wide screen format and does a very good job handling scenes with large crowds of people on screen.And the event when it comes is impressive I wish I could have seen this in a theater instead of on my computer monitor.We have stock characters. The young man beset by guilt his mother and his wouldbe girlfriend a scientist and his exgirlfriend and her daughter and of course he's the little girl's father but doesn't know it a very nice guy and the poser girl he falls for who hangs out with airheads and a real estate developer who wants to replace the funky shops and restaurants on Busan's waterfront with a sterile souldead mall. You can pretty well figure out who lives and doesn't. And there was a scene where two characters are on a roof talking while another wave approaches and I wanted to shout Head for the stairwell and find an interior room on the top floor on the side of the building opposite the ocean! Nobody listens to me.But because the pacing is so slow we begin to wonder how in a city with a population of almost 4000000 people characters happen to run into each other so often.Probably the best scene is a large set piece on a bridge after the first wave has struck. A slacker I'll call Odious Comic Relief survives the deluge then is caught up in catastrophic events involving flying guy wires that snap loose from the bridge falling vehicles and finally a huge fireball. Imagine Chuck Jones directing WILE E. COYOTE IN HELL with the forces of water and gravity replacing the Roadrunner.It's rated R almost entirely for totally unnecessary foul language. There's is of course action violence but if you're looking for another HOSTEL this isn't it.Should we evacuate the city? We can't! The Cultural Fair is going on!! But we've got to.

	schema:reviewBody "Disaster movies have are part of a big tradition and any number of them have been effective in their own ways. HAEUNDAI starts from the simple premise that an unstable range of undersea mountains may give way to a metatsunami  promising waves fifty feet high. HAEUNDAI may have its own fanciful approach to geology but the film divides into two sections the first hour or so and the rest. The first hour involves plodding ineffectual setup as we come to know the ensemble of characters. Consisting of drunkenness yelling and screaming and a hint of romance this part of the movie would work if it were more integrated and carefully written. The remainder of the film is the disaster and its aftermath  which involves not one but three tidal waves each one bigger than the one before.

	onyx:emotionText "Disaster movies have are part of a big tradition and any number of them have been effective in their own ways. HAEUNDAI starts from the simple premise that an unstable range of undersea mountains may give way to a metatsunami  promising waves fifty feet high. HAEUNDAI may have its own fanciful approach to geology but the film divides into two sections the first hour or so and the rest. The first hour involves plodding ineffectual setup as we come to know the ensemble of characters. Consisting of drunkenness yelling and screaming and a hint of romance this part of the movie would work if it were more integrated and carefully written. The remainder of the film is the disaster and its aftermath  which involves not one but three tidal waves each one bigger than the one before.

Tidal Wave takes an hour to get to the disaster stuff and until that time we're treated toKorean comedy. Now I don't mind a bit of comedy the quirkier the better THE HOST had a lot of fun moments. But this comedy is something else the comedy of ridiculous characters behaving ridiculously almost on a subslapstick standard. The overthetop acting is absolutely appalling I avoid American comedies on principle but this is even worse than those.Of course disaster movies always have to build up to the disaster and I fully understand the need to develop the characters before dropping them in the clag. But in my mind the film should always be about the disaster even before it occurs have characters making warnings that are unheeded or build suspense and foreboding with minor events preceding it. DANTE'S PEAK is a case in point of how to achieve this. TIDAL WAVE sits in a completely different and entirely superfluous genre until the actual disaster occurs.Once the chaos gets underway things get a lot better although there's a reliance on overwrought melodrama which will test the patience of even the most hardened viewer I imagine. Endless scenes of characters facing death drawn out in painful slowmotion and with maximum crying screaming sobbing and telling each other they love them. Such scenes are a personal pet hate of mine and they threaten to overwhelm the film even when the going gets good. It's a real shame as with access to those special effects TIDAL WAVE could have and should have been a true great.".

	schema:reviewBody "I suppose most are now acutely aware of how increasingly devastating natural disasters have been in recent years starting from the 2004 Asian Tsunami which swallowed thousands of unfortunate souls. Then there are the recent destruction caused by typhoons and earthquakes the latter which we're more acquainted with given the tremors which we feel as a result of neighbouring incidents a phenomenon not experienced until the last few years.There are numerous accounts of heroics and tragedy following every disaster and it's not a surprise that they have become fodder for mass entertainment. We had 252 Signal of Life as the Japanese offering to the disaster genre earlier this year and the Koreans too have decided to match that with Haeundae The Deadly Tsunami. With 252 it was the disaster hitting hard and fast first followed by the shoving of human melodrama down your throat and thankfully though Haeundae is quite the opposite having the human drama established first without feeling forced before the special effects extravaganza took over.So if you belong to Camp Impatient then you're likely to feel bored as the film sought to introduce the ensemble characters each with their respective backstories and selfish reasons why they go about doing what they are doing of course with repercussions all nicely built in as well for some karmic response. There's the fisherman and the romance with the daughter of a man whom he had caused the death of and this provided most of the emotional anchor for the film. Then there are others like the opposites attract with the coast guard and the freespirited girl from Seoul a seemingly scheming politician who's in some kind of enbloc mess with the folks of the coastal village a much maligned scientist and his estranged wife and daughter and enough overbearing mothers.All these provided some 60 minutes worth of dramatic run time before it's time for Nature to hit back with its tidal waves where quick response to an actual event will save lives which stemmed from complacency creeping in when early warning signals went uncalled for. The filmmakers here had realistically created the phenomenon of the massive tidal waves with the receding waters and such and the effects here were nothing short of eyepopping. Fearinducing even though there was one quick scene which seemed lifted from Hollywood's Deep Impact upon reconciliation of 2 characters in the face of impending doom.But of course budget dictated that the effects could only sustain the movie for a short while and anything more than 2 wave cycles would probably either be costprohibitive or just plain dragging out the misery of the characters in their preservation of lives. Some fadetoblackatopportunemoments also came to the rescue of the film and cheesiness reined comical supreme needlessly as well though no efforts were spared in others especially the one involving the little girl left in the hotel room providing that edgeofyourseat thrills in what would be a literal rollercoaster ride in the last half hour.Haeundae served more as a disaster film without any preachy overtones regarding the preservation of the environment. In earnest I thought the release of this film was more like serving up an appetizer to the bigger budgeted extravaganza come November with 2012. That I want to see.".

Granted most of the effects are computer generated which results in some uneven moments the destruction of the aquarium is pretty bottom of the barrel fake. I'm not sure its worth navigating through the talky bits of the first hour but on DVD getting to the good stuff is going to be rather painless.At best a rental this is really only for people who want to see the destruction of 50 or 60 story waves crashing into a big city.

But the lives of these several characters go on for nearly an hour before we have some idea that a tsunami is about to strike Busan a Korean city with a popular beach. Some of this introduction comes off like B grade sappy comedy and the narrative isn't good enough to make one care it's just enough to make the viewer impatient for the tsunami. When the tsunami hits the city with a nearly 100 foot wall of water everyone in this movie should have died. But all survive the wall of water for a while at least which literally flattens some of the skyscrapers in the city. In one impossible seen a manalong with a few automobilesavoids being washed from a bridge even though a large ocean transport is literally hurled up against the side of it by the giant wave! After the destruction by water the film becomes a conventional disaster film. Some of the effects are good some are not.

	schema:headline " Insert pun about bad disaster movies here";
	schema:reviewBody "In South Korea 'Haeundae' has enjoyed a somewhat baffling popularity. Despite having almost no redeeming qualities it has become one of Korea's top grossing films. Part of this popularity is due to 'Haeundae' being the first disaster movie that the country has made. They've seen New York and L.A. get pummeled plenty but never home. Additionally while a tidal wave is the kind of disaster Americans reserve for a movie of the week the immediacy of the disaster makes it more effective to the home audience than something that threatens the entire planet.For perspective the American '2012' was released in Korea with the usual pomp and ceremony but failed to impress because of its lack of story. It wasn't believable so the Korean audience disconnected. A tidal wave is real possible and precedented which goes a long way in explaining the film's popularity in country where Sciencefiction is just another crazy thing that the Japanese do.That said this movie is actually really really bad. It's not painfully bad sitting through the film is not difficult so much as pointless. The first hour of the film is spent on a lot of campy story arcs. They are all drippingly melodramatic and are ultimately just lazy. There's the woman whose father died in the last big storm the region faced. She's in love with a guy who worked with her father and secretly blames himself for the man's death. This kind of layered family drama is central to most of Korea's modernera dramatic TV series. Then there's the slacker friend whose mother keeps trying to find him a job. Slacker guy's younger brother is a competent lifeguard who saves a vapid conniving tourist girl from drowning and she quickly becomes infatuated with him. The film gives us the obligatory scientist who sees the disaster coming but is unheeded. The scientist is divorced and his biological daughter doesn't know who he is yet completely by chance runs into his ex and the significantly younger man she's dating.If you're keeping score that's three unresolved romances three family conflicts two lifechanging secrets and zero natural disasters. In true movieoftheweek form the first half of the movie is a chess game of the filmmakers putting pieces into position for the most emotionally devastating finale they can. Unfortunately anyone who has seen more than two disaster movies sees exactly what they're doing and it's difficult to take such blatant and artless tearjerker setups seriously.After Slacker ruins things between Daughter and Guiltguy Lifeguard realizes that Touristgirl is probably psychotic Scientist gets mad at Ex for leaving Little Girl unattended and Slacker's Mom sets off to buy her son nice shoes for an interview we get the tidal wave which feels less like a disaster than sweet relief from the twodimensional melodrama we just spent an hour sitting through wistfully guessing which of the undeveloped stock characters is going to die.The special effects sequence is passable but lackluster as it is over way too fast though you sort of have to expect that from a tidal wave and the rest of the film is people trying to get rescued from the ensuing flood and a second aftershock wave. The emotional power of these scenes is undercut by a lot of elements not surprising given the weak buildup.The actors spend most of the film either being way to earnest or looking like even they can't believe they're doing this. Uhm Jeonghwa who turns in powerful performances in her other films looks glazed and contractually obligated for the entire film. The defining characteristics of each character most of which are negative are shoved so violently down our throats that it's impossible to care about any of them.Here be SPOILERS Slacker escapes falling wreckage in a sequence that looks like it was ripped straight out of Looney Tunes. Lifeguard sacrifices himself in a move that seems less heroic than I've finally escaped the crazy girl. Scientist and Ex stand on top of a building and are killed by the second wave when by the film's own logic they could have survived by simply running to the nearby stairwell. A pair of dress shoes float by implying that Slacker's Mom died and that it is kind of his fault even though she was just as likely to die if she had been at home. The film closes with Daughter and Guiltguy getting it together and Daughter immediately turning into a shrill whining harpy. End SpoilersDisaster films is that they are about two things 1 the cheap thrill of CGI destruction and 2 the emotional impact of that destruction. 'Haeundae' delivers neither. The destruction is over too quickly and the one extended scene involving destruction see Spoilers above is a slap stick routine. There is no emotional impact because there is all of one likable character and he is surrounded by such unlikable people that death looks really attractive.The film does avoid a lot of nonsequiturs keeping things coherent if thin. So the film saves itself from being painful to watch by being predictable in a vaguely comfortable kind of way. It's dull and shoots itself in the foot repeatedly but could be enjoyable for Bmovie fans and people who appreciate the overthetop Asian style.".

	schema:reviewBody "Koreans apparently have never made a big disaster movie until now. It's taken this long until 2009 so many years after fellows in other Asian countries like Japan or well Japan have done the disastermovie thing over and over usually with monsters. Why is this? Perhaps Korea didn't have the budget for it  apparently at a mere 11 million US this is the biggest budgeted movie in Korean history and it looks like a giant Titanicmovie as one might expect  or the intent with the subject matter. I don't know why Jegun Yun decided now was the time or this was the subject but it probably has something to do with an actual giant damn tsunami taking apart coastlines all across the southeast Asian seaboard and killing hundreds of thousands and displacing so many more. It's one of those monumental disastersofthedecade that in its own circles i.e. countries is as horrible as Katrina.So perhaps this is the first step towards healing a big blockbuster that doesn't really elevate the form from previous American bigbudget summer disastermovie blockbusters but doesn't suck like a box of Michael Bay ds either. The film named after a shoreline city follows a group of characters in a series of semi or not at all connected plots including one with a man who previously caused the accidental death of another while they worked on a boat during tsunami 2004 and has to reconcile with his alcoholism and a possible new love another with a new coastguard worker and his unintentional love interest and a guy working at the weathercontrol center who has a very estranged relationship with his ex and his daughter who doesn't even know he's her father since you know he works nonstop at a weather center tracking earthquakes and the like.For the first hour or maybe more there are some big laughs and some entertainment to be had if only on that shallowsurface level one might be familiar with in an Independence Day kind of foldout or for the older folks Towering Inferno. With the exception of the young coastguard guy and the twerpy girl who is or isn't trying to court him depending on her mood which just sucks the plots are at least sort of engaging on a fundumb movie level. And even with the shots of visual effects that look terrible and some of it is SyFy level quality when the actual tsunami hits the city it is quite a sight and thing to experience especially with a full audience. The problem that Yun comes with though is both the script its uneven plot threads and hitormiss humor some of it is very funny intentionally so including a giant explosion scene on a bridge during the tsunami climax and in corralling some of the acting.From what I hear some Korean movies do swing and sway quite wildly between moods from scene to scene and it isn't usually consistent even in the best films exceptions I think might be Bong JoonHo and Chanwook Park's films. But here in Haeundae it breaks down like this twothirds of this is a decent crowdpleaser what my wife called a mixed salad kind of entertainment. And then in the last twentyfive minutes it turns into more or less a total weepy so much so that you'll either fall for it completely Titanic style and lo and behold many in the audience I saw the film with mostly KoreanAmericans or Koreans in town in NYC were in tears or you'll be scratching your head or simply cringing at the hysterics on display. It's never too terribly directed but after so much of it... you wonder when it will end. It's a good start for a possible future genre Korea can take some more cracks at. It's just not something you need to rush to see. Unless you're a diehard Roland EmmerichKorea fan. And yes fan of Korea not even Korean movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tidal Wave 2009 out of 4 This South Korean disaster picture deals with a wide range of people who at first are trying to deal with their personal lives but this all changes when a tsunami hits and they must fight for their lives. Apparently this film had the biggest budget for anything to come from South Korean and in fact I thought the special effects of the disaster looked pretty good but more on that in a bit. What really kills TIDAL WAVE is the first eightyminutes which is the time spent with the characters. It's clear that this film is just like so many American films in that we spend the majority of the running time getting to know the characters so that when the disaster does hit we care for them and want to see them survive. The problem here is that the majority of this is built around a bunch of comedy bits that simply aren't funny and in fact they really take you out of the movie. I'm really not sure what the purpose of these comedy scenes were but they should have been in a Laurel and Hardy movie and not something like this. Even the personal drama was pretty predictable as we are given the same stereotypes and same clichs that every disaster movie has followed since the 1970s. The film certainly does come alive once the tsunami hits and I thought the special effects were extremely good on the whole. Yes there are some shots that are obviously fake but I enjoyed the imagination that went into them and we do get some pretty intense scenes. Still after these scenes we fall back into the clich routine with way too many scenes where someone is giving their live for someone else's and it just gets a bit repetitive after a while. TIDAL WAVE on the whole is a disappointment but fans of the genre will still want to check out the actual disaster bit.".

In short it's only the editing which is a major flaw.TIDAL WAVE is a decent disaster film which does take its own sweet time to build up but it makes sure to reward the viewer for hisher patience in the second half with excellent visual effects and action scenes.";

Some decent camera work was definetely one of the stronger sides of Tidal Wave aka Haeundae. Being a Korean disaster movie I already had some worries due to experiences in the past with movies coming from Asia. And I didn't have to wait long. Immediately those horrible nonsense dialogues came up causing that you won't like any of the characters at all. Basically everybody without a high degree of any sort falls into this category and all the interactions and relations don't matter anymore. You just want the wave erase 95 of the cast right from the spot and show us epic slow motion shots of how entires cities get washed away. Romantic aspects and there were quite a few which were forced upon us all fall flat and appear unrealistic. The funny thing is they are not! Living in Asia myself I can tell first hand that romantic issues are handled a lot more different very indirect and seemingly naive. It may be authentic to a certain point but it is definetely painful to watch. Another aspect of the 101 of Asian film making of course there are exceptions to the rule is at least one goofy character who always has to be the clown no matter how serious the topic of the movie may be. As if there is a Comedy quota that has to be reached by any means. And yes Tidal Wave deals with all of these flaws excessively. And this makes most of these films nearly unwatchable. The only good aspects of this movie are indeed the disaster elements themself even though they rely on extreme usage of CGI as far as the eye can see. Some of these shots were really epic and fun to watch. But what does this help if you have suffer through this gruesome acting? Sad to say but this movie would have been beeter if they wouldn't have even bothered in building up characters or relations of any kind and instead simply go nuts on epic destruction. 10 to 15 good minutes won't erase over one hour of uselessness.".

If you are looking for a slice of life and would like to take a look on different story lines and diversified characters and how they live before during and shortly after the disaster you must check this movie out. It focuses on philosophical emotional and simply human topics such as forgiveness responsibility pride egoism friendship love and sacrifice.The characters are introduced slowly and the movie might not be what one expects first but rather a portrait of Korean society with some dramatic touches as well as some humorous passages. This slow paced rhythm though helps to get connected to the characters and will keep you on the edges of your seat when the tidal wave finally hits the surprisingly modern and beautiful city of Busan in South Korea. The acting is great and convincing and the filming modern and accurate.Only the special effects are less convincing but not as bad as many critics would cite. I also regret that the movie didn't show that much of what happened to the different characters after the disaster. In fact one could have easily made an entire television series with all the engaging side stories. It would have been better than any currently running American soap. The disaster itself is only a detail within the movie because this film is about something bigger than action adventure or devastation. It shows us a slice of life in South Korea and makes us understand some parts of this interesting society and culture.".

A lot of people complained about the buildup the character development which takes up probably 90 of the film. Honestly I loved it. I felt I was watching a romantic comedy at times until drama slipped in but still and it worked beautifully. I've come to the conclusion you can't approach this movie from the disaster movie angle you have to approach it from the drama surrounding a disaster kind of movie. It's about the lives and relations of the people on the coast who are going to be effected by this not necessarily pawns just to be written off by the story later. If you're looking purely for a disaster film with little plot and emotion don't go for this.... watch The Day After Tomorrow or Earthquake or 2012 but if you want your disaster mixed in with an emotional story about a tightknit community on the coast with a storm looming in on them then this is your film.

I was very moved and if you do one more thing in your life before you die see this film!Of course I use the term masterpiece in its true sense as the work which reveals an artist's achievement of mastery over his or her craft. Don't be confused with the latter conotation that a masterpiece is a perfect work. Could there ever be such a thing? Truly this film shows the original sense of the word such that I would be nervous seeing any subsequent films from him.There are two versions of the film. I checked the colour version and besides the opening credits being slightly different and the much talked about retaining of colour throughout it appears to be exactly the same.I am sure your are all familiar with the premise but I think that the less you know the better. At it's basic level this film follows in the classic quest for revenge schema. A beautiful woman is condemned to 13 and a half years of incarceration for the kidnapping and murder of a young boy. By this theme the film connects to the previous entries in the now Vengeance Trilogy but it is in no way a rerun.Just like the other two films Sympathy for Lady Vengeance is gorgeous. The design in the film is extraordinary and there are so many frames that are simply beautiful. The use of colour and light is inspirational in some parts and I really can't think of watching any version but the fading one. Maybe it's because I saw that version first but I didn't find the colour version as deeply affecting.I think that which is better will be a personal decision for all who see this film. There are a some points where the fading version is very effective with what becomes subdued spots of colour. Yet the characters in the film are also colourful and fleshed out enough so that the viewer gets to know them but not enough that they know them completely.The past is something hidden for these characters in many ways that is a thematic point of the film. The film is truly about redemption and as we follow the moving drama within we may even come to understand something within ourselves. It is truly a fitting end to this three film exploration into hate remorse and revenge.".

It's more a harbinger of dangerous emptiness than to the means of setting things straight. And yet we indulge in it often to extreme lengths and on more than one occasion it's the only thing to do.SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE is an excellent study of how the passage of time can deepen wounds from more than one source. It's about how a woman's allconsuming need for getting back at a man who ruined her life has her become the most angelic looking woman in prison. Indeed Geumaja Lee's face radiates a translucent luminosity when she meditates as she ingratiates herself into the lives and stories and situations of her inmates ensuring that once she's out of prison they will gladly comply in getting her right within striking distance to her enemy Mr. Baek.The first half of the movie may baffle or annoy people. Park Chanwook is a highly stylized study of interconnecting stories that take the long way into establishing what will become a more linear course during the second half. Character delineations of Geumja Lee's inmates are broad but effective in getting the convoluted plot into motion. Most notably drawn is a overweight lesbian who killed her entire family and ate them and who has a thing for plumper girls. While she berates every other female who comes across her path and at the moment of a disturbing orgasm calls out Geumja's name Geumja has a surprise in store for her no one could see coming.This is one of the many surprises that describe SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE. Geumja's elliptical course towards Mr. Baek has her getting involved with a much younger boy at the same time she travels to Australia to reclaim her lost daughter who resents Geumja's abandonment. Transitions from one scene to the next are visually stunning  the movie has the feeling of a very lucid dream in which characters not present in one scene appear in order to interact with the ones onscreen. The sequence in which Geumja catches up to Mr. Baek and tortures him while her daughter watches is a tourdeforce of poetic violence. Interposing Yeongae Lee's profile with the young actress who plays her daughter as they exchange explanations using Mr. Baek as a translator is brilliant as it is moving as it precludes the story's second emotional ferocious climax. It's here when the film reveals and revels in what it has been hinting at all along releasing our basest natures in order to destroy the person who destroyed a loved one  in this case an innocent child. Gothic potent images ruthless and implacable the movie jumps right over the edge and embraces its blackness like a lover. It's terrific to watch.SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE however looks like it should have ended here but Park Chanwook has something else in store the meditation of what the aftermath. It's here when mother and daughter have one of their most poignant exchanges on film which seems symbolic rather than actual but draws the notion that all there is left to do is to become pure. For such an emotionally visually violent film this may be the only way to go from here.".

	schema:reviewBody "I won't be surprised to see hordes of housewives watching Sympathy for Lady Vengeance given the Korean drama penetration into Asian households especially the wildly popular Jewel In The Palace starring the same lead actress Lee Youngae. Then again given the theme on revenge filled with its fair share of blood and gore this new movie by Park Chanwook might appeal to just a select few.It's easy to draw comparisons with Hollywood's recent revenge movie Quetin Tarantino's Kill Bill. Both stars hot actresses both movies focus on the same theme both have children playing an integral part of the protagonist's motivation and both were essentially screwed by a male baddie. However Sympathy plays up the stylistic factor as well as little arthouse nuances in delivering sweet revenge.Lee Youngae plays Lee Geumja whom we see leaving prison after serving a sentence of 13 years for kidnap and murder. Or is it? Framed and blackmailed by her collaborators she bears the brunt of the responsibility and blame which sent her packing to jail. Naturally she swears vengeance upon the mastermind of the dastardly deeds as hell as knoweth no fury like a woman who's really angry.Playing up biblical moments in the movie by symbolizing Geumja as a devil in angel's clothing or vice versa depending on how you want to look at it the movie intersperses narrative moments with essential flashbacks to her life in prison. On one hand she's the angel to newcomers who protects them from the bad prison cell mamasan while on the other she's the devil who's plotting murder on the sly. She gains respect from these inmates who play important roles when Geumja is released to exact her 13 year revenge plan. One of the best scenes in demonstrating this was the making of her twintrigger handgun translating poetic justice straight from the pages of a suture.The final showdown is different from Kill Bill's without the monotonous monologue and the imaginary Five Point Exploding Heart Palm technique. Here it's brutal it's violent and somehow satisfactory. Revenge is a dish best served cold but only enjoyable when share with a group of likeminded diners to classical Vivaldi music. The final 20 minutes of the show makes an interesting conversation and analytical piece so I would not spoil anything here.While at times the movie does plod along it depended heavily on Youngae to shoulder this film through its slower moments. I'm not sure why but somehow through the many closeups I find she has aged quite a lot from her JSA days.Make no mistake this film might not be for all to bear. Those who are expecting numerous gunfights and explosions will be disappointed as Geumja does not roar and rampage like what Beatrix did. But when she finally does in artistic style all can be forgiven.".

	schema:headline " Lady Repentance";
	schema:reviewBody "I guess it was somewhat convenient and clever for Park to have conceived this film as the third and final installment to his two pragmatically different films. Seeing as how Lady Vengeance shares two similar themes of unjust imprisonment and child kidnapping with her elder brothers Oldboy and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. Clearly if this picture wouldn't have been regarded in the trilogy many would proclaim Park as stagnant and unable of moving away from these akin proses dealing with revenge.Film opens with the release of Lady Vengeance a.k.a. The Witch a.k.a. kindhearted Geumja played by the elegant Yeongae Lee. I was quite surprised by how heavily narrated this film was from the getgo as I was expecting the major breakdowns and motives revealed at a much later time lets say right before the final pinnacle. But I preferred this to how Oldboy played in a sense that Lady Vengeance didn't largely depended on the big shocker to end the film and instead moved along steadily revealing everything piece by piece.Making comparisons with Park's past two films was much tangible here as with each beautiful classical piece mirroring one from Oldboy there was also the unexaggerated violence similar to that of SFMV. The music was again well chosen and played in melancholic and elating waves without any use of mainstream ballads or electronic beats. Some of the compositions were used multiple times and while they might come off a bit repetitive most of them were either recurring for the sake of certain notions and themes that the characters were going through or just because. Aside from the tight main cast many known and capable faces of Korean cinema made appearances in short and shorter interludes throughout the film. Not much else could be said apart from them doing just as much as the script was asking of them. While the visual and musical aspects of the film are simply splendid the story here might cause some viewers to contend whether everything premeditated and executed by our leading lady was truly worthful. The following comments contain spoilersA lot was shown of what Geumja was like during the prison time where she was boldly portrayed as a calculating 'devil in God's clothes' of a woman who had a conveniently good eye for helping those who could later help her. Geumja was able to put on a quite a good by finding faith and making public speeches. But she had the best part reserved for Mr. Baek played by the powerhouse actor Minsik Choi. Mr. Baek had betrayed Geumja and made her take the blame for a murder of a child that he himself committed. And if then 19 year old Geumja was to refuse he would've simply killed her illegitimate newborn child.More was revealed about Mr. Baek who continued working as a kindergarten teacher for when Geumja captured him with the help of her former cell mate who returned her a favor by marrying Mr. Baek and coping with his demeaning ways. Apparently Mr. Baek's past crime with that child wasn't a singular case as he had a fetish for capturing little kids and taping their deaths on camera for his viewing pleasure. After toying with Mr. Baek but holding back from completely destroying him Geumja revealed her grand plan. Standing in the middle of an abandoned school in a classroom of irregularly filled seats Geumja gathered the family members of those kids that Mr. Baek had killed. After screening the tapes Geumja gave those people options to either have their way with Baek or call upon the law to deal with him instead.Watching these characters nauseate over the tapes of their little children being tortured in a way deflated Geumja's arc as a character and somewhat weakened the film's final punch in my eyes. So many years spent in jail and questions surrounding the wellbeing of her daughter must have been undoubtedly excruciating for her but standing next to these people who unlike her seemed so much more humane and relatable I felt a lot more sorrow for them than I did for Geumja most likely due to how mechanical and manipulative her character was made to look which to say the least was brave of the director if not a bit overzealous. Her struggles with gaining forgiveness from the dead boy and the symbolism of the white cake representing her state of repentance overshadowed the climax of the revenge however the scenes with the family members going in one by one after Mr. Baek were the essence of the film. End of spoilersIn the end I found Lady Vengeance more infatuated with itself than Oldboy but not as fundamentally visceral and unrelenting as SFMV which remains to be my favorite film from Park to date. Lady Vengeance felt like an amusement park filled with hard facts mixed with dreamy imagination sequences en route of sardonic pokes at religion and sexual deeds. A film with a little bit of everything for everyone that's if you don't strip away its flashy overtones and comicbooklike personifications which gracefully coat the film's otherwise improbable scheme fantasized by a random cellwoman unjustly imprisoned for a crime she didn't commit. I think Park needs to make a film that will not only disassociate him from his well talked about and highly debated trilogy flicks but will devoid him from being thrown into the pool of devaluing comparisons to Hollywood films like Kill Bill as also witnessed with the response to A Bittersweet Life from the press and movie fans. Park has all the right tools and he has shown us the many faces of revenge now it's time for him to show us something else.".

	onyx:emotionText "I guess it was somewhat convenient and clever for Park to have conceived this film as the third and final installment to his two pragmatically different films. Seeing as how Lady Vengeance shares two similar themes of unjust imprisonment and child kidnapping with her elder brothers Oldboy and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. Clearly if this picture wouldn't have been regarded in the trilogy many would proclaim Park as stagnant and unable of moving away from these akin proses dealing with revenge.Film opens with the release of Lady Vengeance a.k.a. The Witch a.k.a. kindhearted Geumja played by the elegant Yeongae Lee. I was quite surprised by how heavily narrated this film was from the getgo as I was expecting the major breakdowns and motives revealed at a much later time lets say right before the final pinnacle. But I preferred this to how Oldboy played in a sense that Lady Vengeance didn't largely depended on the big shocker to end the film and instead moved along steadily revealing everything piece by piece.Making comparisons with Park's past two films was much tangible here as with each beautiful classical piece mirroring one from Oldboy there was also the unexaggerated violence similar to that of SFMV. The music was again well chosen and played in melancholic and elating waves without any use of mainstream ballads or electronic beats. Some of the compositions were used multiple times and while they might come off a bit repetitive most of them were either recurring for the sake of certain notions and themes that the characters were going through or just because. Aside from the tight main cast many known and capable faces of Korean cinema made appearances in short and shorter interludes throughout the film. Not much else could be said apart from them doing just as much as the script was asking of them. While the visual and musical aspects of the film are simply splendid the story here might cause some viewers to contend whether everything premeditated and executed by our leading lady was truly worthful. The following comments contain spoilersA lot was shown of what Geumja was like during the prison time where she was boldly portrayed as a calculating 'devil in God's clothes' of a woman who had a conveniently good eye for helping those who could later help her. Geumja was able to put on a quite a good by finding faith and making public speeches. But she had the best part reserved for Mr. Baek played by the powerhouse actor Minsik Choi. Mr. Baek had betrayed Geumja and made her take the blame for a murder of a child that he himself committed. And if then 19 year old Geumja was to refuse he would've simply killed her illegitimate newborn child.More was revealed about Mr. Baek who continued working as a kindergarten teacher for when Geumja captured him with the help of her former cell mate who returned her a favor by marrying Mr. Baek and coping with his demeaning ways. Apparently Mr. Baek's past crime with that child wasn't a singular case as he had a fetish for capturing little kids and taping their deaths on camera for his viewing pleasure. After toying with Mr. Baek but holding back from completely destroying him Geumja revealed her grand plan. Standing in the middle of an abandoned school in a classroom of irregularly filled seats Geumja gathered the family members of those kids that Mr. Baek had killed. After screening the tapes Geumja gave those people options to either have their way with Baek or call upon the law to deal with him instead.Watching these characters nauseate over the tapes of their little children being tortured in a way deflated Geumja's arc as a character and somewhat weakened the film's final punch in my eyes.

This time he was presenting his last movie Sympathy for Lady Vengeance to end the revenge trilogy.Everyone was waiting for the movie to start all Park's fans and the lady at the festival announced the director's arrival. There he came in the Korean director with the translator trying to explain the meaning of his surname in Korean and talking about loads of stuff  except the movie. Finally he thanked people for making his movie Old Boy win a lot of money. I think is this personality that makes Park's movies so special. Just like this last one its a beautiful bizarre movie like its creator. The audience was already amazed with the starting credits of unusual beauty that just took the breath away from all audience and guarantied that the movie was going to be something different. Truth is that the movie is different at least more different than his early Old Boy. This time he had created a movie where the story didn't count as much but maybe the visual side of it images that contain so much beauty that just makes the movie already worthy of seeing. The story is also really good charged with all sort of surrealism and irony that makes it extremely interesting. Also this time the director had treated vengeance with another style more beautifully and also comprehensive accomplishing that the audience can identify themselves with the main character Geumja. When it was ended the movie received a warmly applause from an audience including myself that hadn't been disappointed and that thought the director had done a great and bizarre job to end his trilogy.".

Nevertheless the setting only acted as a beautiful addition.The theme of the movie i think is something in Cat.III. Dreaming about a manheaded dog being shot on the head in the middle of a snow desert while falling blissfully asleep during praying! Waow! Is it because the main lead is a woman and a mother who explicitly shows her feelings for her child that I like this movie so much better than Old Boy? Actually Old Boy's male lead also showed that love towards his daughter but I guess it was the ending which was so twisted I just couldn't take it in. GumJa's story was much more straightforward and her character makes it so much easier to feel sympathy for her.

I feel it is a very empty film morally and emotionally which may be the intention but this does not appeal to me and is surely a very acquired taste. Scenes involving relatives of murdered children watching tapes of their children being tortured fail to make me believe in the slightest that they have suffered loss at all let alone the horror of seeing their own child being tortured. The sequence where those relatives torture the child killer is equally cold empty and unrealistic. How could the survival of their victim be ensured for each of them to have a turn when each of them inflicts life threatening injuries?! All the characters and the whole story are so cold that I could not care less who lives dies wins or loses anyway by the end!

	schema:reviewBody "Having only just finished watching a marathon screening of Jewel In The Palace also another Lee YoungAe vehicle a few weeks ago in the comfort of my home I was pleasantly surprised at how flexible this actress could be in her acting skills.Perhaps it is her plainfaced mien that has not seen the plastic surgeon's knife or the ease with which she looks innocent and then sensual and then psychotic all at once in this film that helped her to put on this character like a pair of pantyhose sensual warm transparent yet opaque.The twists and themes in the show were also very different and very unexpected.

The acting from the various cast members were commendable as well as the DPing and various subtle yet very effective special effects in the film. The directing was also superb as was the cinematography.I left the cinema feeling like I had watched my 8 worth and then some. I dun wanna spoil anything by giving away the storyline general plot or the very intriguing twists etc. I just hope you will give this film a chance to charm you like only dark chocolate can. When you're done it will feel like you've just eaten a nice comfy bowl of Ben  Jerry's Chunky Monkey ice cream. Yummy Delicious and happy.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film wasn't bad but I found it kind of disappointing compared to Park ChanWook's last two films. It seemed very unfocused like the the filmmakers had a bunch of different ideas and decided to use them all instead of deciding on what film they were trying to make. Naturally this resulted in a pretty uneven tone. At first it seems like it's trying too hard to be clever and funny which it really isn't but then it also sometimes becomes very heavyhanded and serious. Throw in some haphazard awkward moments of violence that I'm not sure what kind of reaction they were supposed to provoke really I don't think the amount of violence towards women in the film was justified plotwise or even in terms of the statement the film was trying to make and you end up with a muddled confusing mess.Still it's really not as bad as it could have been in that it doesn't take the easy options a hyperstylish filmmaker usually would. It is not an empty selfconscious joke like Kill Bill thankfully although at first it seems as if it might be. And it certainly can't be called blandly conventional and audiencefriendly in a David Finchertype way although some of the camerawork has a similar styleoversubstance desperation. Instead it is just an overambitious confused jumble of ideas not really serious enough to pass as an art film like Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and at the same time really not successful as an entertaining yet intelligent actionpacked thrillride like Oldboy the film is actually remarkably actionfree. Plus there was far too much plot crammed in but which didn't lead to anything. For me a heavy plot can be OK if it is engaging and wellconstructed enough but this film just seemed to use plot to make up for a lack of character development. And the writers seemed to sometimes use jokes to coverup plot points that weren't fully thoughtthrough. Overall the film really just seems sort of unfinished.Still it had some moments that I thought were good enough to frustratingly show that Park ChanWook is clearly a filmmaker that can do better than this as is other films showed as well. I think he could be up there with people like Michael Haneke if he tried instead of settling at worst for Tarantino diversion. Some of the cinematography was actually remarkably nice as well despite occasional overdone stylistic flourishes not that Oldboy wasn't hyperstylish but there it seemed wellintegrated into a solid film whereas this seems like a bit of a patchwork job. All and all I think this film is a case of a promising filmmakerofthemoment ultimately just being lazy unfocused and undisciplined notibly there are numerous cheap allusions back to Oldboy as if cashing in on that film's success like a smug little joke on the audience giving out tidbits of enticement when they could be blowing minds.".

	schema:reviewBody "Isn't it bit hard to write a review for the films that you really like or even admire a lot? That's how I felt right now after having seen Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. It's not easy for me to write this review without blabbing like fan boy raving over the film that they really enjoy a lot but I'll give it a shot. So let me start out this review with this How do you make angel very angry? Better yet how do you make an angel so full of rage that she would go any length to execute old school method revenge on you? Having seen JSA Joint Security Area Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Oldboy which are from South Korean director Park Chanwook I was very excited as hell about seeing Sympathy for Lady Vengeance since it is third one in revenge trilogy after Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Oldboy. In fact I was agonizing in pain when I found out that Sympathy for Lady Vengeance was released last summer in South Korea. I kid you not. Imagine if Santa Claus had your favorite toy but you had to haul your ass all the way over to North Pole would you do it? I would if I had time and money.I believe that Sympathy for Lady Vengeance has solidified Park Chanwook as world class filmmaker and he will continue to evolve. I think it's great that he doesn't fall back on his own formula to create the films and just continuing to master his craft which is astonishing. I honestly think he is the one to watch because I can smell more masterpieces from him in future and I'll be eagerly to wait for one even if he took his sweet time to make it. You can't just rush a masterpiece. You cannot. I'm glad that Chanwook managed to get carte blanche after success of JSA so he is able to make whatever he want to on his own terms. Now let's move on to my personal feelings about Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. Most trilogies usually end on such disappointed conclusion but not Sympathy for Lady Vengeance. It ends the trilogy with bang and it doesn't need to apologize for that. Unlike the predecessors Sympathy for Lady Vengeance has woman as main character which provided different spin revenge tale. It is incredibly refreshing to see revenge film that contained female as protagonist although we have Kill Bill saga.Let me make a comment that I never made before in my previous reviews. I think every frame in SFLV is like painting. There's a wonderful scene where Geumja revealed her feelings in empty building. It's like Chanwook is using celluloid for him to brush that masterpiece paint to paste on. It's great stuff and at some times I felt like I was in air because of great cinematography. It contained one of the awesome cinematography I've ever seen. It doesn't forced or stilt at all like many Hollywood films tend to but it felt very natural and smooth whole time so the viewers doesn't feel very overwhelmed. It's not easy to make revenge film so beautiful yet very arty but Chanwook has succeed with this film and for that he is an auteur because he know no boundaries when it come to cinema. It's fantastic stuff that would make pretentious film buff bawling out like crybaby.The film open with Geumja released from prison and whole story is told in flashbacks while she is getting prepared for revenge. I thought it was very ingenious because I never felt like I was lost like other Hollywood films that rely on flashbacks as gimmicks. We see that Geumja has developed friendships with several cell mates that soon would benefit her when she is being release from prison after 13 years later. The flashbacks structure on each cell mate that Geumja has form friendship so it's very interesting to see how things have process yet it doesn't feel very flashy or cheap gimmick. It's brilliant stuff. It's astonishing to see Geumja managed to win over many people with her kindness and fantastic personality. God knows I'd be very intrigued by her a lot.If you are familiar with Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Oldboy then you would be surprised at number of actors from those films have made an appearance in SFLV. I was very shock to see at some of the actors and I go like isn't he from this and that which is quite amusing.I may toss masterpiece here and this and that but this is absolutely masterpiece in many levels. The actors are top of their game set design is too sweet direction is solid and the cinematography is brilliant. What I like the most about this film is that we don't see violent scenes at all because the camera pans away when that took place so we have to use our imagination like the ear scene in Reservoir Dogs. One look for gore or violent sequences in Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Oldboy would be so disappointed with this film but I think it's better if you go see this film with no knowledge and low expectations and maybe it will be pleasant surprise. But it's hard to keep low expectations because it's Park Chanwook an auteur whose has to be part of group of elite directors by end of 21st Century.What I like the most about this film is use of dark humors which balances the film very well and I find myself laughing at scenes that may not be quite amusing to other. Maybe I have strange sense of humor? It's great how Chanwook managed to slide dark humors in this film because it comes up at most unexpected moment which really works. Top class stuff here.But in all of my honest opinion it's really amazing film in its own rights.".

	schema:headline " Not as original as Old Boy but worth watching";
	schema:reviewBody "Last year at Cannes Korean director Park Chanwook's Old Boy the second of his revenge trilogy won the Grand Prix won this year by Broken Flowers. The third and last Sympathy for Lady Vengeance didn't make it in time to Cannes this year and won only some minor awards at Venice despite the hype. It was also shown in the noncompetitive festivals of Toronto New York and London.I have not seen the first one of this revenge trilogy but compared with Old Boy SFLV is a weak conclusion. Although some found Old Boy unpalatable few disagreed on its provoking originality. Its multilayer plot is particularly clever. SFLV despite all the contrivances to make it look complicated is just a simple revenge story. It starts with 33yearold Lee Geumjee's release after serving 14 years for murder of a kidnapped child a crime for which she was framed not the kidnap but just the murder. While we see her taking a job at a cake shop and taking a room which could have come out of a Wong Karwai artsy movie to start her new life flashbacks with showy dexterity relates how her saintly existence in prison had won her a group of loyal friends. She now seeks them out to help her execute the revenge that she has been meticulously planning all these years. Then the revenge itself.Old Boy was meticulously shot oozing originality in scenes ranging from devastatingly violent to tantalisingly erotic. SFLV seems to have run out of original ideas struggling in the losing battle of trying to shock and impress. While I won't go so far as to suggest plagiarism I do get a feeling of deji vu. Seduction of an adolescent by an older woman we have seen only too often. Neither is copulation on a table used for dining a novelty. The torture scene looks uncannily like Reservoir dog and you recognise the faint shadow of Murder on the orient express although the object there is slightly different i.e. dead.To be fair there are things to be said in SFLV's favour. The art direction surrounding the central figure that is female gives this movie an air of elegance not found in Old Boy. The editing and montages are a bit flashy but do make the movie more interesting to watch. The music is effective in setting the pace. The black humour in the revenge scene scales the height of absurdity by being at the same time both hilarious and chilling.Choi Minsik who was so impressive in Old Boy is only in a supporting role in this movie which is all Lee Youngae's show. The heroin Lee Geumjee is somewhat enigmatic. In Old Boy the central character's wrongdoing is quite minor only in his indulgence in tale telling which unfortunately led to grave consequences. Lee Geumjee an accomplice to the kidnap is however far from being blameless. It is never conclusive what she is avenging having the best part of her life taken away form her her daughter kept out of her reach or the murders of the little kidnap victims. Nor is it made clear whether her angelic behaviour in prison reflects a true goodness in her or is purely manipulative towards practical ends. Most agree that regardless of various interpretations there is in her a deep longing for absolution which is found only in the final reconciliation with her daughter.Lee Yeongae's portrayal of Lee Geumjee has generally been well received although not well enough to win for her an award at Venice. I find myself a bit handicapped when it comes to assessing her performance. Early in the year for three months I watched her for five days every week as the allgoodness heroine in Dae Janggeum A jewel in the palace a Korean TV drama series that became immensely popular worldwide making it hard for me now to see her on screen as anybody else. Lee's other varied roles include a nononsense investigator in JSA 2000 and a changeable lover in One fine day in spring 2001. The very complex character in SFLV is Lee's most challenging role todate and her performance is at least adequate nay more than adequate even if not superlative.".

	onyx:emotionText "Last year at Cannes Korean director Park Chanwook's Old Boy the second of his revenge trilogy won the Grand Prix won this year by Broken Flowers. The third and last Sympathy for Lady Vengeance didn't make it in time to Cannes this year and won only some minor awards at Venice despite the hype. It was also shown in the noncompetitive festivals of Toronto New York and London.I have not seen the first one of this revenge trilogy but compared with Old Boy SFLV is a weak conclusion. Although some found Old Boy unpalatable few disagreed on its provoking originality. Its multilayer plot is particularly clever. SFLV despite all the contrivances to make it look complicated is just a simple revenge story. It starts with 33yearold Lee Geumjee's release after serving 14 years for murder of a kidnapped child a crime for which she was framed not the kidnap but just the murder. While we see her taking a job at a cake shop and taking a room which could have come out of a Wong Karwai artsy movie to start her new life flashbacks with showy dexterity relates how her saintly existence in prison had won her a group of loyal friends. She now seeks them out to help her execute the revenge that she has been meticulously planning all these years. Then the revenge itself.Old Boy was meticulously shot oozing originality in scenes ranging from devastatingly violent to tantalisingly erotic. SFLV seems to have run out of original ideas struggling in the losing battle of trying to shock and impress. While I won't go so far as to suggest plagiarism I do get a feeling of deji vu. Seduction of an adolescent by an older woman we have seen only too often. Neither is copulation on a table used for dining a novelty. The torture scene looks uncannily like Reservoir dog and you recognise the faint shadow of Murder on the orient express although the object there is slightly different i.e. dead.To be fair there are things to be said in SFLV's favour. The art direction surrounding the central figure that is female gives this movie an air of elegance not found in Old Boy. The editing and montages are a bit flashy but do make the movie more interesting to watch. The music is effective in setting the pace. The black humour in the revenge scene scales the height of absurdity by being at the same time both hilarious and chilling.Choi Minsik who was so impressive in Old Boy is only in a supporting role in this movie which is all Lee Youngae's show. The heroin Lee Geumjee is somewhat enigmatic. In Old Boy the central character's wrongdoing is quite minor only in his indulgence in tale telling which unfortunately led to grave consequences. Lee Geumjee an accomplice to the kidnap is however far from being blameless. It is never conclusive what she is avenging having the best part of her life taken away form her her daughter kept out of her reach or the murders of the little kidnap victims. Nor is it made clear whether her angelic behaviour in prison reflects a true goodness in her or is purely manipulative towards practical ends. Most agree that regardless of various interpretations there is in her a deep longing for absolution which is found only in the final reconciliation with her daughter.Lee Yeongae's portrayal of Lee Geumjee has generally been well received although not well enough to win for her an award at Venice. I find myself a bit handicapped when it comes to assessing her performance. Early in the year for three months I watched her for five days every week as the allgoodness heroine in Dae Janggeum A jewel in the palace a Korean TV drama series that became immensely popular worldwide making it hard for me now to see her on screen as anybody else. Lee's other varied roles include a nononsense investigator in JSA 2000 and a changeable lover in One fine day in spring 2001. The very complex character in SFLV is Lee's most challenging role todate and her performance is at least adequate nay more than adequate even if not superlative.";

Romero starts out with a campaign from the government people and their leaders. Raul Julia gives a memorable performance as the Archbishop who struggled to stop the genocide from occurring. This also leads to disloyalty against the churches of El Salvador. Only one man will stepped in and make it stop and listen to the truth. Romero was assassinated in March 1980. It is a powerful movie to watch as we see the horrific details of this atrocity. I seen this movie in my History class. Oscar Romero is one of the least known subject in a History class. While the actual Romero moved El Salvador I was moved by Raul Julia's performance. Romero is one of those political dramas that really grab the audiences and put them inside the real world of the movie. It is a mustsee.  12 3 12 stars".

His role as Oscar Romero really gave light to the film and also impressed many of my students. His assassination scene is handled very well. Great Film.

	schema:reviewBody "So there were a lot of things that were great about this movie. It had some awesome commentary on the reality and the struggle of Salvadorians living in the slums and the harsh behavior of the police and the army on the people. The acting from most of the main characters was pretty great although most of the army members were very blank and just not very good. Raul Julia did an excellent job especially in the scenes in which he had to get emotional although there were a few times in which his performance became a little bit worse in some of the scenes that he was screaming. The prison scene was odd primarily because the make up was not believable to a dead person. He was supposed to be a man who was beaten to death tortured until he finally decided to give up. However the make up was similar to someone who got punched in the face once or twice and got knocked out. One of the things that restricts this movie in my opinion is that everything is just so black and white. The priests and the church are the good guys and then the rich and powerful people are the bad guys. Every single action that they take is therefore extremely predictable because you know what is going to happen as soon as the scene starts. This also makes it so that the only person you can rout for is Romero. There is no struggle I don't have to make a decision and I am not challenged as an audience member. This makes the experience extremely one sided and I am left with a feeling of emptiness.The other problem although I already mentioned it before is the actors other than the lead. The extras are pretty bad and most of the people in the military just have a blank expression and sound like they are just reading their lines. I get it that it really isn't supposed to be about acting but you get the point.Overall good film 710.".

There's a pervasive sense of horror and fear in these latter largely missing from Romero despite laudable efforts at conveying the same rawness of police state terror. Perhaps the staging is a little too tidy or the death squads too ordinary to reach the same level of abject dread. Nonetheless there is much to praise in Romero. Raul Julia's transformation from meek upper class toady to passionate spokesman for the masses is eloquently understated and no less powerful. I especially like the way the filmmakers portrayed elements of the elite humanising them and giving them a chance to speak even as their death squad hirelings carry out the bloody dirty work. Perhaps the movie's high point is Romero's pivotal refusal to continue baptism privileges for the wellbred thus affirming his new spiritual loyalty but also sealing his earthly doom. It's a quietly powerful and revealing moment.I wish the producers had showed more candor in implicating the US's role in the repression. Except for Romero's plea to stop arming the military and the presence of a thuggish American adviser he looks North American but is not identified there is no mention of repression's ultimate sponsor. Yet the US was waist deep in these events as Reagan's boys in the basement undercut every Congressional effort to moderate support. Principled films such as Romero need to be fearlessly historical in putting such facts before the American public pleasant or not. Even so Romero is a moving portrayal of one man's evolution from spiritual cypher to heroic symbol and poses a challenge to conscionable people everywhere.".

Even so Romero is a moving portrayal of one man's evolution from spiritual cypher to heroic symbol and poses a challenge to conscionable people everywhere.";

It's the story of a simple man of faith whose conscience would not allow him to remain silent when confronted by the escalating bloodshed of civil warfare and Raul Julia's performance in the title role highlights all the Archbishop's conviction and sometimes clumsy sense of humility. The film works best when addressing the ageold conflict between Church and State and to its credit is not above criticizing the policies of either institution. Director John Duigan thankfully doesn't try to sensationalize the climate of violence leading up to the crime compare the film to Oliver Stone's typically overwrought 'Salvador' but the assassination itself is sadly played for maximum melo dramatic impact. What follows is a familiar and completely redundant endtitle moral with the usual grim statistics but in balance the film presents an honest and sometimes moving story with an essentially humanist message Someone says the Archbishop must have the courage to say 'enough'.".

	schema:reviewBody "The 20'th century history of Central and South America can be compressed into the film Romero. I'm not going to comment on why this part of the world has been so long plagued by such violence and repression that's up to sociologists. Although things as they stand in 2007 are no where near as bad as they have been there are still completely wild areas in the America's parts of Columbia are in anarchy with rebel groups still fighting a very long war. Central America saw some of the most brutal and repressive civil wars and regimes. Guatamala and El Salvador saw exceptionally horrible levels of death and destruction. El Salvador which this film depicts was in the throes of yet another wave of civil disorder pitting the large and very poor underclass against the small numbers of privileged upper class with predictable results. The army was used as a brutal and murderous machine acting out the dark ideas of the right wing. The US aided the right wing because US foreign policy blindly labeled all rebellious groups in the America's as Communist insurgents and worked overtime to eliminate them. That's the backdrop to this film.The murder of Archbishop Romero was but the beginning of a ten year civil war that saw over 50000 deaths in El Salvador. The film is hard on the nerves to watch as all depictions of depravity and death are. The actors have put their best into this important film. Two of them are sadly no longer with us Richard Jordan and Raul Julia. Jordan shone in this film and even more in one of my favorites  Gettysburg. Julia probably gives his most memorable performance. He is by turns shy sedate stirred outraged shocked and broken down. His depiction shadows that of the real Romero and one gets a sense that Julia had more than enough raw material to work with and that the script and storyline would support strong acting. In short by the tragic end we are emotionally drained and very upset as we should be. If there is ever to be justice in this world and it's a big if then we can start by demanding that perpetrators of violence are dealt with appropriately and not allowed sanctuary and support. Of course the chances of this happening while you live in a client state of the US is slim. A sad wrenching depiction of both Romero's short career as Archbishop and of the black hole that overcame El Salvadore. As grim as they come but important to watch and take note of.".

It offers no context whatsoever and like so much propaganda out of Hollywood the movie completely ignores Marxist revolutionary violence in Central America at the time. One is reminded of the movie Outbreak in which the US Army is portrayed as the villain by Hollywood when in truth Army doctors saved people from a vicious virus outbreak as Richard Preston documented in his excellent book The Hot Zone. It was in fact communist guerrillas who said they would murder anyone found with voting stamp dye on their hands during the El Salvador elections portrayed in the movie. But in a truly heroic act of defiance El Salvadorans stood in long lines for hours to vote under the threat of death by the guerrillas  not as the movie would have you believe the Savadoran army. Similarly in 1990 Nicaraguans voted against the communist junta led by Daniel Ortega. After watching the movie Romero you would never know these things but the facts can be easily verified in authoritative historical sources. Of course as you might expect the US is another villain in the movie like the brutal El Salvadoran army and the communists are of course just trying to help the people in a terrible situation. The movie only hints at the role Liberation Theology played in the thinking of some Catholic theologians at the time. All in all this movie is hardly worth the effort and only worth it as a study in propaganda despite the overtly religious context of the movie. Unless you believe Central America would have been better off under communism watch this movie with a great deal of skepticism.".

Perhaps the previous review was asleep?Pierre Mondy is a retiring bank employee who is sent on a pleasure trip by his colleagues. On the train he happens to meet Clio Goldsmith. His character is a man who is craving adventure after decades of marriage and two kids. Although having been married to Claudia Cardinale one does wonder on what planet the scriptwriter was on... The movie ends on a very high note. Claudia Cardinale travels to Venice and meets her husband and the flame is rekindled. While not a grand piece of cinema it is fun and uplifting. Try it.".

His character is a man who is craving adventure after decades of marriage and two kids. Although having been married to Claudia Cardinale one does wonder on what planet the scriptwriter was on... The movie ends on a very high note. Claudia Cardinale travels to Venice and meets her husband and the flame is rekindled. While not a grand piece of cinema it is fun and uplifting. Try it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Director Bruce Paltrow assembled an impressive ensemble cast to deliver this story about a diverse group of people with many things in common more than they would probably ever realize or admit to in fact.  On the surface the tie that binds is music specifically that cultural phenomenon known as Karaoke a world in which for three minutes or so no matter who or what they are the individual at stage center is a star.  Underneath that particular aspect however the common thread runs much deeper.  Because these are people who in their own way are all seeking to connect with something even though they don't know what it is or even consciously know they're pursuing it.  They're looking for their personal metaphor that one special thing or someone that will give meaning and purpose to their life. It's a road we all go down at one time or another in one way or another and it's that road that is explored by Paltrow in Duets' an affecting film that illustrates how universally elusive the answers we're all seeking in life are and for the most part because we simply don't know the questions in the first place.Ricky Dean Huey Lewis is a singerhustler on the Karaoke circuit In Tulsa on his way to a big competition in Omaha he gets a call and detours through Las Vegas for the funeral of an old friend.  While he's there he meets up with someone with whom he has a special relationship Liv Gwyneth Paltrow who decides she wants to join him on the road.  Meanwhile a salesman named Todd Woods Paul Giamatti suddenly realizes he's so burned out from being on the road that he doesn't even know what city he's in making a pitch to a hotel conference room full of corporate types in Houston thinking all the while he's actually in Orlando Florida.  When he finally gets home his wife Candy Kiersten Warren and his two kids are too selfabsorbed to even say hello to him so he goes out for a pack of cigarettes even though he doesn't smoke discovers Karaoke and makes a new friend Reggie Kane Andre Braugher.  Then there's Billy Scott Speedman a young man who drives a cab of which he is half owner who due to a particular set of circumstances finds himself involved with one Suzi Loomis Maria Bello who is on her way to California by way of the karaoke competition in Omaha.  And ultimately Karaoke becomes the vehicle through which this eclectic bunch of individuals begin to discover just what it is they're looking for and who among them ever would've thought it would be in Omaha Nebraska?Working from an intricate and insightful screenplay by John Byrum Paltrow has crafted an engrossing comedydrama that is entertaining and poignant. There's a lot going on in this film but Paltrow sets a pace that keeps it moving right along and uses transitions that effectively eliminate any confusion that could easily have resulted from having so many storylines unfolding at once.  The characters are well drawn and Paltrow establishes exactly who they are and where they fit in almost as soon as they are introduced which enables the viewer to concentrate on the story without having to figure out who fits where and why.  After all this is not a mystery and Paltrow uses the screen time of his characters wisely to develop the drama that is being played out in their respective lives rather than by throwing in unnecessary twists and turns just to maintain interest. It works because the story is interesting enough without the aid of any superficial enhancements and Paltrow does an excellent job of blending it all together to deliver a satisfying and emotionally involving film.There are a number of outstanding and noteworthy performances in this film but the most memorable is turned in by Paul Giamatti who so successfully conveys the emptiness of this middleaged man who has always played by the rules and who now finds himself at a very real crossroads in his life.  The fact that Todd has accrued 800000 frequent flyer miles that he can't use effectively puts his whole life into perspective and Giamatti sells it with a portrayal that is affecting and incisive.  And as Reggie the guy Todd takes up with on the road Braugher hits just the right note as well and their scenes together provide some of the highlights of the film as when they perform their duet of Try A Little Tenderness' this is Karaoke at it's best.Gwyneth Paltrow provides a few highlights here as well besides creating a very real believable character in Liv it's worth watching the film just to see her sing Bette Davis Eyes.'  But there's also an exquisite gentleness in her nature she so ably expresses that makes her decidedly easy to watch and there's an engaging duet she delivers with Huey Lewis on Cruisin' that's a real showstopper.  It's quite interesting in fact to note just how well the actors in this film deliver their songs and yes they all did their own singing.  Other musical highlights include Braugher's Free Bird' and Bello's rendition of Sweet Dreams.'  This entire film in fact just may be the best thing that ever happened to Karaoke it definitely raises the bar and gives it some mainstream credibility.The supporting cast includes Angie Dickinson Blair Lochlyn Munro Ronny Amanda Kravat Redhead Erika von Tagen Julie and Marian Seldes Harriet.  Early in the film a truck driver asks a hitchhiker a guy just out of prison What were you in for?'  The guy replies An error in judgment.'  And in the final analysis that's what Duets' is really all about the flaws imperfections and errors in judgment' that make up the music of life.  It's about finding that right note and being able to share it with someone being able to perform a duet to the score of life.  910.".

	schema:headline " Not great but entertaining  and well worth it to see Braugher and Giamatti in action";
	schema:reviewBody "Bruce Paltrow's film Duets basically centers on the relationships of vastly different people who all end up at a karaoke contest in Omaha. Liv Paltrow meets her dad Ricky Lewis for the first time at her mother's funeral. Ricky is a karaoke hustler a guy who walks into various competitions and not only wins the cash prize but manages to get a sucker to bet on which of them is going to win. Ricky reluctantly lets Liv tag along with him on the circuit and along with singing herself she also tries to forge a relationship with her father. Todd Giamatti is a salesman who travels most of the year and comes home to a house where his children don't talk to him and his wife would rather spend time online than talk to him after one of his business trips. One day he has a moment of clarity and decides to use some of the 800000 frequent flier miles he has racked up taking off in his car and driving anywhere but near his home. The first night he gets a room he walks into a hotel bar and is convinced to get up on stage for their karaoke night where he finds he loves the freedom it allows and the attention it garners him. Along the way on his trek he picks up a hitchhiker named Reggie Braugher a recent parolee with the voice of an angel and the two strike up a very close friendship despite or possibly because of their many differences. Finally there is Suzi Bello a drifter who travels her way to karaoke contests by eschewing all dignity and selling any part of her she can. At a stopover in Cincinnati she encounters Billy Speedman a former seminary student who is now a gypsy cab driver that just discovered his girlfriend sleeping with his business partner. Bello convinces him to take her to California but along the way the lure of the 5000 purse in Omaha gets the best of her and they make a stop there.Duets features several story lines but other than karaoke they all have one thing in common They are all unhappy with either their past their present or the prospect of a bleak or uncertain future. The film really isn't all that good but there are a couple of good things about it. First and foremost the chemistry between Giamatti and Braugher is fantastic. Completely casting aside the fact that they are two of my favorite actors their connection was practically tangible. Hey who knew Giamatti could sing too? The rest of the stories were pretty clichd or just not very compelling at all. I wasn't sure where they were trying to go with the SuziBilly arc but it ended up going nowhere for me personally. Huey Lewis nothing more than a marginally average actor does an okay job in this film but it obviously isn't much of a stretch for him.If you are not a fan of any of the actors Duets is entertaining enough to sit through and not end up hating yourself afterward. Personally the film deserves a slight edge because of the GiamattiBraugher thing but altogether it gets a 610. In this case I'm rounding up from 5.5 for that edge.Shelly".

	onyx:emotionText "Bruce Paltrow's film Duets basically centers on the relationships of vastly different people who all end up at a karaoke contest in Omaha. Liv Paltrow meets her dad Ricky Lewis for the first time at her mother's funeral. Ricky is a karaoke hustler a guy who walks into various competitions and not only wins the cash prize but manages to get a sucker to bet on which of them is going to win. Ricky reluctantly lets Liv tag along with him on the circuit and along with singing herself she also tries to forge a relationship with her father. Todd Giamatti is a salesman who travels most of the year and comes home to a house where his children don't talk to him and his wife would rather spend time online than talk to him after one of his business trips. One day he has a moment of clarity and decides to use some of the 800000 frequent flier miles he has racked up taking off in his car and driving anywhere but near his home. The first night he gets a room he walks into a hotel bar and is convinced to get up on stage for their karaoke night where he finds he loves the freedom it allows and the attention it garners him. Along the way on his trek he picks up a hitchhiker named Reggie Braugher a recent parolee with the voice of an angel and the two strike up a very close friendship despite or possibly because of their many differences. Finally there is Suzi Bello a drifter who travels her way to karaoke contests by eschewing all dignity and selling any part of her she can. At a stopover in Cincinnati she encounters Billy Speedman a former seminary student who is now a gypsy cab driver that just discovered his girlfriend sleeping with his business partner. Bello convinces him to take her to California but along the way the lure of the 5000 purse in Omaha gets the best of her and they make a stop there.Duets features several story lines but other than karaoke they all have one thing in common They are all unhappy with either their past their present or the prospect of a bleak or uncertain future.

So I will try.The first time I saw it I loved it. I recommended it. I made a mental note that this was a sleeper a really nice little indie. I wanted to see it again.It took 14 years for me to get a chance to revisit the film but on a second viewing I was not that impressed at all. Here are my notes  Paul Giammatti steals this film but that is hardly news he pretty much steals every film he has ever been in this script simply gives him more room to move  the part that Bruce Paltrow cast his daughter in is simply ... bizarre. There are many many ways to play a young girl who meets her wayward father late in life but somehow I don't think this is one of them. Gwen has never looked better and her looks actually distract from the role aided and abetted by the director having her slink here and there whenever the chance presents itself. This is wrong on many levels. the cameos are all interesting and the stories are all interesting but other than the aforesaid performance by Giamatti they simply fall apart the longer the viewer has endure them. on second viewing I realized that what I liked so much about the film originally was the whole Karioke theme that this theme has astonishingly been underplayed in movies boy is that rare! and it shouldn't be because it has legs. The first scene in the script with Huey Lewis is the strongest with the most impact and understand THAT IS NOT A GOOD THING because the story and the film go downhill from there.".

Sure there are other good aspects of this movie such as surprisingly good acting from Huey Lewis and a very low key quirky representation of his daughter played by Gwenneth Paltrow. This movie didn't enchant the critics upon its release...and judging by its box office performance not much of the country either...but there is something very sublime about not only the subject matter but also the method in which this movies elements were pieced together...much like a dramatic jigsaw puzzle. What really made this movie special for me though was the ending. Reggie Kane's final performance and the aftermath...especially with regards to Todd's wife almost made me weep. I found it very moving and genuine in its execution and the lowkey nature if the acting simply enhanced those qualities. So to sum up mediocre movie that has some really great nuances that combine to make a movie that though slow and draggy at times makes up for those lapses with the end results. P.S. as usual Paul Giamatti is perfect! Everything that he gets involved with...with the possible exception of that reenvisioned Planet of the Apes...ALWAYS is made better by his presence!".

	schema:reviewBody "DUETS takes an interesting and unusual cast of character actors mixes them up and puts them in a film where groups of characters will all meet up by the end.  Instead of it being a political rally like in the Robert Altman classic NASHVILLE the gathering is a karaoke contest in Topeka Kansas. It seems that director Bruce Paltrow in stepping into the shoes of Robert Altman but his results aren't as satisfying. There are three different stories in DUETS which switch back and forth between each other instead of making them into segments.  The first story is about a fatherdaughter relationship.  Ricky Dean Huey Lewis is a con artist who cons suckers into making a bet on who can sing better at karaoke and Ricky usually wins.  Ricky finds out that his exwife or exlover the story doesn't really explain has just passed away and he meets Liv Gwyneth Paltrow a young woman who happens to be his daughter.  Ricky heads off to Topeka to compete in the karaoke contest with Liv following him against his wishes.  It turns out that Liv is quite a singer herself and impresses Ricky.  The second story deals with a workaholic man name Todd Paul Giamatti.  Todd goes from city to city and staying in different hotels so often that he forgets what city he is in. When Todd is at home in surban California he decides to go for drive to get some cigarettes and keeps on drivng to Santa Fe.  There he is persuaded by a pretty young woman to give karaoke a shot.  He does and he loves it he loves it so much that he changes his attitude from stiffshirted to free minded.  Todd then picks up a hitchhiker Reggie Andre Braugher a criminal on the run who winds up singing karaoke with Todd to hide from the authorities.  The third story deals with a young aspiring cab company owner in Cleveland Scott Speedman who after catching his wife sleeping with his best friend decides to drink his worries away.  At one of the bars he meets Suzi Maria Bello a young and pretty woman who wants to become a professional singer and she'll do anything without regret including sexual acts to become famous.  In fact Suzi will do sexual acts just to avoid paying for things. By the end of the film all of these people meet in Topeka and the climax isn't that exciting.  I found DUETS to be a film that has great acting.  All of the cast including Huey Lewis Gwyneth Paltrow and Paul Giamaiit to be enjoyable.  If I said it once I'll say it again Huey Lewis isn't only an underrated singer but also an underrated actor.  You don't believe me then see Robert Altman's SHORT CUTS and see for yourself. But what ruins DUETS is it's plot and plot structure.  It's all too familar.  DUETS appears to be a film that Robert Altman would consider to be too commercial so Bruce Paltrow takes over to make a too typical film. And even if the plot structure isn't like Altman the plots of the multiple characters come out like a movie made for t.v. What's pretty amazing is that all of the actors are pretty darn good singers except for Andre Braugher which is reported to have a voice over for his singing.  Gwyneth Paltrow takes her acting to a new level by becoming a singer and she is a good singer.  I'm thinking that former beau Brad Pitt is intimidated by now that the girl he made famous by dating her didn't only win a Oscar but is a good singer. And it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out why a distinguished actress like Gwyneth Paltrow decided to star in this film look at her last name and the director's. Paul Giamatti who is a very enjoyable character actor in HOWARD STERN'S PRIVATE PARTS THE NEGOTIATOR and THE TRUMAN SHOW shows off his talent further by being another good singer.  And Maria Bello who was recently in both PAYBACK and COYOTE UGLY shows that she too can carry a tune.  But when you put these actors up along with Huey Lewis it's like having amateur dancers dance aside with Fred Astire or Gene Kelly.  In other words Huey Lewis does stand out with his singing you just want to hear him sing more songs for the rest of the movie.  But of couse Paltrow wants to carry on with the story which makes it muddle. Overall DUETS does have good acting and good singing.  But it's the plot that makes it an unimpressive film.  If Bruce Paltrow changed the plot structure the character's and add some unexpected surprises  it would have been more interesting but it isn't.  The best way to describe DUETS is this DUETS is like karaoke we all know the words it's just sung in a different way.   out of five".

I never ever want to sing Karaoke ever. Why? 1. Gwyneth Paltrow must have taken on the role just because Bruce Paltrow was directing...no other way would an Alister sacrifice themselves to burn so badly. Or participate in a karaoke film without being able to sing. 2. The plot...couldn't find it! Just telling the story of random people with no significance or emotion. You know it's bad when they need to pull the 'guns and sex' action to get the viewers interested again. Only you just don't get why they need to show sex or shoot in the first place. It just detracts from the easy style of the film. So wrong. 3. The singing. Enough said. 4. That overworked people with unloving families need to go away and get high...pierce their ears and enter karaoke competitions. Nuuh. I really could go on forever...the only good thing about the film was that FINALLY after waiting and waiting for some sort of climax the film ended. Without climax i might add. Watch this at your own risk to see how bad it is. Even popcorn toffee apples ice cream cola and lollies won't distract you from the banality you face in Duets.".

It hasn't been cool since about 1989 and nobody there is that excited about it especially the people who run the contests.  Maria Bello's character was the biggest skank ever. We never really knew why she needed to get to California but were supposed to accept the fact that she planned to blow her way across America. Her escort was just along for the ride and since I suppose they realized that the audience would never fathom these two together they had to tack on a flirtation with Gwyneth Paltrow at the end. Who won the big karaoke tournament? We never found out because Andre Braugher had to blow his brains out onstage. He didn't seem that depressed. My guess is the morbidly obese guy. He had more style in his left stretch mark than any other character in the movie.".

The movies hit song Cruisin by Huey Lewis and Gwenyth Paltrow is enjoyable.  A person in the film that really saves the movie is Coyote Ugly star  Maria Bello who's kinky fun way of life helps add a few laughs to the movie.  The emotions between Gwenyth and Huey are flat and uninteresting.  I think Gwenyth is a great actress.  She was excellent and welldeserving of the Oscar for Shakespeare in Love she was wonderful in The Talented Mr. Ripley as was Emma among many of her other films.  I found this part  unsuiting for her.  Don't get me wrong she could sing the role!!  but here is a movie with lesserknown actors and there is Gwenyth Paltrow  a star.  I think she got talked into it by her father director Bruce Paltrow. Another thing I DIDN'T like was how Scott Speedman TV's Felicitynever sang i was waiting for some love theme duet between him and Maria Bello  but he has a purpose in the beginning of the film  but then his character is good for nothing.  He is a good actor and has alot of unseen talent but the role was all wrong for him.  Allinall the characters are unmemorable and I'm sorry I just don't enjoy comedy that gets laughs by killing someone and being on the run from the police and people dying in the end.  Some movies are comic that way  but this movie was flat all the way through and you were left unmoved at the end.".

They could have gotten any amateur actress to do the role and it would have come out the same. The story has some huge holes as well. When Todd Paul Giamattie and Reggie Andre Braugher are in the convenience story and Todd pulls the gun it is implied that they either shoot or kill the store clerk. When the police come looking for Reggie in the final scene and kill him they would have figured out already that Todd was with Reggie and was the second person in the store. Todd would have been arrested for his part in the murder. But no one even questions him and he goes on with his life knowing he took part in the murder of an innocent man. Also the part of Suzi Loomis Maria Bello is despicable. She offer sexual favors to any man to get something in return and Billy Scott Speedman think she's a pig  but in the end they end up together. Any normal guy would stay away from this girl or go get a shot of penicillin. But he ends up with. No matter this is one film I'll pull out again in a year and watch and still enjoy it.".

The three duos are headed for a national karaoke competition in Omaha.It's a bunch of people in this small world of competitive karaoke. The good is that it treats this world sincerely. The characters are rather scattered and doesn't necessarily add up to an exciting story. Ricky and Liv have a nice father and daughter story. Woods and Kane are going crazy. It does have some good singing from surprising sources especially Paltrow and Braugher. This movie is very much like karaoke. You get surprised at how good some of the singing turns out to be but the intangible substance is not always there.".

	schema:reviewBody "For comedydramas or dramedies as one might call this form of film the blend of humor and human characters is essential to creating believable story lines. The way of going about this has been done multiple ways. A frequently picked method of execution is the separate story threads conjoining at the finale direction. Although not anything new it is a common way of telling individual stories that share a common theme and then bring them together at the end for one grand congregation. The most recent movie that came to mind when thinking of this type of storytelling goes to John Herzfeld's Reach Me 2014. Although entirely stepped on by official critics it wasn't entirely a waste of a film. It was quick on the draw for certain parts of its script but it also had a positive overall message about improving oneself as a person using unique characters. In some respects the way this movie was presented felt somewhat in the same vein. Different groups of people from various areas of the U.S. enter a karaoke contest in the hopes of being awarded 5000 as the winner. Along their travels they learn things about themselves and each other. Sounds simplistic enough right? It is in fact but this is not the problem. The issue lies underneath all that once looked at under a closer lens. The screenplay written by John Byrum The Razor's Edge 1984 and Mahogany 1975 suffers from three factors. One is that the movie cannot find a clear tone in its entirety and its three independent story lines. One story is about a selfish karaoke hustler named Ricky Dean Huey Lewis who discovers after his distant wife passed away left him his daughter Liv Gwyneth Paltrow. Then there's Todd Woods Paul Giamatti a rundown salesman who gets tired of the same old same old and leaves his life behind while running into just released convict Reggie Kane Andre Braugher. Lastly is Billy Scott Speedman a guy who just got cheated on and discovers new girl Suzi Loomis Maria Bello who has a knack for getting what she wants by sacrificing her dignity.It's difficult to say which story feels the most sympathetic. The fatherdaughter struggle could've been heartwarming all the way through but instead is kicked around as a nuisance and is only quickly reconciled later on. The adventure salesmanconvict thread only seems to get more uncontrollably rash and negatively misunderstood the longer the characters are on screen. As for the lonely guynew girl parable the play out often feels like a dark raunchy comedy that was meant for another film entirely. With all the inconsistent tones the film as a whole doesn't work that well. What exactly are you trying to be movie? Unfortunately with the confusing tone brings up the second issue with the screenplay and that's the story lines not complimenting each other in some way. How does one find a comparison between these three mismatched story threads? Finally the last issue which is probably the biggest and most noticeable is that the whole concept of karaoke isn't of main focus for a lot of the running time. It's actually more of a backdrop and that's rather sad due to the pros that are about to be listed next.As much as the problems mentioned prior bring down the film a lot there are positives to bring up and these points at least show it had the potential to be better. For one the acting is solid. Every main character has a certain personality and the actor portraying that character fits it nicely. Even Huey Lewis for the small amount of times he's acted plays it cool although arrogant. Paul Giamatti gets more and more psychotic as time progresses and his dialog gets more and more garbled. Maria Bello with a Southern accent is different and her attitude is quite sharp. This is just a few from the tip of the iceberg. Now if only the characters were actually written better. Also just for fun there are a couple of cameos viewers may not be aware of. For one Michael Bubl has an obvious appearance but is still fun to see him doing what he does best singing that is. There's even a quick shot of Terminator 1984 director James Cameron having some fun. Weird but intriguing.The cinematography was adequate too. Shot by Paul Sarossy Exotica 1994 and The Sweet Hereafter 1997 there's a mix of outside and inside shots. However even for inside camerawork Sarossy manages to keep the camera moving substantially without being distracting. This at least gives the audience something to look at and get an idea of where they are and the scale at which the setting is taking place. Finally the music which is a mix of instrumental score but mostly singing was good. The best part of this film is seeing the actors actually sing. Other than Huey Lewis for obvious reasons singing who knew Gwyneth Paltrow Paul Giamatti Andre Braugher and Maria Bello could sing so well? It was very believable and certainly made the performance feel a tad more emotional. Again though if only those characters were written better. The best sung song from the film would be the popular single Cruisin' originally by Smokey Robinson covered by Huey Lewis and Gwyneth Paltrow. A very smooth and enjoyable song. The score produced by familiar composer David Newman was also appropriate. It was anonymous but useful for the scenes required this time.Sadly even with catchy songs sung legitimately by the actors good camerawork and solid acting the entire execution is just a hodgepodge of ideas that don't coalesce as easy as it should have. The individual story lines don't match in tone which doesn't make the film understandable in its message and the whole concept of karaoke isn't focused on like the premise promotes. It had potential but wasn't utilized properly.".

One day Crocodile saves a beautiful girl who tries to kill herself then he rapes her repeatedly and keeps her with him just to use her for his sexual needs. The girl who was abandoned by her former lover resigned to stay with him. The four characters form a sort of strange family. Crocodile is the first movie by Kim Ki Duc. At that time he had just concluded his life in Paris as a painter and back in Korea he reinvented himself as a movie director. Kim Ki Duk said he had not seen many films and he ignored the basic rules of film language at his debut. Hard to believe it when you're watching the movie but it's so he just transfers beautiful static scenes from a pictorial language to the less static celluloid. Watch the water scenes to get an idea of his pictorial visions. The way he portraits the main character then remind me of another great film debut Accattone by Pasolini. Crocodile and Accatone are similar in their suburban romance of decay in their hopeless lives at the margins of society. Is likely that Kim Ki Duk did not know the work of Pasolini but the similarities are the result of the same artistic sensibility.".

	schema:reviewBody "Deep in the Woods akaPromenonsnous dans les bois is a sort of French spin on the glossy postScream teen slasher. All the ingredients are present from the cast of beautiful young men and women the hip soundtrack right on down to the film's packaging which looks straight out of Dimension's art department. However all similiarities end there. Judging this book by it's cover would be a big mistake because Deep in the Woods is more Argento than Craven and is one of the finest examples of European horror to make it on to DVD.The film opens with a long traveling shot of a woman reading Little Red Riding Hood to a child and it's a dazzling introduction with the camera peering through a keyhole and gliding into the room leading up a truly unsettling murder. We are then introduced to our lead players a quintet of actors hired to perform Red Riding Hood for an eccentric millionaire Axel de FersenBerleand and his autistic grandson Nicolas  a spooky kid named Thibault Truffert . As the title suggests Axel's home is an isolated castle deep within the woods and from the moment the group arrives there is an immediate sense of dread with Axel displaying a rather nasty temperment as well as a bit of affection for Wilfried Lecoeur a bizarre gamekeeper named Stephane Denis Levant who hovers over Axel protectively and of course the autistic Nicolas who manages to be creepy just by sitting there. Meanwhile the police are in hot pursuit of a serial rapist who has apparently taken up residence in the 10 kilometers of woods surrounding Axel's estate. Before long we are thrown headlong into a Giallolike murdermystery that works quite well until the final act where the film seems to run out of gas. Still it's quite a ride while it lasts!Delplanque's direction is the real star here. The bio on the DVD says he was only 27 years old when he completed Deep in the Woods and I have to say I was really impressed if not downright shocked by his ability to turn this relatively formulaic tale into a splendidly entertaining visual feast! If this is any indication of what this guy's next project will look like get me my ticket now! From quick cuts long shots ingenious angles and some spectacular pointofview stuff the camera becomes as organic as the characters and in some cases more so. In the hands of a lesser filmmaker this film could have easily been a killbynumbers I Know What You Did Last Summer rehash but Delplanque's unique visuals keep you glued to the screen until the rather unsatisfying conclusion.As a whole I highly recommend Deep in the Woods. It's leagues better than any of it's American counterparts although so is sleeping or watching paint dry and is sure to please fans of Argento Bava et all. The only complaints I have are the same complaints I always have with Giallo's and that is the cardboard characterizations and lack of logic in the script although Deep in the Woods is actually pretty consistent in the latter.As far as extras there are a bunch but they aren't all that. There is the whole castcrew bios section but aside from the director who cares? No one stood out as the next Gerard Depardieu so I really didn't care what Maud Buquet had on her resume'. There are also two trailers which are virtually identical save the French trailer shows full frontal nudity and most of the goriest bits so while it's great to watch wait till you've seen the film before watching the naked ladies over and over. There is also a commentary by Brian Yuzna of all people who is called Horror Expert on the liner notes. He reads from notes scribbled by Delplanque and then throws in his two cents. His commentary is actually pretty cool because he seems genuinely impressed with the director's work but it would have been nice to hear from Delplanque himself even if they had to subtitle his commentary. Rounding out the package are the nice English and French 5.1 audio tracks. Both the video and audio presentation are flawless but since this is a 2000 release I'd expect no less.All in all a decent package of an above average flick by Artisan and a real treat for anyone who has yet to recover from the Dawson's Creek era of the horror genre. Pretty people CAN die in very ugly ways after all!".

The movie has a simple plot as many American Slashers from the 80's but the truth is that the plot is very well developed and even has scenes that you don't expect and twist ending.The characters are filled with clichs but not as dumb as in many American Slashers. I'd say that most of the characters are likable. The villians are also pretty good. The acting is good overall but this movie asks for little talent.The gore is very good actually. I was impressed by some gruesome death scenes and excellent makeup gore. The direction is clever and fast paced. The movie is visually stunning because it has some really great shinny settings and some dark macabre settings. Nice job.Deep In The Woods starts slow but then gains strenght and ends pretty good. This is not a typical Slasher because there is more plot and character development than you expect. There are some creepy scenes and that's enough for making a good Horror movie. Give it a try it's not a French Slasher that ripsoff American Slashers.".

The beginning with a mother her child and a murderer is stunning and kept me glued to my seat. After that we are suddenly in the company of five youths three girls two guys in their early twenties and even if they are quite alright for this kind of movie they are not very interesting. Things perk up a bit when they arrive to their destination a beautiful castle somewhere on the french countryside and meet their host a rather creepy guy in a wheelchair who makes sexual advances to one of the boys. He has an autistic son who stares ominously throughout the picture and he is quite eerie actually. The movie still looks great and there is a fair amount of tension for half an hour or so. But after this introduction of almost all of the characters NOTHING HAPPENS for quite a while. We get quite a few scenes with some tension but no payoff. Since it is a french production they also throw in some female full frontal nudity in a lesbian love scene for those who like that sort of thing I don't... There is a police showing up from nowhere and he disappears just within a few minutes for some reason only to show up briefly at the end. And the play these youngsters perform is truly abominable. If I had hired these actors I would have asked for a refund!The final half hour is a little better when the killings start  they are lensed in a loving stylish and gory way but unfortunately the story never gets really exciting or involving. Real suspense is sadly lacking for the most part. There is a great potential buried somewhere here but apart from the gorgeous visuals and assured directing it is mostly ignored. The acting is okay I guess and most of the cast look good!. Clotilde Courau is an adequate heroine but has tends to laugh hysterically in all the wrong places. It really got on my nerves in the end.The camera LOVES Vincent Lecoeur but he hasn't a lot to work with like most of the others.  minor spoiler  The only part with some teeth is Axel de Fersen the wheelchair guy and actor Franois Berland really hams it up entertainingly in that part. And the old horror movie clich is still valid a man or woman in a wheelchair certainly has some hidden secrets. End of spoiler  After all this you might expect me to dislike this movie. Wrong! I truly enjoyed it for a number of reasons. It's gaudy look and bigbudget visuals it really is a feast for the eyes. One of the first shots is a bird against a slightly cloudy sky and that image is almost worth the price of admission alone. The luxurious and atmospheric score that accompanies all the mayhem is classy and nice. The murder setpieces that are choreographed with assurance and style. Let's just hope that this director can sink his teeth in a better script next time. Then we might TRULY be able to look forward to a great horror movie one that even could become a classic within it's genre!".

The last horror to do that for me was SCREAM. This is the nonliteral adaption of LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD and is poorly marketed as an English teen slasher. I expected to laugh at this rental as I love to do with every other Bmovie. This is more. Simply a great horror movie. Oddly enough I am usually the one jumping in horrors and not my girlfriend suprisingly we both were this time. Cough but I did it in a manly way.  Regardless of the majority rating take in consideration those who liked it. This movie is worth it if you like the genre. Oh and watch it with subtitles. Normally I would say it wouldn't matter THAT much however like MONONOKE it is much better with it's original performances. I hope you give it a chance and enjoy the photography suspense and playfully amusing read gory deaths.".

Oddly enough I am usually the one jumping in horrors and not my girlfriend suprisingly we both were this time. Cough but I did it in a manly way.  Regardless of the majority rating take in consideration those who liked it. This movie is worth it if you like the genre. Oh and watch it with subtitles. Normally I would say it wouldn't matter THAT much however like MONONOKE it is much better with it's original performances. I hope you give it a chance and enjoy the photography suspense and playfully amusing read gory deaths.";

I think about the blair witch project when one of the actors is disappearing into the woods and about psycho with the murder under the shower and moreover Delplanque's making is empty and hollow. Sometimes the movie becomes ridiculous due to a few scenes like the actors' show played in front of Axel de Fersen and Nicolas and a few characters the cop who turns up at the most awkward moment hasn't got a cop's head and mind. As far as the little boy Nicolas is concerned he is bad used. During an important part of the movie he stays still the vacant look  he seems scared by the big bad wolf and he doesn't say a single word. The little actor that epitomizes him hadn't had very much work to do.... Nevertheless Fraois Berland is quite convincing in his role of sinisterlooking character even if the movie doesn't expand his feelings to Wilfried one of the young men. I noticed that Berland seems to feel love to him.... At last the movie succeeds sometimes in creating an ounce of suspense and doubt in the spectator's mind who is the big bad wolf? Who is responsible of all the murders? You'll know the answers at the end of this listless and dull movie....".

Just like so many of the gialli it so closely seeks to emulate the meager plot fails to hold up under close scrutiny. As a matter of fact narrative sense is pretty much the first thing to go out of the window so consider yourself forewarned. The story such as it is concerns a troupe of amateur actors touring with a private performance of their spectacularly misguided expressionist rendition of Little Red Riding Hood with two Reds and two hunters for some reason. They wind up at the palatial mansion of an eccentric wheelchairbound millionaire terrifically portrayed by the subtly menacing Franois Berland and his autistic grandson in the middle of the woods. Setup barely completed the expected yet exuberantly imaginative slaying commences. This is where the movie's main quality resides as nail gun harpoon scalding acid and some not so readily describable objects are put to spectacular use.Youthful director Lionel Delplanque was just 28 when he made this feature debut  since followed by the Albert Dupontel farce LE PRESIDENT  following a number of well received macabre shorts. He shows considerable flair for creepy atmosphere through mood lighting and effectively employed music masking the fact that the material is really stretched rather thin to sustain the full 90 minutes. Fortunately there are flamboyant recreations of classic scare scenes from Mario Bava's BAY OF BLOOD Dario Argento's DEEP RED and even Jean Brisme's unabashedly gaudy DEVIL'S NIGHTMARE. The presence of such arthouse alumni as Denis Lavant the fetish actor of tragically highbrow Los Carax and Marie Trintignant sadly killed daughter of respected actor JeanLouis may give this scrumptiously entertaining flick a sheen of Cahiers Du Cinma respectability but don't let that discourage you.

	schema:headline " A pleasingly nice'n'nasty French horror outing";
	schema:reviewBody "A motley coed quintet of attractive but untalented young thespians are hired by a flaky testy crippled millionaire a wonderfully loud and flamboyant turn by Francois Berleand who resides in an opulent castle abode located deep in the remote woods to put on a play for his scarily quiet autistic grandson. A vicious rapist and serial killer with a foul penchant for butchering lovely young lasses has been conducting a brutal campaign of terror in the same sylvan area. Come nightfall many of the actors and actresses start getting bumped off in assorted ghastly ways. Could it be the serial killer or someone else who's behind the gruesome killings? Director Lionel Delplanque carefully establishes a genuinely spooky and unnerving tone in the deliberately paced opening third before cutting loose with a breathtaking series of ferocious murder set pieces. Better yet Delplanque adroitly blends the brooding midnightinthegraveyard gloomdoom atmosphere of 60's Gothic horror features with the more graphic gagyouwithapitchfork gore that proliferated in gritty 70's fright films into a potently creepy and jarring synthesis. The strikingly savage kill scenes make inspired nasty use of a nail gun a harpoon scalding acid and other deadly implements. And since this is a European movie there's an explicitly pronounced kinky sexual angle to further spice things up stunningly comely starlet Clotilde Courau doffs all her duds to show us what she's got plenty and it's all good man! some fifteen minutes into the picture plus we have lesbianism voyeurism and the fabulously fullfigured Maud Buquet takes a welcome steamy shower. While the story quite frankly suffers from severe lapses in logic and admittedly lacks originality this movie nonetheless still rates as a satisfyingly harsh serious and properly twisted shockathon that does the trick with considerable style and aplomb to spare.".

	onyx:emotionText "A motley coed quintet of attractive but untalented young thespians are hired by a flaky testy crippled millionaire a wonderfully loud and flamboyant turn by Francois Berleand who resides in an opulent castle abode located deep in the remote woods to put on a play for his scarily quiet autistic grandson. A vicious rapist and serial killer with a foul penchant for butchering lovely young lasses has been conducting a brutal campaign of terror in the same sylvan area. Come nightfall many of the actors and actresses start getting bumped off in assorted ghastly ways. Could it be the serial killer or someone else who's behind the gruesome killings? Director Lionel Delplanque carefully establishes a genuinely spooky and unnerving tone in the deliberately paced opening third before cutting loose with a breathtaking series of ferocious murder set pieces. Better yet Delplanque adroitly blends the brooding midnightinthegraveyard gloomdoom atmosphere of 60's Gothic horror features with the more graphic gagyouwithapitchfork gore that proliferated in gritty 70's fright films into a potently creepy and jarring synthesis. The strikingly savage kill scenes make inspired nasty use of a nail gun a harpoon scalding acid and other deadly implements. And since this is a European movie there's an explicitly pronounced kinky sexual angle to further spice things up stunningly comely starlet Clotilde Courau doffs all her duds to show us what she's got plenty and it's all good man! some fifteen minutes into the picture plus we have lesbianism voyeurism and the fabulously fullfigured Maud Buquet takes a welcome steamy shower. While the story quite frankly suffers from severe lapses in logic and admittedly lacks originality this movie nonetheless still rates as a satisfyingly harsh serious and properly twisted shockathon that does the trick with considerable style and aplomb to spare.";

No real thrill a lot of blood and an average of a murder for every seven screen minutes flat acting  this is what one should expect from this flip.If the American studios put their eyes on this script which might happen judging the lack of fresh ideas in Hollywood scripts lately  we might have a better quality American remake of a French movie  for a change!".

The location is perfect for the movie and the handle of colors is awesome. Sadly or fortunately? most of the time this make you forget the clichd plot full with twist ending.The acting is quite average with Franois Berland being the only worth mentioning giving an outstanding performance as the eccentric millionaire. As many reviews have pointed out the director seemed more concerned in the beauty of his composition than in directing his actors.The script is good and even when it has scenes that border absurd like any scene with the clichd cop it also includes beautiful surreal scenes particularly in the killings clearly inspired by Giallo movies.The film is worth a look since the atmospheric suspense it develops is almost a rarity nowadays. Also the beauty of its photography is something that must be seen to be believed. Don't expect too much and you'll be rewarded. 610".

While the nudity is minimum this is a French retelling of a familiar childhood tale. The film may seem overall simplistic but a deeper viewing will show it operates on several levels. I enjoyed listening to the french dialog while using the english subtitles. The film commentary was fair. The musical score is good. The budget on the film was small. This is incredible when there are many comments that the film is more style than substance. Perhaps I'd give more credence to Decoteau's constant poor mouthing if he created stylistic touches similar to Lionel Delplanque. The film is not fast paced. It can be considered slow with a pace similar to The Talented Mr. Ripley but I think it's a masterpiece... but perhaps I was just mesmerized by Lecoeur!".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw this movie I was ten and even then I liked it. The script itself housed very funny one liners particularly form Spacey's character. But I was amazed at how fast the film itself moved. In the first you are following these scientists going to Africa to find a virus outbreak. Next thing you know you're watching a helicopter go head on with a plane.First comes the acting. Dustin Hoffman is stupendous as always Rene Russo plays Robbie with realism Kevin Spacey makes for a good humor man Cuba Gooding Jr. pulls off the green man trying to earn respect and being a badass at the same time. As always Morgan Freeman is wonderful. Any role I see him in is a role I remember. He's always different too neigh does he ever repeat in characterization. Sometimes he's funny sometimes he's incredibly serious. Last but not least comes Donald Sutherland one of my favorite actors to date. He can jump into the shoes of any character including the general trying to protect a secret he knows he shouldn't. One actor whom I particularly enjoyed watching was J.T. Walsh. It's a great shame he died I liked all his stuff from Breakdown to Pleasantville. He is only in Outbreak for about five minutes but he has one of my favorite monologues in the history of film. He commands attention as he speaks.Next comes the story itself. A very todate story. A one all can relate to because it could very well happen. A virus from Africa makes its way here and begins infecting all without a cure. I liked that there was a hero aspect in Sam Daniels. he was the tracker the hunter the curist. Coupled with the story comes the dialogue. Rich underappreciated funny and serious all wrapped into one. As I said before the monologue for Walsh is brilliant. Many lines are etched into my mind and are often used in conversation. Too bad no one knows what I'm saying.I'm a bit surprised this film didn't bode too well with audiences. Mayhap they didn't want to see what could happen who knows? My only complaint is character endings. You insinuate what happens to McClintock and Ford also Sam and Robbie but we don't ever see Casey again. I could infer that he dies but he could very well have survived. I wish there was a way to know.Finally comes Wolfgang Peterson's remarkable direction. I've been a huge fan of his movies since this movie including Air Force One Enemy Mine not much for Perfect Storm but his upcoming Ender's Game should be good.At the end I felt a certain sense of relief and wonderment. But I have to say the soundtrack is rather exquisite. I have always liked James Newton Howard and though the cd is short in time it's a time I cannot forget. Particularly the end theme when it's chopper vs. plane time. What a song keeps me in suspense every time. I like songs that are taken for film trailers as well. It's still too bad not a lot of people know about this movie.9 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Outbreak is a very good intense movie on what would happen if a virus were to go rampant. This movie connects well because of recent world news concerning the Ebola virus and in that regard the film is downright scary. One thing the film did was make sure I develop some healthy habits. That being said this a fastpaced movie that has an incredible cast and a story that is wellwritten. My only qualm about the movie is the helicopter chases near the end as I don't believe they fit the overall story arch.Wolfgang Petersen's film is about how a fictional disease from Zaire called the Motaba runs rampant in a small California village. Now Colonel Sam Daniels and his CDC helpers must contain the virus before the virus spreads beyond the town's border.As mentioned before the film has a very talented cast. It's surprising how many Oscarwinners are in the cast. Dustin Hoffman does very well as Sam Daniels and the man who wants to save the lives of the sick. Rene Russo likewise does a good job as Sam's estranged wife and coworker. Morgan Freeman is excellent as Sam's boss the man who is stuck in the middle. We also get great supporting turns from Kevin Spacey and the villainous Donald Sutherland.Overall Outbreak is an excellent movie that raises the question what if? If any town gets an outbreak of a deadly virus would the government and the military take the same course of action as they did in this film? No matter which way you look at it it's a very scary thought. The film along with 2011's Contagion are two worthy films to watch if you want to be scared the unconventional way. Because trust me this film is scary because it could very well happen in reality. As for filmmaking this is a very intense wellmade film. I rate this film 910.".

	schema:reviewBody "Personally this film is in my top 10. It is a real treat of a movie to watch which not only acts as pure entertainment but also a deeply involving film which involves great performances and some real thrilling moments. It all starts with the wipeout of an African village due to a deadly virus. However the virus is transported to the US by a small monkey which is smuggled by boat. The film then tracks along as more and more people get infected and the virus mutates making it airborne and more of a threat. It spreads like the flu The actors involved are Dustim Hoffman who as usual does an outstanding job. Rene Russo is used well as a love complication. Kevin Spacy is brilliant as the doctor with a sense of humour. Morgan Freeman and Donald Sutherland seem to be having fun with the material and things get interested when they clash at the end. The film although thrilling at times e.g a spectacular helicopter chase and an attempt to break out of the quarantined town is extremely emotional as it does follow a few people as they are diagnosed with the virus. However this is where the film also goes downhill a bit. We are expecting to see the chaos and mass panic of a virus infected town. However things seem abnormally calm and I got fed up of main stars getting infected just to add to the pressure to Dustim Hoffman's character.But overall this film is brilliant I strongly advise everyone tries to watch this. it isn't everyone's cup of tea but is still a brilliant film which I will treasure and keep in my top 10.".

	schema:headline " If the story had been more believable this would have been a very good movie";
	schema:reviewBody "Next to big volcano's erupting hurricanes and other twisters diseases are an excellent source of inspiration for the creators of disaster movies. Why? The answer is quite simple. We all know that diseases like Ebola and AIDS haven't always been among us but that they were present somewhere on this planet. We don't know how it suddenly finds us but it does. And since most of us are very scared of the unknown and we can be pretty sure that not everything has been discovered yet movies based on this subject can be quite believable and scary.When a new deadly disease is discovered in Africa Colonel Sam Daniels of the U.S. Army is sent to investigate it. As soon as he returns he warns his boss General Ford that they should put out an alert on this virus even though it is far away from the USA and not airborne. General Ford refuses since it is contained and unlikely to show up. But what both men don't know is that a monkey carrying the deadly virus with him has been captured and is being shipped to the USA where a man who works at the customs house takes it and tries to sell it to a pet store. But when the sale isn't closed the man doesn't know what to do with the monkey and releases it in the woods near a small town in California. A few days later the man collapses and dies in Baltimore and at the same time a new outbreak is starting in that little Californian town. Colonel Daniels his team and his exwife will do anything possible to find a cure so they can save the population from being bombed by the military but what they don't know is that there may have been a cure all along...Overall the story of this movie certainly isn't bad but sometimes I started to find it all a bit too much. A new disease that mutates that's possible. The army that wants to know more about it there is nothing new about that. But than talking about military conspiracies a president who wants to bomb his own people... that one I really didn't buy. And that's too bad because I'm convinced that this could be a very powerful movie if only they should have left out a couple of elements. Still that's about the worst thing that I have to say about this movie. The acting for instance is OK. With people like Dustin Hoffman Morgan Freeman Kevin Spacey Donald Sutherland... they have found themselves a very nice cast which may well be the best reason why you should watch this movie even when you aren't a fan of disaster movies like me.But not only the acting looks OK so does the direction. With a man like Wolfgang Petersen I immediately have some high expectations of course. He's the man that gave the world the ultimate submarine movie Das Boot and that always makes me hope for the best. Even though this movie never reaches to that extremely high level it sure is better than average. The man still knows how to create the necessary tension and how to keep you interested. So if it hadn't been for the not always so effective story this movie would have scored very high on my list. Now I give it a 6.510 which certainly isn't bad.".

	schema:headline " OK but never gets near its potential because of all its weaknesses";
	schema:reviewBody "When a deadly virus decimates an African village the US authorities attempt to draw a line under the incident and take the line that a reoccurrence is unlikely. However a monkey has become a carrier for the virus and has reached the US. When Jimbo Scott smuggles the monkey out to sell to a pet store he is infected and spreads it to others. Eventually the local town of Cedar Creek becomes overrun and the US form a barricade around the town. With the politicians planning the destruction of the town to stop the virus spreading Col Sam Daniels and his team race to find some other way of stopping it.Whether you viewed in back in 1995 or now where the threat of viral attack doesn't seem so unlikely this film should be gripping on the basis of the material. At points it does have good moments but generally this generally suffers from trying to do too much and having a script that cannot control its subject. For most of the film the virus is almost a concept rather than a real threat and it talks a lot without really delivering. Even when an entire town is quarantined and dying it all remains very calm where really it needed fear and panic to seep into every character and every scene. Sadly it doesn't do this and the film bogs itself down in personal infections squabbling expartners and so on  did we need the main characters to get the virus? Wasn't it enough for an entire town to be dying and for the world to be at risk? Anyway at the midpoint the film suddenly becomes an action movie with helicopter chases and a plot that can best be summed up as 'catch the monkey'.Even with this section the flaws are rife  the action bits are OK but it seems unlikely that finding a monkey somewhere in the US would be a more complicated task! This is not to say that it isn't entertaining because it just about manages to be enjoyable enough but nowhere near the potential that this had. Part of the reason is a plot that struggles from logic gaps and a lack of intelligence and urgency. The lack of intelligence comes from the film completely ignoring the moral complexities that come with such a situation  the film ignores the fact that bad things may need to be done to stop the virus and instead just paints good guys save the people and bad guys bomb the people. The lack of urgency comes from the failure to really make the virus a threat really I needed Cedar Creek to become the US in miniature  having everyone calm didn't do it for me and I needed more than just two cars making a break for it. But then the writing generally isn't up to the task and the heavy dialogue is pretty average at best with clichd lines and far too much 'personal' stuff between the main characters.Even the main 'bad' guy is a fudge as it just paints everything black and white.Another reason that this doesn't live up to its potential is the sheer numbers of faces in the film. Hoffman makes a strange action star but he does OK with what little he is given. Russo is no good at all and happily has little to do but deliver the personal 'involvement' that the film cannot manage to deliver any other way. Gooding is pretty good in a semiaction role and Spacey has some good lines before he too becomes a cheap emotional device. Sutherland gives a by the numbers performance as he has nothing to really work with but Freeman is more interesting because he does. It's just a shame that this talented cast were not used better in this film. An aside that was interesting to me was that Dale Dye has a minor role in the film while also serving as military adviser to the film. He is an interesting man because his career has grown from adviser to being a reasonable actor to becoming a writer producer and recently a 2nd unit director  clearly a motivated and talented man who it would be interesting to listen to talk sometime.Overall the potential is there but it is unrealised. The cast are great on paper but have nothing to work with in a script that delivers average dialogue no real characters no moral ambiguities no real involvement and no sense of scale or threat. It does have some pace at times and it has enough 'OK' moments to be worth watching maybe once but I was annoyed that the potential of the material alone was missed. I think the film can be summed up by the ending  one minute we have an exciting helicopter stand off and the next we have a payoff that is so lazy and so simplistic that I was actually visibly annoyed by it. Passable entertainment if you are in an undemanding mood but it never even gets near the potential it had.".

	schema:reviewBody "I chose to rent this on the basis of its very strong cast. Headed by Dustin Hoffman and Morgan Freeman who also do well the movie also included names like Rene Russo Kevin Spacey Cuba Gooding Jr. and Donald Sutherland. With names like that I had to assume at the very least that the performances would be strong. For the most part they were although Sutherland came off as a little bit flat in the role of General McClintock  which I think had less to do with Sutherland and was more the result of his character being too one dimensional. Otherwise the cast was fine.The story revolved a virus that originated in Africa in the 1960's and was finally spread to the US by an imported monkey released into the forests of California. The disease spreads as far as Boston but is more or less contained in the small town of Cedar Creek California. The disease is obviously a threat and there's a race going on to find a cure for it before it spreads throughout America and maybe the world. Hoffman played Col. Daniels  an Army doctor trying to figure this out Freeman was his friend and superior Gen. Ford.When the focus of the movie was on the fight against the disease this was pretty good. I might compare it a little bit to the more recently released Contagion. The disease in that movie seemed far more threatening but that movie got bogged down in medical jargon and turned into a lacklustre medical mystery. Outbreak avoided being lacklustre and didn't seem to be trying to impress anyone by using big medical terms. I found the fight against this disease more gripping than the battle in Contagion. The two movies also share a similar plot point about the motives of the government.Where Outbreak fails is at the point that it chooses to become little more than an action thriller basically the last 3040 minutes which eventually gets reduced to little more than an extended helicopter chase. That was well done but it went on far too long and after a while I just wanted to get on with the story. It's a big problem when you find the last half hour of a movie to be rather dull. And yet up to that point it was doing a pretty good job with its basic story and frankly I enjoyed watching this more than I enjoyed watching Contagion. 610".

And OUTBREAK  was a major hit at the box office but does this make it a good film ? In my opinion  no . Despite having an all star cast and massive budget and despite the very good pre titles sequence OUTBREAK  is a bad movie.The main culprit for this debacle is Dworet and Pools script  its far too talky . Too much time is dedicated to talking about the virus and not enough time is shown just how awful the virus is . Its made worse by the fact that when people do talk  And boy they never stop talking  only banal words come out of their mouths   Oh my gawd  is very popular as is  Gawd dammit  and not forgetting  Gawd help us all  as they realise time is running out . Undoubtedly the most disappointing aspect to the script is when the town is put into quarantine  theres no real attempt on the part of the screenwriters to bring moral ambiguity or blur the edges of right and wrong with this scenario . With a few rare exceptions the citizens comply with directives . Despite being an extremely unpleasant film THE CRAZIES made far better use of this speculative plot and its moral consequences unlike here where Donald Sutherland is the bad guy because he wants to firebomb a town to stop the virus spreading . If you were in his shoes what would you do ? Would you be a bad person for firebombing the town in order to save the world from the virus ? Ah but theres a plot device that does show Sutherlands character to be the villain of the piece so out goes any intelligent subtext as to what would be the right or wrong thing to do in such a situation .So just to sum up  despite its great cast and production team OUTBREAK is nothing special and at times feels like an overblown TVM".

The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infections Diseases and the Centre for Disease Control are two Federal agencies headed by an exhusband and his former wife rush to stop its deadly spread while figures in the military are prepared to go to extreme measures to prevent it's spread. I saw this movie in the cinema in 1995 with my then girlfriend and we both enjoyed it but for some reason I have never watched it since. Dustin Hoffman is an actor who will rarely sell you short not pun intended he is fantastic in everything I have seen him in from 'Marathon Man' and 'Kramer V's Kramer' or 'Mr Magoriums Wonder Emporium' and 'Tootsie' or his Oscar winning turn in 'Rain Man'. He is always a delight to watch and the fact that he teams up with Morgan Freeman made it a must see. Freeman for years prior to this could do no wrong in my eyes From 'Driving Miss Daisy' and 'Glory' onwards through 'Prince Of Thieves' with Kevin Costner and 'Unforgiven' with Clint Eastwood. And whilst it would be a while before he actually played God. The man was amazing in everything he did. Any movie became promising just by having his name in the cast.Rene Russo was here too and she was establishing herself as a top actress after good performances in 'Lethal Weapon 3' and 'In The Line of Fire'Kevin Spacey squeezed this movie in inbetween 'The Usual Suspects' and 'Seven' Cuba Gooding Jr has a good role too. Also worthy of note is the actress Michelle Joyner has a touchingsadtragic subplot. The actress has a bit of a career as the tragic supporting character in movies. She's the woman in the opening sequence of 'Cliffhanger' with Sly Stallone as well. Then there is Donald Sutherland as the villain of the peace. I have been a fan of Sutherland's for years. He is another actor I will always watch. Sure the movie has a few plot holes and it leaves a lot of loose ends as the credits role. But I was so hooked throughout the movie I'm more than willing to overlook a few flaws.".

Let me tell you something as a 10 year combat veteran...you do not ever ever ever disobey a direct order ESPECIALLY coming from a general. This movie had more soldiers disobeying orders than obeying.  And Cuba G stealing helicopters.  Extremely unrealistic and it makes the military chain of command out to be a joke.

The sense of excitement? We all know he's gonna find the cure and save the day anyway. So in the meantime we are treated to numerous people dying and wellthat's pretty much it. The ending is absolutely and completely Hollywood very improbable actually ridiculous. Dustin's ladylove survives but everybody else dies? Or ALMOST everyone just as Dustin's sweety is about to go in rides Mr. Hoffman with the cure. Not to Hollywood. I guess I'm being a bit hard on Outbreak but I really was very disappointed in this. Hardly a thriller I'm not sure how I'd classify this except a hopeless waste of time.

The writer recovering from a mastectomy goes from Madrid to Argentina and traces the path that the two lovers took in 1934 when the photographer sold his lover into a brothel and subsequently tried to buy her back. The two stories  the writer trying to come to terms with her cancer and the young woman unaware of the fate that awaits her keep you on the edge of your seat as the dual stories unfold. The anger and bitterness of the writer at her own fate recedes as she becomes totally immersed in the fate of the other woman. A great deal of the action takes place on the Patagonian coast where the whales come from nowhere and vanish back into the far beyond. As an expression of the mystery of existence this movie is absolutely shattering. Time and place cross so that you find the two stories converging in a way that is mesmerizing. A heartstopping ending that will etch itself on your memory. This is moviemaking of a first class order. Kudos to everyone actors director and writer for a wholly original experience.

The critics dwell on the screenplay appearing too forceful therefore unconvincing how can the grandmother stand this obnoxiously rude kid? How can it be possible a kid is this obnoxious? Why would she keeps on taking care of him and loving him?I think we've all judged Grandma by our own standards but didn't try to stop and think that perhaps this is how she is. She lives a simple life never complaint never thought of change never thought of improving her life style. She just simply accepts everything that's given and deal with it the way she knows how. Ask any one of us. Would we want to walk miles to retrieve buckets of water everyday up in the mountains? Would we want to have a hole to use as our bathrooms? We would stop and complain become angry at whatever is doing this unfairness to us. To Grandma this is her life and is all she knows. She accepts whatever life has given her and goes on day by day.The film has shown her inability of complex thoughts. She attempts to play with the wood blocks but unable to put the different shapes through the matching shaped holes. She has no concept of shapes but that doesn't describe her as unintelligent it rather suggests a untrainedsimple mind. Unable to work the blocks she simply tilts her head and walks away with no complaint or anger which I don't think I can take the defeat so well. Whatever happens good or bad but life goes on. Grandson knocks over the rice bowl in anger but Grandma immediately bends over and scooped the rice back in the bowl. Rice falls needs to pick it up and eat it. Grandson rollerbladed around the room dirties the floor. There is dirt needs to wipe it off. As simple as that.I deeply admire the grandmother character. I know I can never be like her. I am a selfish and demanding person that easily complain about a lot of little things just like the grandson though not as annoying I hope. It is HER alone that made this movie incredibly and realistically moving.".

	schema:reviewBody "Love makes us lessen our selfish and selfcentered view of the world. Even the smallest kind word or gentle loving gesture has repercussions in the infinite Lama Surya Das Unconditional love is the ability to love someone exactly the way they are and the way they are not without judgment or evaluation. With this kind of unconditional love the well being of others becomes more important to us than our own. Spiritual teachers tell us that if we can silence the constant chattering of the mind we can get in touch with this capacity. I know it is a big stretch for me but for the wise old grandmother in the South Korean film The Way Home it is second nature. This film by Lee Jeonghyang one of Korea's few female directors is this year's biggest boxoffice hit in South Korea and the first Korean film to receive major studio distribution in the United States. The grandmother played with startling authenticity by firsttime actress 78 yearold Kim Eulboon conveys without speaking the redeeming power of love. Like the young Aboriginal girls in the Australian film RabbitProof Fence Kim had never even seen a movie before she was discovered in a talent search among rural villagers. In The Way Home Sangwoo Yoo Seungho an insufferable sevenyear old boy from Seoul is deposited at his grandmother's house in the remote village of Youngdong in Korea's Choongbuk province so the mother can have time to look for work. The grandmother's posture is stooped and her face is withered from years of hard work and she suffers from a chronic disability and cannot speak. She lives in a wooden hut carved into the hillside and the stunning cinematography magnificently captures the beauty and remoteness of this mountain retreat. Sangwoo is about the most spoiled and irritating boy that I have ever seen in films and one that would try the patience of St. Francis of Assisi. Full of streetsmart knowitall he marches into grandma's home with his electronic toys cans of CocaCola and Spam and starts calling her dummy and byungshin retard. When she asks what he wants to eat he tells her pizza hamburger and Kentucky Fried Chicken. She walks all the way to town to buy him a chicken but he won't eat it until he is too hungry to resist because it is boiled in a pot and not fried Colonelstyle.Despite everything the boy does to her including stealing her shoes so she has to walk barefoot and removing a clasp for her hair so he can sell it to buy batteries for his Game Boy she remains centered and loving. Rather than refusing to cater to his every whim she becomes increasingly generous cleaning and cooking for him and overlooking his stealing. He begins to accept the new lifestyle helping his grandmother to thread a needle hang up clothes on the clothesline and shop with her at the market. Gradually he also learns about the meaning of kindness when he sees his grandmother give a package of vitamins to a dying man and when a neighborhood boy Haeyeon Yim Eunkyung forgives him for teasing him about a crazy runaway cow.When Sangwoo's mother comes back to retrieve him though undemonstrative he has clearly changed. I was expecting a saccharine payoff but Ms. Jeonghyang wisely stays away from a melodramatic farewell that would be out of sync with the rest of the film. Besides it isn't about the destination but the journey and Sangwoo in his sojourn with grandma has learned some valuable lessons that become apparent by the end of the film. The Way Home is dedicated to all grandmothers around the world and speaks volumes about the power of lovingkindness to heal the hardest heart. Reminiscent of the Iranian film The Wind Will Carry Us by Abbas Kiarostami this is not just the umpteenth variation on the city slicker versus country bumpkin theme but a refreshing look at what truly makes a difference in life. With a lovely score by Kim Daehong and Kim Yanghee it is yet another example of the emotional power of films that do not require a huge budget mindboggling complexity special effects or even dialogue to work their magic. And magic it is indeedHave you hugged your grandmother lately?".

	schema:reviewBody "I've not seen anyone depict better the bittersweet relationship between a spoiled child and his patient grandmother than Korean director Lee JeongHyang's  The Way Home.' Nothing spectacular happens during sevenyearold Sangwoo's visit to grandmother's home in a rural village after his single mother drops him off.  Changes occur albeit predictably the glory is in the small matters that will matter much to the boy as he matures long after the visit.Why won't this film make it big if I like it so much?

Nothing spectacular happens during sevenyearold Sangwoo's visit to grandmother's home in a rural village after his single mother drops him off.  Changes occur albeit predictably the glory is in the small matters that will matter much to the boy as he matures long after the visit.Why won't this film make it big if I like it so much?

Perhaps it's because of the distance between the two the urban vs the rural the materialism versus the simple living or the selfish versus the selfless  the contrasting styles really make for an interesting comparison in views of the world.There really was a huge chasm that had to be overcome at the start of this movie and the action moved superbly in filling out the moments and telling a very visual story of crossing the chasm.When I read that the director could have spent 2 months filming this movie by shooting in the most efficient manner possible i.e. common location scenes shot all at once but chose not to I was floored. The director chose to shoot this movie in chronological sequence spending 6 months on it in order to ensure the emotional sequence would be intact and exact. What a great choice  and it really showed through the movie making it absolutely AMAZING.This is a very moving movie. I recommend it without reservation.".

	schema:reviewBody "We adopted our son from Korea almost six years ago so watching this film was sort of like watching him. There the resemblance ends...This was a very touching story without a lot of dialog or big payoff scenes about how a loving approach will eventually break down even the most monstrous of kids.The boy IS a brat make no mistake. If he was our son we would never let him get away with some of the stunts he pulls. However I disagree with some of the other comments saying the kid does not change. He subtly changes throughout the movie. First when he he takes down the wash during a rain storm and then hangs it back up... and then re arranges it so it looks like how his grandma did it so she won't know. There was the scene when he replaces the hairpin he stole while she is sleeping. We got a kick out of his attempt to make her breakfast or lunch in bed. He does learn some hard lessons like when the local boy helps him out when he gets chased by the crazy cow even after he played a nasty trick on him.The payoff as it was was when he leaves Grandma. He still can't say goodbye in a way we might like but let's not forget he IS a kid and sometimes it is hard to say goodbye to someone we love when we are that age. However him leaving her those postcards to send him if she needs him shows just how far he has come.True the story does not have a big payoff scene and some comments have complained about it. I agree with what another person said and think that such moments would have been out of character with the movie. As that user rightly said it's the small gestures that build up to the big moment we hope to see.I was surprised when I learned none of the stars were in movies before. I think having stars would have changed the sweet nature of the film.We really liked the movie but boy did we want to smack that kid early on! Happily he comes around.".

Kidding aside I was astonished by how such a quiet film touched me so. It makes me want to reevaluate my disdain for films from the silent film era. I think I will hunt down Metropolis  I've heard critics speak highly of the silent film.  If you scan through all of the other comments you get suggestions for other films similar to Jibeuro The Way Home.From reading the other comments I was surprised to learn that it was the top grossing film of its year in South Korea.  I know nothing about South Korea's film industry but since it exports cars to the USA Hyundai Kia etc I assumed that their film industry would be similarly advanced.  If it is it is a pleasant surprise indeed that such a small film with first time actors ended up on the 'top of the heap'.Imdb's page on the movie says that its available in DVD.  I recommend people rent this sweet tale on a laid back weekend.I plan to adopt a child within the USA's foster care system  many of which are difficult children.  The grandmother character in this film showed me that with patience and persistence over possibly a long period of time one may get through to a difficult child  this film gave me more confidence that I could be successful as a foster parent.".

A low budget tale of a terrifying little brat sent to live temporarily with his ancient grandmother in the country while his single mother looks for work in Seoul. Hollywood would turn a movie like this into pure sap but director Lee Jeonghyang doesn't offer any easy solutions to the ever growing disconnection of modernized urban Korean young people from their traditional ancestry. The film often feels like some big catharsis is just around the corner but wisely never delivers one. The boy changes a bit by the time his mother returns but he only suddenly becomes aware of it when it's too late. And thankfully NO ONE DIES in this movie which is usually the case with dramas dealing with the elderly. Definitely leaves you thinking about things though.Paramount has released this on DVD in North America.".

Hollywood would turn a movie like this into pure sap but director Lee Jeonghyang doesn't offer any easy solutions to the ever growing disconnection of modernized urban Korean young people from their traditional ancestry. The film often feels like some big catharsis is just around the corner but wisely never delivers one. The boy changes a bit by the time his mother returns but he only suddenly becomes aware of it when it's too late. And thankfully NO ONE DIES in this movie which is usually the case with dramas dealing with the elderly. Definitely leaves you thinking about things though.Paramount has released this on DVD in North America.";

	schema:reviewBody "It seems that with the more South Korean movies I see I'm starting to see a trend of great storytellers showing us what's happening instead of telling us or have the characters tell us. Thus is the case with The Way Home where every shot is simple the camera unimposing and yet poignant and breathtaking at the same time. When we see SangWoo walking up to his grandmother's house 10 paces behind her no one has to explain how reluctant he is. The beauty of this film also lies in what's not shown to us. SangWoo eventually meets a young girl about his age who intrigues him. For a good portion of the movie he is trying to make a connection with her but doesn't seemingly succeed. Then when least expected she comes running to him asking where he was because she wants to play with him. Afterwards it cuts straightaway to SangWoo in bed at night giggling with joy to himself of the prospect of his young crush while he coyly covers his face with the comforter a feeling that hopefully all of us has had the pleasure to experience and even as we get older we can still reminisce about something that is just as personal. In this way the film doesn't insult our intelligence and we automatically know that the previous events are the cause for his jubilance. We did not actually need to see what happened between those scenes because the filmmakers trust us to fill in the blanks. Another example is when SangWoo finally verbalizes his feelings for his grandmother which by the way is a good payoff considering what their relationship was in the beginning it consists of a beautiful yet still unencroaching shot where he is crying and all we see is the back of the grandmother's head. In a hearttugging moment all that needed to be done by the actress who plays the grandmother was for her to lift her hand to her face and we already know her point of view of what's going on. There are no intense tearful closeups or strings playing in the background. We already know that she's crying. And yet after all that SangWoo still has trouble saying goodbye to his grandmother when he finally has to leave with his mother witnessing it. In an American film I'm almost certain he would be directed to hug her for dear life and plead his mother to let him stay longer. This kind of real human behavior portrayal is a testament to the insight of the filmmakers who understand that in life expression of something even as beautiful as love can be a difficult thing to do especially in the presence of someone else.On a more personal note this movie struck a chord with me because it gave me insight to a life that is very foreign to me. Me being AsianAmerican is only one aspect of it but I will be the first to admit that I am spoiled up the wazoo and there will be a lot of convincing for me to give up HDTVs the internet etc. It made me truly appreciate people who are rich in spirit and can find pleasure in simple things which is something I always try to fool myself into thinking that I can do. But truthfully I do not know if I could live in that house without all the amenities that I'm used to although the mountain scenery would be a sight for sore eyes.".

Young Kids can very easily ignore the true love they receive.When we grow up we then realise that we can't take everything for granted. I have to say that this is the best Korean film I've ever seen.I can't even pick up one favourite scene simply because there are too many.

It is a great family movie and I can't wait for my twin sister to watch this with me. This movie is subtitled of course and I know that subtitles are hard for some people to take the effort to watch like my boyfriend I think it is just laziness on his partBut this movie is worth every subtitled read so please don't miss this wonderfully touching movie that the whole family can enjoy!!!".

He's just a boy so of course he chooses the latter even though you as the viewer are hoping at every turn that he will somehow be able to see his situation through the eyes of a mature adult.The performances in this film are amazing. The grandmother says nothing yet she is easily one of the most endearing characters to have ever graced the motion picture screen. And even though the boy is a little brat there's something in his eyes and something of him in all of us that makes us want to see him become a better person through it all. Easily one of the best films I've seen in a long time and I'm not even Korean! Enjoyable for all audiences. This is one you can take your whole family to or at least your girlfriend so that she can cry on your shoulder and think that you're a sensitive guy.".

I was really moved by acting of that old lady whose character is an old and ill person but very kind to her neighbors and unconditionally loves her grandson. A boy was also good and even managed to make me irritated. There is not much of a dialog but actions speak louder than words. I cannot say I am very sensitive person however there are some moments that really made me sad and thoughtful. You'd better watch it yourself! I highly recommend this movie! Two thumbs up!".

However while Soonna has a happy and outgoing personality HaJung is often the target of extreme cruelty at the hands of bullies. After her best friend's strange suicide the formerly bright and outgoing Soonna locks herself in her room and becomes a recluse. She refuses to open the door to anyone and acts as if someone is in the room with her. Her personality degrades to the point where her uncle turns to his fiancee a psychiatrist who specializes in hikikomori for help. Hikikomori is a term to describe those who shut themselves off from society in reaction to trauma usually by confining themselves to a room and avoiding human contact. The outcome is terrifying as supernatural occurrences collide with dark family secrets.";

Whilst this isn't a new phenomena in modern Korean horror it is handled very clumsily here and causes the narrative to jar throughout. In addition several overly melodramatic performances take the sting out of any impact the screenplay may have had.Technically the film looks and sounds fine but there is nothing here we haven't seen before. The horror set pieces are neither particularly special or memorable either.If you're a KHorror fan this is one you can safely pass on. If you are looking to get into the genre there are much better places to start eg 'A Tale of Two Sisters' 'Memento Mori' 'Possessed' 'The Red Shoes' 'Someone Behind You' 'Epitaph'.".

The movie is a Korean movie so the entire movie deals with a platoon of South Korean soldiers and their struggles. I have said before that for better or worse every war movie since it's release is compared to Saving Private Ryan and I never thought a movie could top that one. This is as close as I've seen and in some ways may be better. This is far and away better then Letters From Iwo Jima but like both of those movies you are so involved with the characters it is no longer a movie of nameless faces dying but people you feel a connection with.

	schema:reviewBody "THE FRONT LINE is a typical addition to the recent wave of South Korean war movies that strive to explore new avenues on a very famous theatre of war. The last two I saw were WELCOME TO DONGMAKGOL and 71 INTO THE FIRE the former was a politically intriguing exploration of the nature of conflict itself while the latter was a flagwaving crowdpleaser. THE FRONT LINE falls somewhere between the two refusing to demonise opponents while at the same time providing plenty of gritty war action. The earthflying battle sequences are by far the highlight of this film as the screen is transformed into a nightmarish and barren landscape of blownup hillsides dingy trenches and muddy holes in the ground. This is real warfare postSAVING PRIVATE RYAN throwing you into the thick of realistic action and making you feel like you're fighting at the side of the protagonists.It's a pleasure to report that the nonbattle storyline is every bit as watchable as the scenes taking place on the battlefield. As in the earlier BROTHERHOOD much of the plot revolves around the developing relationship between two characters whom the war transforms in different ways one becomes battleweary and resigned the other slightly unhinged and with a real killer instinct. It's a poignant carefullydrawn relationship and one that sustains the running time admirably. Okay so some of the subplots openly copy those of earlier movies the whole sniper thing in particular but that doesn't detract from what is a very good recent war movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Plot North and South Korean troops fight over a meaningless hill just as the Korean War is about to end.The main problem with this film is that it doesn't know what story to tell. It starts out with a South Korean counterintelligence officer being sent to an infantry unit that has been posting letters from North Korean soldiers to their relatives in the South. But then that gets cleared up and we're left with two stories the fight over the hill in which the same three scenes  attack chat look in secret box  are repeated over and over again and a overlylarge subplot about a sniper. The military scenes are all done in the style that Saving Private Ryan made popular which would be fine except that they aren't well thought out enough and lack objectives tactics and incident. Mostly the troops run up or down a hill shooting as they go. To get some idea of the unreality of it all at one point the SK troops lose the hill and retreat in disorder...but when we meet them next only minutes laterthey are all sitting around without their weapons chatting in camp. Isn't there a massive hole in their lines they ought to be guarding?The film constantly lapses into tearjerking melodrama with nearly every death of a character dragged out and plenty of rote speeches War is Bad A Divided Korea is Bad Aren't We All the Same Anyway etc. Plus lots of dreadful tinkly piano music. The unit is completely dysfunctional full of drug addicts the mentally ill and the emotionally unstable. Everyone is forever crying or threatening to shoot each other in one flashback they really do. The characters are all clichs rookie prankster old sweat etc. and the emotional relationships are underdeveloped. There is also a hefty dose of coincidence who would have thought that the protagonist would meet his old buddy and the NK soldier who captured them three years ago on the same battlefield? Really this is just a worse version of Brotherhood Taegukgi a film which did all the same things in this film only much much better. Watch that instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start off by saying that I'm a huge fan of any war moviesdocumentariesTVseriesetc. It's hard to do wrong when I'm so interested in the subject manner. Technical aspects aside my main gripe with The Front Line is that it is so full of clichs overused tropes imitations of other war films and exaggerations. The fat guy as comedic relief? Check. Melodramatic reactions from just about everyone? Check. Blue filter to mean sad and orange filter to mean warmth? Check please. Every other scene! Scenes that looked strangely and suspiciously familiar to Saving Private RyanBand of BrothersGone with the Windstereotypical war movies? CHECK. The film was so over the top and aimlessly drawn out. More than 50 minutes could have been safely cut without sacrificing the plot line. At some point while writing the script perhaps the writers felt the film could use a more personalalmost romantic story. Enter Two Seconds a sniper from the North Korean side. The two male characters and her do not share a particularly strong and personal relationship yet we're forced to place an uncalled for amount of value on their connections especially between her and SuHyeok this is how his name was subtitled in my DVD different from the IMDb listing. The writing and plot lines that somehow felt as if there were too many and too few of the plot lines were masterful examples of trite war film dialogs. Nary a quick chuckle escaped my mouth probably because the joke was stale and again derivative. I am fluent enough in Korean to understand the dialog so I don't think it was lost in translation either. The acting man. It was as if they read a manual on acting from the dollar store in the 1970s and followed it word for word. It didn't feel organic believable or smart for me. Why do all the soldiers have such pearly white teeth? North Korean army men had the same haircuts for the most part but the South Korean army was mixing it up. My favorite questionable moment was when a group of the South Korean soldiers were on the hunt for Two Seconds and finally were within range of her. Hiding behind a boulder of sorts the leader places his head on a rifle and raises it slowly above to see whether she will shootcan see him or not. She shoots and the helmet is knocked off. A few seconds later the audience should some how forget about this because the leader just raises his whole damn head from behind so he can get a better view. Say didn't we just learn that she's going to shoot? If I were him I would maybe move to the other side of the boulder or have some sort of tactic before raising my head. This concern was not addressed in the movie whatsoever because the storyline progressed with this factor being inconsequential.  EunPyo  why wouldn't you at least capture this incredibly dangerous sniper who has been attacking your men? Ultimately I say I don't know what I watched because this movie seemed to be an unsatisfying stew of other works unoriginal characters and dialog and bad acting. I would give them one star but I have to give them credit for the few scenes that were shot nicely. I don't know how well this film was received in Korea but I can't believe this was the best the country could offer for Academy Award contention.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this movie as part of a Peter Cushing DVD box. I did not really expect much but was pleasantly surprised. The special effects which always are a bit cheesy in the Hammer films was really very good but it was the themes covered in this movie really impressed me. The desire to eradicate evil in the world and to create a kind of paradise only to see these great ambitions fail was great. The second theme were Christopher Lee tries to find the scientific basis for insanity to find a cure for it slowly connects to the story line of Peter Cushings research. The ambiance of the movie is very Gothic and illustrates nicely the futile human endeavor to create a paradise. The evil is a part of us and will always remain so. It is also far from the all to common American moralizing horror movies which tend to focus on the perils on premarital sex e.g. Friday the 13th.For those of you who are a bit unsure about the horror genre I would say that this is a great introduction for it is a a very good movie b a nice intellectual exercise ! and c it stars Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee in one of their best performances. Even giving this movie a 10 feels a bit unsatisfactory since I would like to give it more just to show my appreciation of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "How can this image possibly be bad? Peter Cushing star and protagonist of an endless list of horror classics as a dedicated scientist on the verge of unraveling an entirely new evolution theory in which the existence of evil plays a crucial role. And Christopher Lee once again star and protagonist of an endless list of horror classics as the overambitious president of an asylum trying to steel Cushing's ideas to add them to his book about the origin of insanity'. These actors along with their character's vicious professions pretty much guarantee a dazzling horror premise already. If you then add a tight gothic atmosphere overall decent special effects and loads of emotional intrigues you've got yourself an authentic British horror highlight! And The Creeping Flesh isn't even a Hammer production! Responsible for this film is Tigon Productions who also brought us overlooked milestones such as The Witchfinder General' and Blood on Satan's Claw'. Cushing's character Dr. Hildern is the discoverer of an ancient skeleton that might carry the secret of evil! When exposed to water flesh immediately grows on the creature. Hildern develops an antievil vaccine but has to use this same antidote on his lovely daughter Penelope when she finds out her beloved mother spend years in an asylum when she thought she was actually deceased already. Asylum keeper Lee  who's also Dr. Hildern's half brother  takes notice of the bizarre events going on in the Dr.'s mansion and hires somebody to steal the skeleton to increase his own success as an authority in the field of mental illnesses. The only negative comment you could give on this film is that it actually contains TOO much ideas and horrific aspects. Regretfully this sometimes results in underdeveloped plottwists and a lack of continuity. There are enough horrorelements in The Creeping Flesh to fill 3 movies really! But despite these little flaws this is one of the purest and most entertaining CushingLee collaborations brilliantly directed by the talented Freddie Francis Torture Garden' Tales from the Crypt The main actors as well as the stunning Lorna Heilbron are a joy to observe and the film is pretty darn suspenseful too. All in one a must see for the true horror fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "British horror icons Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee costar in this fascinating bit of Victorian pseudoscientific nonsense which will have you entertained until the very last scene. The bad news is that they share very little on screen time in fact there isn't all that much Lee content at all. But that is my only gripe about this terrific horror thriller. If you want to see the two REALLY costar go to their many Hammer classics or the brilliant 'Horror Express' from around the same period as this. Cushing plays a familiar role Hildern a scientist with good intentions who meddles with something he shouldn't have. He shares a home with his adult daughter the sweet and innocent Penelope. She believes that her mother died many years before not realizing the truth that she was a fun loving floozie who flipped out and spent many years in an asylum run by Cushing's ambitious halfbrother James Lee. Hildern returns from an expedition from New Guinea with a mysterious skeleton of a giant creature which he believes predates man. On his arrival home he is greeted with the news that his insane wife has finally died. He still hides this knowledge from his daughter fearing for her own mental well being. Hildern and his assistant experiment on the skeleton and he believes that it can unlock the secret of evil which he theorizes can be innoculated against. When a hysterical Penelope finally stumbles across the truth about her mother Hildern with the best of intentions tries the experimental antievil vaccine on her. This proves to have disastrous results and matters are further complicated when James who both envies and resents his more respected brother gets wind of what is going on and plans to steal the skeleton for his own research. If you take all the science in this movie with a pinch of salt you'll find it to be one of the most enjoyable horror movies Cushing and Lee were ever involved in. A most underrated movie highly recommended to all fans of late 60searly 70s British horror.".

It is well produced acted directedscored and pretty much top drawer in all departments especially at a time when the horror boom had peaked and production qualities were slipping. The plot is Lovecraft like in terms of it revolving around previous race being discovered and evil being considered as a scientific problem not a religious one. One of the best things about the script is that the back stories of the characters all figure into the monster story as it evolves in clever and even kind of meaningful ways. Lee and Cushing are both in good form here as is the uneven director Freddie Francis who shows enough horror to make it work without showing too much to give away the limits of his budget. He knows when to move the camera when to cut etc. The monster is memorable as is the music score. Lots of fun this film but not in a stupid way. The recent DVD release is no frills but features a good looking and sounding version of the film. If you like British period horror films and HP LOVECRAFT definitely find and enjoy this well made and very well written film.".

Lee it turns out is also trying to find the same cure by experimenting on the lunatics in his asylum.Cushing is driven by the insanity and recent death of his wife. He is so paranoid about the infection of evil and madness that he overprotects his daughter.He discovers an 8foot tall diabolical skeleton on one of his expeditions in New Guinea and becomes convinced that evil itself is somehow linked to this figure. He discovers that the skeleton strangely acquires fleshblood when it gets wet. He subsequently develops a vaccination from the blood to supposedly give people immunization from evil and insanity which he then administers to his daughter !.As you can see the plot is highly creative if nothing else. Numerous issues are touched on in the storyline includingThe origin of evil and insanity. Sibling rivalry. The consequences of overprotection. Is evil and madness a disease for which a person can be vaccinated? The lack of ethics of scientists. An escaped lunatic running amok. Having a carnal celebration after years of repression. The 19th century English pub scene alcohol whores and brawls. An 8foot creeping horror.Some would contend that The Creeping Flesh bites off more than it can chew especially at only 95 minutes. Yet I would say that it addresses all of these items very well. I should also point out that it's not hard to follow as another reviewer argues.Two parts of the film are very well done First when Cushing's daughter Lorna Hailbron finally escapes her father's overprotective clutches and attempts to paint the town red naturally. Lorna does an exquisite job portraying the daughter in both her initial naive modest state and later in her wild firsttimepartygirl condition.Second when the skeleton finally comes to life after acquiring all its flesh. You can see it lurking in the moonlight with a hood and cowl. This creepy image brought to memory artist depictions of the Flatwoods monster that supposedly appeared near that West Virginia village in September 1952.Interestingly The Creeping Flesh has many similarities to Horror Express another Hammeresque film made the very same year. Each film stars Lee and Cushing each features an ancient recentlydiscovered artifact that emanates evil a skeleton and a frozen neanderthal respectively each features numerous shots of people analyzing evil blood samples through a microscope. I like both films about equally but give the slight edge to The Creeping Flesh.Don't hesitate to check out The Creeping Flesh if this sounds like your cup of java. GRADE B".

The title sequence featuring a painting that resembles Salvador Dalis worst nightmare is memorable  the man trapped under the coach in a rain storm sequence is memorable  as is the image of the shadow falling against the house  but despite all the imagery and memorable moments the movie lacks a cohesive story One reviewer mentioned Freud and watching the story play out as virginal and repressed Penelope evolve into an entirely different sultry creature its impossible not to notice some sort of Freudian subtext . Alas this doesnt seem to comprise of the bulk of the film and its impossible to work out what the bulk of the movie is about . Is it about the nature of evil ? What was the skeleton originally ? What were the skeletons plans ? You see if you stop to examine the movie in any great depth it ends up giving more questions than answers . I was also confused as to what how the scenario affected the 20th Century . Did the skeleton and Peter Cushings character experimenting on the essence of evil lead to world wars and genocides across the world ? If so then Nigel Kneale wrote a far better  more interesting and more cohesive story on human nature with QUATERMASS AND THE PITNot to be totally negative THE CREEPING FLESH is an entertaining traditional British horror with Christopher Lee  Peter Cushing and a few women with large breasts and I have mentioned the rather impressive imagery . It is rather disappointing if youve seen it with an absence of 25 years  The man getting stabbed in the throat is laughably ungory when viewed today  but Ill still give it 6 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "I want to start off by saying that I thoroughly enjoy most of Freddie Francis' films especially those he made with Hammer. But...I was expecting so much more from THE CREEPING FLESH. With the recent passing of Christopher Lee RIP I wanted to go back and rewatch his films that I loved and also to find some that I hadn't previously viewed. So I stumbled upon THE CREEPING FLESH and immediately sought it out. Maybe my expectations were too high going in but I was a bit let down. As I said I really like Freddie Francis. I also love Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. So it was a nobrainer that I would like this film. And I did like it...just not as much as I thought I would going in to it.The Victorian age set pieces were fantastic. The subject matter of the story though not scientifically accurate was interesting. The acting was great. The atmosphere was pretty good. It was the lack of the horror element that I was expecting and it just didn't seem to show up until the final 15 minutes or so of the film. When it did show up it was great. I just wish the movie would have used it sooner.I also disagree with the many people who feel THE CREEPING FLESH is Freddie Francis' best film. TORTURE GARDEN TALES FROM THE CRYPT LEGEND OF THE WEREWOLF and maybe even THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS and THE SKULL were all better in my opinion. I especially loved LEGEND OF THE WEREWOLF...but I am partial to werewolves.All in all THE CREEPING FLESH is a good movie worth watching especially if you are a Christopher Lee or Peter Cushing fan or a fan of Hammer films even though this is not a Hammer production. It's a good solid 6 out of 10.".

So I stumbled upon THE CREEPING FLESH and immediately sought it out. Maybe my expectations were too high going in but I was a bit let down. As I said I really like Freddie Francis. I also love Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. So it was a nobrainer that I would like this film. And I did like it...just not as much as I thought I would going in to it.The Victorian age set pieces were fantastic. The subject matter of the story though not scientifically accurate was interesting. The acting was great. The atmosphere was pretty good. It was the lack of the horror element that I was expecting and it just didn't seem to show up until the final 15 minutes or so of the film. When it did show up it was great. I just wish the movie would have used it sooner.I also disagree with the many people who feel THE CREEPING FLESH is Freddie Francis' best film. TORTURE GARDEN TALES FROM THE CRYPT LEGEND OF THE WEREWOLF and maybe even THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS and THE SKULL were all better in my opinion. I especially loved LEGEND OF THE WEREWOLF...but I am partial to werewolves.All in all THE CREEPING FLESH is a good movie worth watching especially if you are a Christopher Lee or Peter Cushing fan or a fan of Hammer films even though this is not a Hammer production. It's a good solid 6 out of 10.";

Although he is on the verge of occupational success his personal life is slipping. Determined to win a prestigious science award for his discovery he fails to give ample time to his daughter Penelope Lorna Heilbron who wants to know more about the mother she has never known.Cushing isn't alone in this picture he gets support from fellow horror icon Christopher Lee.

Lee serves as a nemesis for Cushing because he is seeking to win the same science award Cushing is with his research on electroshock therapy. The two men use science as a method of explaining the perverse things they do culminating for Cushing in injecting Lorna Heilbron with an experimental serum he has concocted in order to keep her from the nuthouse. But the serum has the reverse effect it speeds up her route to wearing straitjackets.This is a wonderful horror film the likes of which aren't made anymore as the genre has descended into revolting displays of gore that test an audience's gag reflex. This is story and character drivennot blood and guts drivenwith Cushing carrying the piece. Both horror icons Cushing and Lee are in splendid form and Lorna Heilbron as the female lead is equal to the task of sharing the screen with them. She does a marvelous job as Penelope beginning the film as a meek doasyourtold daughter before transforming into a depraved nutcase that dances in the courtyard in her nighty to the music that only plays in her head.There are enough Darwin principles and theories used in this film to sustain interest of science aficionados. Even with all the science talk this is a quite a splendid film. Keep in mind this is nothing like modern horror films. The monster has a fifteen minute screen time and the lone gore scene is tepid at best when Lorna Heilbron slits the throat of a sailor trying to rape her.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hammer pictures was a great studio for the genre but there were other UK filmcompanies like Amicus and Tigon who often bested the horrorgiant. This is supposed to be the last Tigon film and like the other indieproductions outside of Hammer the director crew and actors were Hammeralumni. When creativity was restricted at Hammer these folks simply went to the other studios to moonlight. If I was to bet money on it I'd say this is the mostsatisfying CushingLee vehicle of the 1960s70s. But by 1973 Gothic horror was ending and modern horror had arrived. Hell House would be a smashhit but this kind of horror revolvingaround an old manse was over and was reflected in the poor boxoffice of this movie.The Creeping Flesh is a strange film about the origins and nature of evil and it is therefore a philosophicalhorror that resembles Lovecraft's cosmichorror. It has some parallels with the story of Cain and Abel too. As in Mary Shelly's Frankenstein this is a cautionarytale we shouldn't be blind to our own shortcomings when investigating the unknown in science. We should be certain of why we are searchingout a particular knowledge and we should know who we are and where we stand morally inrelation to others. Also some things in nature should be leftalone.Cushing plays Victorian Dr. Immanuel Hildern a museumpaleontologist who receives an ancientskeleton from New Guinea that looks almost prehuman. It has an enormous cranium that looks monstrous. A legend surrounds the skeleton that when a great rain comes it will reanimate and plunge the world into darkness which is why the remains were sealed in a cave away from water. Hildern suspects it is a concentrated evil from which he may be able to create a vaccination against evilitself a strange idea that... Evil is a disease. It appears he has lost his wife to a malevolentinsanity and fears his daughter will succumb to the same evil. Meanwhile someoneelse wants to study the skeleton...As with most Gothichorrors this is a story of an aristocraticfamily indecline. His halfbrother James played icily by the legendary Christopher Lee runs an insane asylum unethically and there are hints that he treats his inmates to hideousexperiments and torture. In the beginning Cushing's character seems less like Lee's but this illusion soon fallsaway. From the start it's clear that this is a family tainted with evil and that it is dying. There is some hope earlyon that Immanuel Hildern can reverse this but he is flawed like Lee. So what does the film say about evil? That it is ambiguous and untouchable? That we are guidedbyfate? I think the filmmakers leave it to the audience to decide.So while it is hinted that the skeleton is somehow the source of all evil...a concentrated evil Dr. Hildern and his brother's misguidedattempts at greatness express that the evil was already withinthem before the introduction of the skeleton. It offers that evil is intangible which is odd for a film that is both Gothic and a bit modern. Gothic horror seems like antimonarchist propaganda today and a lot of it isit's specific in WHAT the evil is so there is a contradiction within the story. Still it fuses the Gothic and the modern well and that's a lot harder than it sounds.So allinall not a bad film with some incredible exposition on how evil grows. From the scenes where Cushing accidentally spillswater on the skeleton to the stopmotion growth of flesh on dead bones to the robedcreature seeking Hildern and his family this is entertaining and eerie. Of course the daughter is torridly hot as in the Hammer films and there is a strong sexualtension that's both repellent and attractive. Many of the shock scenes are wellconceived and staged including the subplot with the murderer runningamok from the asylum. By the end of the film everyone has been touched by evil or is dead.The Creeping Flesh also has a great cinematography helped by the fact that the director Freddie Francis Evil of Frankenstein Tales from the Crypt was a DP himself. Many of the tableaux are shot in a wonderful lowlit atmosphere and the makeup is very good for 1973. If the film suffers from anything it is toomany ideas in 94 minutes! The Sony DVD is an excellent HighDefinition transfer widescreen with no real extras. It's a bit overpriced but worth it for such a great classic of Gothic horror. A commentarytrack would have been a good minimaladdition Mr. Francis is stillalive he is 91 asof this writing 82006.".

From the minute that Peter Cushing opens that crate he's brought back with him from New Guinea you just know nothing good is going to come from that bizarre looking skeleton. All it takes is having that thing laying there to create effective atmosphere. The slight sound that can be heard every time Freddie Francis gives us a close up of the thing only adds to the unease. And when you throw the shots of the evil blood regardless of how preposterous the idea is Cushing is able to draw form the creature you've the foundation for a very nice Gothic horror film.The subplot involving Cushing's daughter going mad is also well done. In large part I think the credit has to go to Lorna Helbron. She is believable as both the demure obedient girl and the tantalizing violent woman. I bought her genteel table manners as much as I did her wild gestations from behind bars. It's really a nice performance.The rest of the cast is more than up to the challenge. Any Gothic horror film is better when Peter Cushing andor Christopher Lee are in the cast. By Lee's standards his performance is what I would call average. Much of the blame for that has to be the attributed to the script as Lee is given very little to do. Cushing on the other hand is dynamite. He goes through a range of emotions and satisfactorily pulls them all off. I especially like the ending of The Creeping Flesh when you see that Cushing has been talking so sincerely and earnestly to  well never mind  that would spoil it.".

This combination is usually pretty interesting and this film is quite interestingeven if it is also a bit silly now and then.The story finds Cushing as a scientist of sorts. He seems to be a combination of a paleontologist and biochemist back in the late 1800s. When the film begins he is arriving back home with a skeleton he unearthed in Indonesia. Oddly the skeleton is an enormous humanoid but it is much older and radically different from anything found in the past. Odder still if you know much about skeletons you know that once the flesh decays the bones all become disconnectedbut the one in this film is fully articulatedeven after a bazillion years in the ground. In other words the ligaments and tendons and muscles holding everything together decompose after death and the bones naturally all fall apart from each other. However like I've seen in a lot of bad horror movies over the years such as TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE the skeletons are fully articulatedlike some sort of Halloween novelty skeleton. This is a silly mistake but one that will most likely only bother doctors biology majors and compulsive film nuts like myself.For some inexplicable reason Cushing is convinced that the skeleton belongs to a creature of pure evil. His reasons for this are pretty vague as is his theory about evil itself. While working with the skeleton he washes off some dirt and soon flesh begins growing around the portion he dampened!! Quickly he cuts off this finger and puts it in water. Soon it has grown into a huge flesh covered finger and it actually bleeds! The blood naturally is not normal blood...it's EVIL blood.A parallel story occurs in Cushing's house. It seems that years before Cushing's wife went mad and was incarcerated in his brother's hellish mental hospital. However he has always told his daughter that her mother died in order to spare her from the stigma and pain. In an odd twist when the daughter accidentally discovers this she almost immediately turns into a sluttish psycho murdererthough she'd been previously normal her whole life. And when the brother Lee looks at her blood under a microscope it turns out she too has evil bloodjust like the skeleton's! There's a lot more to the story than thisespecially a plot involving Lee experimenting on his own patients. Up until the end most of the film makes no sense at all and there are lots of inconsistencies. However believe it or not pretty much all the problems with the film are explained away well by the twist ending which is highly reminiscent of THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI. So be sure to stick with itthe mistakes and problems just seem insurmountable until late in the film.An interesting and unusual film.".

His return home delights his daughter Penelope Lorna Heilbron but Emmanuel has little time for family reunions as he made a tremendous discovery in New Ginuea a huge man like skeleton that may change everything we know about Neanderthal man  our own origins.

The somewhat lethargic script by Peter Spenceley  Jonathan Rumbold which takes itself extremely seriously tries to be a bit too ambitious for it's own good  in the end I felt The Creeping Flesh came across as various loose sub plots which come  go  are all very tenuously linked together I mean there just doesn't seem to be a single unifying thread throughout the film as it switches direction  narrative on several occasions. At first it starts like a monster film with the Skeleton which regrows it's own flesh then it becomes  good vs evil morality tale as it's blood is found to be pure evil  then it goes back to be a monster film for it's climax which sort of leaves things hanging in the air a little bit  it isn't even made clear whether what happened was true or whether it was the mad ramblings of nutcase. There are other various sub plots to confuse things even further like the death of Emmanuel's wife the effect it has on his daughter his half brother trying to steal the skeleton for himself  an escaped lunatic from an asylum who has no relevance to the story at all. Having said that it's well written has some very effective moments in it  is definitely something a bit different even though it seems the filmmakers didn't quite know what to do with the bizarre ideas  themes.Director Francis does a decent job  I absolutely love period British horror films the production design is fantastic from the sets to the props to the costumes  they all have great detail. On the negative side of things I'm not convinced by Christoper Lee's fake goatee beard the creatures severed finger looks more like a penis  the day for night shots look terrible as they usually do. There's a nice atmosphere  there's some scary  creepy moments as well. The creature when seen at the end looks pretty good actually  quite gross you can tell it's a static rubber mask but it's a pretty good one all the same. Forget about any gore they cut the creatures finger open to experiment on it but that's as gory as it gets.Technically the film is very good with excellent production values decent special effects good cinematography  good attention to detail in the period setting. The acting is good from a great cast including the always watchable Peter Cushing  Christopher Lee are worth the price of admission alone.The Creeping Flesh in my opinion is not a classic British horror  it's a touch slow going at times but it's something different yet still retaining that 70's Gothic Anglo horror feel  look it's not always a total success at what it tries to do but it's watchable enough.".

The script is kind of silly. Most of the first hour is all talk and the revelation of what the skeleton really is is absolutely ridiculousbut Cushing manages to put it through. It's more of an oldfashioned horror movie than the blood and gore movies Hammer was putting out at the same time. The rating is PG and there are only two bloody but tame throat slashings. Also the look you get of the monster actually made me jump. I loved it the first time I saw it on TV edited back in the early 1980s but unfortunately it doesn't hold up on a second viewing. The plot was a whopper. I could handle it the first time but the second time around I thought it was just dumb.Good acting all around helps. Cushing and Lee playing brothers! are just greatbut I think those two were incapable of giving a bad performance. Lorna Heilbron was also good as Cushing'd daughter Penelope. She has do a complete turnabout with her character halfway through the movie and she pulls it off.Worth seeing for horror fansespecially people who like oldfashioned ones.".

	schema:reviewBody "I mean can you really go wrong with a 70s horrorscifi flick by a veteran Hammer director starring Peter Cushing Christopher Lee and some kind of huge undead creature that is the embodiment of evil? No no you can't.The story centers around Professor Hildern Cushing an ultimately wellmeaning but deeply sad Victorianera scientist who brings home the remains of some kind of humanoid being from an expedition to New Guinea. In his studies of the mythology of the region and of the remains themselves he becomes convinced that the bones are what remain of a huge malevolent giant  a biological representation of evil itself  that will be reanimated by rain. He tries to use this discovery to better the world starting with his own small family but things don't go quite as planned SPOILERS! I'm always a big fan of the whole theme of mad scientist gone wrong despite the fact that those movies often have big plot holes and this film is no exception. In some cases it's a scientist driven to immoral acts because of an irresistible urge for power money invincibility whatever but in some cases like this one it's the urge to improve the world that steers someone in such a calamitous direction. It gives the movie a quality of sadness that is interesting to me.I loved all of the simultaneous battles between good and evil. The battle of this mysterious mythical creature embodying evil and needing to fight against the good of the world. The smaller scale battle of Professor Hildern  wanting to turn the world into a paradise  vs his halfbrother Dr. James Hildern Lee wanting his own recognition and fame even at his own relative's expense. The more complex battle of Professor Hildern wanting to keep the truth about his wife from his daughter Penelope Lorna Heilbron seemingly for her own good.Christopher Lee naturally brilliantly plays the cloaked halfbrother who runs the asylum and Peter Cushing is fantastic per usual.The very Gothic settings camera work and even some of the special effects are pretty great. It's a fairly low budget horror film from the 70s so the special effects aren't exactly going to rock anyone's world but I thought the scene where the flesh first formed on the finger bone was pretty impressive considering and Cushing staring perplexed through his magnifying glass was a great touch.The entire concept of evil being physical rather than psychological  a disease rather than a mental disorder  I thought was in some ways surprisingly complex for a horror film. It gave an air of hope  of being able to defeat what had always seemed to be unstoppable.There were some interestingly conservative touches though I could be wrong to both Professor Hildern's wife Marguerite's Jenny Runacre mental collapse and his daughter Penelope's. Not much is shown of either aside from them becoming extremely uninhibited particularly when it comes to attracting and enjoying attention from men. I mean yes Penelope starts to enjoy being physically cruel with no provocation but her initial madness is simply her finally breaking free of the bonds in place by her father trying maybe navely definitely unfairly to protect her. And her scratching the one dude's face up and slitting the other guy's throat were pretty justified from what I could see.The atmosphere is pretty great throughout but particularly during the ending scenes. I loved the horsedrawn carriage chase through the rain with the added tension of knowing the skeleton was quietly reanimating. When Professor Hildern finds the tipped carriage and sees the hooded monster silhouetted up ahead with thunder booming and lighting flashing awesome. One of my favorite shots was when you could hear the creature shuffling towards the house and see its shadow first moving horizontally and then becoming larger and larger as it approached without seeing the creature itself  so good. And the look of terrified surprise on Professor Hildern's face as we view it from INSIDE the hollow creature good times.And THE ENDING. I actually for once won't spoil it here but DAMN I loved it. It almost leaves it up to your interpretation but there's one telltale clue at least from the way I interpreted it that makes it in some ways even more horrifying than the alternative. Great twist.All in all a solid watch. The fear is more impending more slowly creeping than some might enjoy with more deep concepts to chew on in the meantime but I really appreciated that.".

Cushing and Lee are simply wonderful especially in their scenes together. And they're directed by renowned cinematographer  filmmaker Freddie Francis who also guided the two of them in The Skull from 1965. The amusing interesting screenplay is by Peter Spenceley and Jonathan Rumbold who create a few subplots and mix them together with decent results. One of the through lines is Emmanuels' accidental discovery that his newly acquired skeleton can be restored to life!A company named Tigon made this one and it's good enough to compare favorably with a lot of the period horrors cranked out by the more famous Hammer Studios and Amicus productions. The period detail is respectable the lighting by Norman Warwick is just right and the music by Paul Ferris is excellent. Makeup artist Roy Ashton does typically fine work. The film is also somewhat gory but it won't be too hard to take for more squeamish viewers.Gorgeous Heilbron delivers a transfixing performance as the daughter. The exemplary supporting cast also includes George Benson Kenneth J. Warren Duncan Lamont Harry Locke Michael Ripper whose role is much too brief Catherine Finn and Jenny Runacre.It's all worth it just for the delicious twist ending which does help to smooth over any holes there might be in the story.Seven out of 10.".

Warren Duncan Lamont Harry Locke Michael Ripper whose role is much too brief Catherine Finn and Jenny Runacre.It's all worth it just for the delicious twist ending which does help to smooth over any holes there might be in the story.Seven out of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "Tigon films never made a secret of being inspired by the larger Hammer horror company this film is perhaps most indebted to their rival. It stars Peter Cushing Christopher Lee and briefly Michael Ripper and the story's Victorian setting is familiar to Hammer fans. I don't know how successful this was upon release. It was actually Tigon's final horror outing the company having all but ceased by the time of the film's release having been rebranded as the very different The Laurie Marsh Group. I have a feeling it would have been more lucrative had it been released ten years earlier when such a style of storytelling was in its prime.Cushing plays Professor Emmanuel Hildern first seen minus toupee alongside elegant actor David Bailie in an almost psychedelic featureless laboratory set relaying the story we are about to see. Lee is typically and masterfully cold and officious as brother James whose ambition far outweighs any loyalty to his sibling. The charming Lorna Hailbron is Emmanuel's daughter Penelope stoically attempting to keep the family home alive despite debilitating finances brought about by her father's experimentation into the dawn of creation. Emmanuel is fiercely overprotective of his daughter following his wife's descent into madness he fears the condition may be hereditary. As it is his deception is the instigator of Penelope's rapid decline. Too rapid in my view  for years she has been the most sensible family member suddenly she is certifiable.Such experiments regurgitate the skeleton of a previously unknown outsized monolithic humanoid creature. The interesting thing is unlikely as it may seem any contact with water puts flesh back on the bones and brings the old boy to life! Energised by this revelation Emmanuel removes one of the creature's fingers in order to investigate further some suggest a certain phallic similarity with the outsized digit which in the hands of lesser an actor than Cushing could result in chortles from the audience during his examination of the prop. We are treated to many closeups of the dormant monster as if he is observing throughout.This is lovingly sedately directed by Freddie Francis and seems to be well budgeted. James' asylum setting is impressive as is the lively plight of escaped inmate Lennie Kenneth J Warren although this entertaining sidestep has little to do with the plot.A word for Cushing's performance. It's a given really that he always puts in a fine performance but this fragile broken soul is amongst his best. The ending and the leadup to it is true classic horror with the creature finally animated and seen in restrained longshots. Cushing sobbing and defeated after the creature has come to claim its revenge is heartbreaking.".

Emmanuel was always the favorite of the two siblings the one destined to achieve greatness so it's with great pleasure that James tells him that he is in the running for the prestigious Richter Award. In addition he will no longer fund Emmanuel's transcontinental trips. I'm not familiar with most horror predating 1980. I rate this somewhere between 6070 about a 6.510. I've never watched a movie horror or other genre with so much anticipation and dread for what may come. The climax is truly a frightening one. The suspense is nailbiting! Lee and Cushing are great but it's the beautiful Heilbron who steals the show. I want to watch more films she stars in. I recommend this to horror fans who want to explore the classics. No gore torture or loud music cues to instill a false sense of fear. I liked it!".

	schema:reviewBody "The look of the murky and desolate school corridors where sunlight cannot reach during the afternoon lessons had always given me the creeps. This movie was on the silverscreen while I was in Grade10 in Turkey. My friends have gone to see it yet they were so indisposed afterwards. However couple weeks before its screening we've seen a JenniferLove Hewitt flick I Still Know What You Did Last Summer that was when we had finished that horror movie with belly laughs and roll in the aisles. I was curious to see and to know what was not to laugh of somebody's frightening of ghosts. Somehow even though my friends were irritated of it Whispering Corridors made a good boxoffice hit in Turkey. It must have inspired some serious masses that in the first decade of 2000s' Turkish HorrorSuspense Fiction have used remarkable pieces from Whispering Corridors whether directly or indirectly. Then Taylan Brothers adapted a lowquality copycat from this already adapted adaptation. Making double adaptation for a piece of art didn't make sense on the payoff and the viewer felt it thoroughly. No one ever liked this adaptation and it remained as a pathetic Turkish version Okul2004. That failure of Turkish cinema made me search for its origin. Yet till yesterday I hadn't have a chance to see this psychohorror.Now watching it for the first time after 10 years of its release it's clear to realize that Horror is no Horror if there is no Psycho in it. Whispering Corridors is parapsychologically successful and realistic. People know in secret that these types of extraordinary and supernatural happenings do really occur in real life.The story takes place on a countryside allgirl private school in South Korea the year 1998. Presumably on a Sunday the day before the new semester starts the president of the teachers' committee of the schoolMrs.Parks is getting killed right after the killer stole the 1993 and 1996 student yearbooks. We the viewers get 3 clues of the killer that she has the capitals P.C. from her desk she commits her murders barefoot and she carefully leaves no evidence making the murders seem like suicides. After the semester starts one of the male teachers of the school entrusts a class of girls with a task to hush up the rumours about the suicide among the students of the whole school. For this purpose every week the committee of teachers choose the clerk for the week out of students of the same class. Meantime there is a very strict racism storming in the air among the teachers for the student children of the Shaman families. A girl from the chosen class whose mother is a Shaman priestess begins getting affected while she used to call spirits to reveal the exam scores before they're announced or reveal whoever is virgin or not among her friends. That way her friends always show respect to her frightening of her but loving her at the same time. Soon we get more clues about the murderer after she kills the night guard of the school. The murderer is very unpredictable and the best thing is that each time when the mystery takes control on us trying to solve the murders the murderer is getting killed. So technically the spirits which curses the school and those students who are cursedeach time a new student were the actual offenders. One by one girls of the chosen class lose their minds and in order to kill their victims they must trade their souls in with the spirits so that the spirits can manipulate them kill their victims.Technical aspects are very low due to the low budget. Even though the audio quality is considerable. To capture the actors' voices more clearly I don't think the film crew had a boom operator though. The tensioned atmosphere is the true accomplishment of the camera movements some degree of lighting adjustments camera locations and chosen angles. Storytelling is very ambitious that despite the editing is mediocre still the film keeps its fluency. Only watch out for the last 20 minutes! It becomes a captivity of total paranoia.While I was staring emptyminded at the closing credits witnessed on how easy the deepest emotions of a human heart can destroy everything in one's life I asked myself how in earth can someone make a movie like that so as to reveal what's unseen of the psychopathic murders. What a brave and hard job! What an amazing concept! If only it could have been produced more attractive to the viewer with a better screening quality a better acting a better screenplay a better editing. The total commitment and selfbelief of the production crew carries its importance to the highest standards there we are taught how important the preproduction phase of a raw production material which was based on a very widely known and so told school rumour.If producers who are only looking for gaining boxoffice receipts with a horror movie and they hesitate to scratch and scrabble the concept of the fear then they cannot reflect the reality or it just remains unreasonable as a work of imagination. For Yeogo Goedam didn't fall into this trap it's a mustsee cult horror.".

People know in secret that these types of extraordinary and supernatural happenings do really occur in real life.The story takes place on a countryside allgirl private school in South Korea the year 1998. Presumably on a Sunday the day before the new semester starts the president of the teachers' committee of the schoolMrs.Parks is getting killed right after the killer stole the 1993 and 1996 student yearbooks. We the viewers get 3 clues of the killer that she has the capitals P.C. from her desk she commits her murders barefoot and she carefully leaves no evidence making the murders seem like suicides. After the semester starts one of the male teachers of the school entrusts a class of girls with a task to hush up the rumours about the suicide among the students of the whole school. For this purpose every week the committee of teachers choose the clerk for the week out of students of the same class. Meantime there is a very strict racism storming in the air among the teachers for the student children of the Shaman families. A girl from the chosen class whose mother is a Shaman priestess begins getting affected while she used to call spirits to reveal the exam scores before they're announced or reveal whoever is virgin or not among her friends. That way her friends always show respect to her frightening of her but loving her at the same time. Soon we get more clues about the murderer after she kills the night guard of the school. The murderer is very unpredictable and the best thing is that each time when the mystery takes control on us trying to solve the murders the murderer is getting killed. So technically the spirits which curses the school and those students who are cursedeach time a new student were the actual offenders. One by one girls of the chosen class lose their minds and in order to kill their victims they must trade their souls in with the spirits so that the spirits can manipulate them kill their victims.Technical aspects are very low due to the low budget. Even though the audio quality is considerable. To capture the actors' voices more clearly I don't think the film crew had a boom operator though. The tensioned atmosphere is the true accomplishment of the camera movements some degree of lighting adjustments camera locations and chosen angles. Storytelling is very ambitious that despite the editing is mediocre still the film keeps its fluency. Only watch out for the last 20 minutes! It becomes a captivity of total paranoia.While I was staring emptyminded at the closing credits witnessed on how easy the deepest emotions of a human heart can destroy everything in one's life I asked myself how in earth can someone make a movie like that so as to reveal what's unseen of the psychopathic murders. What a brave and hard job! What an amazing concept! If only it could have been produced more attractive to the viewer with a better screening quality a better acting a better screenplay a better editing. The total commitment and selfbelief of the production crew carries its importance to the highest standards there we are taught how important the preproduction phase of a raw production material which was based on a very widely known and so told school rumour.If producers who are only looking for gaining boxoffice receipts with a horror movie and they hesitate to scratch and scrabble the concept of the fear then they cannot reflect the reality or it just remains unreasonable as a work of imagination. For Yeogo Goedam didn't fall into this trap it's a mustsee cult horror.";

Before she died she telephoned her young coworker and told her that JinJu is here. She's still alive! Baffled by this the young teacher embarks on an investigation to figure out what exactly is going on at this school. She finds that the ultracompetitive students are not what they seem on the surface.In its trailer Whispering Corridors is credited as being the film that started the Asian Horror Explosion. I'm not so sure about that as Ringu is far better known and appears to have been released first. However this truly is an excellent supernatural story that deserves as much recognition. While the movie leans heavily on drama and mystery the frightening scenes are very effective. Those that take place in the long ominous hallways in the empty school at night as well as in the condemned art studio are incredibly creepy and atmospheric.The performances by the entire cast especially the young actresses are excellent. Throughout the film we are introduced to several of the repressed but competitive girls. There's the insecure nerdy girl who believes in magic her best friend who is desperate to be popular and secretly wants to be an artist the prettiest girl who is also at the top of the class and the viciouseyed girl who is second in rank and never utters a word. As the body count increases the viewer is given several hints as to why each of these girls as well as the violent and lecherous principal could be a suspect.The film culminates with a sappy sequence that will likely cause you to eyeroll through it is duration but it is easy to forgive this melodrama after seeing the chilling final shot of the film. The chronology may be confusing for some though it is much easier to follow than many Asian supernatural horrors! but all the sideplots are nicely tied together in the final sequences. What makes Whispering Corridors especially interesting is its strong underlying message of solidarity above competition in young women. Not only was I surprised to find social commentary of this type successfully incorporated into a horror movie but I was doubly astounded to find it in one from South Korea. Yet the messages here are especially potent because they are universal. I wish this unique horror film could find a larger audience because it deserves to be seen by more people.My Rating 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Whispering Corridors is a totally scary and entertaining horror flick from Korea. It's easy to see why this was the first of an explosion of Asian Horror films like the Ring and the Grudge because the director Park KiHyung is definitely well versed in American horror and uses his understanding of the genre to make the movie really appealing to any American horror fan. Whispering Corridors is the first in a trilogy of films. The first death in the movie and all of the rest are really reminiscent of the slashers like Friday the 13th and other late 70's early 80's American horror which are the staples of the genre. If you like horror films and have seen the best ones you'll immediately see why this one fits right in to that group. What's really cool about it is that there's no CG computer generated effects. All of the blood and deaths etc. are all done with real actors and it's almost more believable than the overthetop current American horror genre. There's something so tangible about the blood in the film. It's bright red and creeps the viewer out in a way that CG children running around like in the Grudge could never fully achieve.The whole film takes place around an all girls school and with girls in uniforms and mysterious murders you've got the makings of a great horror narrative. The first 20 minutes really suck you into the story as KiHyung moves the camera much like 70's DePalma or HitchcockIt's seductive. The school building becomes horrifying in and of itself. The way KiHyung presents the school makes it like an evil edifice similar to the Overlook Hotel in Kubrick's The Shining.The tone is similar to Rosemary's Baby in that the girls are consistently trying to figure out what the problem isthey want to get to the bottom of it but the forces out of their control i.e. the school teachers get in their way and they get in trouble. The grainy look of the film and the way the sound designscore are used is totally an homage to the classic horror films of the 70's. In the movie the Korean school system is depicted as an evil force that represses the girls abuses them and ultimately is the motivating force that makes the one girl commit suicide and become the ghost who murders her enemies throughout the film. The performances by the girls are great. And the colors of the film are so dreary that you can't help but feel like you're there. The end of the movie has a really amazing image of the two main girls alone in the classroom with blood pouring out of the walls and the ceiling. Overall this film is really entertaining and psychologically interesting and will scare the crap out of you. The Tartan DVD release is pretty awesome. It has trailers for a lot of Asia Extreme films 5.1 surround sound photos and EnglishSpanish subtitles.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really didn't expect much going into this film. I think I'd been burned by too many mediocre horror movies featuring ghosties in the past so to watch one of the grandmamas of the modern Asian ghost girl genre had me bracing for every trite conceit that could be thrown my way. Whispering Corridors surprised me. Rather than really being a flashy story about hauntings and killings it turns out more to be an exploration of the impact of the brutal South Corean high school system on the youth that attend it using the horror genre as the medium.First of all I have to say that I wasn't frightened during this film. Not even for a brief moment. Rather than suspense and thrills I was hooked into the mystery and dramatic elements that were at play. The way that the story is spun there's no question as to who the ghost was or why it's doing the haunting but rather what the ghost's secret is. Now astute viewers will pick up in the first few scenes of the film what we're looking for and I even managed to make the correct guess at italthough I really just had to watch to have my guess confirmed.Another interesting aspect of the story is that there are three stories going on. One about an artistic student trying to express herself in a system that cares little for her expression another about a former student who returns as a teacher trying to make peace with her memories and the last about a student rivalry between a model student and the secondrank peer. The strength of this approach is that we anticipate the collision of the separate story lines and are rewarded when they do collide. The weakness of the approach is that the story has to juggle three well really twothe third is a Bstory protagonists and sometimes seems to suffer from a lack of focus.The film was clearly made in an era of Corean filmmaking that hasn't yet reached its more modern proficiency and the equipmentfilm stock used will have an almost grindhousedirecttovideo feel to it for those who are only used to modern AmericanEuropean cinema. Nevertheless while the directing nor acting is spectacular it is presented sufficiently as not to serve as a detraction from the story.All in all this is actually a pretty decent film even if it's not as much of a horror film as I was expecting. The interesting intertwined story lines and the use of horror to explore societal and personal burdens and with some measure of tact left me pleasantly surprised with Whispering Corridors. I can't recommend it to all viewers as the aesthetics might turn off those only looking for beautiful films and those looking for scary ghost or gorefests will be horribly disappointed. But this is an interesting look at the Corean high school experience as well as an intriguing mystery. So recommended to those with open minds and a willingness to look past the genre for the story within. 810.".

But it's long been rumored that the school has a ghost and after a young replacement teacher Eunyoung arrives both rumors and strange occurrences gradually increase until more lives are threatened and a mystery is revealed.Whispering corridors is a typical Asian horror film in that it's relatively slowpaced much of the time and wide open to interpretation. It also features a young female ghost of sorts which westerners are already familiar with as a classic Asian horror archetype from versions of The Ring aka Ringu and The Grudge aka JuOn. More unusually it is set in a single often claustrophobic and always atmospheric environment. And along with its horror it presents intriguing social criticisms and a poetic subtext about friendship.The bulk of the film is centered on what turns out to be the real villaina fascistic abusive approach to education especially exemplified by Mr. Oh who is also sexually predatory towards some of his students. But his strict abusively disciplinarian approach is school policy so we also see other teachers berating humiliating and striking students. Combined with the usual human biasesfavoritism and complex wider cultural attitudes towards maintaining particular kinds of public appearances we have a recipe for eventual disaster which Whispering Corridors delivers.As should be expected most of the horror material in the film is surrealistic and understated. Director KiHyung Park has a knack for creating and finding creepy environments in the slightly dilapidated schoolthe hallway is particularly striking. Although there are a few suspenseful attack scenes that are more similar in tone to modern U.S. horror films shots focused on simple visuals such as bloodstains and drippingrunning blood are just as effective. The key to the film's horror is its gradually strengthening sense of unease which is fueled by the more traditionally dramatic elements of the film as well.The ending has a twist somewhat akin to The Sixth Sense 1999 or The Others 2001 although note that Whispering Corridors predates both of those films. The twist is also much more purposefully ambiguous than American audiences are used to allowing for a number of different interpretations.A major subtext is friendship. Students throughout the film are constantly seeking friends building relationships testing bonds setting boundaries with others inside or outside of friendships experiencing growth apart from friends with sometimes traumatic effects and trying to strengthen various kinds of connectionsthere are even extremely subtle suggestions of romantic bonds between some female students. Most of the teachers are dealing with complicated relationships as well between each other and between themselves and students.Whispering Corridors is a complex sometimes difficult not negatively so film that would surely reward multiple viewings. Although it's a horror film on some surface levels and very rewarding at that its heart is more of a poetically dramatic picture of its subtexts and social commentaries. Like much nonU.S. horror it is worth viewing but fans only used to American films will have to adjust their expectations in terms of pacing and clearly stated linear plotting.".

The material may be recycled but the filmmakers present it in a way that is different and anything but stereotypical. Don't watch this film expecting to see a massive body count and flying limbs. There are moments when you will see why this movie is classified as a horror film but like most ghost stories the power of this movie is demonstrated by what the filmmakers chose not to show us. The pace is slow and deliberate. I found it almost hypnotic but it never lags. Some of the story elements are very convoluted but ultimately this does not detract from the overall appeal of Whispering Corridors. A movie for the thinking horror fan.".

When you say this is a copycat of traditional Japanese high school horror that is certainly not true.  Yeogo goedam goes deeper revealing on problems of a high school system in Korea and presents a lack of respect between relationship of students and faculties.  Most students in the movie are depressed and having difficulties of their own those qualities are what make Yeogo goedam better than most of horror teenflicks made in other countries.

Whispering Corridors is your typical ghost thrillerdrama and real blood thirsty for some of the sicker members of society you'll enjoy the ear scene you'll see.Anyways on with the plot the film opens on a dark rainy night in an all girls boarding school a figure is seen standing in the rain take a guess at who it could be anyways the scene cuts to Mrs Park AKA Old Fox who also has a bad reputation amongst the school girls shes speaking on the phone to Hur EunYoung a new colleague and former student at the school also JinJu's best friendShe starts by saying Jinju is definitely dead but she's still attending school! Yet before she can explain what she means she is attacked and killed left hung in the school.The next day two girls a quiet shy girl by the names of Youn Jaeyi Choi Seyeon and a talented artist Lim Jioh Kim Gyuri attending their senior year and the new class monitors who have to be in early and make sure everything is clean before school starts on their routine they meet Kim Jungsook Yun Jihye a strange girl who is rumored to be possessed by the spirit of JinJu and the prime suspect for the murder being the first one in the whole school.After discovering Mrs Park the girls are told to keep the cause of death quiet so inspectors and press don't bother the school Jioh however is really disturbed by this and feels the need to paint a picture of Mrs Parks death to get the image out of her head but the painting is seen and she becomes banned from the art block.Rumors begin around the school that during the course of JinJu's like she was abused and beaten by Mrs Park and therefore her ghost had returned to get revenge on her Mrs Park had been abusing her on account of JinJu's mother being a Psychic and a Shamen.In every school their a few who like to play around with ouiji boards and a girl by the name of Park Soyoung Park Jinhie persuades Jioh to hold a sance to find out if Jinju is still around.The sance is broken up by a teacher Mr Oh Park YoungSoo who has the nickname 'Mad Dog' as he is abusive both physically and sexually towards the female students and no their is no scenes of sex in the movie in case that put you off.Meanwhile Jaeyi and Jioh have become good friends and Jaeyi offers to help Jioh's painting skills grow but as Jioh is banned form the art block she suggests using the old shutdown art block of the school to paint which are supposedly hauntedWil JinJu's spirit take revenge on the abusive 'Mad Dog' and why is Eunyoung having visions of her old best friend JinJu? and whats with the sound of bells ringing around the school? will these 3 be able to solve the mystery before JinJu strikes again?Though if your looking for a film that has st yourself silly moments around every corner like 'JuOn  The Grudge' or 'Ringu' then you wont find it here although the scenes with JinJu are very affective theirs just not enough of this young ghost to keep you scared for very long.Yet this film manages to hold its own and was one of Koreas biggest box office hits of '98' with chills not so much around every corner but enough to keep you interested and lots of blood this film IMO is one of the better Asian films to delight my eyes. Oh and the kick in the crotch twist at the end that just makes you want to cry is very well effective i didn't see it coming at all. Entertainment  1010 Scares  810 Ghostly Girls  1 but a very scary one at that Bordem  210Dark Slade Rating  1010As i was watching this i was gripped throughout and i actually cried a little at the end.

	schema:reviewBody "Having seen so many Asian horror films in recent months I expected Whispering Corridors to be a lot scarier than it was but I was still impressed with the consistently creepy mood that permeated the film. When it comes to movies there are a few things that tend to be pretty effective in scaring me like kids clowns and hallways. Hallways especially. The Shining had a profound effect on me. Then there are things that are never scary like screeching cats and things that are never scary but generally still a lot of fun like the walking dead. The movie borrows a lot from the horror films that have been pouring out of Japan and doesn't necessarily cover much new ground but is still a pretty entertaining thriller. Interestingly I found that the best thing about the movie were the performances some of which were outstanding. Acting prowess is generally not something you look for in horror films. spoilers There are some things that seem to be hinted at in the movie although I'm not sure if they're all intentional. At the end when we learn that the ghost's job was to fill the empty seats it seemed to me that the movie was making a crack about Asian people looking so similar. On the other hand Asian people only tend to look the same to people who are not Asian. One of my roommates is Japanese and she says it's Americans that all look the same. There is also a hilarious bit of irony near the end when one character has a shard of glass pressed into her throat as she threatens to kill herself. She's pressing hard enough to draw blood and she says something like The bloodshed must stop! Overall there are not a lot of memorably scary moments but it is an interesting film that gives some insight into some of the surprising teaching methods practiced in Korea as well as a fairly interesting story. There's nothing new about haunted schools but the mixture of that foundational premise and the Korean schoolyard environment make for a pretty interesting combination.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some spoilers in this commentSouth Korean movie Whispering Corridors is a horror movie which is not scary enough. Unlike Phone from the same country the screenwriters of this movie did not succeed in maintaining the terrifying suspense throughout the movie. After the death of the sadistic female teacher and brutal male teacher Mad Dog Oh the movie dragged on and on until its rather disappointing climax. At the climax an averagelooking school girl apparition who was in no way scary appeared and explained the motivation behind the haunting. Convinced by the sincerity of her former friend Miss Hur she goes back to the netherworld. This was not even onetenth as scary as the climax of Phone where the apparition of Jinhee a murder victim emerges from a wall and stares at her victim with her horrifyingly angry eyes. Jinhee was a totally unforgiving monster. She has an uncompromising grudge which even an average moviegoer can feel from the screen. How can the averagelooking female ghost in Whispering Corridors measure up to Jinhee of Phone? The only matter of note in this movie was the incredible brutality of the Korean teachers. The teachers slap punch whip and sexually harass the students but the students take it with obedient Yes sir. These teachers make some U.S. Marine Corps drill instructors look like cream puffs. If these teachers acted like this in the U.S. they would have been thrown in jail.According to my Korean acquaintance teachers are allowed to use corporal punishment in South Korea. He also told me that the root cause of the brutality of Korean schoolteachers is the generationsold Confucian ideology. Followers of Confucian ideology believe that teachers can do no wrong and give teachers absolute authority over his or her students. And many modern Koreans pride themselves as being obedient followers of classic Confucianism. Just as the adage Absolute authority absolutely corrupts. states the absolute authority given to Korean schoolteachers make many of them to act any way they want. Many resort to intolerable violence while some resort to sexual harassment. Of course I strong believe that there are many kind respectable Korean schoolteachers like Miss Hur in this movie.In conclusion Whispering Corridors is just an OK movie. It should be obvious to any competent movie fan that Phone from the same country is a much better crafted horror movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Some spoilers in this commentSouth Korean movie Whispering Corridors is a horror movie which is not scary enough. Unlike Phone from the same country the screenwriters of this movie did not succeed in maintaining the terrifying suspense throughout the movie. After the death of the sadistic female teacher and brutal male teacher Mad Dog Oh the movie dragged on and on until its rather disappointing climax. At the climax an averagelooking school girl apparition who was in no way scary appeared and explained the motivation behind the haunting.

	schema:reviewBody "WHISPERING CORRIDORS is a pretty interesting South Korean ghost story set in a girl's school haunted by the spirit of a dead student. Released in the same year as RING the Japanese hit that was to inspire dozens of derivative knock offs its pleasing to see that this film avoids the clichs for the most part. There's no longhaired whitefaced girl ghost here just a melancholy spirit with a knack for bumping off brutal teachers in increasingly violent ways.The film is full of atmosphere. Indeed the story is stretched out almost to breaking point and the pacing extremely slow  especially around the midsection. The eerie atmosphere keeps you watching along with an effective soundtrack full of those low almost distorted notes also used in RING that instantly send a shudder down the spine. The low budget here is evident and some of the performances are a little rough around the edges but there was nothing that stopped me enjoying this.Even the 'Hollywood style' stalkandslash moments are well portrayed especially an extended showdown between cruel teacher Mad Dog and the unseen spirit. Things get a little muddled at the climax  as they do in so many of these films  where twist comes upon twist in a short space of time. Personally I would have preferred the surprises to be more spread out but nonetheless the denouement impresses. This isn't grandstanding horror and indeed it's not a film that I'll rush to watch again. But as an example of Asian horror you could do a lot worse. A sequel MEMENTO MORI followed.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you have never witnessed a horror movie before then Whispering Corridors will more than likely scare you. For someone like me who has an entire bookcase devoted to horror movies there was only one moment in the feature that caused me to jump. Although Whispering Corridors contains elements that are quintessential to the horror genre it works best as a character drama shrouded by mystery and suspense revealing to us the hardships of education especially in South Korean culture and the importance of friendship.Though released in 1998 Whispering Corridors has lost none of its poignancy and though I was late to jump on board the Whispering Corridors franchise none of the films were ever released in my country the movie is surely one that should not be missed. If you are after a horror movie that will scare the pants right off you I'm afraid by the end your trousers will still be firmly attached to your legs. At the same time however Whispering Corridors is able to grab your attention right from the opening scene and refuses to let go even after you've ejected the disc from your player.Eunyoung Miyeon Lee is a teacher only recently employed at the same all girls high school she attended as a student nine years earlier. Her time there is far from normal after receiving an ominous phone call from her former home room teacher Mrs. Park concerning her best childhood friend Jinju who tragically died on campus but is suspected of haunting school property. Immediately after this phone call Mrs. Park's life takes a turn for the worse and a group of students the next morning find her hanging from an overpass.Alongside Eunyoung three characters strongly focused upon are Lim Jioh Gyuri Kim a gifted artist and the timid Yoon Jaeyi Choi Seyeon who although a bit of an outsider is far more sociable than interloper Kim Jungsook Jihye Yun. Through witnessing these characters lives we experience the difficulties of the education system the teachers doing all they can to benefit the talented intellectual geniuses of the class while those underpar or who put one toe out of line are subjected to intimidation and cruelty.Despite many of the characters been teenagers I found myself engrossed in their lives not one of them ever annoying me although the same can't be said for American films of the same genre. By returning to her high school Eunyoung is able to witness how nothing has changed since her time as an adolescent as she remembers past events while taking Mrs. Park's final words to heart. The characters in the film are brilliantly portrayed the audience becoming deeply involved in their lives to the point that we aren't just sympathetic towards them but genuinely care for their wellbeing.The suspense in this intriguing mystery is marvelously conveyed viewers being required to experience every second of this film in order to comprehend the many plots that are taking place. Although there are scenes with blood the film doesn't rely upon grotesque violence nor in your face scares to keep your interest.Although there are a couple elements of the film that remain somewhat unexplained by the end the audience after receiving a plentiful amount of entertainment are able to use their own imagination to concoct potential answers. With a series of terrific camera shots that compliment the story alongside entertaining well thought out characters Whispering Corridors is an intelligent moving feature that you simply must see.".

It was not a master piece like we are use to. Basically you follow around students and teachers at a High School after the opening sequence of death. It pretty much sets up the movie to uncover what happens in beginning and most importantly why. I honestly kind of got lost in the end but it ended on a typical soft toned end.".

Unfortunately I am unable to be objective nor subjective about Whispering Corridors.While watching I was unintentionally and uncontrollably hindered by two things. The first  I'm not sure if I found a bad translation or if the Korean language is really as such. I'm afraid it was the first option as I have no idea how 3 sentences could be summarized in 5 words. Half the time of most dialogues the screen was empty of text. As a translator a poet and a former teacher  I know that no translation ever captures 100 of the original meaning but in this case I couldn't help but feeling that I wasn't being exposed to lots of information however redundant. And the second problem I experienced was my inability to differentiate the Korean female students. I am not at all racist but they all seemed too much alike and their names sounded too much alike... I guess I haven't seen enough Asian films andor Asian people in my life and I realize this is a shortcoming of myself and my life and not the film.Taking all the aforementioned into account I was completely robbed the film's twist as I could barely understand. I was only able to interpret the music which was excellent by the way and the event but not completely experience the twist as someone who'd been successful in following and keeping up with the entire film would have. Therefore I feel I cannot with a clear conscience rate this film. I can say good music and interesting dramatic shooting and cinematography but that's all. And without being able to have an opinion of the actingand most importantly the story  one cannot rate. So I can't recommend the film and I can't criticize it.

Like I said it does really not a whole lot wrong and I think it actually was a very deliberate choice to not make this movie a standard formulaic horror flick. It instead went for the more intelligent approach which however doesn't make this movie a very interesting watch though. It works for the mystery but a bit too well you could say. You really have no real idea what is going on in this movie and the viewers are left in the dark for too long without giving them really anything. This really doesn't make this the most interesting or spectacular genre movie to watch. It only builds up to its finale in which everything falls together and gets explained. This however means that you first have to endure watching this movie for 90 minutes or so without getting an awful lot out of it.I just wasn't too impressed with the entire way the story before that point progressed. It progressed in a very uninteresting way without any well build up tension and mystery to it.And I for one would had preferred it if this movie would had taken a bit of a more standard horror approach at times. It really would had added much more to the movie its tension and atmosphere. Some more killings and scary moments or gore could had already been enough for this. I'm not too sure about it that the movie now will make lots of horrorfans happy.Still it seems like the movie is popular and also was a success at the time at least in South Korea since the movie has so far already 4 sequels.

	schema:headline " A creepy high school suspense of a great quality";
	schema:reviewBody "The first part of the very loosely bound Yeogo goedam series that tell stories about supernatural events happening in Korean girl schools is the best one I have seen so far and easily beats the second and third part.This movie mixes everything a good psychological suspense movie needs. The opening scene is very dark and somewhat confusing. The atmosphere of the movie is creepy and addicting. The playing of the young Korean actresses is very well done and offers a multitude of intriguing characters. From time to time there some supernatural events and surprises that take place but nothing that seems to be too unreal or out of vogue. Until the end you keep on guessing who is behind all the tragic events that take place throughout the movie and many scenarios are possible. After that the film lets you on a mysterious and dark note and finishes the dark flick in a creepy way.The tension and atmosphere is always quite high in this movie. There are not many shocking effects or gore scenes but a dark atmosphere that equals and even overpowers the usual flicks of the same genre. The great acting and a few interesting revelations keep the tension high and develop the different characters.The only negative thing might be that the idea of such a movie is not quite new and that the final revelations could have been even more developed and surprising and I was expecting something more spectacular. But those are only two rather subjective points and though this movie is nothing pretty outstanding it's at least worth eight points and I completely understand why the general idea of this first flick lead to a total of now four sequels. The movie is really entertaining and far better than the American high school horror movies. You don't have to watch the sequels that are less impressive but this first movie should be on your list if you like Asian cinema or high school suspense movies.".

	onyx:emotionText "The first part of the very loosely bound Yeogo goedam series that tell stories about supernatural events happening in Korean girl schools is the best one I have seen so far and easily beats the second and third part.This movie mixes everything a good psychological suspense movie needs. The opening scene is very dark and somewhat confusing. The atmosphere of the movie is creepy and addicting. The playing of the young Korean actresses is very well done and offers a multitude of intriguing characters. From time to time there some supernatural events and surprises that take place but nothing that seems to be too unreal or out of vogue. Until the end you keep on guessing who is behind all the tragic events that take place throughout the movie and many scenarios are possible. After that the film lets you on a mysterious and dark note and finishes the dark flick in a creepy way.The tension and atmosphere is always quite high in this movie. There are not many shocking effects or gore scenes but a dark atmosphere that equals and even overpowers the usual flicks of the same genre. The great acting and a few interesting revelations keep the tension high and develop the different characters.The only negative thing might be that the idea of such a movie is not quite new and that the final revelations could have been even more developed and surprising and I was expecting something more spectacular. But those are only two rather subjective points and though this movie is nothing pretty outstanding it's at least worth eight points and I completely understand why the general idea of this first flick lead to a total of now four sequels. The movie is really entertaining and far better than the American high school horror movies. You don't have to watch the sequels that are less impressive but this first movie should be on your list if you like Asian cinema or high school suspense movies.";

	schema:headline " This movie just did not work for me";
	schema:reviewBody "After watching this movie I was relatively disappointed. This movie has got a decent storyline but there are just too many plot holes in this movie that made this movie bad. The movie starts of very well with an extremely frightening scene that kept me glued to the screen. A student wanted to take revenge because a teacher did something to her. The way this Mrs Park got hanged was frightening. After the first twenty minutes the movie just got really bad. There were just really very long boring conversations between the two girls. They just seem to keep on talking forever. Then there was one silly part where another girl in the art room pretends to say maybe I am the ghost and smokes to act cool. Then another long boring conversation was carried out between the two girls again. This show was not scary at all. It didn't even build enough tension and fear to the climax. The violent acts of the teachers were the scary ones. A really big plot hole for this movie is who locked JinJu in the art room. This was not explained at all. I am still confused what 1989199319961998 is all about. And why this pattern? The girls rang and rang and rang the bells so many times and is just so repetitive. At least there was one scary scene showing JinJu attacking Mad Dog. This movie really shows the school system in Korea very well. The last few scenes of this film were unsatisfying. I could not figure out many stuff that were happening. Why did JinJu turned her head back at the end? Why was the classroom empty? Why was blood being all over the classroom? Lots of questions just come to my mind. The acting towards the end of the film was not good it was not convincing. When JinJu was about to kill the teacher in the end why did the teacher frown? Was she frustrated? Sad? happy? I cannot understand her weird expression. This teacher also acted in Bunshinsaba and her acting did really improve a lot in that film. I could not understand anything towards the end of the movie. However some of the good merits to this movie includes cultural interest mystery and so on..... I have so far only watched wishing stairs and this movie and wishing stairs is by far a much better film than this. If you are interested in the whispering corridors series watch wishing stairs. My rating for this movie5.510".

But maybe that is cause I seen way too many horror movies to the point I have seen everything in this movie in other films except done better. This really wasn't a scary movie in fact the teachers in this were more frightening than the ghost they act more scary than drill sergeants and the girl students seemed like they were in military school. The movie was made in 1998 so I don't know how the school system was like back then but I sure hope they toned it down a bit. I thought the build up was alright but not that good either but the ghost is so not intimidating what so ever and there is more students and teachers talking amongst themselves about the rumors of a ghost roaming the school that it gets sort of boring. And if you want to be frightened more than go with the mystery and drama like scenarios you probably won't enjoy this as much. But I could tell it did pretty well for it's time and I did like some of the themes in this it could have been better if it was a bit more faster paced though. Just because it's a classic film doesn't mean it has to be brilliant.5.610".

Yet its story is more gripping than most action movies.An old airplane owned by an oil company crashes at the hands of a crusty old pilot James Stewart whose bitterness and fatalism are brought out when he's forced to admit the crash was due to pilot error. His halfalcoholic navigator has insured that the plane was off course and cannot be discovered by rescue craft if any he's a nice guy and becomes the mediator between the rancorous passengers and crew but he lacks selfconfidence Richard Attenborough in a finely understated performance. The passengers include a company accountant Dan Duryea a shellshocked employee Ernest Borgnine by turns touching and silly sent home in the company of his doctor Christian Marquand a straightlaced British officer Peter Finch and his mutinous sergeant Ronald Fraser several oil company employees including one who is always making vicious jokes at the expense of the others Ian Bannen and a German designer Hardy Kruger who went to the oil fields to visit his brother. Stranded in the desert with no hope of rescue they debate various schemes for salvation all of which fail until Kruger tells the others he is an airplane designer and he has discovered a way to build a new plane from the spare parts of the old one. All it needs for a handful of unskilled men living on a little water and no food but pressed dates coping with unbearable heat during the day and unbearable cold at night to transform themselves into aircraft manufacturers before they all succumb.All performances are good. Some of the actors George Kennedy the always interesting Dan Duryea are woefully underused  perhaps large segments of their roles wound up on the cuttingroom floor. The major tension is the confrontation between Stewart's oldschool pilot and Kruger's technologically selfrighteous engineer at one point Stewart's character makes the incredibly prescient remark that one day the little men with their sliderules and computers will inherit the earth.Even when they all decide they'd rather attempt building the new plane with hope than sit around watching each other die new surprises spring up that compromise the whole thing.The script and the acting are solid especially James Stewart in a different and challenging role. The music is sometimes overwhelming and stings give unnecessary emphasis to some lines. Also of interest is the listing in the credits of The Love Theme which seems like a silly thing to call it.A superlative story of men living on the ragged edge of survival working together but not necessarily getting along or surrendering their own values.".

A couple of people have commented on the old school seatofthepants flying vs. mathematical engineering conflict in the movie and this is certainly a big part of it.Another conflict subtler but just as important has gone completely unmentioned here. That's the issue of the crew's mistrust of Kruger for being German. This movie is pretty important for the way it excellently touches on the tension many people still felt by the sixties on working side by side with the former enemy in the new postwar world. It's not an accident that the three main characters that have to come together to survive are American English and German. Flight of the Phoenix is one movie that is timeless in its direct appeal but should be taken in context of the time in which it was produced in order to be fully appreciated.Taking these conflicts together the overall message is clear.

	schema:reviewBody "This masterpiece is now 40 years old and has lost nothing of it's excitement due to it's fantastic outstanding actors Attenborough and Kruger have never done better from my point of view director scenery and the simplicity of the story itself. A plane lost in a desert no help and a challenge to master by people who never chose to master their destiny together in a hostile environment.The way the conflict is layed out can serve as an example for organizational conflicts cultural conflicts simply whenever humans have to solve a problem that jeopardizes their future under resource constraints. Or even mankind on earth in the hostile universe who need to solve their very own conflicts? All actors are able to deliver fully convincing natural emotions in this kind of situation to make the audience understand why humans usually fail to solve these conflicts. How many actors can you name today that are superstars and can do it like them? It's becomes evident how difficult the first step to compromise or to accept leadership of another person is especially for western individuals. Accept leadership and downgrade oneself in the hierarchy despite the fact that there is usually one solution which suits the groups interest as a whole better? How many leaders or e.g. managers are able to do this? In the end the collaborative approach is successful staged behind a general struggle for power influenced by the cold war environment containing an explosive mix of historical facts and clichs on British imperialismmilitarism American heroism German nazihoddengineering rational and various other aspects. You could easily work out how difficult the situation would be if nowadays a e.g. member of priest of a Christian church would crash land together with a Muslim mullah. How would they be able to work together to master the hostility of the desert? Would they be able to accept a compromise? You can spend months to identify all the clichs that are used to increase the tension between the characters they have to understand to manage their faith unfortunately you need a lot of historical background knowledge on 19th century till cold war to understand all the details but that is only another good reason to start studying this.The movie also shows that every specific cultural background has it's advantages closely tied to its disadvantages e.g. the heroism advantage of attack eaten up by a lack of rationality for example due to alcoholismboredom. Actually this movie should be screened as an example for success for conflicts of international companies global organizations or just humans between the frontiers of different cultures.And if this is too educational for you It is even great entertainment if you are just watch it from a pure emotional point of view. Myself being a German I would wish that we still can show of some of the engineering mastership that Dorfner shows of  however I'm happy that no technocrats are now ruling my country.In the end What a masterpiece!".

Stewart plays the pilot and the hero but in an Aldrich type of scenario he is the antihero. He admits his error causes the plane to crash. As it is obviously an old plane there is some conjecture to it all being his fault but he takes the blame anyhow.The cast and direction here are excellent. It is great that Turner Classic Movies has started running this as I have to admit this is a film I had not seen.

This film presents a hypothetical survival situation and does a great job of showing how innovation and persistence bring the survivors through. Strengths and weaknesses are plausibly portrayed in characters who have depth and a mix of vices and virtues. That Sgt Watson does not suffer for his sin is just the sort of thing that makes this an adult movie. That's what real life is like. Often people who do the wrong thing seem to go unpunished or worse to actually benefit. You could get a whole other novel out of the Sgt's subsequent life. There was a real survivor story a few years back where a trimaran the RoseNoelle capsized and the crew existed on the overturned craft for many weeks. There were tensions between people. Each individual seemed to be weak in some ways and strong in others  eg one guy was very despondent and was often treated with contempt by 2 others but he was also far more patient at fishing he caught a lot more than anyone else. The skipperowner kept up his leadership role and the others resented him being hard on them I thought no harder than was needed. When the trimaran eventually ran ashore and they were picked up by emergency services at least 2 of the crew immediately separated themselves from the skipper and never contacted him afterward according to his book. When these two wrote their own book they stated that they had taken food from the common store when they weren't being watched. I was flabbergasted that they would admit such a thing without feeling any guilt. They didn't express any anyway. In the 70s I read a selfimprovement book about socalled noneroneous people who would never worry about what other people thought about them or what they did. I now believe the old saying that Only very competent men or very beautiful women or very rich people of either gender can afford to be totally forthright all the time. Hardy Kruger's character was a wonderful example of the nonerroneous person. His view was that he worked harder he planned everything he was essential to the project so it was OK for him to take more water than the others. He openly admitted it when confronted by the pilot James Stewart. However he changed his behaviour because he saw that he had to get people onside if the project was to succeed. That a model aircraft engineers skills were as good as a fullsize engineers was selfevident to him. He was not without his faults however. During the enginestarting sequence he rather lost his nerve. He was not able to trust the best man for the task the pilot to do the task without trying to interfere. Hardy Kruger is one of my favorite actors very versatile he always managed to please even when cast in utter tripe like Hatari!".

	schema:headline " An enjoyable performance driven spin on the disaster movie genre";
	schema:reviewBody "Returning from an oil field with a plane full of crew etc going on leave Frank Towns' plane enters a sandstorm over the Sahara desert and crashes. As various attempts at rescue or escape fail one passenger Dorfmann suggests his plan to rebuild the plane as a smaller version and attempt to fly out leaving the bulk of the damage craft behind.  However tensions mount as personalities conflict as all the men face death.I had only ever heard of this film before I finally got round to watching it last night on television.  I was aware of the basic plot and had assumed it was more recent that it actually was.  I watched it assuming that it was made in the early seventies when the disaster movie genre was just starting to take off sorry  accidental pun.  However this was made prior to this and is probably a much better film for it  in the seventies the film would have required more spectacle so the crash would have been much more dramatic and horrifying.  As it is now the film is more about the men under stress than it is about anything else.This is brought out well and the majority of the drama and tension within the film is as much from these conflicts as it is from the pressure to escape the desert.  The film is longer than I expected it to be but it pretty much sustains itself for that length.  The main reason for the film working so well is the cast which has it's fair share of famous faces but also has more than it's fair share of good performances.Stewart is really strong in the lead although in fairness there is no one main character and becomes increasingly grizzled as the film goes on.  His character is not without flaws even if he does come out of this well. Attenborough is also good but is less evident in the film than some of the others.  Krger has the least pleasant of the roles given that he plays a tough German.  He manages to make the character likeable while still going about his task with a strict organised German air to him.  Finch is good and is well supported by Fraser.  The support cast includes strong performances from Borgnine Bannen Kennedy Marquand and the director's own son is thrown in for colour!Overall this is much better than the disastertype movie I had expected as it is a film where the plane crash isn't a blaze of spectacle and the death scenes aren't played out for full effect.  Instead it is a tension adventure story that is driven by some great performances by a cast full of well known actors.".

	onyx:emotionText "Returning from an oil field with a plane full of crew etc going on leave Frank Towns' plane enters a sandstorm over the Sahara desert and crashes. As various attempts at rescue or escape fail one passenger Dorfmann suggests his plan to rebuild the plane as a smaller version and attempt to fly out leaving the bulk of the damage craft behind.  However tensions mount as personalities conflict as all the men face death.I had only ever heard of this film before I finally got round to watching it last night on television.  I was aware of the basic plot and had assumed it was more recent that it actually was.  I watched it assuming that it was made in the early seventies when the disaster movie genre was just starting to take off sorry  accidental pun.  However this was made prior to this and is probably a much better film for it  in the seventies the film would have required more spectacle so the crash would have been much more dramatic and horrifying.  As it is now the film is more about the men under stress than it is about anything else.This is brought out well and the majority of the drama and tension within the film is as much from these conflicts as it is from the pressure to escape the desert.

	schema:reviewBody "Flight of the Phoenix 1965 is a survival story about a group of men who crashland in the Libyan desert. A German airplane designer Hardy Krger amongst them suggests utilizing the workable remains of the wreckage to create a new Frankenstein plane The Phoenix and fly out. Although his scheme is initially perceived as mad they soon realize it might be their only legitimate way out.Even though Flight is a survival adventure it's just as much a drama since the setting is stationary a relatively small area of desert and there's very little opportunity for action except the occasional punch or two. The action here is the tension between the men. First and foremost there's pilot Towns' friction with the Kraut airplane designer Dorfmann. Towns James Stewart is a man of oldfashioned practicality whereas Dorfmann is a visionary. Between the two is Towns' assistant Moran Richard Attenborough who understands  likes Towns but sees the genius of Dorfmann.A stiffupperlipped British officer and his sergeant provide more tension. The officer always seems to make the quasiheroic decision that while admirable on the surface is usually the dumbest choice. The sergeant realizes this and is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Does the British Army's chain of command mean anything in such a survival situation? Should he follow this boneheaded officer to a premature grave in the name of respect and loyalty or should he follow the wiser choices for the sake of survival? Towns despises the sergeant for choosing the latter but is he really wrong? It's debatable.Other notables are on hand like Ernest Bornine Christian Marquand George Kennedy and Ian Bannen. Borgnine's excellent as a halfcrazed employee sent home in the company of his doctor played by Marquand. One passenger resorts to constant joking and mocking to cope with the situation Bannen.The film runs 2 hours and 22 minutes but the drama is so wellwritten it doesn't seem that long. Like all great films it pulls you in and holds your attention until the end.The film was shot believe it or not in the desert areas of Imperial County in SE California as well as Yuma.DVD INFO Some whiners complain about the DVD being butchered etc. but I just viewed it and everything looked great and there were no scenes cut out.FINAL WORD Flight of the Phoenix is one of the greatest survival adventuredramas ever made. Although there's a little bit of datedness the film stands headandshoulders above the 2004 remake.GRADE A".

	schema:reviewBody "Flying across the deserts of North Africa one can imagine how dangerous it would be to be stranded in the trackless ocean of sand. In 1965 a film called The Flight of The Phoenix appeared on movie marquee's around the country. From the first moment audiences took in this film they recognized the distinctive traits of a true drama which would establish for itself the foundations of a classic. The tale is that of an outmoded airplane load of oil employees who in conjunction with a couple of passengers run headlong into a desert sand storm and are forced to crash into the forbidden wastelands below. Thus begins the impossible task of not only surviving in the empty miles of lifeless sands but to somehow return to civilization. James Stewart is Capt. Frank Towns an experienced pilot who realizes the 'pushbutton' age has made him obsolete. Richard Attenborough is superb as Lew Moran the boozing asst. pilot. Peter Finch plays Capt. Harris who believes his army training and Sgt. Watson Ron Frasser will save the desperate group. Ernest Borgnine plays Trucker Cobb who's only concern is to move up to become line chief. Ian Bannen Dan Duryea and George Kennedy are the company crew. But it is Hardy Krger who plays Heinrich Dorfmann who astonishes disbelieving Capt. Towns and everyone else with his boost that with their help the onboard tools and supplies and some undamaged parts of the crashed plane he can design a model aircraft which will fly them to safety. Fantastic idea but no one cares for his suicide plan. What ensues is a test of wills against each other the unforgiving landscape hostile Arabs and the scant water supply and time they have left. ".

Hadn't seen the movie in over 30 years until the DVD came out and was delighted that my longago passion was justified  this is a great film. Wellplotted good suspense good cinematography great attention to how people really react under extreme stress. In addition the physical action is 'real' in a way no CGI film of today ever could be.Compared to the disaster films of the 1970s the theme of the film is Promethean  instead of simply trying to escape the characters do something fantastic  they come up with a way to survive that practically amounts to stealing fire from heaven. Gazing at a wrecked plane lying in the desert Dorfman Stringer in the novel sees a new plane rising from the ashes couched in the new language of math and aerodynamics. The rest of the film seesaws between who has the power of the future  analytic engineerstyle dreamers like Dorfman versus seat of the pants Stewart's pilot character. In the end both are vindicated  only Dorfman can envision the Phoenix but the Phoenix can't fly without Stewart the outstanding pilot.There's a moment of Christian symbolism common in films of this vintage when after a night of exhausting work one of the characters gazes at their work and comments it looks like an airplane.  Actually the Phoenix looks like a cross with the sun behind it in contrast to the crosses marking the dead on a nearby dune. Cool. This motif is repeated as the engine of the Phoenix powers up on the last day  a thrilling scene. There's even a Calvary reference where the halfdead survivors drag the crossshaped plane to its launching place  if they endure this last trial they will be reborn.But the most amazing thing for me is that the Phoenix was actually built for the film. The original author of the novel worked hard to make sure that the story was possible. The movie producers went further  they built the actual physical Phoenix and flew it. One stuntman died but it flew. Other scenes have the same reality that no longer exists in film  for example Alist actors standing a few feet in front of an unshielded roaring propeller. Wouldn't happen now.What would we have done today making this film? We would have hired a computer graphics company create an overhyped impossible plane that could only fly on their monitors. Not the same. In this film's climax we see a real plane flying. The film shares a common mood of the era seen in the real desert of Lawrence of Arabia and the real bridge in Bridge on the River Kwai. Since film today seems destined to go 100 CGI in the future we won't be making films like Flight of the Phoenix. Is this a loss? Whatever you think of the culture of the early 1960s their entertainment had a reality check that has vanished.".

At the time I am writing this there was 2812 votes and it had a rating of 7.6 out of 10.... not bad considering it doesn't make the top 100 lists. I have to note I am very curious as to why 19 people gave it 1 vote and 11 people gave it 2 votes. Were they watching the same movie that I was? It is simply a story of survival and human reaction under very stressful circumstances. I have watched it at least 10 times and it keeps getting better each time. Knowing people in their 20's i can tell you right now most of them 97 or higher won't like it because it doesn't have special effects and relies solely on the ability of actors who had to act.A MUST SEE movie if you are over 40... in my opinion of course.".

Regardless The Flight of the Phoenix is one of my all time favorite movies. Great direction acting story and above all chemistry between the characters is phenomenal. This movie truly represents the golden era of movie making that is the 60's and 70's I must mention I was born in the early 80's. Hardy kruger's character as the aircraft designer is one of the most though provoking character I have encountered in movies. He doesn't speak much but when he does he leaves other characters in the movie as well the audience speechless. His character was well researched and Hardy Kruger was the perfect choice to play it. The second character that impressed me the most was of Richard Attenborough. There is a lot of friction between characters played by James Stewart pilot and Hardy Kruger aircraft designer and Attenborough acts as oil to reduce the friction between them and he does that in an outstanding manner. This is not to say other characters in the movie didn't impress me there wasn't a single character that was unnecessary or not paid attention to. This movie is a work of art with every part chiseled to perfection. Its hard to imagine what it would feel like to be stranded in the middle of a hot desert with a limited supply of water and waiting for death on the other side of sand dune. But director Aldrich does a great job of playing those emotions perfectly and his cast doesn't let him down. A 10 out of 10.I would greatly recommend this film if you prefer substance and story over CGI and bad acting.".

Nevertheless it became absolutely clear to the that after making Flight of the Phoenix there is no sense in trying to do something better of airplane crash movies. Especially in our computercalculated future of which one of the characters spoke fearfully. Still wonder how they knew. It is painful to think how Flight of the Phoenix could look if it was made in 2003... A 15minutes completely digital crash sequence 3 or 4 female characters and even more love plots simultaneously and they crash somewhere in Iraq after plane being hit by some bad guys' Sovietmade rocket. Fortunately in 1965 they made not so stupid films. That means Flight of the Phoenix is not about the plane or the desert or crash or survival tricks... It's about people. Arguing from the first minutes challenging leadership fading hopes fighting... I'd even say sometimes Phoenix more concerns weakness and cowardice rather than strength and courage. 9 out of 10.

	schema:headline " Terrific Storytelling from the Master Applied to Melodrama";
	schema:reviewBody "The story of course is not acceptable now. It's based on a play written by two performers who were major stage figures in their time but are now principally remembered for a few film roles Novello in Hitchcock's THE LODGER Collier as the hasbeen actress teaching acting to young girls in LaCava's STAGE DOOR. The story tells of the long melodramatic total downfall and degeneration of a son of wealth with a seemingly bright future the hero of the rugby field who is disgraced when he takes the rap for his impoverished roommate at his British school. Modern audiences tend to find this sort of melodrama no matter how well done a bit ridiculous. The anguished query of young Novello when he's told that he's expelled Does this mean sir that I won't be able to play rugby for the Old Boys? is justly famous for its fatuousness. But the film itself is not fatuous or ridiculous in the slightest. It shows Hitchcock to be one of the greatest of all the masters of the silent cinema using an array of sophisticated film techniques to build a narrative complexity that goes far beyond the melodramatic plot. The pictorial quality of the film is lush and dense and the photography is sophisticated.For one thing he uses very few titles. Of course he was not alone in trying to keep silentfilm intertitles to a minimum. But directors like Murnau tended to tell simple timeless stories with very formal pictography the story told through a series of strong simple iconic images the characters hardly speaking. Hitchcock has preserved verisimilitude by having his characters talk as much as they want. If what they're saying isn't important such as the small talk among the rugby spectators at the beginning why show it in titles? The casual milieu is established more clearly in fact if one doesn't know exactly what's being said. Hitchcock's use of this technique is even more evident in THE FARMER'S WIFE also adapted from a play where the characters talk and talk but rarely is there a title. We talk constantly in real life and one of the things that makes some silents seem stilted is the refusal to have the characters say anything unless what they say is shown in a title.Even when characters reveal their inner feelings to each other the words they speak are often not the best communicators. Hitchcock shows relationships through subtle facial expressions body posture and observant human movements through editing little closeups or vignettes of action and placement of camera. All sorts of naturalistic bits of business are used to make the story clear and dramatically interesting. These techniques convey subtle relationships even more strongly when titles are not there to explain the content in words to the viewer undercutting the images.Amid symbolic images of his descent such as traveling down London's endless escalators to the underground trains and riding down in an elevator the story of Novello's decline is laid out in melodramatic detail. A few incidents and Hitchcock's handling of them are described below.The film opens on the day of a big rugby game and the visiting families dine with the students in the school's great dining hall. At one point the sister of Novello's poor roommate steps into a stairwell and sees two small boys fighting on the stair. Then a door opens and she glimpses Novello toweling up after a shower. Nothing comes of either of these incidents she doesn't see Novello again they are just original well staged atmospheric moments. Having attended a British boarding school for a year in the fifties I can attest that these are particularly telling touches. Long aimless vicious fights were a hallmark of that existence and I also remember incidents of women embarrassed at being out of place in a boys' school.The roommate gets a note from the attractive waitress to meet him at the sweet shop where she works. At the same time she flirts with Novello. The two young men visit the girl at the sweet shop and there's a long scene where each of them dance with her in a back room. She obviously favors Novello and Hitchcock cuts from shots of Novello dancing with the shopgirl to the gradually disapproving stare of his companion. However as the other fellow goes out she points to the sign Closed Wednesday Afternoons a typical example of visual storytelling which not only economically indicates without titles that she has asked him to return but also the furtive nature of the invitation. Later she comes to the school and accuses Novello of making her pregnant not of theft as the IMDB synopsis and other sources state. She accuses him apparently because she was mad at him for ignoring her and because he's rich and can presumably pay off. The actress playing the shop girl Daisy Jackson per a photo caption in the Citadel Hitchcock book though she isn't in any credits listing including in that book and IMDB is very attractive and an excellent silent film actress.After Novello is cast out of his father's house the scene changes with a title Make Believe. We see Novello in a tuxedo talking. The camera pulls back and we find him a waiter. After some action the scene is revealed to be part of a musical he's a stage actor now. Make believe for sure first we think he's in high society then a waiter finally an actor!After falling further we find him in France a male taxidancer under the thumb of an ironhanded battleax. He spends an evening at the table of an older woman Violet Farebrother who sympathetically listens to his life story. But at the end of the evening so late that it's now morning a man has an attack and the windows are opened to let in fresh air. The glaring sunlight floods into the foul nightspot and Novello looks around at the dissipated apathetic revellers looks at the nowmuchfaded interesting older woman and realizes the horror of his surroundings. The scene exudes a profound sense of revulsion and loathing a depth of feeling on a plane rarely found in Hitchcock. Finally Novello is feverstricken and delirious in a dockside dive cared for by scruffy blacks. As they pile him on to a small steamer his shaky passage to the ship on the gangplank and into the cabin is presented in striking handheld pointofview shots.The sophisticated narrative style the profusion of telling details the richness of the visuals all made the film gripping and dramatic despite the hoary plot and a slight overlength. Before Hitchcock found his niche he used his talents to make quite a few unexpectedly eclectic films that showed a remarkable talent constantly inventive and original continually using film in creative ways. His silent films are largely ignored because they for the most part do not conform to the Hitchcock subject matter. But he's one of the great silent directors! He understood the medium and used it more subtly and creatively than many more famous practitioners.".

Nothing comes of either of these incidents she doesn't see Novello again they are just original well staged atmospheric moments. Having attended a British boarding school for a year in the fifties I can attest that these are particularly telling touches. Long aimless vicious fights were a hallmark of that existence and I also remember incidents of women embarrassed at being out of place in a boys' school.The roommate gets a note from the attractive waitress to meet him at the sweet shop where she works. At the same time she flirts with Novello. The two young men visit the girl at the sweet shop and there's a long scene where each of them dance with her in a back room. She obviously favors Novello and Hitchcock cuts from shots of Novello dancing with the shopgirl to the gradually disapproving stare of his companion. However as the other fellow goes out she points to the sign Closed Wednesday Afternoons a typical example of visual storytelling which not only economically indicates without titles that she has asked him to return but also the furtive nature of the invitation. Later she comes to the school and accuses Novello of making her pregnant not of theft as the IMDB synopsis and other sources state. She accuses him apparently because she was mad at him for ignoring her and because he's rich and can presumably pay off. The actress playing the shop girl Daisy Jackson per a photo caption in the Citadel Hitchcock book though she isn't in any credits listing including in that book and IMDB is very attractive and an excellent silent film actress.After Novello is cast out of his father's house the scene changes with a title Make Believe. We see Novello in a tuxedo talking. The camera pulls back and we find him a waiter. After some action the scene is revealed to be part of a musical he's a stage actor now. Make believe for sure first we think he's in high society then a waiter finally an actor!After falling further we find him in France a male taxidancer under the thumb of an ironhanded battleax. He spends an evening at the table of an older woman Violet Farebrother who sympathetically listens to his life story. But at the end of the evening so late that it's now morning a man has an attack and the windows are opened to let in fresh air. The glaring sunlight floods into the foul nightspot and Novello looks around at the dissipated apathetic revellers looks at the nowmuchfaded interesting older woman and realizes the horror of his surroundings. The scene exudes a profound sense of revulsion and loathing a depth of feeling on a plane rarely found in Hitchcock. Finally Novello is feverstricken and delirious in a dockside dive cared for by scruffy blacks. As they pile him on to a small steamer his shaky passage to the ship on the gangplank and into the cabin is presented in striking handheld pointofview shots.The sophisticated narrative style the profusion of telling details the richness of the visuals all made the film gripping and dramatic despite the hoary plot and a slight overlength. Before Hitchcock found his niche he used his talents to make quite a few unexpectedly eclectic films that showed a remarkable talent constantly inventive and original continually using film in creative ways. His silent films are largely ignored because they for the most part do not conform to the Hitchcock subject matter. But he's one of the great silent directors! He understood the medium and used it more subtly and creatively than many more famous practitioners.";

	schema:reviewBody "In Downhill Ivor Novello's character life goes all downhill after a false accusation made by a girl who ruins his life as a rich schoolboy. He lost his only friend Robin Irvine abandoned his family after being thrown out of school and all that happened because a pretty girl falsely accused him of getting her pregnant there's a whole debate over what was the accusation because the film doesn't explain it so clear which was a shocking thing at the time considering the societies conventions of the period.In a stunning dramatic exercise way before his suspense films Alfred Hitchcock presents in Downhill the story of a man who lost everything trying to protect others but not himself rejected his father because the last didn't believe in him calling of him a liar but this man realizes that he made a big mistake but not telling the truth to anyone living a lowlife with people of inferior classes marrying with another troubled girl and more. And everything methaporically and literally spins around and around over this poor guy so it's all downhill.This was my first experience on watching a Hitchcock silent film and it was a great pleasure to see how everything about it was brilliant important the way he moves with his camera edition direction of actors the whole package. Novello's performance as the main character living in a constant delirant state showing a sorrow that doesn't need to be overacted or appear to be so emotional no he has an expressive face that says more than we can see you can feel his desperation and sadness in simple gestures. There's some bit humored parts the fight between Novello and his wife lover at the apartment that calm down the almost depressive story.One of my favorite parts and to you might sound pointless is a transition scene that fools the viewer in a magic way. Right after Novello left home we see him working as waiter in a restaurant attending a couple that walks away from the table and start to strangely dance followed by other people. The image opens up without cutting and we see a stage musicians and a whole crowd watching the dancers scene Novello and other waiters start to dance too and we are fooled because he's not a waiter he is an actor in a musical play. It's a very humorous transition scene and way ahead of its time very brilliant and well made.I watched the film in the Public Archive the link is present here on IMDb so there's a few things to complain about their version and another one that helped me watching the film. First the final minutes of the film are missing very significant five minutes gladly I found the missing part on YouTube. Second their version doesn't feature the musical score presented in it which leads to the thing that helped me watching it I selected classical musics to go with the film and that was very clever of my part because the absence of sound in this case made me think on other things than the film the problems of life and things like that. But after watching Downhill hearing instrumental music made the experience even better and it wasn't distractive as I thought it would be. So my suggestion is that if you watch the film in the Public Archive do that listen to Tchaikovsky Strauss or film composers scores that will help you a lot.From the very first scene at the school with the boys playing in the park until the last similar scene at the ending Downhill justifies only the story as being a downhill thing because looking at its magnificence it's a memorable and upper film. One of Hitchcock's best works even though it's not a work of suspense. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "My copy of this movie is truly silence with no musical score. Whenever I watch a movie that is completely silent initially I find it a little hard. But when the film is well made as this one is it doesn't take long to adjust and focus on the story as you are drawn into it. I feel Hitchcock was a master of the silent film genre with his ability to tell such a deep story with very few intertitles. Relying instead on the expressions of the actors and written notes and signs in the movie without having to cut away to an intertitle which allows the film to flow more fluidly instead of constant cutting between the live action and the title cards. Ivor Novello in the lead role of Roddy and in his prior work with Hitchcock in The Lodger really impressed me with his talent of conveying his feelings strictly through facial expressions and acting without the use of sound. Hitch is also good at using subtle exaggeration and focus on action to help take the place of the sound in his silent films. The story is that of a young man in school who is falsely accused of theft by a lady that he had danced with and he is willing to take the blame for a friend of his and is expelled from school. This leads to the downhill spiral of his life as leaves home after his father calls him a LIAR!. Things get worse from there as ends up working as a gigolo in Paris getting in fights losing a large sum of money and eventually hitting bottom.In this film we really begin seeing a lot of Hitchcock's visual style that he is so famous for. He has some really good use of fades and graphic matches between scenes. Two of my favorite where the fading out on the pocket watch and into a large clock and the other being the scene where he fades out on a photograph and then back in on the real person. I really enjoyed the symbolic shot of Roddy heading down the escalator showing us that is in heading downhill in his life. And my favorite Hitch shot in this movie was the pointofview shot when the lady was leaning back in her chair and it cuts to Roddy walking into the room and we see him upside down on the screen. I also thought Hitchcock did a great job of portraying Roddy's seasickness towards the end of the film. I really enjoy seeing Hitchcock's style developing in his early silent films that will become so prominent in his later more famous movies. I also really appreciate Hitch's working in comedic scenes into his serious movies. My favorite humorous scene in this movie is the peashooter scene early in the film.Without giving too much away I would have liked to see a more typical Hitchcock ending to this film.  out of 4 stars".

	schema:headline " The Misfortunes of Virtue";
	schema:reviewBody "During my youth in the sixties and seventies silent films were quite regularly shown on British television but today are they are few and far between even on specialist movie channels and are hardly ever shown on terrestrial television perhaps because the generation that can remember the silent era are mostly dead. Many people therefore do not realise that Alfred Hitchcock made a number of silent films during the twenties they are much less wellknown than his Hollywood films of the forties fifties and sixties and even than the British talkies like The Lady Vanishes which he made in the thirties. Downhill recently shown on Sky Classics is one of them dating from 1927 towards the end of the silent era. It was released in the same year as the first talking picture The Jazz Singer. As the film opens its hero Roddy Berwick appears to be a fortunate young man. The son of an aristocratic family he is School Captain at an exclusive public school. He is popular intelligent and the school's star rugby player. His world collapses when Mabel a waitress at a local caf announces to the headmaster that she is pregnant and that Roddy is the father. The real culprit in fact is Roddy's best friend Tim but Mabel appears to have singled Roddy out because his family is wealthier than Tim's and she is hoping that she can blackmail them. Out of loyalty to his friend however Roddy accepts the blame and expulsion from the school. This is not the end of his misfortunes however. He is disowned by his father who believes him guilty of the accusation. He goes to work as an actor and marries a famous actress named Julia but the marriage is an unhappy one and she leaves him for another man. He inherits 30000 from a relation but loses it all largely due to Julia's extravagance. He becomes a gigolo in Paris but quits this line of work in disgust and ends up penniless and starving. The theme of Mabel's pregnancy is treated very obscurely so much so that some have misinterpreted these scenes and incorrectly concluded that Roddy is expelled on a false accusation of theft. This is because the British censors discouraged any discussion of sexual matters. Although the American Hays Office was not set up until the 1930s its British equivalent the British Board of Film Censors had been established in 1912 with the result that film censorship in Britain during the twenties tended to be stricter than in America and indeed than in many European countries. In later years Hitchcock was to become famous for his suspense thrillers nearly all his Hollywood films with Mr and Mrs Smith a rare exception fall into this category. In his early British period however he made numerous films in other genres as well and Downhill is a melodrama rather than a thriller. It does however show evidence of some of the techniques that were later to make him famous particularly in films like Spellbound in which he could indulge his love of the surreal and dreamlike. In one scene Roddy taken ill while on a ship experiences a delirious nightmare. Hitchcock also makes use of shots of a descending escalator not for any literal meaning but as a visual metaphor for Roddy's descent into misfortune which is of course the significance of the title Downhill. It is strange how English and many other languages use the expression going downhill as a metaphor for a change in one's fortunes for the worse even though in reality the lowlands at the foot of a hill are often a more pleasant place to be than the hilltop itself. True colour films were very rare in the twenties but Downhill in common with a number of other monochrome films from the period makes use of the device of film tinting in which different scenes are tinted in different shades. Orange is normally used for interior scenes and daytime exteriors blue for nighttime exteriors and green for scenes set at sea and the nightmare sequences. Only a few scenes are in straightforward blackandwhite. Even in my youth most of the silent movies shown on TV were comedies. Indeed at the time I formed the quite erroneous impression that during the silent era nobody ever made films about serious subjects and that my grandparents' generation only ever went to the cinema to laugh at the antics of Charlie Chaplin Buster Keaton or Laurel and Hardy. The sort of slapstick at which these comedians excelled has passed the test of time better than the serious films of the era which can look very alien today largely because they required nonnaturalistic acting techniques with which we are unfamiliar. Dialogue had to be supplied by title cards and in Downhill Hitchcock keeps his use of these to a minimum. Emotion had to be conveyed through facial expression and gesture alone something which must have appeared strange to British people in the twenties who generally believed in keeping a stiff upper lip and regarded gesticulating while talking as a foreign eccentricity. Downhill however shows just how powerful silent film could be as a storytelling medium. The film's happy ending may seem sentimental today but at the time vice punished and virtue rewarded was an established dramatic convention and Roddy's misfortunes are due not to his vices but to an excess of virtue which enables the cowardly Tim and the manipulative Julia to take advantage of his good nature. Once one gets used to the melodramatic acting techniques one can appreciate the power of some of the performances here especially from Ivor Novello today better remembered as a musician and composer than as an actor as Roddy Annette Benson as the scheming Mabel and Isabel Jeans as Julia. The film makes compelling viewing for anyone with an interest in Hitchcock's work. 810".

	onyx:emotionText "During my youth in the sixties and seventies silent films were quite regularly shown on British television but today are they are few and far between even on specialist movie channels and are hardly ever shown on terrestrial television perhaps because the generation that can remember the silent era are mostly dead. Many people therefore do not realise that Alfred Hitchcock made a number of silent films during the twenties they are much less wellknown than his Hollywood films of the forties fifties and sixties and even than the British talkies like The Lady Vanishes which he made in the thirties. Downhill recently shown on Sky Classics is one of them dating from 1927 towards the end of the silent era. It was released in the same year as the first talking picture The Jazz Singer. As the film opens its hero Roddy Berwick appears to be a fortunate young man. The son of an aristocratic family he is School Captain at an exclusive public school. He is popular intelligent and the school's star rugby player. His world collapses when Mabel a waitress at a local caf announces to the headmaster that she is pregnant and that Roddy is the father. The real culprit in fact is Roddy's best friend Tim but Mabel appears to have singled Roddy out because his family is wealthier than Tim's and she is hoping that she can blackmail them. Out of loyalty to his friend however Roddy accepts the blame and expulsion from the school. This is not the end of his misfortunes however. He is disowned by his father who believes him guilty of the accusation. He goes to work as an actor and marries a famous actress named Julia but the marriage is an unhappy one and she leaves him for another man. He inherits 30000 from a relation but loses it all largely due to Julia's extravagance. He becomes a gigolo in Paris but quits this line of work in disgust and ends up penniless and starving. The theme of Mabel's pregnancy is treated very obscurely so much so that some have misinterpreted these scenes and incorrectly concluded that Roddy is expelled on a false accusation of theft. This is because the British censors discouraged any discussion of sexual matters. Although the American Hays Office was not set up until the 1930s its British equivalent the British Board of Film Censors had been established in 1912 with the result that film censorship in Britain during the twenties tended to be stricter than in America and indeed than in many European countries. In later years Hitchcock was to become famous for his suspense thrillers nearly all his Hollywood films with Mr and Mrs Smith a rare exception fall into this category. In his early British period however he made numerous films in other genres as well and Downhill is a melodrama rather than a thriller. It does however show evidence of some of the techniques that were later to make him famous particularly in films like Spellbound in which he could indulge his love of the surreal and dreamlike. In one scene Roddy taken ill while on a ship experiences a delirious nightmare. Hitchcock also makes use of shots of a descending escalator not for any literal meaning but as a visual metaphor for Roddy's descent into misfortune which is of course the significance of the title Downhill. It is strange how English and many other languages use the expression going downhill as a metaphor for a change in one's fortunes for the worse even though in reality the lowlands at the foot of a hill are often a more pleasant place to be than the hilltop itself. True colour films were very rare in the twenties but Downhill in common with a number of other monochrome films from the period makes use of the device of film tinting in which different scenes are tinted in different shades. Orange is normally used for interior scenes and daytime exteriors blue for nighttime exteriors and green for scenes set at sea and the nightmare sequences. Only a few scenes are in straightforward blackandwhite. Even in my youth most of the silent movies shown on TV were comedies. Indeed at the time I formed the quite erroneous impression that during the silent era nobody ever made films about serious subjects and that my grandparents' generation only ever went to the cinema to laugh at the antics of Charlie Chaplin Buster Keaton or Laurel and Hardy. The sort of slapstick at which these comedians excelled has passed the test of time better than the serious films of the era which can look very alien today largely because they required nonnaturalistic acting techniques with which we are unfamiliar. Dialogue had to be supplied by title cards and in Downhill Hitchcock keeps his use of these to a minimum. Emotion had to be conveyed through facial expression and gesture alone something which must have appeared strange to British people in the twenties who generally believed in keeping a stiff upper lip and regarded gesticulating while talking as a foreign eccentricity. Downhill however shows just how powerful silent film could be as a storytelling medium. The film's happy ending may seem sentimental today but at the time vice punished and virtue rewarded was an established dramatic convention and Roddy's misfortunes are due not to his vices but to an excess of virtue which enables the cowardly Tim and the manipulative Julia to take advantage of his good nature. Once one gets used to the melodramatic acting techniques one can appreciate the power of some of the performances here especially from Ivor Novello today better remembered as a musician and composer than as an actor as Roddy Annette Benson as the scheming Mabel and Isabel Jeans as Julia. The film makes compelling viewing for anyone with an interest in Hitchcock's work. 810";

When Boys Leave Home delivers moments of brilliance undone by an underbaked plot.Young Roddy Ivor Novello is expelled from his boarding school when he is charged with a major infraction involving a woman at a local bake shop. No use appealing to his father who stares at him with frightening disgust. Roddy makes his way alone in life coming up against a pair of theatrical con artists before landing in a seedy music hall providing dances for lonely women at 50 francs a whirl. It all gets to be too much for the frail boy.Poor Roddy can't catch a break even in cyberspace. A lot of reviewers both here at IMDb.com and elsewhere have at the fellow for one deathless line he delivers when his headmaster drops the hammer Can I  Won't I be able to play for the Old Boys sir? It's a line dripping with ingenuousness but actually works better in context. Roddy is a true believer in the code of his school who runs up against a world that doesn't allow for second chances.Based on an adaptation of a play Novello coauthored with Constance Collier under the pseudonym David L'Estrange Downhill pushes the action from one setpiece to another with little explanation or character development. Hitchcock seems far more enthusiastic about his set pieces and camera tricks than giving the viewer anything to hold onto. Even dialogue cards are kept at a minimum in this very nonverbal silent film.The best sequence a section called The World Of MakeBelieve plunges Roddy into the harsh world of show biz where conniving actress Julia Isabel Jeans and her significant other Archie Ian Hunter set up a suddenly cashrich Roddy.Watching Archie as Roddy pledges his love to Julia smoking and drinking and looking frightfully bored as he awaits the chance to offer his casual blessing to their ersatz union features terrific acting from all concerned. Hitchcock does well in this section by playing up the humor of the situation. But when it's over there's no explanation or attempt at grounding things. What's this kid going to do about his new marriage? We just follow Roddy to his next stop on his downhill journey.Hitchcock presents us with some arresting images. One favorite of mine shows a daytime view of Roddy's boarding school dissolving into a scene of London at night. Anyone curious at how England looked in the 1920s will enjoy these views for their travelogue value anyway.Novello is worthy too carrying the film as he must. He's too old for the part but believably earnest even as he goes from bright student to allaround chump. A better film would give us more of a basis for this but all we get is some eye fluttering from Novello to tell us of his deerintheheadlights state. It worked for Novello's female fan base at the time but not for us.Hitchcock too often works in this surface manner. He shrugs off any subtlety in pursuit of the big effect. The worst of these feature Roddy's father Sir Thomas Norman McKinnel who bears a striking resemblance to Nosferatu and shows up late in the film in Roddy's wracked pointofview in a slew of implausible guises.Still I was interested enough in Roddy's journey if only as a matter of historical interest. Early on we see he is the genuine article a real believer in the world he inhabits holding a cap emblazoned with the word Honour. There's a scene arrestingly similar to the deconstructive Lindsay Anderson film if where Roddy and his friend meet that girl in the bake shop. No playing tiger in this one Roddy just dances with the girl a little and tries to make a polite exit but the damage is just as much as if he broke out the tommy guns like Mick and company in that later anarchic classic.Downhill is a comingofage movie that only really works as a look at Hitchcock's own coming of age  before he arrived.".

Hitchcock wasn't yet in his comfort zone but his direction not only shows technical skill but also early in his career being able to show the psychological insight that he was often so good at. As well as enhancing the mood. From a narrative standpoint unfortunately Downhill falls far short in comparison for all how strong his visuals and direction are Hitchcock apparently had little interest in the story and it comes through loud and clear. The story creaks that wooden floorboards in a deserted house makes very little sense and does drag quite badly at times. The characters are not very interesting and often onesided which especially with the female characters may leave a sour taste in the mouth. The script touches on the social hypocrisy and the separation of classes morally mostly but to me it does very little with those themes and while interesting for when and where Downhill was set it doesn't hold up well today. On the whole a mixed view here loved it technically didn't care for it narratively. 510 Bethany Cox".

Peashooting scene Fighting between Ivor Novello and Ian Hunter and Ian Hunter sneezing at the dog toy when he falls down after the fight with Ivor Novello are some great examples.If you like Silent films then this is a great Hitchcock Silent film. But it isn't a thriller. But an interesting drama.";

	schema:reviewBody "Alfred Hitchcock despite all his ability was undeniably a largely mechanical filmmaker. His approach was one of planning and manipulation rather than aesthetics or feeling. Not a bad thing in itself so long as that cold mechanical mind could be put to the purposes of intrigue and excitement as it would at the peak of his career. The trouble then with his earliest efforts is that they have all that technical intricacy without that much needed focus on reaching the audience as entertainment.His silent films in particular seem to lurch all over the place and are proof that the term experimental film generally means a bad one. After all if you know how to do it properly you don't need to experiment do you? Downhill unlike the films made immediately before and after has less of the camera trickery that characterises Hitch's early work the exceptions being a couple of mobile point of view shots in the Headmaster's office scene and the rather extravagant finale which believe me is nothing compared to the obtrusive bag of tricks Hitch employs in say Champagne 1928.Instead the director focuses far more on the expression and gesture of the actors and the cunning arrangement of shots to reveal what is going on. Much of this is technique that Hitch appropriated from screenwriter Eliot Stannard who actually predates Eisenstein in theories of montage and the various inserts of reactions and concurrent bits of business  like the crosscutting from the courting couple to Ivor Novello dealing with the young customers in the shop scene  seem to fit in with the theories Stannard set out in film articles in the 1910s. A more Hitchcockian manoeuvre on display here is the beginning of scenes with closeups with gradual pullbackandreveal shots to give context. Often the opening shot focusing on a single character or an item like a cap with the word honour on it serves almost like a chapter heading. Gradually the shots become wider giving more context to the scene often finishing with a hauntingly empty wide shot  one that in another director's work might introduce a sequence. In one scene Hitchcock playfully confounds our expectations several times over by starting with Novello in a posh outfit pulling back to reveal he is in fact a waiter then pulling back again to reveal the restaurant is part of a stage set.This more subtle approach by Hitchcock is very welcome but the trouble is he seems a little overconfident in his own abilities. Downhill contains very few intertitles but the action is not quite coherent enough to make up for them. The shop scene in particular is very confusing and synopsis writers cannot even seem to agree whether Novello is being falsely accused of stealing or getting a woman pregnant. The latter is less obvious but makes much more sense. The focus on people and their actions is a bonus at least and we get to see a bit more character from Ivor Novello as compared to his rather leaden personality in The Lodger but the handsome chappy still cannot really act. And it's nothing but mugging and crazy stares from the rest of the cast I'm afraid.But perhaps I am missing the point. The incident in the shop could be regarded as an early example of the MacGuffin  an otherwise unimportant device which serves only to drive the plot forward  and as such its details are of no consequence. And certainly this rather trite plot of a man disowned by his family for some social misdemeanour who descends the slippery slope until he ends up becoming a gigolo for fat French women is certainly one which could bear a bit of style over substance. And isn't it in some ways the essence of cinema to conjure up atmosphere or visual delight with coherence and plot detail being of secondary concern? All this is true and yet the purpose of a motion picture is to tell a story whether it be the ostensible one of plot or an emotional one at a more human characterdriven level and this is something Downhill fails to provide.".

	schema:reviewBody "Downhill is the fourth early Hitchcock movie I discovered after Waltzes from Vienna Juno and the Paycock and Mary I discount the original The Man Who Knew Too Much as the film started Hitch' canon so the more restored gems I discover the more I understood how Hitchcock became one of the most prolific directors ever.I could have said 'one of the greatest' but 'great' is a misleading word Orson Welles was one of the greatest too but his first strike was also his masterpiece Tarantino also started with his best movies but it's not just about hitting a home run in your first game but about keeping the distance after that. Hitchcock was a late bloomer he only made a name for himself in his forties and became the world' most iconic filmmaker in his fifties. It took a long time but this is what allowed him to make a lot of films just like John Ford some were good a few of them were great but most of them were forgettable if not forgotten. Still within their own debatable quality these movies he made as a contractdirector allowed him to sharpen his tools and make his bones the slow and hard way.In Waltzes from Vienna Hitch' experimented the use of music in order to make it in line with the action a device that would be useful in The Man Who Knew Too Much. In Mary it was the use of pointofview shooting every little movie he made planted the seeds of his emerging talent but Downhill Hitchcock's silent movie released in 1927 was a totally different experience. While I expected the work of a rising director still learning the tricks I discovered an ambitious absorbing and compelling psychological drama working like the ancestor of Requiem for a Dream even with the same straightforward title. And the storytelling was like the hurlyburly of life grabbing your heart and taking you in the path of the main protagonist played by Ivor Novello i.e downhill.The movie chronicles the descent into poverty and madness of Roddy a handsome young preppy promised to a brilliant future Captain of his school rugby team coming from a rich family eyepleasing and maybe his worst quality goodhearted. After flirting with a waitress and dating her with his friend Tim he learns several days later from the headmaster that the girl is pregnant. The film clearly indicates that Roddy's innocent if there ever is one culprit because nothing actually proves she's pregnant but her target is Roddy because she knows he's the wealthy one. And since Tim needs his father's money for a scholarship to get to Oxford Roddy sacrifices his career and causes himself to be expelled. Back home his father won't believe his innocence why should he? Who can be fool enough to jeopardize his life for an act he didn't commit? causing his son to slam the door.There is a very defining moment in Downhill when a sadeyed Roddy takes the subway's escalator and slowly vanishes from the screen. It is not the most subtle symbolism but it is very poignant and powerful within the plot's narrative as Roddy's journey can be compared to a slow downfall. Roddy starts as a stage actor and gets involved in a relationship that would empty his pockets because of a venal actress who won't improve his trust on people of female persuasion and he finally turns into a gigolo in a sordid French nightclub where we can see while an old lady is having a hearttoheart talk with him that the man is drowning in his own selfloathing bitterness constantly wondering how he ended up in such a situation.Besides Hitchcock's directing Ivor Novello's performance is integral to the film's strength of course it carries the mark of the silent era and I concede that many closeups or sideeyes from the characters were a bit distracting but when I saw the film I had to interrupt it and check the name of the actor I realized Novello was 34 during the film which was surprising because he really looked sweet and innocent in the beginning as the idealistic smiling preppy I really thought he was in his twenties. Yet near the end when the delirium phrase begun you could almost give him the age of 40 and it's definitely not the makeup the face of this poor man is like a sponge that absorbed so much hardship that you could only feel the pain in his eyes. And the talent of Hitchcock is to completely rely on the face of the actor to convey the tragedy of his life and use the minimum of cardboards to make his point.And the least cardboards there were the more efficient they were and I felt like it was Hitchcock putting himself in his so cherished Goldlike position with an obvious sympathy toward Roddy because the ugly words were never directed at him but at the steps of his hellish journey calling 'stage' the world of 'makebelieves' or nightclubs 'the world of lost illusions'. The film is interesting because it give us a hint on how Hitchcock the man whose touch could always be read in his movies could make his presence visible in the silent era when he hadn't much trademarks to show off. And the result is simply astonishing and carries all the promises of Hitch's talent.A few words about the ending I expect many viewers will be surprised by the 'happy' ending thinking that realistically the man should have ended up in a worse situation but think about it had it happened today with the Internet and all the modern devices he certainly wouldn't have went through the same troubles and been easier to find. The 20's were indeed a time where you could go downhill quicker than you'd think and it's very revealing that the film's other title is When Boys Leave Home.".

The wit didn't transfer to the movie only the title!! the plot of which was so melodramatic it must have given Hitchcock Novello and others of the sophisticated cast a bit of a laugh.The initial part shows Ivor as Robby Berwick a school captain and star footballer at an exclusive English boarding school.

When Mabel finds herself pregnant she makes a fuss at the school and picks out Robby as the father even though it is really Tim as she sees his wealth as a bonus.

The nicest scene in the movie for me is when Robby is left in charge of the little shop a boy comes in with a halfpenny and Robby sells him a box of chocolates next thing all his little mates are at the door waving halfpennies  very funny and a chance for Ivor to have a bit of fun.Alfred Hitchcock finds a way to add some wonderful touches  his title the world of make believe shows Robby thrown out of home is now working as a waiter.

Perhaps the finest of all in my opinion a montage of super imposed images starting with the squalid lanes of the East End then each street getting a little bit neater and nicer until Robby is back in his own gentrified surroundings.An excellent film that shows some innovative Hitchcock touches.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Downhill' is visually inventive and astonishing but the story is nothing more than simple flat melodrama. Script is based on the play Down Hill written by Constance Collier and the film's star Ivor Novello. Roddy Berwick Ivor Novello and Tim Wakely Robin Irvine are best buddies attending expensive private school. Soon after both boys spend an evening with waitress Annette Benson she comes forward and says she's pregnant. She accuses Roddy who comes from the rich family being the father while the real one is Tim. Roddy promises to keep his mouth to protect Tim who might lose his scholarship. Roddy gets expelled from school and thrown out at home by his father. Roddy falls deeper and deeper after being used by different people. Hitchcock fantastically depicts Roddy's descent after each dramatic episode with showing Novello's character going down on stairs on escalators and with elevator.Not the Hitchcock's best movie  directing is marvelous but the story is just too simple and predictable. On the other hand it is very easy to care about the main character and despise the cruel people who but other persons through unfair grind even when things happen thanks to Roddy's own naivety. P.S. At that time in August 2018 the film's theme is still relative.".

The opening scenes with that delightfully vicious floosie Annette Benson and the clerically coddled Robert Irvine plus the middle episode in which our hero encounters spendthrift musical comedy star Isabel Jeans and her faithful yet otherwise comically rottentothecore lover Ian Hunter come over as especially striking despite the fact that Novello is obviously far too old for a college boy and his acting particularly in comparison with the other players overwrought. These scenes are also full of delightful Hitchcock touches including a bit when our hero surreptitiously pockets the heroine's purse which it turns out is a joke on the audience rides a lonely Down escalator to the Underground and gets drenched on top of a doubledecker bus. Mr. Hunter does extremely well in a most difficult role. His Archie is a comic character yet he's an object of derision except oddly from Miss Jeans and from an audience pointofview totally unsympathetic. Under Hitch's inspired direction Hunter manages to juggle hisses and comic capers with amazing dexterity. Easily the best performance of his entire career!".

The characters in the cab photographed from the outside during a rain worked quite well. The superimpositions were very well done and the collage of London with its usual turmoil in the streets made its point of business as usual effectively.

A bad film by a good director is still a bad film.Hitchcock was a good director and Downhill was a bad film.The problem is not what Hitchcock does with the material but the material itself. The story is not only dated and melodramatic it is incoherent. It charts the downward spiral of promising public schoolboy Roddy Berwick after he is expelled from school for taking the blame for a friend's offence. However his subsequent descent is not a consequence of this initial misfortune. At each stage it is precipitated by something completely different and the only common factor is Roddy's own feebleness.After expulsion from school he rows with his father and stalks out of his home so the second step in his decline is due to his pride and pigheadedness.He finds work as an actor and seems to be doing OK. Then in a ridiculous plot development he inherits 30000 which enables him to marry an actress on the make. Although his fortune is 1.3 million in today's money she runs through it in an improbably short period of time doesn't he ever read bank statements? and kicks him out of the house which for some reason has been signed over to her. This step in his decline is due to his sheer stupidity.Next we find him as a taxi dancer in France. How or why he has ended up doing this job is a mystery. Is he incapable of holding down a normal job? If not why doesn't he return to acting? When the sudden irruption of daylight into the dance hall reveals how tawdry it all is this seems to come as a revelation to him. Apparently it hadn't previously occurred to him that squiring middleaged women round a dance floor as a lowrent gigolo might be regarded as a bit demeaning.He takes this disillusionment badly and promptly sinks even lower until he ends up in a Marseilles flop house where he is now ill and delirious. It is difficult to account for this final stage in his decline other than that is was needed to complete a predetermined pattern.With the aid of some sailors he returns to England and eventually makes it back to his own home. It is not obvious what he has done to earn this help from these relative strangers. His father is now full of repentance and says Forgive me I know everything.For a youth of whom great things were expected it cannot be said that Robby acquits himself very well in his adversity.That is the material Hitchcock has to work with and although he has fun with a few of the scenes as other reviewers have documented there really isn't anything he can do to salvage this pointless farrago. Ultimately this is not a story it is just a succession of Ivor Novello's selfpitying masochistic fantasies.Of course from the very beginning of his career Hitchcock had command of a rich cinematic vocabulary so you can find a number of Hitchcock touches even in this picture. Individual scenes undoubtedly have their merit but the picture as a whole is just an utterly negligible trifle.In the Sixties when Hitchcock was interviewed at length by Francois Truffaut about his whole body of work he had very little to say about this movie.Perhaps we can best honour his memory by following his lead.".

I'm not saying that there are Oscarworthy performances here but they didn't sleep walk through it either. There's a group of high school guys. They were friends once upon a time.

He goes home for the funeral then with another boyhood chum decides to investigate...because something just doesn't feel right. Tragedy and betrayal...and of course violence ensues.The action scenes were certainly effective with plenty of stylized Tae Kwon Do all over the place. Only one gun in the movie in a police station! There are some people on the site saying the action is underchoreographed and infrequent. I felt like the movie had a good deal of action Plenty of short action scenes to keep it interesting and two long bllstothewall scenes the second of which is something like Kill Bill meets Lethal Weapon.

The Cinematography was well done to a point it reminded me of Running Scared yet kept its own originality. The overhead views were nicely done and there was no shortage of action. I loved the editing on the movie and wasn't bored at all reading the subs as it was a fantastic story of loyalty an broken friendships. The action in its own right was brutal an fun as i craved to see what technique our heroes would use to take down there opponents. The ending was well played as the payoff was great and the final showdown was intense in action and drama. I don't have any real complaints about this movie as everything gelled together real well right down to the soundtrack intresting they played western themes at the end when in the beginning Columbo was mention its a great movie that should not be missed it really shows how well Korea is coming along with its movies".

	schema:reviewBody "City of violence is an action movie. And when it comes to action movies the plot isn't that important. At least as long as it never forgets to be in function of the action and not the other way around. But I was surprised to see that although not very original the plot was quite interesting. The actors also did a great job in carrying this plot. They were believable as childhood friends who reunite after the death of one them. Doohong Jung Arahan who has the lead as the friend who is a cop also is the martial arts director for this movie. And it shows. He choreographed some excellent fighting scenes. Especially at the ending you will be in for a treat. One of the highlights of the movie is one big action scene in he middle of the city where Doohong Jung has to fight several gangs of kids on his own. He does gets assistance of a friend Seokhwan played Seungwan Ryoo who is the director of this film. Not to be confused with his brother actor Seungbeom Ryu from Arahan who looks very similar to him! When these two get together the fun really begins. I don't know if it was meant as a parody or tribute to The Warriors but it was sure a spectacular sight to see the Korean hoodlums dressed as the gangs from that movie. They were just as dangerous and menacing. The good mix of comedy drama and action makes this a movie that has to be seen. It's one big and fun ride!".

Kill Bill is more City of violence kind of movie although I'm sure everyone will be comparing it with Kill Bill when it reaches America  probably next year.This is not a masterpiece but still a very good and simple movie. And there are many reasons why i liked it and only a few why i didn't. It was short but not too short. Fighting in the movie is incredible realistic and unrealistic in the same time. I mean it is unrealistic that a man defeat so many deadly enemies and stands after receiving so many punches but kicks alone are very realistic. The fighting is a real thing without special effects or ropes and all you gotta do is sit and enjoy the fight.The best fighter in the movie is well known Korean actor Jeong Duhong who plays a roll of a police officer Taesu whose friend has been killed. He decides to find the killer and gets help from other friends from the past but he will soon realize that the killer is actually one of his friends  Pilho. That fact is obvious from the beginning of the movie but don't spoil the movie. In fact it is interesting to watch the game of Pilho who is now a gangster and wait for his end as we have waited for Bill to die in Kill Bill now I'm comparing them myselfFive friends are main characters in this movie which tells a story about their showdown in present and friendship in past. Drama part of the movie is not done perfectly but everyone should get the point. The Director Ryoo Seungwan also did Crying Fist more dramatic and longer movie but there must be something the same about this two films because i love them both very much. And the next thing to do is to find other Ryoo Seungwan movies like No Blood no tears and Die bad and see if this is really another great Korean director as Chanwook Park and Kiduk Kim.As for City of Violence if you like fighting you shouldn't miss this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "The City of Violence had gotten some fairly great reviews on Amazon that is one of the main motives for why I bought it that and also because I enjoy Asian cinema.And now having seen The City of Violence I must say that I was thoroughly entertained and somewhat surprised by the movie. Initially I found the story to be a little bit jumpy and not all that easy to grasp at first as there is a lot of jumping to and fro and a heap of characters thrown into your face all at once. But once the dust settles and the movie trots on it becomes really great. The story really isn't the main issue to carry the movie the action and fighting is.The action and fighting scenes and sequences were really nicely choreographed and executed. Lots of adrenaline and inyourface fighting here. It is not the type of action as seen in many Chinese action movies with wires and crazy jumping going on no! This is done very realistic and believable. Though I do wonder how one manages to stay afoot after receiving such a beating as the two main characters did towards the end and final showdown I guess they just had that Jean Claude Van Damme gene in them eh?.The people cast for the various roles were doing really great jobs with their roles and I think it was nice to see so many unfamiliar faces on the cast list which for me means there are no associations to prior movies and roles hanging in the air. I enjoyed the performances by all people in The City of Violence.The City of Violence is a movie that you just have to watch if you are a fan of Asian action movies it is an amazing Korean movie that is well worthy up along side some of the 'classic' Hong Kong action movies. And The City of Violence goes to prove that action doesn't have to come from Hollywood. And speaking of action then the final showdown at the restaurant was one of the best fighting scenes I have ever witnessed in a movie it just went on and on but in a good way and it was done so nicely.Thumbs up for this movie way up!".

But suspicions arise and TaeSu who is now a hardnosed cop stays in town to conduct his own personal investigation into the death of his friend. He teams up with SeokHwan and together they tear up the town and even revert back to their old pugilistic ways. When it turns out the aggressor in all this is their old pal PilHo who grew up to be a remorseless psychopath and who has become a successful land developer because of his corrupt and ruthless ways it sets the stage for an epic battle for the ages. Will the hometown of these old friends become the ultimate CITY OF VIOLENCE? Find out today! The City of Violence is a highly entertaining movie overflowing with dynamism energy color and visual appeal. The cinematic flourishes on a the visual level are the icing on the cake to a story about loyalty brotherhood betrayal and nostalgia. Not to mention remembrance and tragedy. And of course fighting. It is extremely wellshot welllit and welldirected and director Ryoo employs all manner of tactics to delight the eye of the viewer and keep them invested. What with its fast pace you don't really get a chance to become uninvested. Thanks to indicators like this movie South Korea has become a hotbed of film talent in recent years. The City of Violence is a great example of what Korean filmmakers have to offer and we definitely recommend it.There are plenty of memorable moments but from an action standpoint the scene in the shopping district with its references to The Warriors 1979 as well as the Shaw Brothersinspired climax will more than satisfy action cravings. The scenes set in the 80's also stand out with expertlydone hair and clothes as well as music  note the song by Namee Eternal Friendship. Could there be some irony there? Whoever did the wardrobe for the movie should also be very proud as characters wear very interesting clothing which definitely matches the movie's overall colorful nature. Top the movie off with some nice humorous bits and you have a winner.Definitely try to get a hold of the Dragon Dynasty 2DVD set of this movie. They always do good work and they've chosen another gem for their roster of releases. We think it's definitely worth adding to your collection.".

	schema:reviewBody "One element to City of Violence in which I'm not hearing many other reviewers talk about is the selfaware sense of humor the movie has towards the typical Asian crime and revenge flicks. There is a comedic undertone present in which both pays tribute and pokes fun at these two staple genres in Asian action cinema. This tongueincheek attitude is expressed appropriately and is shown exclusively in action sequences. If such scenes of comic relief were not shown during the action sequences than the stunts would come across as just being ridiculous. Thankfully the subtle comedy allows the viewer to play along with the two male leads who are highly charismatic and easily capture interest. The other portions of the movie outside the action are taken very seriously and the drama is used well to both set the tone and advance the plot. My point is I believe many viewers are missing the dynamic of the comedy working alongside the drama here as it is balanced to create the unique style of the film. The plot is solid as well. Many questions arise within the first act which all resolve by the conclusion. The story is simple but there further elements to be discovered along the plot. Best friends broken bonds betrayal and all the usual elements of an Asian revenge movie however the cinematography and direction by Seungwan Ryoo gives everything it's own special flavor. I find City of Violence massively entertaining and am satisfied by it's strong martial arts presentation and interesting dynamic of the storyline. Definitely give it a watch. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "Amusingly violent and funny action story done in a style best described as film noir plot meets spaghetti western music meet Asian action film. Its the story of an organized crime detective who goes home for the funeral of a boyhood friend. Sensing something was wrong about the case he and another friend begin to investigate and find that the city they grew up in has changed and that somethings are better left undiscovered.This is a neat little film. Its not the be all and end all but it fires along in its own bloody way for 90 entertaining minutes. The dialog is witty and is the sort of thing you wish you and your friends would come up with. The characters are also the sort of people you know and that familiarity helps make it easy for you to ride along as the plot unfolds largely as you expect it will. The action is quite good but it is often bloody so you may not want to watch those parts if you don't like the red stuff. This movie is a great deal of fun in the right frame of mind. Worth a look.The film reminds me of what Quentin Tarantino might produce were he not insistent on making references and paying homage to obscure little films. Its a thought that I had prior to the end fight which reminded me in away of the House of Blue Leaves segment from the first Kill Bill. For the record I like the sequence here better since it plays more real and doesn't go on and on and on".

Together with a second childhood friend our hero suspects something amiss and begins his own investigation into the murder. This decision is the cue for a succession of unlikely encounters and a particularly bloody and fatal encounter with yet another childhood friend.There are some people whose personalities are so underdeveloped that they have a tendency to adopt the characteristics of those they are close to accent mannerisms etc and this film reminded me a lot of people like that. Watching it I got the impression that the writerdirector was mimicking every film he wished he'd made. There are a number of obvious 'homages' and a flashback to a juvenile fight that is as hopefully deliberately cheesy as any 70s chopsocky sequence. One of the 'homages' is to Quentin Tarantino's himself the king of the 'homage' overrated Kill Bill so if like me you were bored by Tarantino's selfindulgence you might consider thinking twice about watching a film whose writer obviously thinks so highly of it. Having said that there is something ironic about an Asian film so clearly referencing a film which blatantly ripped off so many of the staple devices of its national genre.The action is as frenetic and professional as you'd expect and the storyline is reasonably engaging but when all is said and done this is really nothing more than a decent timefiller.".

But it suffers in the writing department. The film has some really uninteresting moments which made me difficult to finish the film in once. But when I recalled the excellent action clip I had seen from the film on YouTube I decided to give it a full watch today finally. And I did enjoy it though not totally. The last 30 minutes however save the film as in this runtime itself the film ends up entertaining to the core. Another thing that's praiseworthy is that Ryoo Seungwan who also stars in the lead role along with veteran action director Jung Doo hong has avoided unnecessary violence. Whatever we see is just integral to the story and not a single violent shot seems pointless. But both the actors are just fine when it comes to their performances The latter excels in the fights and the energy of the duo is enough to make you enjoy this badly written action entertainer. Rest of the cast is just average in performances. The cinematography styles in certain portions are quite innovative and have a classic feel. This film could disappoint you if you like storydriven stuff.But if you're an action lover and can ignore the uneven writing and some unimpressive performances this film is made for you.

	schema:reviewBody "Perhaps more than any other genre in cinema Asian martial arts movies are an acquired taste. It's not just that they have so many conventions and tropes you have to accept. It's that the better they are the more their stories reflect the unique social and cultural aspects of their countries of origin the less appealing they are to someone who just wants to watch people getting karate chopped. The City of Violence is a pretty good Asian martial arts movie. Whether you enjoy it depends on how much of a taste you've acquired for that sort of thing.Set in Korea Taetsoo Doohong Jung is a police officer in Seoul who gets word that one of his boyhood friends is dead and returns to his hometown to look into it. Wangjae KilKang Ahn was the toughest and boldest of the boys and grew into a leader of the gangs that have always run Taetsoo's hometown. Then he left the gang life behind when he married and settled down as a private citizen. He turned the control of his gangs over to another of the childhood chums Pilho Beomsu Lee who's used his illicit power to bring a casino development to town. After Wangjae ends up dead in an alley Taetsoo and another old friend the hotheaded Seokhwan Seungwan Ryoo investigate what happened. T he true story leads to Seokhwan's worthless brother Donghwan Seoktyong Jeong and two of those martial arts fight scenes where two guys have to battle dozens of enemies at the same time.The fight scenes are always the most important element of this type of film and The City of Violence delivers. There's very little oneonone action where it looks more like ballet than combat and there's none of that wirefu stuff with superhuman leaps and feats of strength but there's plenty of rough and bloody battle. It's very much in the style of Jackie Chan where there's lot of running and spinning and using whatever's handy for defense and attack. The guys playing Taetsoo and Seokhwan help the puncture the melodrama and keep things from getting too overwrought. As the challenges before them grow they both evince a you've got to be kidding me weariness that gives some emotional realism to the physically fantastic action going on. The fight scenes also look really good unlike many American action flicks where you literally can't tell what the heck is going on.The story of 4 old friends brought together by death and vengeance is fairly compelling and the acting seems good though it's always hard to tell. Asian performances can have such different emotional pacing and inflection that it can be a little hard to follow. Beomsu Lee as Pilho however pulls off a seamless mixture of weakness and strength as a street kid grown up and out of his depth.Like most Asian martial arts films there are plenty of things you have to go along with in The City of Violencesuch as the kid gangs all having costume themes like something from the old Batman TV show and that this story apparently occurs in a reality where guns where never invented. But if you can accept all that and you're not just looking for mindless violence I think you'll like this movie.".

The fight scenes also look really good unlike many American action flicks where you literally can't tell what the heck is going on.The story of 4 old friends brought together by death and vengeance is fairly compelling and the acting seems good though it's always hard to tell. Asian performances can have such different emotional pacing and inflection that it can be a little hard to follow. Beomsu Lee as Pilho however pulls off a seamless mixture of weakness and strength as a street kid grown up and out of his depth.Like most Asian martial arts films there are plenty of things you have to go along with in The City of Violencesuch as the kid gangs all having costume themes like something from the old Batman TV show and that this story apparently occurs in a reality where guns where never invented. But if you can accept all that and you're not just looking for mindless violence I think you'll like this movie.";

Taewoo and Sukhwon will go the extra mile no matter the amount of men they'll have to obliterate to get their hands on Pilho.Director Seungwan Ryoo's City of Violence offers plenty of style and action choreography with flashy camera work and bloody violence. Two phenomenal action setpieces include Taesoo defending himself against four street gangs coming from all angles and the grand finale where Taesoo and Sukhwon must work their way through armies of thugs..most equipped with machetes or ginsu knivesin order to achieve the ultimate goal of getting a hold of Pinho. I felt the film is about the deterioration of a group of friends thanks to jealousy and greed. Pinho's obsession of attaining the top of the hierarchy no matter the cost fuels the erupting graphic violence ending in tragedy. The filmmakers pull out all the stops and we see how our heroes tire of the endless stream of enemies they must dispose of in order to finish their quest of vengeance for the friend they lost by nefarious means. We see the depths of cruelty Pinho is willing to go in order to become a success. While straining credibility the climax as the two skilled fighters engage their adversaries is exhilarating.".

The film is also visually and auditory reminiscent to classics like Kill Bill and Lupin while a nostalgic arch in the story makes you think about Stand By Me.The story as often is the case focuses on an explosive derelict in search of his friend's killer which somewhat sluggishly develops into a more complicated story about gang politics. Fortunately the film benefits from a malevolent napoleoncomplex driven villain who you truly love to hate because of his fear tactics and interrogation techniques.There are times where the film tries to be comedic but because of poor execution it doesn't work very well. The action scenes were also pretty sparse and usually revolved around one or two guys managing to fend off a gang of 100 while overusing flying kicks the way you never see them used in reallife fights. The worst aspect of the battles was not their scarcity but their lack of distinct breathtaking choreography  no remarkable fights or memorable strikes. Although the fight scenes were nonintuitive the visuals remained top notch through the whole film. The disappointing knife scene which resembled interpretive dancing drivel with lots of flying kicks and people taking an unbelievable amount of punishment none the less still looked visually appealing.The strong points good music great visualscinematography well developed characters and a decent story.

It's also a very nice slice of Air Force flying in the early 50's and as a professional pilot I can say that the flying sequences showing the C54 cockpit are quite realistic. In one scene Clift runs cockpit checklists for the pilots who are flying that are completely authentic. There is also a nice description of how GCA approach control works which still exists as a backup at todays airports.Some claim that Paul Douglas' character Kowalski isn't believable as an antiGerman bigot but I thought he was spoton. There are men in their 80's today who still feel the same way.German actor O.E. Hasse portrays Stieber the Scrounger. He's a bit of comic relief as a spy for the Russians watching Templehof field counting the Allied aircraft as they land. He says that he has to lessen the count so that the Russians will believe him. Look for Hasse in another excellent war picture Decision Before Dawn where he plays Wehrmacht Colonel Von Ecker of the XI Panzer Corps deployed east of the Rhine to counter the American Seventh Army during the closing months of the war. Also like The Big Lift this movie was shot amongst the ruins of Germany and used real Army personnel on screen.Decision Before Dawn Battleground The Best Years of Our Lives and The Big Lift are four bw movies made in this era which attempted to get a real taste for the movie goer of what the men experienced during World War II and the period just after. All four are favorites of mine and I hope you enjoy them as much as I do. Thank you for reading my comments.".

The most interesting portrayal in this film is the Paul Douglas character of that of an American seargant who has no love for the Germans and goes out of his way to be rude and act like a true occupation taking revenge out on a former Nazi prison guard that tormented him while he was a prisoner.Its probably the most realistic portrayal of an American soldier after the war when technically the US Army was an occupation force along with the British and French. In addition the portrayal of the German widow who really hated the Americans was probably realistic as well. These characters seemed more than stereotypes which was common in films portraying the political situation at the time. It does a good job in showing how ordinary soldiers and people can have divided loyalties and wrestle with the adverse situation that befell them in Berlin at the time.

Both use the settings effectively to start the viewer thinking about the artifices associated with civilization and the depths to which we ourselves would probably sink to meet our material desires.

Ergo we saw the likes of STALAG 17 Paramount 1952 as an example of a stage of development and maturity all culminating with perhaps the zenith of Hollywood's World War II epics in PATTON 20th CenturyFox 1969. As a further indicator of how things had changed from the old days we remember George C. Scott's refusal of the Oscar for Best Actor.Contrary to this timespacequality film relationship we have today's Fun Time Movie with Uncle Red THE BIG LIFT 20th CenturyFox 1950. It was made so very shortly after Joe Stalin's unsuccessful blockade of the Western Allies' sectors of Berlin as to give it an almost newsreeldocudrama look and feel. The filming done in West Germany and Berlin gave us a look at the actual location in Hitler's now bombed out former Fortress Europa. Interiors were shot at the German UFA Studios in Berlin. And while it was necessary to come up with a fictional account of a couple of G.I.'s sojourn in defeated Germany their changing attitudes and their bittersweet involvement with some conniving former Hitler Youth Fraulein the basic mission of bringing us the story of the Berlin Airlift of June 12 1948 to May 11 1949. We learned that the joint British  American mission logged over 92 million miles Earth to Sun  about 93 million and delivered 2326406 tons of supplies by way of 278228 flights. There was a total of 101 lives lost due to aircraft accidents. Of those killed 39 were Brits from the RAF and 31 were Yanks from the USAF.The Film's heart comes from the fictional account of the two main characters of the young Sgt. Danny MacCullough Montgomery Clift and the grizzled old veteran the cynical MSgt Hank Kowalski Paul Douglas.MacCullough's life is meandering along like so many servicemen in the Post War Force of Occupation. He seems inclined to getting into trouble with the Civil Authorities in the complicated 4 Power Zones of the divided Capitol of Berlin and he luckily evades what could have been serious trouble. He has met a German girl whom he hopes to marry in take to the United States. She turns out to be a lyin' little Nazi bitch and plans to take Sgt. Mac for a ride by hooking up with her real German old man once she was safely in the New World.Hank Kowalski has been through the mill and expresses a real contempt if not a true hatred of all that is German be it the people the language or the Culture. Part of this attitude comes to him honestly as he had been a P.O.W. in Stalag ??  and had been brutalized by a sadistic Nazi Guard Is there any other kind? who hated both Poles and Americans. MSgt. Kowalski was both.A chance meeting with the former Prisoner of War Guard in Berlin almost led to Kowalski's getting arrested but he and the Kraut both luck out. Oddly enough the accidental meeting and physical confrontation by the now free and in control Kowalski amounts to a sort of catharsis for the pent up aggression and resentments left in the Master Sergeant's war damaged psyche. It is the first step in his own personal rehabilitation.Once again thanks to the proximity of the film's being made to the true life 11 month crisis the movie gives the World a photographic record of what Berlin and Germany looked like then. The German civilians in the film were still feeling the effects of both the Soviet Blockade as well as the joint AngloAmerican super air operations. And being that it is after all an American Film there are a whole lot of real American Armed Forces personnel making their Movie debuts here.Oh by the way On behalf of the U.S. the U.K. Germany and the rest of the World let us say THANK YOU Allied Soldiers Airmen and Sailors! Again!!NOTE  While owing its origin to the U.S.Army being known as the Army Air Corps The United States Air Force became an independent Branch of the Armed Forces on September 18 1947. That would make this Berlin Air Lift the 1st Major Mission that the independent Air Force had in its charge.".

There is some interesting stuff about the airlift. The challenges of flying in and out of Berlin in the era seem to be well documented and there was what seemed to me to be a wholly authentic picture of American military life in that era heightened by the fact that aside from Montgomery Clift and Paul Douglas all the military personnel portrayed played themselves. Having said that the movie really turned out to be more of a slice of life depiction of what it was like to live in Berlin during these postwar years and especially during the airlift.The movie focuses really on the budding relationship between Sgt. MacCullough Clift and a German woman he meets and falls in love with played very well by an actress named Cornell Borchers. As we watch their relationship develop we are introduced to the situation in Berlin  a city still largely in ruins 5 years after the end of World War II food and electricity in short supply hopelessly divided into the different zones of occupation some Germans struggling with a Nazi legacy others cooperating with the Russians just to survive and in the greatest irony of all a people totally dependent on the Western allies who had so recently been their enemies for their survival. Douglas offered a pretty good portrayal of an American soldier Kowalski who had been held in a German POW camp during the War and who struggled with his antiGerman feelings all the way through. After being a bit taken aback to discover that this movie wasn't what I had expected it to be I ended up getting quite caught up in the story. As a very early piece of Cold War moviemaking propaganda it obviously glorifies the American ideal but it's pretty well put together and enjoyable all the way through. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "If you managed to endure the quizzical flop 'The Good German' with Kate Blanchett and George Clooney you should really just get your hands on this littleknown movie which covers the same postwar wartorn locale. It's much better and it's quite interesting because it was filmed on location in front of some remarkable bizarre ruins.Monty Clift manipulates a military situation to get into Berlin to pursue a meaningless opportunity with a German gal. Clift calculatedly wears nicer clothes and tries to play off the image of the American nice guy to score with her. But instead the situation is being manipulated by many others. The biggest problem is that the slight plot does not bear 2 hours of interest and at that length it would be nice of them to provide an ending. 'Lift' offers only an inadequate denouement.The camera setups are interesting. The warlore and landing strip factoids are all interesting. The momentary diversions are interesting. as when a raciallyintegrated drill corp welcomes Clift and Douglas to the Berlin landing strip. ...the collapse of a building behind a sadfaced woman. It lacks a great script but Seaton is a good director always with an eye for striking opportunities to include. There's a very strong geography to the film the lovers rendezvous in an apartment at the end of the airlift runway. The hairraising airstrip landings a couple hundred feet past a halfruined residential neighborhood are awesome.Lars von Trier's remarkable hypnotic Zentropa covers similar ground. I'm no fan of The Third Man which occurs in destroyed Berlin but it should be mentioned. The Big Lift has a simpler plot and is refreshingly free of 'The Third Man's big dumb reveal. Two other movies Witness for the Prosecution Mr. Arkadin feature moments or plot points that occur in destroyed Berlin. All these movies are tales of desperate individuals lying andor killing to get their basic needs met the treachery of war refugees and the ambiguity of what had been unshakable 'values' once the fabric of life becomes decimated. The views in this movie are much more than American viewers were asked to consider in the '50s.".

	schema:headline " A good movie propaganda film and bit of real history.";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all this is an entertaining movie with two great actors Montgomery Clift and Paul Douglas. It could have been a trite boys away from home movie but it doesn't end up that way. The good looking guy doesn't get the girl and almost gets taken for a chump. Paul Douglas keeps his girl despite his original hatred for Germans and everything German. Douglas decides to teach her about Democracy only to find that he creates a new democrat who expects Douglas to treat her with the respect due to any human whether former enemy or not. I thought this was one of the best messages in this movie. Practicing what one preaches is usually the more difficult task. There some other messages that probably had support from the military. Many lonely soldiers were falling victim to unscruplous persons who only wanted a ticket out of war ravished Germany via marriage vows. The government's red tape was there for a good reason.This movie was made in 1950 and has some relevant aspects that apply to our country in 2006. Our country went to war on Dec 7 1941 against Japan but we spent most of our resources and time fighting Germany which was considered the more serious enemy. Does this have a current similarity today? In 1941 the enemy was military and political totalitarianism. The Soviet Union was a totalitarian system also but when it was attacked by the Nazi's we formed devil's pact as military allies. War and national defense means cooperating with people and nations that do not share our beliefs or traditions. It also means that many innocent people are going to get killed. In order to get to Berlin we invaded France and killed a of innocent Frenchmen including children. Once the shooting war was over in 1945 our former ally Soviet Russia reneged on prewar promises and took over most of Central and Eastern Europe for almost 50 years and our troops still remain in Europe today. Berlin was the physical heart of the cold war and the Berlin Wall was its most visible sign. There were many reasons to leave Berlin to the Soviets. We had just fought a terrible war against Germany and thought we had won a victory. Many thought we had no reason to help our former enemy who seem ready to fall prey from one intolerant system to another.This movie obviously was made with the idea that it was a good thing to save our former enemies from the Soviets. Good for us as well as them. This movie shows a real sketch of the devastation and deprivations of Berliners. Starving children did not start the war but now they were being victimized by the political motivations of the Soviets who reneged on their prewar agreements. They wanted the US out of Berlin. This movie shows the men and the machines that saved Berlin from complete Soviet domination. The cold war lasted in Germany for almost 50 years. Those who expect miracles in Iraq today should keep this recent history in mind. Had the US decided to bug out of Berlin the history of Germany and Europe would be much different. Without a productive and prosperous Western Europe the freedom enjoyed now by Central and Eastern Europe might not have been possible.Creative people generally do not like the restrictions placed on them by Government. I can understand a writer artist or actor who hates restrictions. Which makes me constantly curious as to how so many people in the entertainment industry failed to see the Soviet's and their form of Communism for what it really was.This movie touches on our imperfections too. We fought the Germans in the name of freedom for all with a segregated military. We were and we are and remain an imperfect democracy but our system was and remains light years ahead of others in granting artistic and journalistic freedoms.What was true 50 years ago unfortunately remains a problem today. We live with another demon just as evil as the Nazi ideology. The muslem ideology that does not tolerate any other beliefs is a threat to our existence as a free nation and people. I have lived long enough to know that tolerance is a goal not a reality. I have also lived long enough to know which countries and which political systems preach and try to practice tolerance. This movie is an accurate reflection of the times and troubles of a divided Berlin and the men who eventually saved it from tyranny.".

Maybe not pure evil but definitely self absorbed. Unfortunately she probably polished up her act and managed to keep the next poor schmo who came along and got what she wanted in the end. Anyway....But the best parts to me was showing postwar Berlin still chock full of rubble. Even RheinMain airfield when it was still dirt. Much improved by the time I went through there in the 70's. A nice documentation of Germany shortly after the war. And being made in 1950 this was what it must have looked like around town during the airlift...except for in color. A nice glimpse of what postwar Berlin was like complete with a trip through the Russian sector.And speaking of Russians who knew Russian spies could be as lovable as Herr Stieber? The GIs were as good as some Hollywood actors I could mention and they really fleshed out the movie. And a lesson Revenge is not necessarily sweet taught to a tough former POW.All in all a decent enough movie. Worth watching.".

The film has its values however but is admittedly more on the entertaining side. Nice to spot later Haimatfilm and TV favourites in a Hollywood production.

God knows what it must have viewed like back in 1950 to audiences on both sides who had just lived through a war but today it seems almost painfully propagandic with ciphers rather than characters and an almost obligatory volteface from the bigoted krautbasher albeit with a reason supplied he'd been beaten by a sadistic guard whilst a POW into Mr Tolerance even as the liberal GI is learning the hard way about deception. Paul Douglas started life as a radio announcer and never really aspired to superstardom yet nevertheless he turned in some pretty good performances along the way and here he more than holds his own with the more gifted and naturally talented Monty Clift. The location shooting is a plus and in passing we note that hardly  if indeed any at all  progress has been made rebuildingwise since Billy Wilder shot A Foreign Affair on the same Berlin streets two years earlier. As I said at the top of the piece I was happy to watch it to the end but I'm not sure if it would sustain a second viewing.".

Paul Douglas started life as a radio announcer and never really aspired to superstardom yet nevertheless he turned in some pretty good performances along the way and here he more than holds his own with the more gifted and naturally talented Monty Clift. The location shooting is a plus and in passing we note that hardly  if indeed any at all  progress has been made rebuildingwise since Billy Wilder shot A Foreign Affair on the same Berlin streets two years earlier. As I said at the top of the piece I was happy to watch it to the end but I'm not sure if it would sustain a second viewing.";

On the negative side there is the picture quality with too high a contrast plus an abysmal and tinnysounding soundtrack. Storywise the first 27 minutes were superfluous and my interest as a spectator was only aroused from minute 28 onwards. I reckon the whole gamut could have been locked into a 1h 35m stint instead of the two hours it took in reality.On the positive side however the film is a very interesting insight into the Berlin under blocade of the 1950's. Filmed on location with the Berliner people you couldn't ask for a greater dose of realism. Some of the scenes are overlong notably those within aircraft which gets boring. What interested me were the character developments of the four main protagonists plus the russian spy. I found Montgomery Clift's character too weak and passionless and was more interested by the character portrayed by Paul Douglas as well as that portrayed by Cornell Borchers  I was most unpleasantly surprised when I realised what her real intentions were . A most impressive moment in the film is when Clift confronts Borchers on her past in front of the house in rubble. As he leaves her disgusted a great part of wall comes tumbling down ! I don't know whether it was done on purpose or whether it was just a coincidence during the filming. Whatever the hypothesis it was most impressive.My appreciation of the film on balance is definitely positive in relation to its plot and character development but oh how I wish they could have given it a clear stereo soundtrack !!!".

	schema:headline " This movie was somewhat uplifting. It also had some altitude.";
	schema:reviewBody "This black and white movie probably flew over many people's head when it came out. In my opinion The Big Lift is a little secret gem that needs to be seen. Written and directed by George Seaton The Big Lift tells the story of two U.S. Air Force sergeants living in Berlin Germany during the events of the Berlin Airlift of 1949. While the movie is set during the events of Operation Vittles AKA Berlin Airlift it's not really about it for say. It's more about Tech Sgt. Danny MacCullough Montgomery Clift  Master Sgt. Hank Kowalski Paul Douglas's personal romantic lives. If you were looking forward to some war action. You'll be deeply disappointed. The movie was shot on location in the city of Berlin Germany in the after years of the events of World War 2. The images of the city in ruins is a graphic reminder of the destruction of war. It's a haunting backdrop reminding the viewers that wounds between Germany and the Allies are very deep and will take years for it to heal. You really see the uneasily of the veterans of the war on the face of Hank Kowalski. Paul Douglas is great as the bitter Ugly American. He is dismissive and a bully to anybody German. While his character can be a bit unlikeable and offensive. He has a good character arch that is believable and affecting. I like the dialogue exchange between him and his lady friend Greda Bruni Lbel. I love the scene where he had to define democracy and how he got irate and frustrated because he had no idea how to explain it. While the movie might be preachy prodemocracy. It's not a propaganda film at all. You really see characters bring up counter arguments on some of America's viewpoints and show how certain Americans can be hypocritical. One character even mentions American internment camps and US persecutions of Jews. That's not proAmerica at all! While a lot of critics are saying that the movie is offensive to the German people. I really doubt that as well. Yes we see some Germans acting like lying thefts but not all of them are that way. Greda is a great example of that. Bruni really did a great job in teaching closeminded Americans to understand that 'not all foreigners are the devil'. I just wish the message was more subtle and less obvious. It wouldn't have look so cheesy. Without spoiling the melodrama twist toward the end. Montgomery Clift's acting is believably as the young idealist airman. He portrays the nice if tootrusting guy pretty well. His thin handsome face is a strange cross between rugged and fragile. It's believably that he would end up smitten during his love scenes and heartbreaking when he realizes he's been used and betrayed. What an amazing performance! I love the scenes where he became a man without a country and in danger from all the political forces. I love how the movie shows the confusing Cold War's borders of Berlin in which each Allies countries controls. One minute you're in the Russian Sector and the next minute you're in the British or American Sector. You really get to see how frequently each political nation tactfully clash with each other and how paranoid everybody is. You get to see the bleak situation that the Berliners had to endure as a result of the Cold War. It's indeed cold out there in Berlin. It's a real eye opening. Lots of tense moments in the film but also a lot of comedy. I love The Chattanooga ChooChoo with a German quartet. I love the scene where they're smuggling coffee. Those were a lot of laughs. Cornell Borchers as Clift's love interest the duplicitous Frederica Burkhardt was powerful. While Borchers isn't overwhelmingly pretty her performance was deep and complex. She really pull it off. By the end of the film you feel sad for her but also a little bit angry. While her story might seem a bit misogynistic it's not. If it came off that way. It's the product of its time. I'm just glad she wasn't a one dimension Femme fatale stereotype. She's just another person trying to survive. One thing that I didn't like about the film is the pacing. It's a bit off. I love the newsreel footage part but did we honestly need it? Why did we need the Indiana Jones type journey scenes of the crew going to Berlin as well? Most of all did the viewers really need all that discussing about how radar works!? 30 minutes have passed that we finally get to the meat of the plot. The Berlin production was also plagued by logistical and political problems but after a lot of political wrangling with military authorities George Seaton was given unprecedented access to Soviet sectors and access to American airbases and airplanes. With the exception of Montgomery Clift and Paul Douglas all military personnel in the film were actual members of the US military on duty in Germany at the time. The movie was released one year after the Soviet blockade of Berlin was lifted and airlift operations ceased. The movie is easy to find. You can find the film on the internet or your local library. The failure of the original copyright holder to renew the film's copyright resulted in it falling into public domain meaning that virtually anyone could duplicate and sell a VHSDVD copy of the film. Therefore many of the versions of this film available on the market are either badly made or in extremely poor quality having been duped from second or thirdgeneration copies of the film. So do warning. My copy wasn't so bad. Kinda grainy but watchable. Overall This movie had a nice dramatic documentary feel to it. I do highly recommended watching it. Do ahead and fly and go get it!".

These would have been a good basis for a documentary about the Airlift.However in a 2 hour feature these seem cut'n'pasted just for the sake of them. Sure they bring a sense of realism to the story yet and when we are for example shown in great detail how the radar systems in air traffic control work I was just thinking how few would actually appreciate this mumbojumbo which has nothing to do with the story. There'a 20 minutes of material begging to be left to the cutting floor. The story itself is simple and doesn't warrant two hour running time.Was the production done in a haste? For example the engine scare at the end is meant to be a terrifying experience yet it was boring at best  all due to poor editing and of course amateur acting. The latter was maybe the only choice as Berlin at the time didn't have the glamour to attract actors to maybe even risk their lives in a lowkey production.The film itself is a typical piece of propaganda of the times. We're reminded many times why the American way is the only way as Kowalski and Gerda have their rather childish conversations about democracy. A film about a serious matter  famine  isn't really good material for laughs anyway yet the Kowalski character is written to be the comical sidekick unfortunately his character isn't written very well and the jokes fizzle most of the time.If the film had pursued more of the serious subplot of Kowalski's hatred at his stalag tormentor this film could have offered much more. But his brutal assault is quickly forgotten and never mentioned again.All in all this film has a Bgrade feeling and what I really did like was the authentic setting. Postwar Berlin was much more hardhitting and more insightfully depicted a few years earlier in Rossellini's Germania anno zero told from a German boy's perspective.

	schema:reviewBody "THE SALAMANDER is one of those films with a gobsmacking cast and wealth of talent both in front of and behind the scenes. It's based on a classic thriller novel by Morris West and adapted by TWILIGHT ZONE creator Rod Serling it's directed by an experienced film editor Peter Zinner who ensures that his editing here is crisp and perfect and it has both British and American backing although it's an Italian film shot in Italy with an Italian supporting cast. But what of the main cast! Remember those glory days of disaster films in the '70s where an allstar cast was a guarantee of big audiences? Where the film poster could hardly manage to fit all those Hollywood names in? Well that's what we have here although THE SALAMANDER eventually succumbs to the same fate as those other movies there are so many players and familiar faces that only a few of them get a substantial role and the rest are just window dressing.Heading the cast is Franco Nero playing a crusading investigator. His appearance immediately puts this film in line with the popular '70s polizia or crime flicks that packed out Italian cinemas in that decade. There's a requisite number of decentlydone car chases and short action sequences but this isn't really an action film it's more of a mystery. It's the static nature of the plot that works against it and stops it from being fully entertaining. Essentially the film has Nero questioning one character after another in a series of longwinded interviews only to bring everyone together at the climax to reveal the villains. It's like something out of an Agatha Christie novel and despite efforts from the filmmakers to throw in MARATHON MANstyle torture scenes and assassins bumping off key players it's a completely linear movie. Saying that I still enjoyed it thanks to the great camerawork and performances.Supporting the evergreat Nero is Martin Balsam here teaming up with the star again after CONFESSIONS OF A POLICE CAPTAIN. These two actors make for a great double act and they shine whenever they're on screen together  it just seems so natural. Glamour is brought to the proceedings by Claudia Cardinale and Anita Strindberg although these two accomplished actresses barely get a look in  the main glamour girl is Sybil Danning playing Nero's love interest. For once Danning doesn't go nude for the role which ends up being one of her best in terms of acting. The main cast heavyweight is Anthony Quinn and he acts everyone off the screen in a great role. Elsewhere we get villains essayed by Christopher Lee  who can do this kind of thing in his sleep  and Eli Wallach who still seems too likable to be believable in his role. There are cameos for Paul Smith typecast as a torturer and Cleavon Little who shows up to fire off a machine gun and then goes again! Italian regulars like John Steiner and Renzo Palmer help flesh out minor parts. THE SALAMANDER is far from great but if you like the look of the cast and you enjoy beautiful scenery you'll have a ball like I did.".

There are however also a number of EuroCult regulars John Steiner in the role of Wallach's aide as well as lover of his neglected wife Cardinale Renzo Palmer Marino Mase'  unenviably playing a corpse!  and Nello Pazzafini. While tolerable as entertainment though there is less action than I had anticipated and featuring a decent score by the great Ennio Morricone the film is ultimately too superficial and uneven to make a ripple in the circles it professes to denounce nevertheless the clever climax is surprisingly but effectively handled in the style of the Thin Man movies! Besides one particular scene nearly turns this into a camp classic i.e. when the hero caught and about to be tortured by Smith attacks the latter clad only in a harness along his waist which gives unwarranted prominence to Nero's groin while leaving his buttocks completely exposed! but ends up slammed against the wall hanging upsidedown instead!!".

After all many communists and socialists were seated in parliament during this period and they controlled the countryside municipalities through their mayors. Of course the captains of industries the nobility their allies in the military elite and government bureaucracy did not like that. My appreciation of the movie heightened when serendipitously I chanced upon a copy of the Morris L.

But these are not necessarily the offspring of kings but may be compared to the English earls. Remember that for much of the medieval period Italy was divided into city states some of which were nominally under the Holy Roman Emperor who did not brook the presence of kings except for his own relatives like the King of Sicily. There is also the unique Italian noble title of Falconeri who must have been the falconer of a Grand Duke. Perhaps we can compare him to a Hapsburg baron.Italians are great designers of uniforms among other things such as cars and it shows in this movie. The Captain dons at least two different uniforms in various scenes and his formal or gala dress was interestingly cool. That golden flame insignia on his officer's cap caught my eye.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fierce Creatures was marketed as a somewhat adventurous endeavour in teaming up much of the old team from the highly acclaimed A Fish called Wanda to do another film that was completely different and had nothing the same except much of the cast.Does this have the same sparkle? The short answer is no but it is still good viewing. It tells the story of a highly greedy and successful business magnate Rod McCain Kevin Kline who has just taken over a zoo in England. However business regulations require that the zoo return 20 of revenue or it will be shut down. Put in charge is Rollo Lee John Cleese who is then somewhat overthrown by new recruit Willa Weston Jamie Lee Curtis and McCain's 'idiot' son Vince also Kline. Essentially the film deals with the three of the new directors and their different schemes for making money and raising the revenue to 20 but with plenty of sexual tension and comedies of error along the way.It's a lot of fun I think I've made that clear. It's by no means the best comedy put on film but it has a lot of the same laughs as a normal Cleesewritten comedy in some ways the character of Rollo Lee is very much like the character of Basil Fawlty. Kline is brilliantly hilarious as usual he's the standout while Curtis Michael Palin Robert Lindsay and Ronnie Corbett all give spirited performances. It's also nice for an Aussie to see Bille Brown making his big screen debut as the terrible righthand man Neville.Overall it's an above average piece of writing directing and performing that gives you a laugh. Perfect for a night in. 3 12 stars out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "Yes I know it wasn't as good as A Fish Called Wanda which it was the unofficial sequel to  being not a continuation of the same characters but featuring all the same lead actors in roughly the same configuration and relation to one another as in the previous film. And yes it's clear that John Cleese has lost a step or three on his precision and comic timing though John Cleese at half speed is still funnier than most comic actors working today. But this film has such a sweetness and a general good spirit to it that I find it impossible to dislike. The story itself is rather convoluted and one could make a fair claim that it seems more a hodgepodge of stitched together ideas than a seamless throughline. That is so and yet since it is a hodge podge of almost entirely good ideas it's harder to find fault with. Cleese stars as an excop who is hired by a huge Rupert Murdochlike conglomerate to run an English zoo that they have picked up in a mergers acquisition. Needless to say the zoo has absolutely no inherent interest to the company but they are willing to keep it going if it can return a profit at a certain rate. Cleese plans to do this is by appealing to people's bloodlust and only keeping the most dangerous and fearsome of the animals the fierce creatures of the title. Things change somewhat when Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline show up to take over Cleese's job but keep him on as an employee. A brainstorm by Kline playing a character every bit as hilariously slimy and petty as his counterpart in Wanda introduces the notion of corporate sponsorship into the zoogoing experience. Eventually all the employees are decked out in animal costumes like mascots at a Zoo Land amusement park and Kline has even begun the process of introducing animatronic creatures behind the bars. All the while a budding romance between Cleese and Curtis is playing out behind the scenes and the two eventually join forces to try and save the zoo from the clutches of the crass and evil conglomerate.Any one of the comic scenarios the filmmakers bring up would be worth exploring to the end. The fact that they cannot seem to keep one satirical conceit going for any stretch and feel the need to overhaul the plot in a new direction every twenty minutes or so definitely lessens the impact the movie could have had. And yet for example just because the writers beg off early on the fierce creatures idea doesn't make it any less hilarious  both as a concept and in execution. The scenes of the kindly zookeepers trying to sell their individual cute little animals as dangerous is one of the funniest scenes in the movie. But then later when that concept has been forgotten and we instead see Kevin Kline leading around a group of potential financial backers giving them his notions of how corporate sponsorship could work at the zoo . . . well that's one of the funniest scenes too. What I'm saying is though a strong focus is something the film lacks it makes up for it by filling its running time with enough entertaining and well devised comic moments to make you feel like you got your money's worth. The performances help. As in Fish Called Wanda Jamie Lee Curtis is not particularly noteworthy as an actress OR a comedienne but she gets by on her general sultriness and willingness to play cheerfully along. Most importantly she keeps out of the way of the big boys and lets them do their stuff. As I mentioned Cleese is a little moldier here than usual but there's still no one who does highstrung fussiness better and he holds down the screen nicely. As with Wanda though it's Kevin Kline who really steals the show  this time in a dual role as the Murdochlike head of the conglomerate and his stupid slimeball son who has big plans for the zoo as well as getting into Curtis's pants. The sheer energy he throws out is infectious and his ability to play off himself  in the scenes between father and son  is nothing short of superb. Blessedly the dual role bit is revealed as more than just an actor's stunt by the way the movie is resolved had Kline not been playing both roles the movie could never end the way it does. That too was a nice touch.Genial breezy good spirted  this is Fierce Creatures. Nothing in the masterpiece league but especially if you've seen A Fish Called Wanda it's a nice evening spent with old friends  with some new and well devised jokes thrown into the mix.".

Blessedly the dual role bit is revealed as more than just an actor's stunt by the way the movie is resolved had Kline not been playing both roles the movie could never end the way it does. That too was a nice touch.Genial breezy good spirted  this is Fierce Creatures. Nothing in the masterpiece league but especially if you've seen A Fish Called Wanda it's a nice evening spent with old friends  with some new and well devised jokes thrown into the mix.";

It still makes me laugh uproariously every time I see it and I've seen it many many times.Special congratulations must go to Cleese and Kline both of whom give exceptional performances and there is a real sense of joy that comes through from the various situations in which these characters find themselves. Although Cleese's character is somewhat 'Fawltyesque' and let's face it  this is what he does best I found it thoroughly enjoyable.Jamie lee Curtis and Michael Palin do equally well though Palin's character is almost as frustrating  annoying as was his role in 'Wanda' but I don't think this detracts from the enjoyability factor of the film.This is an uplifting and heartwarming affair packed full of laughs but with a more than reasonable plot line and I really liked the ending which cleverly capitalizes on Klines excellent character acting.If I had to level any sort of criticism at 'Fierce creatures' it would be in the soundtrack department  i just didn't think it was as good as it could have been  but this makes little difference to the overall flow of the film and I have no hesitation in awarding it 9.5 out of 10 and recommending it to anyone that enjoys a well made and endearing quality comedy.".

	schema:headline " Tacky but funny";
	schema:reviewBody "I can't tell you how many times I've seen this movie a rough estimate would be at least half a dozen times just through three or four years. And amazingly enough I laugh every single time. It may be that Michael Palin is just so damn funny and typically Monty Pythonlike in the film it may be that Jamie Lee Curtis has a surprising amount of comedic talent it may be that Kevin Kline is excellent in both of his roles in the film... heck it may even be John Cleese's entertaining performance... and I'm not even a fan of him. The film manages to be incredibly funny despite being very tacky and downright tasteless in many many scenes. The plot is pretty good and as far as I know quite original. It deals with a multibillionaire and a zoo which obviously doesn't make a lot of money like the billionaire wants it to. The film has a good pace and is rarely  if ever  boring. The acting is very good but one wouldn't expect any less from such names as John Cleese Jamie Lee Curtis Kevin Kline and Michael Palin. It was also a nice surprise to recognize Richard Ridings who plays one of my favorite characters in the Luc Besson film Jeanne D'arc La Hire. I recognized him almost instantly by his very distinguished laugh. The characters are wellwritten wellcast and wellacted as well as credible. I thoroughly enjoyed most of them even though they are mostly caricatures. That just added to the humor of the film I think. As in several other of Kevin Kline's films he plays two parts and he as alwayswell nearly always anyway does so very well. I understand that this is in some ways apparently a sequel to the late80's comedy A Fish Called Wanda now I haven't seen that film so I can't really comment on how the two relate to each other but if Wanda is in any way as funny as this movie I'm gonna have to see it sometime. The humor is excellent black crude humor at its best. All in all a very good comedy if you don't mind some tacky humor. I recommend it to fans of any of the actors fans of tackycrudeblack humor and even fans of Monty Python since both members involved in this are great. 710".

That comedy was one and only perfect brilliant mean witty the best film about culture clashes the best backstabbing comedy the best  everything. For me Wanda is a Citizen Kane of the comedy. Period. What makes is outstanding are the four partners in crime as written by John Cleese and played by Cleese himself Jamie Lee Curtis Michael Palin and Kevin Kline that were simply incredible and let's face it despite being criminals and backstabbers you would love them all. I know I did.When Fierce Creatures was released 12 years ago I ran to see it and I was bitterly disappointed. I expected Wanda Part 2  which is impossible because ...see the first paragraph. Last night I caught FC on TV and I have to admit that it IS a good and funny film. It knows that it is a follow up to A Fish Called Wanda. It references to the perfect predecessor makes you laugh and lets you meet again with the fabulous four and many supporting players from Wanda. Fierce Creatures has gained Cult Status with years and I am now a part of its following. The script was written by John Cleese and the plot is convoluted and silly at the same time. The best the funniest moments play off mistaken assuming that John Cleese's character Rollo excop appointed the London Marwood Zoo Director is a sexy beast for whom one woman is not enough. The scenes between Cleese Rollo Lee and Willa Weston an American businesswoman Jamie Lee Curtis are the funniest. The weakest links in the movie are IMO Michael Palin who unlike his character Ken in AFCW can talk and he just would never shut up. His character became boring and annoying very soon. The same sadly should be said about Kevin Kline playing two roles the Australian billionaire Ron McClain ruthless obnoxious and vulgar and his weakling loser son Vince whom his father despises. Needless to say there is not much love lost between an arrogant father and his estranged son. The film has so many hilarious jokes and witty references not only to A Fish Called Wanda but to Monty Python series that by the time of the conclusion I had enough fun and laughs to tolerate and forgive the loud and messy final act.".

So is John Cleese Michael Palin Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis.Fierce Creatures is not a sequel to the hilarious A Fish Called Wanda from 1988 it just a film that contains the same main actors playing entirely different characters.Cleese plays Rollo Lee a former Chinese policeman now Director of an English Zoo for a new parent company ingeniously named Octopus Inc. It is Octopus's policy to bring all businesses up to a rigid 20 profit margin or risk being closed down. Lee's philosophy is to get rid of all the sweet and cuddly animals and in his own words have 'a lethal weapon in every cage' Fierce Creatures only.Willa Weston starts work for Octopus only to find that the arm of the business she was to control has been sold off by Octopus's head man Rod McCain Kevin Kline. She asks McCain if she can go to England and run the Zoo. What she doesn't count on is that the boss's embarrassing son Vince McCain Kevin Kline is going with her.Back in England the animal keepers are doing everything they can to convince that their animals are predatory killers in order to keep them at the zoo knowing that as placement in other zoo's are unlikely the animals face certain death.Willa's intention is to run the zoo well while still bringing the profit margin to the required standard but Vince's constant interference sees the chances dwindling with not only his embezzlement of funds but his tacky and degrading sponsorship deals.In A Fish Called Wanda Michael Palin played Ken a guy who could hardly talk because of a debilitating stutter. In Fierce Creatures he plays Bugsy the Arachnid keeper who is an incessant talker the verbal contrast between the two characters is a bit of an injoke but an hilarious one and I'm sure that this contrast was not lost on the audience.Like in A Fish Called Wanda Kevin Kline totally steals the show with his double role as Father  Son. Rod McCain is a tough confident Australian mogul so obviously based on Rupurt Murdoch it's untrue while his son is relatively unsuccessful an embassement to his father and has real issues when it comes to dealing with people.I found Fierce creatures very funny and in many ways far superior to 'Wanda'.Some great appearances by other wonderful actors such as Ronnie Corbett Maria Aitken who played Cleese's Wife in Wanda Billie Brown as Rod's sycophantic Assistant Neville Carey yummy Lowell and Robert Lyndsay. Cleese's daughter Cynthia also appears as she did in Wanda playing the small Mammals keeper. For those devotees of British Children's TV of the 70's and 80's look out for Derek Griffiths too.Cleese once said that his two biggest regrets in his life were marrying his third wife and making fierce Creatures. I can say to Mr Cleese now that Fierce Creatures is nothing to be embarrassed about it's a great and funny movie and one he should be proud of.Another in joke is that the zoo is called Marwood Zoo which incidentally is Cleese's middle name.Enjoy!!!".

The sexual tension between Clesse and Curtis is quite funny also. The film was originally filmed in 1995 by Young and then largely refilmed by Schepisi. Then they edited Young's and Schepisi's version together into one film. Clesse Curtis Kline Michael Palin Maria Aitken and Cynthia Clesse. Which the six actors are in this film also were together before in the instant classic comedy A Fish Called Wanda. Panavision. .";

	schema:reviewBody "So back in 1988 there was a highly quirky sexy British crime heist movie with a mix of top cult British and American stars it was a huge and surprising success. Nine years later the same team were back in this sort of sequel or maybe prequel no one was really sure. In the end it was just another comedy utilising the same cast however the novelisation of the film actually explains how both movies connect but no one cares about the book so...The plot is radically different from the 'A Fish Called Wanda' this is not any kind of crime comedy but it still involves unscrupulous people. Its all about John Cleese's character Rollo coming to look after a small typically British zoo of mainly small harmless animals which he then tries to convert into a zoo full of fierce creatures. He has to do this because the main company he works for that own the zoo wants better revenue from the attraction hotspot. Thusly he is instantly at odds with the zoo's team of caring keepers who obviously are against this. At the same time Rollo must contend with Willa Weston and Vince McCain Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline who are overseeing this latest acquisition by the company to make sure it makes money.You see the problem with this comedy is the fact they have tried to basically remake 'Wanda'. Many of scenes in this film are rehashes from the original and are going for exactly the same laughs the cast are playing virtually the same kind of characters and in the case of Jamie Lee Curtis her characters name has clearly been made as close as possible to Wanda Willa. I really don't understand why they have done this because everyone knows this kind of thing hardly ever works it doesn't matter how grand your cast roster is.Much of the said cast is of course taken from the first movie and I don't just mean the main cast either many smaller roles and cameos feature actorsactresses from the first movie. Does that somehow make things better? are these actors suppose to connect this story to the first movie somehow? Apparently not as this is supposed to be more of a stand alone movie...so why use the same cast then?? I mean sure the use of the classic British comedic legend Ronnie Corbett is very nice a nice addition but he barely does anything and is clearly there just to ramp up the star meter. Its an all British type affair so lets get some British gems of comedy...yeah OK but at least make use of them at least make a good film with them.I mean watching Cleese in this is actually cringeworthy he's doing all his usual typical funny little quirks he's done his entire career because that's what people expect but its old hat now. He brings nothing new to the table here which isn't entirely his fault because like I said people wanna see that but you gotta try and break the mould guy! In short Cleese is basically Basil Fawlty in charge of a zoo...but not as funny sweet idea but like I said its not as funny as it sounds. At the same time watching Cleese trying to act sexy and dashing whilst cuddling up to Curtis again is horrible!! its like watching your aging dad trying to be sexy n cool with a younger woman God no! As pointed out already Curtis plays the same character again too a sexual female predator that is after Rollo but has to shake off the ever lurking Vincent Kline yet again. This leads to Kline who as in the first movie is head and shoulders above the rest giving the best performance. Kline seems to be really really good at playing the brash pigheaded egotistical Yank that won't think twice about being a complete sht no matter who's watching. He's rude arrogant and cruel yet again and has his target set on Cleese's character Rollo yet again you notice I'm having to type 'yet again' quite often here. Do I have to mention Palin and his character that bares a remarkably close resemblance to his character in 'Wanda'? Nope its the same character.Don't get me wrong this isn't a terrible movie its not all bad there are some nice moments of farcical humour just not that much is all. It has everything you'd expect from a naughty British comedy that has two Pythons in it no not the scaly reptilian kind. Characters running around in their underwear Cleese again! lots of sexual double entendres silly visual gags pratfalls slapstick and the odd hint of violence which you of course don't actually see. Thing is the first movie was a smart witty sexy dark comedy aimed at adults. This movie is a childish immature infantile watered down excuse of a comedy that isn't really aimed at anyone. The kids won't appreciate the performances or at least what they were aiming for and there's nothing too visually appealing going on for them either whilst its way too dumb and soft for adults. There's no point having Jamie Lee Curtis looking all slinky if she's not gonna actually do anything.I think the idea for a quaint little British zoo battling against corporate suits is fine and has promise but its been completely squandered here. For the first time ever I would have to say that the shenanigans of both Cleese and Palin actually bored and annoyed me at times. I've never really come across a movie that has tried to pretty much copy its predecessors formula so blatantly. I mean seriously! why would you even watch this when you have the first movie which is exactly the same and so much better.410".

The zoo employees try in vain to persuade Rollo that some of the animals are in fact fierce but it doesn't work. Rollo's solution turns out to be quite hilarious and not as demented as it might seem.But Rod is not happy with the job Rollo is doing and he sends Vince and Willa to make improvements. With hilarious results. The zoo employees look like NASCAR drivers and every exhibit appears to have a sponsor.Add to that a naughty sense of humor. For example while Rollo is hiding some of the less desirable animals in his sleeping quarters Willa on the phone thinks he has numerous women with him. Plenty of other evidence of Rollo's supposed womanizing gets him in even more trouble. And then there is the time the woman falls down steps and needs an ambulance. One has to forget the concern that might be felt for characters in pain in most movies or TV shows and just enjoy the moment.John Cleese and Jamie Lee Curtis both do fine jobs here. Cleese has an insane sense of humor though his consideration for others lacks the outrageousness of Basil Fawlty. That's probably a good thing Kevin Klines's two characters do enough of that sort of thing. Curtis does her best work when not even saying a word making expert use of facial expressions. Plus she has a hot body and shows it off in tight and often revealing outfits.I don't think I'd recommend this for children. But it might appeal to the Monty Python fans.".

I only liked the first one of the telephone call. The matter of Kevin Kline playing 2 characters wasn't understood. Even the 2 characters were so silly themselves especially the father's one it gave us free farts along the way for nothing but exciting the nausea. Another character the one played by Michael Palin was totally unfunny. In fact the comedy in this movie suffered from being nonexistent. The talking scenes are plenty with no ironic stuff unless it's about Cleese being a playboy!. Save the sequence of thinking Cleese as a killer the action comedy was miserable as well. I freaked out due to the huge spider which they used more than once. Not to mention the idiot ending where everything was simply solved by the death of the original owner. If one thing was watchable and entertaining then we're talking about seeing Carey Lowell while being just in her black underwear. Although I'm not of the ones who see how the first gathering of the four leads A Fish Called Wanda  1988 was the greatest comedy or a great comedy but undoubtedly it's more thrilling and comedic than Fierce Creatures. Maybe this one would be interesting to some middle aged middle class men who would feel attached to John Cleese's character since the crazy situations make him win the love he wishes and never had the boldness to achieve it. Otherwise it's one heavy movie with empty circles that alleges being funny. Therefore saying that this is a comedy is like saying that you saw the Invisible Man in no Invisible Man movie it's possible !!".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite the fact that this movie isn't a sequel to A Fish Called Wanda many people like to compare this Fierce Creatures with it. Some even seem to see that as enough reason not to like this movie. Personally I wouldn't go that far. For as far as I know the only comparison that can be made between the two is the fact that its story deals about animals and that most actors from the first movie also played a role in the second one. I don't think that's reason enough to like or dislike this movie and since I try to see it as a new and separate movie I'll not make any further comparison between the two.When a massive company  which is active in all kinds of industrial and commercial branches  takes over the failing London Marwood Zoo the cruel tycoon Rod McCain is only interested in bringing more business to the zoo or in case that isn't possible to sell it to Japanese owners who will turn it into a golf course. Octopus Inc. that's the wellchosen name of the company hires a new manager called Rollo Lee who almost immediately comes up with a plan that will definitely attract more customers. The zoo will have to get rid of all animals that aren't ferocious or dangerous enough because according to him the audience is only interested in dangerous things. This new policy shocks the zookeepers who will do anything possible to make him change ideas. But in the meantime Rod McCain wants to see results and when he doesn't get them quickly enough he sends in his son Vince McCain and the upandcoming business executive Willa Weston. They will have to take over control from Rollo Lee but once they are there Willa's views on zoo management completely change. While Vince comes up with a lot of merchandise fake robotic animals a lot of publicity boards all over the place... she starts to realize the true value of these animals. Together with Rollo and the staff she tries to prevent that the McCain's will completely destroy this zoo...Overall the quality of this movie is quite good and the acting has a lot to do with that of course. I guess not everybody appreciates it as much as I do but I really like John Cleese's style and in my opinion his interaction with Jamie Lee Curtis really works. Also interesting is Kevin Kline in his double role Michael Palin as the bugloving zookeeper... I'm certainly not going to say that it's the best comedy I've ever seen but I had a good time with it. Even though not all the jokes and gags worked perfectly there were enough good ones to make me forget about that. And being a marketeer myself I had even more fun with the jokes about the publicity. In our business it's very easy to go too far and that's something that was shown very well in this movie. Now don't think that I believe they should show this in every class about the do's and don't's in publicity but it worked for me and that's all that counted when I was watching this movie.Overall I had a good time watching this movie but I can understand that not everybody appreciates it as much as I do. Personally I love all animals but many people don't and may therefor not be that interested in this movie. Seeing so many of them in this movie together with those fine and famous actors really gave me a good time though. Add to this a simple but decent story some fine jokes... and you know why I liked this movie. I give it a 7.510.".

	schema:headline " Noir In The City";
	schema:reviewBody "In this contemporary film noir two brothers with the same alma mater Folsom Prison discover something about loyalty and what honor among thieves' really means in City of Industry' directed by John Irvin.  Lee Egan Timothy Hutton puts together a crew of four men including his brother Roy Harvey Keitel to take down a jewelry store in Palm Springs California.  If all goes well they look to score a cool three mil in diamonds and Lee has a fence in L.A. ready to move the merchandise.  Lee and Roy are solid as is Jorge Wade Dominguez the third member of the crew who is already looking at 2 to 5 in Folsom having been convicted of carrying a concealed weapon.  Jorge wants a quick score that will take care of his wife Rachel Famke Janssen and their two kids while he's away. The wild card of the bunch is Skip Kovich Stephen Dorff their wheel man he has a wild streak that emboldens him too much for his own good a flaky girlfriend and some ideas of his own about how the split from the job should go down.  Lee contends that it's going to be an easy score with each man's share being Not bad for a day's work.'  But you can bet that anytime you have a sure thing' it's going to turn out to be anything but and this caper is of course no exception.As is befitting the subject matter the film is dark much of it takes place at night or in rather seedy industrial locales with a touch of artistic cinematography that gives a sense of urgency to the story.  It quickly shifts from the posh atmosphere of Palm Springs to downtown Los Angeles and Chinatown an environment through which you get a sense of who these guys are and what they are about.  As Rachel says to Roy at one point You guys are all alike'As Roy Keitel carries the film with the kind of credible performance we've come to expect from him.  While this character is certainly not a stretch for him you've seen Roy' many times before played by Keitel and others he does put a unique stamp on him he's familiar but Keitel manages to avoid letting him slip into stereotype.  And that is no easy task when you take into consideration that in reality a man like Roy would necessarily share certain traits with others of his ilk.  What makes the difference is Keitel's consummate ability as an actor and his concern with fleshing out the details of his character.The role of Lee is something of a departure for Hutton though similar to the part he played in Playing God' but with much more definition.  He gives Lee a very real' quality the cool confidence of one who lives just beyond the fringe of what society deems acceptable.  When he mentions that he's been in Folsom it's believable.  Dorff meanwhile is effective as Skip a guy perpetually pumped and strung out crazy but like a fox with an aura of menace about him that is nearly tangible.  In attitude and style Skip is reminiscent of Laurence Fishburne's twofisted gun toting Jump in King of New York.'  And Janssen gives a notable performance also successfully creating the one character in the film with whom the audience can sympathize.  You feel her desperation and the concern she has for her children's well being which effectively adds valuable context to the story.The supporting cast includes Michael Jai White Odell Lucy Liu Cathi Reno Wilson Keshaun Dana Barron Gena Tamara Clatterbuck Sunny Brian Brophy Backus and Francois Chau Uncle Luke.  A violent and stylish examination of the criminal element in our midst City of Industry' is a hardedged film that presents the matteroffact way in which those who subscribe to a life of crime seemingly function within their own sect of society.  It's a part of life many would just as soon deny in reality but as Steve McQueen said many years ago in Bullitt' That's where half of it is.'  And a film like this is not about to let you forget it.  I rate this one 810.".

With solid production values and a top notch cast and set against a sunny and seedy Los Angeles backdrop this fastpaced story of desperate criminals driven by greed and revenge is the perfect vehicle for Guy's Movie Night.Harvey Keitel is at his best as Roy Egan the hardened career criminal bent on avenging a doublecross by former partnerincrime Skip Kovich played by Stephen Dorff in his best performance ever.  Also along for the ride are Timothy Hutton the late Wade Dominguez Dangerous Minds and a very sexy Famke Janssen.  As if this weren't enough this movie is notable for providing the only film nude scenes of Lucy Liu a brief role as Dorff's stripper exgirlfriend and Dana Barron Audry Griswold in the original Vacation.Despite its occasional plot holes this film gets better with repeated viewings.  And for fans of what my Manly Man Movie Night associates have deemed Keiteling the mandatory Harvey Keitel emotional and physical meltdown e.g. the church scene in Bad Lieutenant it doesn't get any better than this.  However the film is quite violent and I have not met many women who like it.  Still City of Industry belongs in the collection of any fan of revengebased action thrillers.".

He plays Roy Egan a veteran con helping his kid brother Lee Timothy Hutton and two other desperados pull a big jewel job in Palm Springs. The job goes well but then one of the gang gets murderously greedy and Roy goes into LA after him and the loot.The other element which lifts the movie from competent to first rate are the downtown and industrial locations. For once we see an LA not made up exclusively of lush areas like Beverly Hills on the one hand and nogo ghettos like South Central on the other. At the same time writer Ken Solarz and director John Irvin make good use of LA's ethnic mix with both Chinese and Black gangs playing a part as Roy hunts his man. Hutton Stephen Dorff Wade Dominguez and Famke Janssen contribute solid performances and Lucy Liu is also to be seen. The movie may descend into too much mayhem for some and the sunny epilogue seems out of place but this is a mustsee for thrillerlovers.".

He is convinced by his brother Lee to rob a jewelry store  when is Harvey going to learn not to rob jewelry stores? They are joined by Lee's friends Jorge and Skip  these are four macho guys who we care about because they care about each other  except Skip who doesn't seem to care about anything.  When the heist goes bad Roy spends the rest of the movie hunting down the guy who betrayed him. There is a scene when Roy is alone in a hotel room and begins to pound a table  even though he says nothing we can feel his fury and frustration building  this is Keitel at his best.  All the acting in this movie is great  the four male leads are well cast and work well together and Jorge's wife Rachel is sympathetic as a young mother who wants to do what's best for her kids.  Elliot Gould has a small part as a loan shark and Lucy Liu shows up briefly as an exotic dancer.  The locations are interesting  this is the true dark side of L.A. and the ending  though violent is satisfying and stays with you.  This movie also has one of the best soundtracks I've heard. City of Industry will grab you and pull you in at the opening credits and not let you go until the very end.".

	schema:headline " The most surprising thing about the film is how it takes such a familiar premise and gets it wrong.";
	schema:reviewBody "The biggest gripe I have with City of Industry is not because of its familiarity but for its execution. I love the genre of noir pulpy crime and a couple of heist films but City of Industry is just a bank job too far a wise talking gangster too far and a story of pulp fiction too far. City of Industry takes place in a world in which car alarms do not exist in which if someone kicks open your apartment door and you're asleep you do not wake up a world in which people can survive multiple gun shot wounds without professional medical help and a world in which jewellery robbers don't wear masks. Throw in some badly done gunfights and a weak romance subplot and you have a sort of fun at times gritty crime film but something forgettable in the long run.The biggest problem I had with City of Industry is its point of view approach. It sounds like a funny thing to be pulling up a film for but just who exactly is the protagonist here? Who are we supposed to be following? Who's telling this story? It seems the film wants us to focus on several different characters at once but only one of them is in the film long enough for us to care for them while the others fill in the blanks when Roy Egan Keitel isn't on screen. At the beginning Rachel Janssen and Jorge Dominguez talk on the phone  he is due to go to prison for a few years and Rachel his wife is upset about this as you'd expect only twenty minutes later the film's initial incident has happened and Jorge is out of the picture. Before you say something this is not a spoiler because the film's premise is a guy hunts for a betrayer after they kill his two heist partners. That gives away enough right there so why does the film have its initial character build up revolve around someone it'll kill off ten minutes later?Secondly it seems that Egan is the character from whose point of view we're seeing this. The scene that suggests this is when he's standing at the trailer door when Skip well played by Stephen Dorff arrives because the camera cuts to his point of view the point of view angle is very important as it puts the audience in the character's head so the film has changed its mind again. The closing monologue all about how it was 'our' struggle and no one will ever know 'our' story is told to us by a character who has just spent all of about nine minutes on screen. Sorry but it's not 'your' story because you didn't even do anything bar stay at home and look after the kids  at this point the protagonist or who we think is the protagonist has disappeared.So the film is muddled in who is delivering the film whose story is it anyway? Think of any other film that uses voice over work and chances are when they show other characters doing things a million miles away from them the film will never 'shift' to their point of view. And so the film's initial incident kicks Egan into action as he punches and shoots his way through the city looking for Skip an amateur amongst professionals with his mistreating of women and his hip fancy music. There is some fun to be had out of this little journey because the film is feeding its narrative drive that is revenge with the obligatory yet entertaining scenes you expect. Egan floors a jerk of a bartender he spends some time with the widow that is Rachel and he gets around stealing cars and interrogating people  good fun you think.But then the film steers itself off the thin track it was already on. Revenge is still in the back of the film's mind but it is not the drive anymore. There is a subplot that opens up involving money owed money stolen money I'm not sure. All I know is that Skip gets into trouble with some AfricanAmerican gangsters and hell threatens to break loose I say 'threaten' because nothing much actually happens. If we take 1999's Payback we can see that Porter goes after Val for the money he owes him Porter narrates and we do not get distracted by anything else until the dnouement between Val and Porter also whenever Val is on screen it is a constant build up of how angry Porter is and how vulnerable Val is in City of Industry Skip continues to act deranged and immaturely alienating us from the film's crime world and the revenge narrativedrive is sort of substituted for a little more violence and some characters running around for some missing money.It's at this point around about the fortyfive minute mark that the film looses us it has abandoned its approach and has opted for explosions impossible feats and mere petty violence. Nice opening nice little hunt for Egan until a certain point and then 'bam' we aren't having fun anymore. Then the film gives us a satisfying dnouement before cheating us again and having Egan disappear. Rachel is left to tell us how hard it was for her to get everything sorted out but that's just silly since she didn't do anything. Maybe a better film have been eliminating Regan in the trailer park and then having Rachel go on the revenge mission  what fun that might've been.".

City of Industry takes place in a world in which car alarms do not exist in which if someone kicks open your apartment door and you're asleep you do not wake up a world in which people can survive multiple gun shot wounds without professional medical help and a world in which jewellery robbers don't wear masks. Throw in some badly done gunfights and a weak romance subplot and you have a sort of fun at times gritty crime film but something forgettable in the long run.The biggest problem I had with City of Industry is its point of view approach. It sounds like a funny thing to be pulling up a film for but just who exactly is the protagonist here? Who are we supposed to be following? Who's telling this story? It seems the film wants us to focus on several different characters at once but only one of them is in the film long enough for us to care for them while the others fill in the blanks when Roy Egan Keitel isn't on screen. At the beginning Rachel Janssen and Jorge Dominguez talk on the phone  he is due to go to prison for a few years and Rachel his wife is upset about this as you'd expect only twenty minutes later the film's initial incident has happened and Jorge is out of the picture. Before you say something this is not a spoiler because the film's premise is a guy hunts for a betrayer after they kill his two heist partners. That gives away enough right there so why does the film have its initial character build up revolve around someone it'll kill off ten minutes later?Secondly it seems that Egan is the character from whose point of view we're seeing this. The scene that suggests this is when he's standing at the trailer door when Skip well played by Stephen Dorff arrives because the camera cuts to his point of view the point of view angle is very important as it puts the audience in the character's head so the film has changed its mind again. The closing monologue all about how it was 'our' struggle and no one will ever know 'our' story is told to us by a character who has just spent all of about nine minutes on screen. Sorry but it's not 'your' story because you didn't even do anything bar stay at home and look after the kids  at this point the protagonist or who we think is the protagonist has disappeared.So the film is muddled in who is delivering the film whose story is it anyway? Think of any other film that uses voice over work and chances are when they show other characters doing things a million miles away from them the film will never 'shift' to their point of view. And so the film's initial incident kicks Egan into action as he punches and shoots his way through the city looking for Skip an amateur amongst professionals with his mistreating of women and his hip fancy music. There is some fun to be had out of this little journey because the film is feeding its narrative drive that is revenge with the obligatory yet entertaining scenes you expect. Egan floors a jerk of a bartender he spends some time with the widow that is Rachel and he gets around stealing cars and interrogating people  good fun you think.But then the film steers itself off the thin track it was already on. Revenge is still in the back of the film's mind but it is not the drive anymore. There is a subplot that opens up involving money owed money stolen money I'm not sure. All I know is that Skip gets into trouble with some AfricanAmerican gangsters and hell threatens to break loose I say 'threaten' because nothing much actually happens. If we take 1999's Payback we can see that Porter goes after Val for the money he owes him Porter narrates and we do not get distracted by anything else until the dnouement between Val and Porter also whenever Val is on screen it is a constant build up of how angry Porter is and how vulnerable Val is in City of Industry Skip continues to act deranged and immaturely alienating us from the film's crime world and the revenge narrativedrive is sort of substituted for a little more violence and some characters running around for some missing money.It's at this point around about the fortyfive minute mark that the film looses us it has abandoned its approach and has opted for explosions impossible feats and mere petty violence. Nice opening nice little hunt for Egan until a certain point and then 'bam' we aren't having fun anymore. Then the film gives us a satisfying dnouement before cheating us again and having Egan disappear. Rachel is left to tell us how hard it was for her to get everything sorted out but that's just silly since she didn't do anything. Maybe a better film have been eliminating Regan in the trailer park and then having Rachel go on the revenge mission  what fun that might've been.";

Harvey reluctantly joins a heist crew led by little brother Hutton that will knock off highend jewelry store connected to the Russian mob. The brutally executed caper is successful but then Skip Kovic Dorff goes turncoat cancels some of the crew including little brother and now Harvey is out for blood. The big man looks good obviously still hitting the weights with some Risky Business shades and tieless Man in the Arrow shirt look. Okay so he is in his late 50's with a bit of a gut and he walks with a little swayback. But you know what this is the man who pulled off Fingers son and he would dominate the screen even if he walked around LA reading from the Congressional registry. Best scene In his small hotel room after the postrobbery bloodbath Harvey cuts through any Hamletstyle vacillation by pounding a card table with escalating fury overturning it sending out an unholy moan and then setting out to kick some serious A. Only Harvey could turn a wordless moan and the act of overturning a card table into a statement of existential despair. Second best when the big man gives a slimy bartender a beat down. About this second scene postrobbery Harvey goes to a hoodlum hangout and tries to bribe the bartender for the whereabouts of Skip Kovic Dorff. The bartender who we know is in the know tells Harvey to f off and Harvey steps back squints and waits cigarette dangling. That goof with his silly goatee starts scrambling forward from the bar. Harvey administers a serious beatdown KEEPING HIS CIGARETTE IN HIS MOUTH THE WHOLE TIME. Oh and he picks up a gun for good measure. Now that is MOVIE MAKING son. Irvin could have 86'd Eliot Gould and Michael Jai White and the other Hollywood Btypes trying to give the movie some bogus street cred. I buy Eliot Gould as a mobster as easily as I can buy a slurpee using a 3bill earned from my paper route on Mars. More of the stupendously sexy Famke Jannsen. And a nice cameo with Lucy Liu as a stripper with a SM motif. If Irvin was trying to channel the spirit of Michael Mann he might have added more dialogue and made the Dorff character more complex. Still I'll be here when City of 2 Electric Boogaloo comes out.".

Though this film has some film noir elements the essential elements are completely missing. The best film noir features an innocent person who gets dragged into crime. Usually it's as a result of a knowingly bad decision but it comes from the seduction of a femme fatale.Both these elements are missing. The main character played marvelously by Harvey Keitel is a lifelong criminal. There's nothing innocent about him. Nor is there any femme fatale who double or triple crosses him or who seduces him into the misadventure.The film not only lacks the essential hero or antihero and femme fatale it lacks the visual style of most film noir.Finally the film lacks the requisite ending to ever be classified as film noir.Of course there are some film noir elements. It takes place in an urban center LA and dwells in the less upscale parts of town. A lot of the action takes place at night. At the core of the film is a double cross though it isn't the femme fatale and there are no triple crosses and we get introduced to a motley crew of seedy low lifes. There's a good bit of violence but truth be told most classic film noir are not nearly as violent as this film.It's probably best to view this as a revenge film or more accurately a crime revenge drama.".

Stephen Dorff is one of my favorites his talents also deserve better parts what is up with that?

He also blows Jude Law away with his looks and People magazine never has him in there.

John Irvin did a good job directing the movie moving it at a pace thats just right. Its not too slow or fast so the movie mounts suspense as it nears the end. The opening credits are also memorable. With haunting music and a depressing view of a industrial area. The only problem with the film is Timothy Hutton's role is short. He is a good actor too good to have such a short role. Overall the movie has a excellent story combined with the acting from Janssen Keitel and Dorff. All of this makes this at the very least an enjoyable watch.".

I liked his outbursts his emotions on screen the way he handles certain things and people and I liked his moments with Jorge's wife Rachel Famke Janssen.I liked these things but the story is as predictable as it can get. Dorff is a nice villain but he is as predictable as the plot and that doesn't make him very interesting. His violent side is effective and sometimes funny as well but it doesn't add anything to the character.In the end I wasn't really bored with this movie. I had a pretty good time although a lot of things didn't make much sense. In one scene it is day in the next it is night but the events we see seem to happen only moments later.

He is so desperate that he contacts a distant cousin Richard Prescott for help breaking in to the business world of New York City. Along the way he meets his aunt Vera Prescott played by the delicious Margaret Whitton who really steals the show in this role. He also falls in love with Christy Wills who works there and is played admirably by Helen Slater. John Pankow plays the guy in the mail room who helps Brantley. The cast is first rate but the writing is somewhat mediocre material. It's a good entertainment with a first rate cast and the scenes in the country are quite beautiful.".

	schema:reviewBody "Very funny at times serious at others... The Secret Of My Success starring Michael J. Fox is one of my all time favorite movies! J. Fox's acting is right on and the other actors are great too! Fox plays two characters in this film Brantley Foster and the made up Carlton Whitfield. Brantley comes to New York with the hopes of getting a successful business career. He eventually gets a job   as a postal boy! From that point LOTSA weird things happen as he makes up an identity 'Carlton Whitfield' to get in touch with the other SUITS business men and to find out more about this beautiful girl that he saw the other day. The character Melrose John Pankow from TV's Mad About You is also very cool. He's Brantley's coworker at the post office. The character Vera made me crack up a few times too! I think this movie captures the vibe of New York. Where the storyline is going down If you get into the main character it's almost like you're THERE ya know? See this movie a few times and you'll understand what I mean. The film is backed up by some FANTASTIC music. The Soundtrack is really special! SongwriterProducer David Foster is the music producer in this picture and he even made a hard rockin' song with the American multiplatinum selling rock band Night Ranger who by the way are BACK in the music world with two great new studio albums called Neverland and Seven for this movie. The song is called The Secret Of My Success and is the film's theme. I give this film 10 stars because it's such an enjoyable entertaining one!".

Ross wasn't trying to wax philosophic on his viewers though this is meant to be a fun film and it truly is. It is very funny in parts and basically mildly funny at all other times. There's no real lull in this movie that seems boring but you'll only laugh out loud three of four times throughout the course of the film even if you are a big Fox fan. To be honest an episode of Spin City probably has twice as many laughs packed inside of a twentytwo minute episode than this whole movie had. Fox makes this film work though and generally whenever there's a laugh to be had it's a line or action Fox was responsible for. The supporting cast is quite good though Fred Gwynne is sorely underused and when he is introduced in the final moments of the film he is given absolutely no funny material to work with. That was probably the major disappointment of this movie for me but other than that it's pretty sharplywritten directed the music is firstrate and you truly root for Fox throughout. 8 out of 10 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "The eighties the decade of ugly clothes and hairstyles bad music and easily forgettable movies. But there is one positive aspect about that decade and that is Michael J. Fox. He's probably one of the few actors who started his movie career at those days who I still admire. He's still nice to watch especially in light weighted comedies like this one.In fact the title The Secret of My Succes already says enough about what you can expect from this movie also notice the little dollar sign in the title but I'll give a short resume anyway. It shows how Brantley Foster a talented and welleducated young man coming from rural Kansas goes to New York to find a suiting job and a nice girlfriend. But he isn't very successful no company wants to hire him because he doesn't have any experience. Before leaving Kansas for the Big Apple his father had bought him a return ticket home and his mother gave him the address of his in New York living uncle Howard Prescott just in case when he should need some help. But what Foster didn't know is that his uncle runs a multimilliondollar company. When he pays him a visit he gets a job ... in the mail room. But then he meets Christy Wills who happens to be one of the top executives. Believing that the best way to win her over is by posing as an executive Brantley decides to take a position under the name Carlton Whitfield and of course things soon start to get completely out of hand...I admit that this movie is as 'eighties' as you can get them. I'm pretty sure that noone of todays directors would be able to make it exactly the way it looks because they don't write scripts like that anymore and there are no more actors like Fox. The man that comes closest for this kind of role is probably Jim Carrey but even then you would get a completely different kind of movie. It's probably thanks to Michael J. Fox who is really very nice in this movie that I forgot about most of its flaws. Once again he's the boyish sweet guy and that's probably the best thing this movie has to offer. If it hadn't been for him almost noone would ever have seen the movie or would still remember it because the story isn't special and it's too typical for that time period. All in all this is a fastpaced comedy full of typical eighties clichs but it works thanks to Michael J. Fox's performance and that's why I still give it a 710.".

'Baby Boom' and 'Working Girl' are other titles that come to mind. The Secret of My Success is a charming movie though sometimes not a very funny one. As one viewer wrote it is likely Michael J. Fox's innocent goodnatured character that drives what might otherwise be only a mildly amusing movie. Margaret Whitton and John Pankow had he not said 'suits' so many damn times are pleasing secondary characters as well and a much needed counterbalance to the obnoxious characters that Helen Slater and Richard Jordan portray. Brantley Foster Fox fresh off the Kansas farm learns the harsh reality of a business graduate's life when he travels to New York expecting to become the next CEO of some company. Nevermind find a job he can't even seem to get past the interview stage with one rejection after another. And these are some of the funniest lines in the films. Especially when Brantley asks his interviewer how he can get hardnosed business experience if no one will hire him. If we hired you to get experience you'd take that experience and get a better job. If you'd joined our training program right out of high school you would've had a job today. Brantley asks curiously Why did I go to college. The interviewer laughs You had fun didn't you? Brantley decides to dial up some unknown uncle Howard hoping to get a job with his company in his last resort. And his first impression work landing him a job in the mailroom. But Brantely has his sights on bigger better things and uses his newfound position to establish his plan. That is he is going to be the new great employee at Prescott's employee but as Carlton Whitton a business mastermind. Trying to run one life is hard enough and many comedic mishaps arise when Brantley tries to maintain his own life and pose as Carlton Whitton on a near fulltime basis as well. He has trouble separating the two when he has to keep hiding Carlton Whitton from his uncle Howard who obviously knows who he is. He simultaneously has to hide his true identity from a fellow coworker that he falls in love with Helen Slater. Add to the mix that Howard is having an affair with Christy Slater and asks her to spy on Cartlon Whitton because he suspects a spy within his company during rumors of a hostile takeover. Can Brantley keep up with it all? It is the only way to prove to anyone that he's not some dumb college kid. His success depends on it.The movie is kind of funny and pretty dated. Sometimes Fox's character is too charming. He never seems to get too angry even after figuring that some people in the company were trying hard to screw him out of his job both as Carlton and as Brantley. But his charm and some of those strange mishaps the sequence with the four characters at the townhouse sneaking around at night is a nice arrangement keep the movie going. Best recommended for 80s fans or Michael J. Fox fans who would mostly likely be immune to some of the films flaws.".

	schema:reviewBody "Brantley Foster Michael J Fox moves away from his parents in Kansas to be successful in New York. After unsuccessful attempts in interviews resorting to lying hoping he can get a job that way he finally succumbs to pleading for a job at his 'Uncle Howard's' Richard Jordan company as a mailman and adopts a double identity. He calls himself 'Carlton Whitfield' after Elmer Whitfield's cousin who went to New York and 'came back with his head shaved and an earring stuck in his cheek'. From there he leads a double life as part mailmanpart suit incidents ensue to make sure he succeeds in the end gets the originally reluctant girl and make everybody happy by owning the company.First of all the bad points. To rate this film logically you have to take into account it is unrealistic ridiculous and the acting can be dubious at times. There are some gaping plot holes in the film too. Here are a few that come from the top of my head I am sure there are more The biggest irony of this film is that Brantley keeps saying 'I've got to make it on my own'. The truth is he got a chance at success through nepotism. He was fortunate enough to be a distant nephew of the boss of Penrose. Brantley has only been working for what seems like hours and gets to ferry the executive's wife back to her home. I'm sure responsibility like that would require a trustworthy person who has worked there for some time much less a mailman lol. Any company would have been suspicious of the amount of times the lifts 'failed' because of the amount of times Brantley changes his clothes in there.For such a heartwarming film there is some bizarre ugliness within most notably the incest and the couple having loud sex in the apartment next door. Now I must make it clear that at least Brantley and Vera are related only tenuously by marriage and both didn't know this fact beforehand. The overacted sex in the nextdoor apartment scene was gratuitous complete with Brantley opening up a beer as a metaphor for the couple climaxing.Richard Jordan certainly looks the part as 'Uncle' Howard Prescott but doesn't pack that punch needed for the role and so seems pretty subdued for a guy who was introduced by one of the suits as 'ready to blow a bloodvessel'. Helen Slater doesn't really convince as Christy Wills but I'm not too sure she was meant to and Fred 'Herman Munster' Gwynne has an uninspiring cameo towards the end as Donald Davenport. His cameo consists of being sat in the boardroom and looking suspicious.Your interest in this film depends on how much you like Michael J Fox's performance as FosterWhitfield and how much you are nostalgic for the 1980s. If both factors appeal to you this film is an entertaining flight of fancy.The good points are some great lines in the film including lovely cameos by Elizabeth Franz and Drew Schnyder as Brantley Foster's parents Burt and Grace. Margaret Whitton puts on a great performance as 'Vera' pushing all the seductive buttons and John Pankow is believable as easygoing cynic Fred Melrose. Of course Michael J Fox is the thrust of the film who seems to say throughout 'hey I know all this is unrealistic but who cares route for the underdog anyway' and it works to some extent. The Secret of my Success wasn't meant to be Wall Street.Also there is some great New York photography especially at the start of the film that is a time capsule of New York back in the 80s and yes during the intro montage that is Cindy Crawford turning her head second from the end.The soundtracks to the film are excellent though I do wonder how long it took for it to get made as it featured 'Walking on Sunshine' by Katrina and the Waves and 'Oh yeah' by Yello. Those songs were two years old by the time The Secret of my success came out in 1987 'Oh Yeah' also featured more famously in 'Ferris Beuller's Day Off'. Saying that it didn't stop 'Look who's talking' using the Katrina and the Waves song two years later.Great songs in the film involve 'The price of love' by The Who's Roger Daltry and for more pensive scenes 'Don't ask the reason why' by Restless Heart who are more renowned for their country ballads. However the highlight is the blistering theme tune 'Secret of my Success' by Night Ranger which features at the start of the film.Overall if you are going to watch this movie get someone to take your brain for a walk in the meantime as you are not going to need it. Sometimes that can be a good thing as this doesn't promise much yet can be enjoyed on it's own terms.".

This all summed up is just a rough plot to hang M.J.F doing what he does best rushing from one possible disaster to the next and always being one step ahead. Like it says in the tagline Theres no such thing as an overnight success it took Brantley Foster 3 weeks! From the opening montage title sequence this film screams 80's if you've seen Beverly Hills Cop the opening here is similar to the shots of Detroit and 80'smusic that accompanied it only with New York taking centre stage this time also is one of the models in the opening sequence Cindy Crawford!? There is no real logic to the film it's just a sheer unabashed feel good comedy of what it would be like if people really could go from the mail room to head of the board in just 3 weeks. Fox is excellent as ever and this film works because of his presence although there is some good support from Margert Whittons as the bored executive wife. It must also be mentioned Helen Slatter looks stunning in a very eighties way!.I would recommend this film to anyone as a funny film you don't need to think about to hard! 7.510".

	schema:headline " Technically? A failure. But it's also a classic lightweight 80s romp with the always likable Michael J. Fox!";
	schema:reviewBody "The Secret of My Success owes all its minimal success to the casting of Michael J. Fox one of the most likable screen presences in all of film history. In Back to the Future he was the overwhelmed high schooler who accidentally traveled back in time to 1955 and had to find a way back. In Teen Wolf he was the highschooler turned into a werewolf. In The Hard Way one of the best copbuddy films of all time he was the eagertoplease Hollywood actor trying to do some goodnatured research.All his roles fall back on the Sweet Guy persona. In The Secret of My Success he plays Brantley a Kansas boy who makes the big move to the Big Apple where he lands a job at his uncle Howard's Richard Jordan firm. He gradually makes his way up the ladder as a mail boy but his real break comes when he is mistaken for a higherup and tries to woo hardtoget girl Christy Helen Slater a beautiful coworker of the company who buys Brantley's job position.Simple premise but it becomes all the more entangled when Brantley has to run back and forth between different job positions changing clothes in the elevator and getting in a heated affair with his uncle's wife played by Margaret Whitton the kind of lady who doesn't take no for an answer.The film's amorality is what struck me on multiple viewings. It sort of seems dirty and unclean  Brantley's a farm boy but he's eager to get in a romance with his aunt. The casual sexuality of the film is what ultimately makes it sort of disturbing and also sort of memorable as odd as that may sound.Fox shines in the lead role and with any other actor the film would simply fall flat on its face. And to be honest a film like this could never be made nowadays  I can imagine Jim Carrey in such a role but the outcome would be wholly different. The eighties were an entire generation of comedy unto themselves. A lot of people love the comedies from the eighties because so many were made with so little thought and yet a lot of heart kind of like The Secret of My Success. Its mediocrity is what drives it amazingly but also its heart and so many comedies nowadays lack the heart of the comedies from the eighties.I come back to The Secret of My Success a lot probably because I saw it on TV when I was younger and it's been in my head ever since. It's a routine film that's hardly recommendable but I actually enjoy it a lot the more I watch it and it has a kind of frenetic comedic energy that most of the films of the genre are lacking nowadays.The script by Jim Cash nd Jack Epps Jr. seems as though it were one from an earlier decade. It has a delightful sweetness to it that's simply not unnoticeable.I understand how many would dislike this film. The critic Roger Ebert gave The Secret of My Success 1.54 stars upon its inital release in 1987. I can't say I wouldn't have either if I were in his shoes. But comedies over time sort of grow on you and this is one of those cases.It's not as good as Back to the Future or The Hard Way but it's a lot like Fox's Teen Wolf 1985 fastpaced extremely routine cliched flawed and lots of fun. Don't miss this one even if it isn't exactly the pinnacle of comedy.45 stars.John Ulmer".

	schema:reviewBody "After earning an Academy award nomination for her performance in John Ford's 1953 tale of romance and adventure Mogambo the beautiful actress Grace Kelly proved that she was way more than just a pretty face and that there was real talent behind her image. However what truly took her career to new levels were three now classic films she made directed by the legendary Master of Suspense Alfred Hitchcock. Under his direction Kelly made an integral part of the Master's films becoming the perfect embodiment of Hitchcock's idea of a female protagonist. While Kelly debuted two years earlier in the classic Western High Noon one could say that it was Hitchcock who really introduced the beauty and talent of Grace Kelly to the world. Dial M for Murder was the first of Hitchcock's films with Kelly and a movie where once again the Master returns to a familiar theme the perfect murder.The movie is the story of Tony Wendice Ray Milland a former tennis player married to the beautiful and wealthy Margot Grace Kelly and living in an nice apartment in London. Life is good for Tony until he discovers that his wife is cheating on him with an old flame of her famous crime novel writer Mark Halliday Robert Cummings. After that discovery Tony spends a whole years plotting the perfect way to murder his wife in order to inherit her money carefully planning every detail of the crime. When Mark visits London again Tony finds the perfect chance to set his plan in motion and as planned he recruits Charles Swann Anthony Dawson to kill his wife. However bad luck and a sudden change of events will test Tony's plan's infallibility as just as Mark points out human action can originate flaws even in the most perfectly devised plan.Like most Hitchcock's films Dial M for Murder was an adaptation of another artform this time a popular play by Frederick Knott. As Knott was also the writer of the screenplay the movie remains extremely faithful to the play although of course not without its differences. Knott's script is wonderfully constructed as like in the play the dialog is witty and simply captivating with many twists and turns that spiced up the complex plot and keep it from being boring or tiresome. An interesting feature of the movie is that oddly there are no black and white morality in the characters and it's easy not only to sympathize with Margot despite she being cheating on her husband but also to sympathize with Tony despite he wanting to kill his wife as the characters are wonderfully developed with very detailed personalities.It seems that Hitchcock's knows that the dialog is the highlight of the play as he deliberately focuses on his actors and uses an elegant camerawork to frame the whole movie inside the apartment. The movie literally is shot entirely in one single room only two other sets are used and only briefly but Hitchcock's classy way of using the camera allow a highly dynamic flow that never lets the movie be tiresome. This is also very helpful as Hitchcock just lets his characters keep speaking carefully describing actions and events when other directors would use flashbacks in a similar way to a what the real play would be. While this approach could easily get boring Hitchcock's use of colors and overall visual imagery simply creates the perfect medium to allow Knott's dialog to shine.Without disrespecting John Ford or Fred Zinnemann I think that it was Hitchcock who finally could allow Kelly's talent to shine beyond her physical beauty. Grace Kelly makes her character shine with her subtle and restrained performance specially showing her skill in the second half of the film. While often Kelly receives top honors in this movie it is actually Ray Milland who makes the whole movie work with his suave and charming villian. Milland's performance is simply terrific making his character nice enough to win the sympathies of the audience yet still frighteningly intelligent as the mastermind of the plot. John Williams appears as the Inspector in charge to solve the complex puzzle and delivers a classic performance as the Enlgish gentleman decided to find the final answer. Only Robert Cummings seems miscast as Mark Halliday although a lot of his weak performance could be blamed to Milland Kelly and Williams overshadowing him with their excellent work.In many ways Dial M for Murder shares many things with Rope as not only the two films are based on successful plays they are also about committing the perfect murder and oddly they are both experiments while Rope was conceived as a movie in one take Dial M for Murder was done as 3D movie. Sadly the interest in 3D was dying when the film was released so few theaters carried the movie complete with the gimmick a real shame as Hitchcock's use of the technology unlike most 3D films of its time was conceived as a way to enhance the claustrophobia of the Wendices' apartment instead of using it to merely shock the audience with stuff coming out of the screen as seen in for example House of Wax. While not too fond of the gimmick Hitchcock truly gave it a good and intelligent albeit subtle use to it.Dial M for Murder is probably less celebrated than the Master's most famous movies the fact that it came out the same years as Rear Window again with Grace Kelly may have had something to do with it too. While a subtler and more restrained tale of suspense this is still the Master at his best as the movie proves that when he was at the top of his game no other director was comparable to him. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "There is a lot to admire about Alfred Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder and I do hold the film with a great deal of admiration and respect. However what I adore about the movie the most more than the cinematography the suspense the acting and even the direction is the work by screenwriter Frederick Knott. Mr. Knott based the screenplay for Dial M for Murder on his successful stage production which I have never seen but am told contains almost all of the words we hear in the film. And the words are music to the ears. They sing with intelligence wit that Mr. Hitchcock certainly found attractive and best of all an easy transition to the screen. Many times when a stage production goes to film as far as I am concerned the results even if good are uneven. Frequently the dialogue and restricted set space allowed tend to give off the impression of a filmed play not a cinematic experience. Another Hitchcock film 1948's Rope though valiant interesting and successful attempted this and suffered from this difficult struggle.But the dialogue put on film here is exceptional. I write this review having seen Dial M for Murder two or three times and wanting to see it once again. Many reviewers myself included have tried watching films with the sound off. I want to try the opposite. I want to close my eyes and just listen to the dialogue because it's so strong. The MacGuffin conversation at the beginning with a perfectly cast Ray Milland blackmailing a perfectly cast Anthony Dawson into murdering a perfectly cast Grace Kelly is brilliantly written by Mr. Knott. It was clearly from a stage production as it explains the plot background in great detail and goes on for the better part of twenty minutes. Both men are fleshed out giving us their personalities and individual tendencies. And even though Dial M for Murder pretty much stays on just one small set an apartment in London in which we see mostly the foyer a little of the bedroom and just a glimpse of the kitchen what happens there is so fascinating that we do not really want to venture out into the city.And that is just the setup. The dialogue remains insistently interesting and clever throughout the picture. It also has that subtle dark sense of humor that Alfred Hitchcock was keen on. It also has the ironic touches such as when Mr. Milland as the jealous husband kisses his unfaithful wife on the night she is to be murdered and tells her Goodbye my dear. The audience having been given every single little detail about the scheme and how it is to unfold cringes with a dark realization that Mr. Hitchcock might just go through with Mr. Milland's plot. Mr. Hitchcock as the director is also due tremendous credit for his trademark of creating tension. Screenwriter Knott brilliantly lays out for the audience not the victim how the murder will go through but Mr. Hitchcock's camera dutifully follows everything as the scheme goes along. And before we realize it if something starts to go wrong we become scared and tense. And you can imagine my guilt when I realized I was feeling scared that a plan to murder someone just might not go through. It's Mr. Hitchcock's gift at work.Dimitri Tiomkin a very good film composer hits all the write notes that includes knowing when he needs to tell his violins and trumpets to shut up. Robert Burks' cinematography is also strong with effective usage of shadows and streaks of light. Colors are omnipresent. And even though Dial M for Murder was shot with the intent to be seen in 3D it is hardly evident. When I first saw the film in much superior 2D I did not mind the lamps and such in the foreground such as when one bisects the screen between Ray Milland and Anthony Dawson during the opening sequence. I just thought it was a clever piece of filmmaking and misc en scene not a cheap gimmick like in most 3D movies today. Dial M for Murder is a nearperfect movie of its kind pumped full of smart dialogue and dazzling energy. This is one of the few playtomovie transition that I have seen where I have suddenly become eager to see the original stage production.".

I do wish Hitchcock could have done better with his backprojection unit an oldfashioned jarring trait he still hadn't grown out of by Marnie some 10 years later and I occasionally found the constant too frivolous background music an intrusion but it's well paced throughout helped considerably by an onform cast.Ray Milland is excellent in a kind of darker Cary Grant type persona Grace Kelly who'd want to murder her? goes convincingly from loveliness to wretchedness while it's pleasing to see Robert Cumming to the fore recalled by Hitch for the first time in over a decade since Saboteur in 1942. The actors playing the would be murderer and nosey police inspector are just fine too.About those flourishes... perhaps the most famous being the changing spotlight on Grace Kelly's doomed face as her trial is condensed into just a few terse minutes and of course the murder scene itself even if one can't imagine her extended stabbing gesture being strong enough to cut through Swann's jacket far less kill him stone dead but I also enjoyed the raised tracking shot looking down on Milland as he explains his plot to Swann and particularly the parting shadows of lovers Cumming and Kelly at Milland's unexpected approach.Yes it's old fashioned Hollywood moviemaking but it's oldfashioned Hollywood moviemaking at its best and in my opinion an unjustly overlooked effort from the Master.".

The actors playing the would be murderer and nosey police inspector are just fine too.About those flourishes... perhaps the most famous being the changing spotlight on Grace Kelly's doomed face as her trial is condensed into just a few terse minutes and of course the murder scene itself even if one can't imagine her extended stabbing gesture being strong enough to cut through Swann's jacket far less kill him stone dead but I also enjoyed the raised tracking shot looking down on Milland as he explains his plot to Swann and particularly the parting shadows of lovers Cumming and Kelly at Milland's unexpected approach.Yes it's old fashioned Hollywood moviemaking but it's oldfashioned Hollywood moviemaking at its best and in my opinion an unjustly overlooked effort from the Master.";

	schema:reviewBody "1954 was a big year for Grace Kelly.  She played in Hitchcock's classic Rear window and she won an Oscar for best actress in The country girl and most people tend to forget that she starred in yet another classic Dial M for murder.  Starring Grace Kelly Ray Milland and Robert Cummings it is simply one of Hitchcock's finest movies of alltime.  In fact I would consider it to be my second favorite Hitchcock movie ever my first being Psycho although I haven't seen Rear window yet.  Margot Grace Kelly is married to Tony Wendice Ray Milland an extennis player.  However she has been seeing another man named Mark Halliday Robert Cummings.  Mark writes crime stories.  The two of them think that Tony doesn't know about their relationship but they're wrong Tony has known about this relationship for one year and seems to have had enough of it.  So when Mark who lives in NewYork comes to London to see Margot Tony wants to go out with Mark and his wife.  But the night of the event Tony is unable to go.  So he tells Margot to take Mark out and to have a good time.  The only problem is that Tony doesn't really have something that's keeping him from going out with Margot and Mark.  He has another plan the plan being to blackmail one of his old college friends that has become a small time crook into murdering his wife.  What follows this is pure entertainment at its best.  As usual Hitchcock masterfully directs this movie and has the right actors to do the job.  Ray Milland and Grace Kelly deliver very good performances and surprisingly enough Robert Cummings does a rather good job in his role of Mark Halliday the American crime novel writer who accidentally stumbles on the answer. But it is John Williams who steals the show with his great performance as Inspector Hubbard the detective who holds the key to the whole mistery.  He is simply excellent and pretty funny when he is supposed to be.  Another of his great performances is in Witness for the prosecution where he played Brogan Moore Charles Laughton's very good friend and seconding lawyer in the case.  As for Dial M for murder well it's one of those movies that anyone should see at pretty much any cost.".

I could never understand the attraction of 3D movies least of all with this particular attempt or why Kelly was continually uglified by the Hollywood machine when she never looked lovelier than in here when she was playing stressed out throughout.I wonder if Hitch remembered the jokey murder scene he did in 1930 in Elstree Calling when Jameson Thomas realised he was murdering in the wrong apartment?

For instance Mark writes mystery novels only because this explains his ability to read the crime scene. Most of the movie's dialogue is expository long scenes where the characters debate the minutiae of evidence found at the scene without an interesting subtext. The movie is known for taking place almost entirely in the Wendices' living room and Hitchcock does a good job of varying the camera angles to make you forget there's just one set.

But Kelly and Cummings are surprisingly boring for a pair of adulterous lovers.

Though serious concerns adultery murder the death penalty underlie the story we're never made to feel that they are really consequential. It's a cold and mechanical movie which subordinates everything else to the demands of an intricate plot. Contrast this with something like Rear Window whose plot is simple and lacking in twists but whose characters are vividly drawn and act as though their stories really meant something.

	schema:headline " Superior Hitchcock with an exquisite Grace Kelly";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a fine example of the kind of mystery that little old ladies  from Pasadena or Russell Square adore. Perhaps Arsenic and Old Lace  1944 starring Cary Grant might be comparable in its gentile and  bloodless ability to glue us to the screen.  This is certainly one of Hitchcock's best but most of the credit must  go to a devilishly clever play written by Frederick Knott from which  the movie was adapted. He also wrote Wait Until Dark 1967 starring  Audrey Hepburn. Hitchcock does a good job in not tinkering  unnecessarily with the material. He also has the exquisitely beautiful  Grace Kelly to play the part of Margot Wendice.  Ray Milland plays with a kind of hightoned Brit panache her  diabolical husband Tony Wendice a onetime tennis star who married  mostly for security. John Williams is the prim and proper Chief  Inspector Hubbard. He lends to the part a bit of Sherlock Holmesian  flair. One especially liked his taking a moment to comb his mustache  after the case is solved. Robert Cummings unfortunately plays Margot's  American boyfriend as inventively as a sawhorse. For those of you who  might have blinked Hitchcock makes his traditional appearance in the  photo on the wall from Tony Wendice's undergraduate days.  The fulcrum of the plot is the latchkey. It is the clue that  literally unlocks the mystery. There is a modernized redoing of this  movie called A Perfect Murder 1998 starring Michael Douglas and  Gwyneth Paltrow in which a similar business with latchkeys is employed.  I am not very good with clues so it was only after seeing that movie  and Dial M for Murder for the second time that I finally understood  what happened. Follow the latchkey!  Of course I was too distracted by Grace Kelly to fully appreciate such  intricacies. I found myself struck with the ironic notion that anyone  even a cuckolded husband might want to kill Grace Kelly or that a jury  might find her guilty of anything! She remains in my psyche America's  fairytale princess who quit Hollywood at the height of her popularity  after only five years and eleven movies to become a real princess by  marrying Prince Rainier of Monaco. Something was lost there and  something was gained. She was in essence the original Jackie Kennedy  Onassis. I think however that the old saw about the man who marries  for money earning it might apply to American princesses as well.  At any rate Grace Kelly's cool and sublime bearing was on fine display  here. Hitchcock cloths her in discreet nightgowns and snug but  certainly not clinging dresses that show off her delicate figure and  her exquisite arms and hint oh so coyly at her subtle sexuality. She  was 25yearsold stunningly beautiful and in full confidence of her  ability as an actress. She had just finished starring opposite James  Stewart in another splendid Hitchcock oneroom mystery Rear Window  1954 and was about to make The Country Girl 1954 with Bing Crosby  for which she would win an Oscar for Best Actress.  So see this for Grace Kelly who makes Gwyneth Paltrow whom I adore  look downright gawky and for Ray Milland whose urbane scheming seems a  layer or two of hell removed from Michael Douglas's evil manipulations.  By the way the original theatrical trailer preceding these Warner  Brothers Classic videos is what we used to call the Coming  Attractionsthat is clips directly from the movie and a promo. You  might want to fast forward to the movie itself.".

Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 adaptation was the first and certainly the best one even if the master himself considered it one of his lesser efforts. Dial M for Murder will be remembered as Hitchcock's first color film and the first of three thrillers he had made with Grace Kelly the future Princess of Monaco in the prime of her beauty and her talent. Using color proved to be very effective in the film. The first two scenes featuring Kelly wearing a white morning dress in the idyllic scene with her husband Tony and right after that kissing passionately her American lover writer Robert Cummings in the red dress immediately without many words tell the viewer that the story of passion deception betrayal and ultimately murder will follow. Ray Milland Tony Wendice is a surprisingly sympathetic villain which is perhaps not surprising from the actor with talent charm and charisma that equal and remind a lot of both Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart who knows about his wife cheating and decides to teach her a lesson by plotting a very clever murder which will make him a sole heir to her money she is a wealthy one in the family. His plan is perfect and almost works but Margot managed to not only escape the murderer but to turn the table on him while stunned Wendice is on the phone and listens how his well thought of plan collapses. Wendice is very resourceful and he proved to be a master of improvisation because it took him a few minutes in a cab to switch to a plan B that turned a terrified victim Margot into a coldblooded murderess. Now it is up to seasoned and shrewd inspector Hubbard John Williams to find the crucial piece of evidence and to solve the case.As always with Hitchcock his directing is impeccable the camera rarely leaves Wendice's apartment but the film is never claustrophobic which is the case for many plays' adaptation. It breathes and moves freely and we almost forget that we are in the same room for close to two hours. I would not call Dial M for Murder my favorite Hitchcock's film but it is enjoyable clever and witty thriller with the interesting twists outstanding performances and more than one truly memorable scenes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hitchcock brings the successful play Dial M for Murder by Frederick Knott to life in a shocking new way. Adapted by use of the amazing 3D technology.This movie is unique for Hitchcock in many ways. It is shot entirely in one room yet there is never a moment of claustrophobia. As for many movies in the early 50's it was shot in 3D. And you will at times notice scenes that play into that but are done with the greatest of expertise. Also he chose not to change the play at all but rather ride it out.As the aging tennis pro or the jealous husband Ray Milland is solid all the way through. And what can I say about Grace Kelly. Behind only Ingrid Bergman and Donna Reed as the most beautiful and talented actresses of all time. She never fails to impress. She can be quite a darling and at the same time a spectacular bitch.Probably my favorite Hitchcock film since it is the first one I saw. I was introduced to him very early in life at the age of 7 by my wicked older sister. For years Psycho haunted me and Vertigo confused. But I do thank her for Notorious and Rear Window. Dial M for and North by Northwest.Seems to me that Hitch was not the most attractive guy yet like all of us he favored beautiful women. Especially blonde's. This leads me to the question of what does a guy like Hitchcock know about women? Maybe simply how to kill them.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mostly enjoyable movie but hardly a 'great' movie. I am most disappointed by the lack of depth in the Grace Kelly and Cummings characters which are both onenote uninteresting roles. Grace Kelly is wasted in a passive weak and vapid role which relegates her to the status of window dressing not that there is anything wrong with that! she might as well be a nice looking piece of furniture in this movie. The Cummings role is wasted as the passion between him and Kelly is not developed and amazingly the tension that would exist between Milland and Cummings is never apparent!. This guy was sleeping with Milland's wife but you would think they were best friends. What a waste. Would have been a lot more interesting if Kelly and Cummings were not such bland cardboard harmless people and were a little more human with real emotions jealousy hatred passion even a little evil.Milland makes the move interesting to watch as he sets his plan in motion with great charm and flair. Unfortunately as he is the only interesting character you kind of feel bad when he is caught in the end and the two sappy characters prevail. Oh well it could have been a lot more 'noir' if they had not glossed over the fact that Kelly and Cummings are far from the sweet innocents they are portrayed.".

When things go wrong  he improvises a brilliant plan B . In the city  wealthy Margot Mary Wendice Grace Kelly had a brief love affair with the American writer Mark Halliday Robert Cummings while her husband and professional tennis player Tony Wendice was on a tennis tour . But his plan for pulling off the perfect crime is temporarily foiled and quickly switches to another plan . Meanwhile a Police Inspector John Williams who won the 1953 Tony Award to recreate his stage role of Chief Inspector Hubbard investigates the deeds .Topnotch suspense film of a man plotting spouse's killing  full of sustained intrigue  thrills  a few interesting twists and entertainment . The picture  stagy at times  is formed by two parts  a Plan A and a Plan B with even more fun . Casting is frankly magnificent  the stars are excellently cast . Splendid performances from Ray Milland as a rather likable nasty who desires to inherit his wife's fortune and John Williams as an obstinate Inspector who carries out the subsequent investigation . Furthermore  a gorgeous and wonderful Grace Kelly  Hitch arranged to have Grace dressed in bright colors at the start of the film and made them progressively darker as time goes on. Colorful and shimmer cinematography by Robert Burks who uses intelligent camera vantages  being photographed in Technicolor and 3D  which explains the prevalence of lowangle shots with lamps and other objects between us and the cast members.

The movie takes off from there as an intense character battle between three different characters... Tony done by Ray Milland in outstanding performance is icily intense and incredibly wild. He is easily the best of the three... Grace Kelly  Robert Cummings both pale in comparison although Grace is slightly better for the merely reason that her character is left for to do the least amount of truly suspenseful acting...The murder is set up and is deliciously evil The defining moment is when Ray Milland wipes clean every object he touches as he explains to Anthony Dawson how to carry out the murder of his adulterous wife thus not incriminating himself... They discuss the closing of the screen door to the porch the placement of the golden key and the time it will take his woman to answer the distracting phone call...Grace Kelly is the smart but vulnerable Margot... She begins her role dressed in bright crimson reds but as the film progresses and finds herself accused her outfits become darker... Kelly is ingnue enough to be sympathetic but also tough enough to be respected... Her most memorable image was on the phone oblivious to the assassin behind her... Robert Cummings does not fare at all because of his comical face... He is the weakest cast member bringing so little to the table... John Williams is excellent as the dangerous murder weapon tricked by a clever scoundrel... but he somewhere along makes one fatal mistake...Anthony Dawson is absolutely brilliant delightful as the eccentric Chief Inspector watching how the easytalking husband is trying to cover his tracks... As soon as he arrives on scene to investigate the murder there's an instant feeling of electricity... Here's a guy who can read human nature from a mile away... He takes compassion on Kelly but unfortunately the two don't partner up as in cop buddy movies...The film however belongs to the sinister Ray Milland the cold logic husband who designs the murder to look like a routine burglary gone wrong and leads Scotland Yard into believing his wife is guilty of deliberate murder...Milland a genteel charmer with an icy murderous side is perfect as Tony Wendice... If ever there was a demonstration of venality Milland's Tony Wendice was it courteous on the outside devious on the inside... We see his cheery domestic manner with his wife... He blithely sends her out for the evening with her lover then without breaking his stride sits down at the telephone and calls Swan the man he intends to enlist for the murder... There is something chilling about the way in which Milland operates in these scenes Once Swan arrives the polite smile never leaves Milland's face as he switches gears from exchanging pleasantries to blackmail and murder.. The entire scene was shot from the ceiling...'Dial M for Murder' holds its grip pretty well... Hitchcock provides the tension in many directorial tricks Margot's unexpected change in plans for the evening a hiding place for a key blocked by Mark at a critical moment a stopped watch an occupied telephone box Margot's wavering hand holding the telephone that almost blocks Swan's access to her neck Tony taking the key out of Swan's pocket and even briefing his wife what to tell the police...'Dial M for Murder' is a classic stage murder thriller... It never reaches the heights that 'Rear Window' did but it has to be one of the most brilliant stage thrillers ever written... The score composed by Dimitri Tiomkin is both eerie  precarious...Dial M for Murder is a film that makes you pay attention. It is a definite mustsee!".

Meanwhile Tony calls the scum Captain Lesgate  aka Charles Alexander Swann Anthony Dawson that studied with him in the college and blackmails him to murder his wife so that he would inherit her fortune. But there is no perfect crime and things do not work as planned by Tony.Dial M for Murder is one of the best thrillers of cinema history with a theatrical story supported by an excellent screenplay and topnotch performances. Ray Milland is superb in the role of the Machiavellian and cynical Tony Wendice Grace Kelly is extremely gorgeous and sweet in the role of a wife in the 50's and John Williams is great in the role of the efficient and fussy Chief Inspector Hubbard. This time the cameo of Alfred Hitchcock is in the picture of Tony's reunion. In 1998 Andrew Davis remade this movie with A Perfect Crime with Michael Douglas Gwineth Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Disque M para Matar Dial M for Murder".

But when I saw this movie I was quite amazed and quite pleased.The plot is superb and Ray Milland did an excellent work. John Williams even has an equally powerful role and performance.The main thing about this film which I enjoyed most is how the story progresses and how the suspense come out layer by layer.

The story is so interesting and it will bind you to your seat.Recently I heard about this movie and from that time I was looking for it. I went to video library so many times for looking this title and I got it after 3 long weeks. But when I saw this movie I was quite amazed and quite pleased.The plot is superb and Ray Milland did an excellent work. John Williams even has an equally powerful role and performance.The main thing about this film which I enjoyed most is how the story progresses and how the suspense come out layer by layer. Everything is just perfect in this film the story the characters the plot. I enjoyed this movie so much.For all the fans of thriller murder and crime it is an excellent film. Hats off to the Alfred Hitchcock. From me its 910.";

That's the plot of Dial M for Murder in a nutshell.I decided to make this my next Hitchcock film because that's the kind of story that always seems to interest me. Well the primary reason was that I'm in love with Grace Kelly but the plot description was also appealing. Dial M reminded me of Rear Window in a few ways. Most noticeably the sparse yet effective action and the use of a single apartment as the major setting for the film. In the hands of a lesser director those two elements may have been a detriment to the overall quality. But Hitchcock once again works around them marvelously.It's not hard to guess the stage origins of this movie. It actually feels more like a play than a movie. And while that is in no way a negative it does mean a lot of exposition. The story is explained to the viewers instead of shown and because of that I cannot rate Dial M as highly as Psycho Vertigo or Rear Window. It's an interesting movie and it's not hard to find yourself tense during nearly the entire last half. But the execution as a whole could have been better and less expository.".

	schema:reviewBody "I must admit that I scanned through all the comments on this film hoping that someone somewhere might agree with my assessment of the plot as being absurdly overcomplicated. Surely it was relatively straightforward to get an extra key cut even in the 1950s which would have stopped all the ridiculous key swapping activities. At times it seemed more like a magician's con man's? act  now you see it now you don't  rather than a mysterythriller. I thought it was quaint that the local police were called instead of the emergency services when there is a dead body in the apartment.  Perhaps we had the ethos of your local friendly neighbourhood cop on the beat in those days who would clear it all up quite amicably and we could all get on with our lives and perhaps be more careful in future. Not only are keys swapped with gay abandon but also raincoats unnoticed of course. Not at all sure why the crimewriter boyfriend of the wife agreed to go to a stag night with the husband just after he had admitted that he would find it very difficult talking to the bloke who he hardly knew anyway. The whole thing just fails to be anywhere near believable.  Why on earth are all the comments favourable?".

Grace Kelly is a terrible actress but she doesn't even have the crutch of her legendary beauty here as her humiliation goes hand in hand with increasing dowdiness.  And yet the film is a mustsee not only because every Hitchcock film is rich in style and meaning but for two cherishable performances from Ray Milland and John Williams for an extraordinary abstract courtroom scene and for a remarkable play with theatrical metaphors.Robin Wood sees many Hitchcock films as analyses of marriage and DIAL M FOR MURDER is no exception.  Even from the beginning we know there's something wrong with the Wendice union  the opening clench is theatrical cold unreal.  The family home is not comforting but made strange objects don't blend in but are threateningly present lamps drinks bottles etc. always getting in the way of human communication the telephone is an apt metaphor for the crisis in the film.  In a traditional detective story it is through the displacement of ordinary items taken for granted that marks a rupture  the everyday becomes frightening.Wendice is unable to satisfy his wife  he is only interested in her money. when he talks to Swan about his marital difficulties he walks with a cane ostensibly a fake prop but a clear hint of the impotence rejected when he drops it and talks of the murder that will reassert his patriarchal role. He is like a servant in his own home dependent on his wife serving her and her lover drinks.  He is probably gay  the handbag which has been transferred in association from his wife to him is made the butt of a homophobic jibe by Inspector Hubbard.Most importantly the conjugal home resembles a stage set.  This is the governing motif of the film.  Hitchcock subverts the hokey sentiments and values of Knott's play by drawing attention to its staginess.  Props are foregrounded Wendice is clearly a stage directorauthor who is putting on a play planning the murder of his wife.  He talks to Swan like he's a director instructing an actor giving him his lines showing him round the stage telling him what to do where to move crucially giving him his cue timing the 'call'.However although Wendice seems in control the gaze of the film does not belong to him  his authority is already undermined long before his plot unravels.  Frequently filmed in distanceng wide angle this scene with Swan is shot from above spied on from a seemingly unmotivated godlike position which only emhasises the unreality theatricality of the sequence.  There is another author beyond Wendice who is really running the play.  Is it God?  Fate?  Hubris?  This position of authority is jostled for by the four male characters in a frequently homoerotic manner.The only time this kind of shot becomes motivated it belongs to the Inspector suggesting that the law is the godlike arbiter from whom nothing can be hidden.  And this is true but not reassuring the Inspector is cold and detached but more unforgiveably like the other male characters two of whom tried to murder her he sadistically inflicts pain on Mrs. Wendice pushing her out of the story in effect succeeding where Wendice and Swan failed she is absent for most of the film's second half.  The law is shown to be both frightening and whimsical rather like an Old Testament God. This is not comforting.This link between the author and authority both trying to shape meaning and 'create' truth while in reality concealing it Hubbard's assertion of patriarchal truth denies Mrs. Wendice's emotional reality is linked to a story which is invoked in the film's opening MacGuffin the stolen letter. Poe a favourite of Hitchcock's wrote 'The Purloined Letter' about a missive stolen by a respectable government minister form a Queen possibly enjoying an adulterous relationship.  What's written in this letter and who controls it becomes a site of power between the two male characters who squeeze out the female character who owns it altogether.  Knowledge authority power and the artist are linked all are abused all are stolen from women.  Mrs. Wendice's absence in the middle of the film is the anguish seething behind the film's or play's smooth mechanics.  Anyone who thinks Hitchcock is just a technician is an idiot.  he had a profound grasp on the workings of society and how people are sacrificed for it.He also shows the seductive appeal of power  Wendice is suave hilarious imperious mandarin the motor of the film a joy to watch and yet an automaton.  Hubbard's victory over him relies on Wendice's working like clockwork.  The author was really only an actor parroting perfectly his fed lines.  It's significant that it should be a real author who exposes him.".

Some of the more clever guys at the lab had connections with hobbyists in the area and also with local film enthusiasts connected with the city artfilm theater. They'd arranged for a reconstruction of the threeD version of this. I made a special trip for what was billed as the only week ever this would be shown.It was originally filmed in 3D using an unusual process. Two cameras made two color prints. These were delivered together to the theater and shown with two synchronized projectors on the same screen through polarizing lenses. Polarized glasses allowed the viewer to see color 3D.Almost immediately after release the process was abandoned because the projectors required amazing skill and were extraordinarily complicated expensive and unreliable. To reconstruct the original effect several years went into the location of most of the original projectors so that parts could be cannibalized to create the complete kit of Siamese twin projectors. Some missing precision parts may have been fabricated in a spooky government research lab I cannot say. That was only the first impossibility.What had happened shortly after the film was released over 50 years ago within a few months was that the left and right prints were separated and distributed as ordinary versions. To reconstruct a pair you need to have every single frame match. But no prints had all frames complete. Some had been edited by exhibitors for various reasons like time. Others had been broken and respliced and some of those repairs even reversed. Some had frames snipped to create publicity stills. Still others had both some left and some right elements.It apparently was a tremendous effort to scan all prints a frame at a time and reconstruct a matched pair. A previous 3D version had been released but it was no help in fact unwatchable. It reduced the process to the older black and white and didn't do the matching this team did. Its horrible and not even 3D in some places.So I made a special trip to see this in Dayton as it was intended. Hitchcock made this in his spare time while preparing for his masterful Rear Window. It was already a hit play and his contribution was to design the blocking for 3D. Its important because Hitchcock was a master in advancing the notion of a spatial camera a spacesavvy eye. Some of what he did here is not only extraordinary on its own but it can be seen as a sort of sketchpad for some of the indirectly referenced effects on Rear Window. So if you are interested in the world then you are interested in film in space and then Rear Window and as a result this in 3D.I not only saw this but arranged to have the optimum seat in the house. And the place was packed with some of the most enlightened viewers I knew and the swelling of sighs at points was palpable. It was an extraordinary experience. The vision research lab was destroyed shortly thereafter because of Republican actions in Congress. I believe the reconstructed projection machinery was effectively lost forever so the window may have closed to see this properly.You'll have to extrapolate the 3D effects from a twod print. Its not impossible I suppose. I'll give you some clues. He places the camera in one of three modes alternating among them depending on whether we are colluding witnessing or dissecting. The trial scene is excluded from this. Obviously these viewer modes are interleaved appropriately with which character we conspire with the husband a performer the boyfriend mystery writer or the detective. Its easy to work out and quite thrilling to see how he has dialed the vision.This is a replacement comment the original having been deleted along with scores of others by a reader unhappy with comments elsewhere I made about an unrelated actor.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "In order to get his hands on his wife's fortune washed up tennis star Tony Wendice plans to have her killed.  In a carefully planned plot he approaches a small time conman and blackmails him into helping.  However the carefully planned set up goes wrong and Margot kills Swan in a struggle. When the ensuing police investigation assumes that Margot set the whole thing up everything appears perfect for Tony.  However there is no such thing as the perfect murder.Although it is very much a stage play rather than a film this still works well as a thriller due to solid if unspectacular performances and good direction.  The film s split into three main acts  the planning the deed and the conclusion.  The planning is easily the most enjoyable part as it moves quickly and seems to have everything tied up.  The deed is good as we begin to see little things go wrong and the conclusion is enjoyable as the pieces are put together.  The plot is quite straightforward but it's strength is in it's logic  both in set up and conclusion.  It is a little dull at times due to it's static location almost 100 of the film is in the flat but Hitchcock does manage to deliver real tension at key moments.The gimmick of 3D as the film was originally shot to be means that the film is cluttered with shots of action in the background and furniture in the foreground.  It all feels slightly weird to have such a good director frame his shots in this way but it is not too obtrusive.  He does better with the dramatic stuff and manages to give a cold logical air to the planning stages and also makes the actual murder scene very dramatic.The cast deliver quite polished performances without every stretching themselves outside of the character they have been placed in.  So Kelly plays the bewildered wife well Cummings is a typical tough jawed American and Dawson is a bit of a subTerry Thomas.  However it is Milland as the coldly English plotter who makes the film quite watchable in it's first act and is very enjoyably English'.  The final act of the film is made to feel different enough to enjoy due to the input of Wiliams as the Inspector  he is witty but also a good match for Tony.Overall this film is a little too stagy for it's own good but it is still a solid little thriller.  The setting make it feel a little too confined and staged than was necessary but Hitchcock is able to use the location well rather than be hampered by it 3D aside.  An old fashioned detective film in the style of a B movie.".

It was remade in 1998 but had more twists and action scenes added.In this film as in that remake A Perfect Murder I found myself rooting for the husband.

Nobody in the film challenged him on what he was doing. Apparently adultery was okay with the filmmakers here. At least in the remake they made the adulterer into a scumbag although they made the cheating wife into a sympathetic character! No matter who makes this film they are still clueless when it comes to what's right and what's wrong!.".

Kennedy and James Coburn one of the best comedy actors ever Walter Matthau and the city of Paris. Nothing could possibly go wrong don't you think? Audrey Hepburn is Reggie Lambert an American girl married to a swiss guy called Charles Lambert at least that's what she thinks... She's spending her holidays in some ski resort with her best girlfriend Sylvie and the son of hers. Reggie has decided to divorce her husband so she gets back to Paris. Once there she found out that her husband's been killed. From this moment on she gets involved in the funniest spy plot ever.Watching Charade you'll have an smile on your face from the beginning till the very end. And you'll burst out laughing in many moments of the movie. Stanley Donen gets out of every sequence very skillfully and as he did before in Seven Brides or Singin' In The Rain he probes he's an outstanding filmmaker. There're two names that come into my mind every time I watch this movie Alfred Hitchcock and Blake Edwards. In Charade Stanley Donen merged suspense and romanticcomedy in the best possible way. Actor's selection is just perfect the chemical between Hepburn and Grant is simply unbeatable. One more perfect couple to add to Hollywood's Couple's Hall Of Fame side by side with Katharine HepburnSpencer Tracy Katharine HepburnCary Grant him once again! Lauren BacallHumphrey Bogart... It's not easy to find two actors so compatible. What to say about George Kennedy or James Coburn? Best known for their roles in action movies they do their best as CIA agents. And least but not less we got Walter Matthau one of the best comedy actors ever I should've put Walter MatthauJack Lemon in my Couple's Hall Of Fame! doing the best he can that is a lot! as in principle an American Embassy employee. So if you liked North By Northwest or Breakfast At Tiffany's if you think that there's never been a more classy actress than Audrey Hepburn if you do believe that Cary Grant's been one of the more talented actors ever and one of the funniest ones... please don't miss Charade. You'll spend one of the times of your life. Aur Voir Mon Amis!My Rate 1010 or even higher.".

Do try to get ahold of the marvelous Criterion Collection DVD of CHARADE it's well worth seeking out with nifty extras including an utterly delightful commentary track by Stanley Donen and the late Peter Stone. By the way CHARADE is also piggybacked onto the DVD of Jonathan Demme's wellmeaning but disappointing remake THE TRUTH ABOUT CHARLIE. On a related note Donen's second Hitchcock spoofhomage ARABESQUE was released as part of a Gregory Peck boxed DVD set. I'm glad ARABESQUE is available on DVD but I wish they'd recorded a commentary track by Donen and Sophia Loren while they're both still alive and reasonably well. But I digress...watch CHARADE today!

The dialog between Grant and Hepburn is very entertaining as the latter tries to figure out the same thing. There are lots of good lines particularly by Grant. That in itself makes this film fun to watch multiple times. The pacing of this story also is good the film moves fast and spaces the action out smartly.This has to be one of the best movies ever to come out of the 1960s.

Its tasteful humor colorful characters and intelligent plot make Charade one of the best mystery movies ever made but it's not well known even among classic films.Look for it.  Look as hard and as fast as you can.  This film ranks with Clue The Name of the Rose and The 39 Steps as one of the most enjoyable mysteries of all time.  Makes a great datingparty movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Charade is an elegant and witty adventure. Audrey Hepburn is a UN translator whose husband is killed by a seemingly motiveless murderer. In her Paris home she is menaced by exsoldiers James Coburn Ned Glass and George Kennedy fed confusing information by spy Walter Matthau and aided by the charming but elusive Cary Grant. The plot five men who were behind enemy lines in wartime Germany stole a hoard of gold. Now four of them have come back to find the loot and the man who doublecrossed them is secondary to the suspense generated in the treasure hunt across Paris. The villains  particularly Kennedy as a onearmed hood who literally makes sparks fly  are genuinely menacing to poor Hepburn's sexy young widow and trying to work out just on who's side Grant is provides much entertainment especially as he changes identity every quarter of an hour. Charade's director Stanley Donen former dancer and maker of musicals easily outHitches Hitchcock. In its way this was a hugely influential film. The villain with a metal hook motif was taken up again in the Moore Bond Live and Let Die while the music and editing influenced the later Bond cycle the film even has a pretitle teaser scene a trait the later Bonds would make their own. The subplot about stealing gold during wartime provided the basis for the Clint Eastwood actioneer Kelly's Heroes and the recent George Clooney effort Three Kings. The photography lighting and music courtesy of Henri Mancini are as good as  if not better than  anything the Bonds of the time could come up with this is 1963 the same year as From Russia With Love. Particularly riveting is a rooftop fight between Grant and the onearmed Kennedy. This is one of the best fights in cinema history nasty suspenseful and with a viciousness that only the Dalton and Brosnan Bond movies have matched in the action films of recent years. When watching the film you become aware that Grant was the model for the screen Bond. It's a pity he turned down Dr. No and never played the part but at least here we have a taste of what his Bond might have been like. If you like comedy thrillers you won't want to miss a moment of this one. Director Donen composer Mancini and scriptwriter Peter Stone reunited three years later for Arabesque a suspenser with Sophia Loren and Gregory Peck in the Hepburn and Grant roles.".

In a way he was a natural for directing this marvelous movie of adventure and romance based in Paris a city well known to the director. In fact it didn't come as a surprise this is one of his best movies Mr. Donen ever directed. In fact Charade has all the right elements to work as it does. First it's a thriller adventure as the beautiful Reggie is being menaced by some unsavory characters and she has no clue why are they doing that to her. Her dead husband ties her in to all the bad guys that want to get hold of a treasure she possesses but has no idea about what could it be. When Peter enters the picture Reggie feels protected but then there is a doubt planted in her that makes her think twice about his intentions. In the meanwhile Reggie has to put up with those bad guys shadowing her. Charade is so appealing because of the immense talented Audrey Hepburn who was perfect for the role of Reggie. This young woman who works as a translator is one of the best things Ms. Hepburn did on the screen. The actress was a good comedienne as well as an elegant figure that graced whatever she played. Dressed by Givenchy Audrey Hepburn is a beautiful excuse to look at. Cary Grant is seen as the man who ultimately conquers Reggie. In spite of the age difference Mr. Grant was always a welcome addition to any film. The easy chemistry between the two stars is one of the strong points of the film. Cary Grant is perfectly suave in the film. The supporting cast was excellent. Walter Matthau James Coburn George Kennedy Ned Glass among others were perfect.Charade offers a melodious musical score and gives the film a dimension and adds to the action. The great cinematography by Charles Lang takes in the beauty of Paris at its best. This is one of those films in which Paris seems to add to the general enjoyment one feels in watching it. Charade is an excellent film no matter how many times one watches it thanks to the inspired direction of Stanley Donen and the gorgeous Audrey Hepburn who is irresistible in it.".

Though the film can be classified as such the screenplay takes more time to work on the relationship between the two main characters than the average thriller does. And of course it doesn't hurt to have Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant two wonderfully charismatic actors as your leads. Very well written dialogue for the characters only increases the enjoyment. The film wisely focuses on them and leaves the thrills to the background.  Not to say that stuff isn't well written.  The idea isn't terribly enthralling but it's executed with enough twists and turns to keep you interested though if you're anything like me you'll see the surprises coming a mile off.  That was probably the weak point of the film.  It was simply too predictable.   And though I loved the two main characters and I'm glad the film focused on them I would have like to have seem just a bit more time allotted to the three bad guys.  A little more sculpturing could have made them more effect heels than they were not that they were bad.  Thanks to Grant and Hepburn and a devotion by the screenwriters to make their characters great the film is fun to watch.  The suspense is there but not amazingly thrilling.  7.510   12     ".

Now they and the government are looking for the money from her.All that's been left to her as far as her husband's things are the contents of a Lufthansa travel bag and the rather mundane contents of said bag. It's all one big Charade for Audrey she doesn't know who to believe. She'd like to believe Cary Grant and who wouldn't but every time she turns around Grant's got a different character name. He has a total of four during the film. The others are James Coburn George Kennedy Ned Glass and Walter Matthau.Charade boasts a fast moving plot and great location photography in both Paris and the Swiss Alps. It also has a nice musical score with a title song that was up for an Oscar that year. If the song Charade had won it would have been an unprecedented three wins in a row for the songwriting team of Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer. But the song lost to Call Me Irresponsible from Papa's Delicate Condition.It's ironic that Cary Grant at the last minute backed out of doing Sabrina because he thought the contrast in age between him and Audrey Hepburn would not be believed by the audience. Maybe so but they do make a nice couple here and apparently he changed his mind along the way.We should be glad he did.".

Very clever dialogue. The beginning has more of this kind of dialogue that's said staccato fashion which gives it part of the movie a style of its own.It all comes to a head during the final chase and when the twist is finally revealed.

Long underrated and underappreciated and only available in horriblelooking grainy video prints this fabulously entertaining comedythriller is the cinematic equivilant of a champagne cocktail. Often compared perhaps unfavorably to Hitchcock's films of the period Charade contains little of the heavy psychological tension that marked Hitch's work. Instead the film concentrates on witty banter Audrey's wardrobe and a clever scriptand we're the richer for it. Audrey is a sudden widow who is terrifyingly thrust into a web of deceit her late husband it seems was being hunted by three exwar buddies with whom he stole 250000. Audrey they think has the moneyand if she doesn't come up with it quickly she'll be joining him. Cary Grant is the handsome mysterious stranger who may be friend or foe. It had been done before and it's been done since but never with such panache. Henry Mancini's stylish score adds immeasurably to both the fun and the tension and the evernimble Stanley Donen directs the suspense scenes just as deftly as the comic ones. My favorites Audrey trailing Cary dressed inconspicuously in a white Givenchy trenchcoat and huge movie star sunglasses while giving a poor German tourist the fits Audrey finally cornering Cary in her hotel room and lightly kissing her way down his facetoday's filmmakers might take a page from her book this scene is intensely romantic without ever seeing a bit of exposed flesh or dueling tongues and of course the fabulous opening scene I won't give away the surprisewith Audrey wearing one of my favorite Movie Star get ups of all time a hooded mink poncho over a catsuit. This is entertainment with a capital E made all the more enjoyable because it never panders to the lowest common denominator never dips into camp and never breaks a sweat. Today's films continue to mine the same territory and the results are ceaselessly boring tawdry or both. You can FEEL the strain of the writers and actors as they attempt the kind of slick interplay that came naturally to those involved in Charade.

I suppose in the 60's they were experiencing the darker side of stories rather than mostly the sweet movies from the 1950's you normally would see! I swear Hepburn was just stunning as usual on this like really she should've starred in more movies with Grant as she was the right woman for him to play as his lover. I even liked her yellow coat it just looked fabulous on her no wonder girls would want to be like her. I have to say I would be the same myself if I wasn't so lazy lol! Anyways this was a great film with a lotta action and of course having three legends on this makes the movie very enjoyable to watch. I give this a 810!".

But the romantic pairing of Hepburn and Grant transforms this otherwise commonplace thriller into something magical. There may have been better or prettier actresses than Audrey and there may have been better though not handsomer actors than Cary  but no two actors ever exuded sophistication and playfulness the way these two do and they play off one another in this movie with extraordinary charm and electricity. It is truly a pity that they never made another movie together because it would also have been a classic. I don't believe Hepburn ever had another leading man or Grant another leading lady as perfect as these two are together. And the story is sufficiently tense and amusing to make reasonable use of the time when Hepburn and Grant aren't on the screen together.

	schema:reviewBody "In the 29 years of Alcatraz's existence and despite the strict measures 39 captives tried to escape from America's premier maximumsecurity prison during its existence... Thirty six of whom failed... This script is about the other three of whom nothing is known... They may have drowned in San Francisco Bay or they may have got away...Morris Clint Eastwood was a loner a rebel against society the perfect hero that Siegel loves... Lee Marvin in 'The Killers' Steve McQueen in 'Hell is for Heroes' and Richard Widmark in 'Madigan' were all similar types in films which he had directed..In 'Escape From Alcatraz' Eastwood gives his best screen acting to date... It is a charismatic performance that is so idiosyncratic persuasive and powerful... Eastwood gave Morris the rough intelligent aspect that is immediately palpable...The first few minutes of the film consist of Morris being brought by boat to Alcatraz inspected by a doctor and thrown into a cell... Throughout this Eastwood does not speak... But already the audience feels it... They know the character... He has been through this before... He tries to control his mind... He builds a barrier between himself and his surroundings... He holds back his fear but he's not so foolish as to appear brave... Behind his impassivity his mind is calculating... He is studying everyone... Everyone knows prison guards and fellow prisoners alike that this is not a man to be intimidated with easily...But Siegel wasn't making a film about penal cruelty or miscarriage of justice or anything like that... He was presenting a meditative study of the inflexibility of human spirit with a star strong enough in himself to join one sequence to the next... Both Siegel and Eastwood are known for violence but there's relatively little of it this time...This is not to say that Siegel has no interest in character... Stereotype characters such as Doc and Litmus make the film more entertaining... A further example is the inevitable homosexual Wolf Bruce M. Fisher who points out that Morris is a potential victim but realizes he has met his match when he approaches him in the showers one morning and gets three unexpected blows in the groin and a bar of soap in the mouth for his harassment... Another familiar type of character is English Paul Benjamin the leader of the Black mafia who sits in the yard far away from the white inmates... English proves to be a nice guy..But the biggest stereotype of them all is the cold warden although Patrick McGoohan tries as hard as he can to provide Morris with some individual personality... Apart from the flowercrushing and constant attention to his nails he is permitted by the scriptwriter merely to recite phrases that might have come from the prison handbook 'No one has ever escaped from Alcatraz alive. Alcatraz was built to keep all the rotten eggs in one basket. I was specially chosen to make sure the stink from that basket doesn't escape.'But two elements in the film are absolutely real one is the central character which will be considered in a moment and the other is 'The Rock' itself...Siegel's overwhelming achievement is to send the audience to infamous prison for two hours... The claustrophobia the implicit suppression of any joy the barbarity of being caged in isolation cells all these suffocating atrocities come across with such reality that one experiences a total sense of relief when the camera moves into the recreation yard for the clear bright light of every early morning... Siegel's technique in this respect is unique...Siegel's film style seems almost a cinematic interpretation of Eastwood screen persona lean clean and harsh... Here is one example When the incorrigible psychopath is out to finish Eastwood his one chance is in the exercise yard... When he enters the yard he is in need for a weapon... He has none! He slowly advances into the yard toward his victim... The camera goes down to the man's right hand as he walks... After a moment another man puts a knife in that hand... The camera stays on the hand as he keeps moving... After another moment another hand reaches in and grabs the con's arm.... The whole brief sequence is loaded with surprise and suspense... It is in two words pure cinema...Siegel's movie follows the known facts of the escape constantly permitting itself only one act of poetic license at the very end... Throughout the film Siegel uses a yellow chrysanthemum as a symbol of 'heart' to indicate that although the brutal system may have removed everything from the inmates save the questionable privilege of remaining alive in some men at least their spirit survives... 'Doc' an elderly inmate who has spent twenty years there but who is permitted to paint and cultivate chrysanthemums introduces the concept...".

Don Siegel's film is based on the true story of an attempted escape. Some aspects are clichd the psychopathic homosexual for example and by concentrating on the brutality of the regime the film gets you on the side of the escapees at the price of suggesting that prison breakouts are actually a good thing. But in general this is a successful film that has aged well with no sickly sentiment or overdone melodrama by concentrating on the unadorned details of the story the film allows each one to count.

Having had walked around the space of the prison in the dim evening light really enhanced my sense of the movie's environment.Small details like the painting of black shadows for sharp tools that they shared in the tour were also present in the movie very authentic. The lack of action per se perfectly captures the actual mood of the prison where boredom reigned and I thought the film balanced this well with an entertaining cast of characters and welltimed action. Eastwood's silently intense attitude was a good fit for the role and the drama and atmosphere of the escape scene was done perfectly.In short I'd highly recommend the evening tour on Alcatraz followed by a viewing of Escape from Alcatraz you will not be disappointed.".

The suspense during those scenes is outstanding. Clint Eastwood is good as the fairly lowkey character Frank Morris and most of the inmates are likable guys which was highly unlikely in real life.For tourists of San Francisco of which I was one about five years ago I would recommend taking the Alcatraz tour. It's fascinating and makes this movie even more interesting once you've seen the place. I notice the people here at IMDb make the same recommendation on the title page of this film.Much of the rest of the cast are not wellknown actors but they do a fine job in here. This is one of director Don Siegel's final films. He worked with Eastwood on Coogan's Bluff and then Dirty Harry.Transferwise the DVD was not that impressive a bit too grainy for the usual standards. However the story is always interesting and the movie is definitely recommended.".

	schema:reviewBody "Star Clint Eastwood and director Don Siegel made some excellent films together in the '70s. Their final collaboration came in 1979 with Escape From Alcatraz a very authenticlooking prison drama based on the true story of the only successful escape from the notorious islandprison off San Francisco. In reality noone can be sure that Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers DID actually get away.... there is a very real possibility that they drowned or suffered hypothermia while trying to swim to safety. But the bodies of Morris and his cronies were never recovered so neither can anyone categorically state that they perished. As a result of this legendary escape Alcatraz lost its reputation as an inescapable penitentiary and was closed down just over a year later.Convicted bank robber Frank Morris Clint Eastwood is moved to Alcatraz after repeatedly attempting to escape from his previous jail. Here he finds himself at the mercy of a ruthless and powerhungry warden Patrick McGoohan whose attitude toward the prisoners is one of utter contempt.

	onyx:emotionText "Star Clint Eastwood and director Don Siegel made some excellent films together in the '70s. Their final collaboration came in 1979 with Escape From Alcatraz a very authenticlooking prison drama based on the true story of the only successful escape from the notorious islandprison off San Francisco. In reality noone can be sure that Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers DID actually get away.... there is a very real possibility that they drowned or suffered hypothermia while trying to swim to safety. But the bodies of Morris and his cronies were never recovered so neither can anyone categorically state that they perished. As a result of this legendary escape Alcatraz lost its reputation as an inescapable penitentiary and was closed down just over a year later.Convicted bank robber Frank Morris Clint Eastwood is moved to Alcatraz after repeatedly attempting to escape from his previous jail. Here he finds himself at the mercy of a ruthless and powerhungry warden Patrick McGoohan whose attitude toward the prisoners is one of utter contempt. Frank also finds his new fellow inmates to be alternately hostile or hopeless. While some inmates spend their time bullying and intimidating others wallow in despair as endless months pass them by. Among the desperate ones Frank meets Doc Dalton Roberts Blossom a convict with a talent for painting who chops off his own fingers when the warden refuses to let him paint.

	schema:reviewBody "It's a testament to the compelling nature of the story that this film can run an hour and 52 minutes and not feel nearly that long. This is interesting and involving every step of the way with producer  director Don Siegel treating the material in the most matter of fact way possible. There's no melodrama here and no filler. The performances are all low key natural and convincing.Clint Eastwood in his fifth and final pairing with Siegel is well cast as bank robber Frank Morris who's sent to the notorious Alcatraz island prison after having busted out of other prisons. He takes his time adjusting to his new surroundings and makes acquaintances such as Doc Roberts Blossom and English Paul Benjamin meeting up with old friends the Anglin brothers Jack Thibeau Fred Ward and defending himself from trouble making bruiser Wolf Bruce M. Fischer. He soon realizes that he can dig his way through the brittle wall of his cell and decides that he'll take his chances and try to escape.Based on the true story of the 1962 breakout from the supposedly foolproof prison this is simply good solid storytelling from Siegel. To make it feel more real the use of a music score is sparing and Jerry Fieldings' score is pretty subtle anyway. This is one film that truly holds your attention with one riveting sequence after another. And the cast plays it very well. Patrick McGoohan is perfectly icy as the warden who does his best to break the spirit of his inmates and who clearly relishes exercising his power. Blossom is so good as easygoing convict Doc that you miss him when he's written out of the picture. Benjamin has a quietly powerful presence impressive enough to match Clints'. Thibeau and Ward are engaging as is comedic actor Larry Hankin in one of his rare straight parts as hard luck inmate Charley Butts.Quite atmospheric throughout with a wonderfully suspenseful climactic breakout the film ends on a memorably ambiguous note. Did in fact Frank and the Anglins make it or perish in their escape attempt? The truth of the matter is that they were never heard from again and it's up to us to come up with the conclusion.A superb effort overall.10 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "'Escape from Alcatraz 1979' is such a delicate understated film that it could only be the work of a veteran. The film was Don Siegel's final collaboration with Clint Eastwood whom he had passionately mentored since directing him in 'Coogan's Bluff 1968.' Here Siegel recognises that adapting a true story requires some dramatic restraint but nor does he feel tied to factual details the film is less concerned with narrative than in evoking the mood of prison life. Indeed the escape in the title doesn't take centrestage until the film's final act and even then Siegel resists the urge to transform it into an epic Hitchcockian setpiece though there's certainly nothing wrong with them. The escape instead plays more closely to the wordless heist sequence in Dassin's 'Rififi 1955' heartstopping because it places the viewer on the scene and at the mercy of the characters' mistakes. Every clank of metal or heavy footfall inspires an instinctive flinch despite the foreknowledge of events signalled in the film's title.Eastwood though rarely celebrated for his acting subtlety always excelled at giving internalised masculine portrayals particularly when playing laconic Western heroes like The Man With No Name. In 'Escape from Alcatraz' as in Leone's Westerns his character enters without much in the way of a backstory no family and only a vague history of previous escape attempts. This ghostlike ambiguity allows the audience to sympathise with Frank Morris' plight. Furthermore Morris is far more intelligent than he lets on speaking only when practical  watch closely and you'll notice that even from his opening moments at Alcatraz he spends most of his time unobtrusively scouring his environment for a means of escape. Only once  following Doc's Roberts Blossom mental breakdown at the hands of the Warden's vanity  does Morris really say what he's thinking and he is lucky to get away with the outburst. Patrick McGoohan also delivers a similarly controlled performance. Without painting the Warden as villainous he manages to portray the man as lonely insecure and ultimately impotent. 'Escape from Alcatraz' borrows plenty from the prison films of previous years  among them Frankenheimer's 'Birdman of Alcatraz 1962' and Schaffner's 'Papillon 1973' Siegel himself had preceded these with his own 'Riot in Cell Block 11 1954' which I haven't seen. However the film also proved influential in its own right and Darabont's 'The Shawshank Redemption 1994' simply could not have existed without it. Narrative cinema typically requires a reassuringly tidy conclusion and so there's potential difficulty in telling a true story whose ending remains unknown. Siegel handles this issue with poise concocting a curious blend of hope and uncertainty that provides just enough closure without overreaching his artistic license A chrysanthemum flower a symbol of human hope flits delicately on the island shore Jerry Fielding's score whirs eerily on the soundtrack the credits rolling over the grotesque image of Morris' papermache mask  a shell of the man who once slept in that bed. Just as he entered the film as a ghost so too does Frank Morris depart it.".

	schema:reviewBody "When people disobey the rules of society they get sent to prison. When they disobey the rules of prison they get sent to Alcatraz. Transferred from Atlanta this is the true story of Frank Morris  the only man to break out of Alcatraz prison. Morris comes to the prison to find cruel guards and monotony are the norm all resided over by the disinterested warden. With time he makes both friends and enemies and begins to plan his way out of his cell and out of the prison.I have seen this film once before probably more than a decade ago and I wasn't going to try and review it from my distant memory of it so I watched it again the other day. From my memory of the film and the opening 15 minutes I assumed that this was just going to be an effective breakout thriller with all the usual clichs in place  the shanks the old man with a small animal the old timer who goes nuts etc and in some regards this is what it is. However it is also very unusual for a prison movie because it is so very low key and slow. In this way it is like the prison life itself  based in routine without a great deal actually happening certainly the film engages consistently rather than relying on a handful of set pieces to do it. For this reason some viewers may be turned off by it as they expect more from prison dramas certainly viewers of HBO's Oz cannot help but find this to be lacking in action.I don't want my comments to be taken out of context so I will say that I think that this is a very effective film in what it tries to do. It is slow but never dull clichd but never uninteresting. Siegel's direction shows good control and it is matched by a performance from Clint Eastwood that is so understated that at times it seemed like he would disappear from the screen with a slight whiff of smoke  this was not a showy performance but it was a very good one. He is supported by a cast that delivers mostly clichd characters but delivers them without overdoing it or pushing it to the point where they are too obvious. The support cast includes turns from Blossum Benjamin Fischer Hankin and Fred Ward. McGoohan doesn't have a great deal to do but he plays his character well with a strange half smile on his face for much of the time  a knowing look reflecting the irony of the most famous Prisoner becoming the warden perhaps?Overall this is lacking in fireworks or big set pieces even the escape at the end is delivered without dramatic flourishes or tense music but that is it's aim. The film captures the dull routine of prison life including the violence and the treatment while also telling a good story that it has the good taste to leave open as it was in real life.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Don Siegel and actor Clint Eastwood always do classy work together and Escape From Alcatraz is no different.The film simply involves Clint Eastwood being locked away in Alcatraz prison and then planning and enacting an escape but the end result is nevertheless one of the best prison escape movies precisely because Siegel's stripped down no nonsense ruggedly masculine directorial style perfectly meshes with Clint's stripped down no nonsense ruggedly masculine acting style. It's a film in which Siegel's camera simply watches with minimum fuss as Clint digs through a wall and escapes a top security prison with minimum fuss.With the death of Peckinpah and Siegel no one makes these manly movies today directors now all pampered and privileged. When Siegel made a movie you could feel the grime sweat and testosterone.In terms of flaws the film rather sneakily neglects to tell us why Clint and his associates are in prison and goes to great lengths to portray the prison warden as a villain the end result being that we're essentially conned into wishing for the escape of bad people.Of course most prison movies are largely existential tales. Like Paul Newman and Steve McQueen in their respective prison movies Clint's less a criminal than an everyman who embodies our yearning for freedom the film appealing to our desires for escape transgression and rebellion. Thankfully Siegel doesn't hype up these existential aspects the director underplaying or ignoring them entirely in favour for a more dry docudrama approach. If Clint signed up to the film in order to take his internalized stoic acting style to new heights then Siegel was drawn to a script filled with methodical planning. More than most directors love when a good plan comes together.810  The film isn't as good as Siegel and Clint's best collaboration The Beguiled but it's still excellent. Clint's the coolest actor since Bogart and while this is a very simple tale its procedural like direction detachment and simple plot mesh perfectly with Clint's quiet scenery chewing impressive scowling and laconic mannerisms. The film's poster was based on the famous A Clockwork Orange poster.Worth one viewing.".

It's a film in which Siegel's camera simply watches with minimum fuss as Clint digs through a wall and escapes a top security prison with minimum fuss.With the death of Peckinpah and Siegel no one makes these manly movies today directors now all pampered and privileged. When Siegel made a movie you could feel the grime sweat and testosterone.In terms of flaws the film rather sneakily neglects to tell us why Clint and his associates are in prison and goes to great lengths to portray the prison warden as a villain the end result being that we're essentially conned into wishing for the escape of bad people.Of course most prison movies are largely existential tales. Like Paul Newman and Steve McQueen in their respective prison movies Clint's less a criminal than an everyman who embodies our yearning for freedom the film appealing to our desires for escape transgression and rebellion. Thankfully Siegel doesn't hype up these existential aspects the director underplaying or ignoring them entirely in favour for a more dry docudrama approach. If Clint signed up to the film in order to take his internalized stoic acting style to new heights then Siegel was drawn to a script filled with methodical planning. More than most directors love when a good plan comes together.810  The film isn't as good as Siegel and Clint's best collaboration The Beguiled but it's still excellent. Clint's the coolest actor since Bogart and while this is a very simple tale its procedural like direction detachment and simple plot mesh perfectly with Clint's quiet scenery chewing impressive scowling and laconic mannerisms. The film's poster was based on the famous A Clockwork Orange poster.Worth one viewing.";

	schema:reviewBody "Alcatraz the escape proof prison located on an island in San Francisco Bay. During its 29 years as a U.S Federal Prison there were over a dozen escape attempts which failed. Yet one attempt in 1962 might just have succeeded in breaking three of its inmates out. That attempt is the focus of the 1979 film Escape From Alcatraz a superb example of how to bring a reallife story to the screen.The cast is stellar but low key throughout. Clint Eastwood plays the ringleader of the escape Frank Morris. Eastwood portrays Morris as being a low key intelligent and yet charismatic individual who uses both his brain and personality in the lead up to the escape. His nemesis is the cold ruthless and at times even vindictive prison warden played by Patrick McGoohan in a role that seems tailor made for him even if he only pops up in the film every so often but does so to great effect. Appearing about midway through the film to aid in the escape are the Anglin twins who are the played with charm and charisma by Fred Ward and Jack Thibeau. Along the way we meet some of Alcatraz's other prisoners including Paul Benjamin as English Roberts Blossom as the painter Doc Frank Ronzio as long term prisoner Litmus Bruce M. Fischer as the appropriately named prison animal Wolf and Larry Hankin as potential escapee Charley Butts though the name of the actual prisoner was changed for the film. The performances are all low key which adds to the atmosphere and suspense of the film immensely.The entire film has an atmosphere of menace and suspense to it. From the moment Morris is brought to the island director Don Siegel places the viewer into the exact same situation the character and by extension the real prisoner finds himself in a world confined to a small piece of island where time passes by slowly escape seems impossible and thanks to fellow prisoners like Wolf death could potentially hit you at any moment. The film was shot inside the infamous prison itself the film therefore has a strong sense of authenticity to it that is hard to achieve in a studio set. Sequences such as Morris' time in solitary confinement in Dblock or the escape attempt itself showcase this fact.That sense of authenticity is combined with the work of those behind the camera to create the aforementioned atmosphere. The solitary confinement sequence for example is intercut by Ferris Webster to include shots of the sun rising and setting over the prison to help give the audience a sense of time that I suspect would have been a luxury to anyone who has ever experienced it. The score from Jerry Fielding is like the rest of the film low key to be point of barely being noticeable yet highly effective when it is used. The one thing that brings that atmosphere though is the cinematography of Bruce Surtees which gives the entire film a cold look akin to a permanently gloomy day and permanently dark nights. The result is a film that keeps you on edge the whole time even if you know how it ends.Which in a way brings us to the script. Richard Tuggle's script based on the J. Campbell Bruce book of the same name has the feeling of being a meticulously researched well thought out piece of writing. The script stays very true to the known facts of the escape with only a few minor changes such as the name of the potential fourth escapee for example. As a result this film isn't fast paced or action packed. The story builds as we see Morris settling into the prison adjusting to it formulate the escape plan and then work towards carrying it out. There's plenty of suspense along the way as each stage has its own risks and potential to go wrong which keeps the viewer waiting to see what happens next. The result is that the escape attempt itself is made all the more powerful in terms of its suspense. Yet Tuggle keeps his characters at the center and keeps their characterizations firmly anchored in reality. As a result the script makes the film real and suspenseful without ever letting never letting the facts overwhelm the people.Escape From Alcatraz is a superb example of how to bring a true story to the screen. From its low key but effective performances to its authenticity and sense of menace the film is highly effective both as a docudrama and as a suspense film. While those who can only stand the fast pace editing and highly stylistic films of today might find it utterly dull others will find a fascinating true story brought to life in fine form.".

Where supposedly no one can escape. The maximum security prison life is jarringly miserable and hopeless. The prison warden intends to keep it that way. Morris makes some friends but also an enemy which wants to see him dead after turning down his proposal with brute force. Through a small glimpse of hope and luck. Morris actually discovers a possible way of escape and carefully plans it out with the aid of a couple of inmates.You can always count on the influential pairing of Clint Eastwood and Don Siegel. No matter what. On their filth and final partnership they come up with another genuine winner in the shape of the grippingly harrowing and sedated prison yarn shaped off J. Campbell Bruce's novel and the supposed true story of the only three men to break out of Alcatraz. It's hard not marvel at Siegel's sturdily compact craftsmanship in depicting the dour prison life with moody realism and how the story eventually folds out into a tautly drawn up break out attempt. The build up doesn't sway off course but sticks to its simple narrative and characteristics with effective results. There's nothing explosive and downright exciting but there's spirit lurking under the cold looking domain that eventually comes through. Like quoted in the film the rock would either break you or inspire you to fight on. The smartly layered plot works this into the characters very successfully and despite the predictability it stays admirably honest without the need of sensationalising the facts and ambiguous conclusion. It starts of small and stays that way to the end even with its dominantly large situation. The wellarticulated script by Richard Tuggle is scanty with a lot of quiet patches. But it when comes to the forefront it manages to be cunning but also touching. There's nothing overwrought here and gladly it doesn't succumb to that. Pacing is quite subdued but this helps enhances the creaky mood and sophomoric nature of Alcatraz. Drama and action is kept to a minimal. Being shot on Alcatraz help chipped out such a towering and gritty presence the film held strongly and Bruce Surtees' fixedly expressive cinematography gets amongst the shadowy dank and gloomy interior. Jerry Fielding's poignantly lingering and uncanny music score only adds more to the nauseating air whiffed up through the presentation. Clint Eastwood plays it quite steely and lean. He fit's the role smoothly as Morris. The support roles are reliably good even if they are stuck with generic characters. Patrick McGoohan is sinisterly fine as the warden and Robert Blossom and Frank Ronzio are delightfully moving as two elder prison inmates. Paul Benjamin Bruce M. Fischer Fred Ward and Larry Hankin as the edgily weakminded Charley Butts are memorably excellent in their parts.We've been down this path before but this efficient offering plays it cards in a very understated manner and is to the point that I found it hard not to be fascinated by it's bitter depiction. Take the chance with this fortress.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are many who regard The Shawshank Redemption as the ultimate prison movie. I seriously don't. In terms of atmosphere and realism this is a more superior movie. Also when you watch this movie it becomes obvious to you how incredibly much Stephen King 'copied' and not even subtly he basically copied entire characters and events from this movie for the both of his novels that are set in prisons The Shawshank Redemption and to a smaller extend The Green Mile.Yes of course The Shawshank Redemption has a totally brilliant story and some topclass acting but I still see Escape from Alcatraz as a better movie. The story is more believable which add to the realism of the movie. The Shawshank Redemption is a way more overdramatized movie if you like while Escape from Alcatraz is just simply realistic and honest with its story. Yes the story of this movie might be told and filmed in a slow way but the movie is only 112 minutes long so this shouldn't be a serious complaint. The movie is never dragging and not 1 minute shorter or longer than was needed. It should be so that everyone who is about to see or has seen The Shawshank Redemption should also watch Escape from Alcatraz and then ask yourself this What does The Shawsank Redemption has got that this movie hasn't and what is that makes it that The Shawshank Redemption is so incredibly high in the IMDb top250 while Escape from Alcatraz isn't even in that same top250.For the record I like The Shawshank Redemption very much as a movie and even though I think and also thought so before seeing this movie that it is a bit of an overrated movie I would probably still rate it an 910.But enough about The Shawshank Redemption let's talk about the quality of this movie. What makes Escape from Alcatraz an absolute classic is the atmosphere and like I said before the realism of the characters the events and the story in general. It was also great to see Clint Eastwood in this role. Before this movie he mostly only played just the hero's in westerns like Buono il brutto il cattivo Il Hang 'Em High and The Outlaw Josey Wales and in WW II movies like Kelly's Heroes and Where Eagles Dare or as super cop Harry Callahan in Dirty Harry. I think this is more a movie in which Clint shows his acting abilities. Also I enjoyed seeing Patrick McGoohan to be fair I only saw him in three movies before this Braveheart his small role in A Time to Kill and the Columbo movie Columbo Ashes to Ashes. But despite that fact that I only saw him a small amount of roles I already adored him as an actor. He was also great in this movie and wow he looked so incredibly young compared to the movies I had seen him in.In my opinion THE ultimate prison movie and an absolute classic due to its atmosphere and realism.1010httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

And the star here is Dirty Harry himself Clint Eastwood.The other really famous Alcatraz movie Birdman of Alcatraz was made in 1962 and has a transcendent performance by Burt Lancaster and if this version was lifted by some magic by Eastwood it would rise above the mundane series of events.Not that escaping from jail is mundane normally but in fact this is like a heist film before the guys go to jail where a group of men plan their way out of jail and then the events are shown. The sequence of things is important and very uncomplicated and a few tricks are revealed like the famous dummy heads that were used in the beds while they escaped. Don't get me wrong it really is fascinating. But it isn't fabulous it isn't so ingenious or daring it makes you sit up. It just is a well executed attempt at an escape.There are some other minor characters here who add to the nice mix maybe the most curious is the warden played by Patrick McGoohan who shows no trace of his very British accent here he was No. 6 in the t.v. show The Prisoner. None of these quite rise from their stereotypes either though all are fine.Key is Eastwood who is relaxed and his normal self and Siegel who makes the movie so functional it would almost be better to see a documentary.".

Grim silent and brooding over the rugged island it represented the end of the line for the most dangerous Federal prisoners.Four men succeeded in escaping from its shores. One swam all the way to a shoreside pylon of the Golden Gate Bridge where he was arrested. Frank Morris and his two confederates escaped using homemade dummies fake vent shaft covers life vests and a raft. They were never found.In 1963 Alcatraz was closed allegedly because it was too old and no longer costeffective to maintain and because it was no longer in line with progressive penological theory but this is all obvious rubbish. What ended its existence was the shattering of the myth of it being an escapeproof facility. When four men proved that it was possible to escape from it the prison became just one more heap of rock mortar bricks and steel owned by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons.This movie contains fictional elements but it's still a mustsee.".

	schema:headline " A clichd prison film that is saved by Eastwood's performance";
	schema:reviewBody "Alcatraz was built to keep all the rotten eggs in one basket and I was specially chosen to make sure that the stink from the basket does not escape.When it comes to prison films the first movie that comes to mind is Frank Darabont's Shawshank Redemption. It ranks on some popular online sites as one of the best films ever made so when I finally got a chance to watch Don Siegel's 1979 prison movie I was underwhelmed. The greatest problem is that this film hasn't aged well and these characters are all playing familiar stereotypes. Modern prison films have captured the right atmosphere where you actually believe most prisoners are criminals and not just victims of a system. They're dark gruesome films and above all they feel genuine. Even popular TV shows have managed to give us a much more raw sense of prison life. But you don't get any of that from watching this film because almost every prisoner in this movie is presented as a victim. I had a hard time believing these characters were actual prisoners and the interactions among them were predictable and cheesy. Don Siegel had worked with Clint Eastwood since the late 60's but it had been several years since they had last collaborated together. Escape from Alcatraz was their fifth film together and despite its success it was there last collaboration. Clint Eastwood had long solidified his career as a star and he basically comes into this film playing himself. He isn't given much of a personality other than being the quiet and reserved prisoner who you know is smarter than anyone around him simply because he's Eastwood. He is so slow at delivering every oneliner that you can predict everything he is going to answer back to whoever tries to intimidate him. I was surprised the screenplay was so predictable but Eastwood has such strong charisma that you just enjoy the way he delivers the lines even though you know exactly what he's going to say. Escape from Alcatraz which was based on J. Campbell Bruce's book of the same name was inspired on true events. Richard Tuggle who would later go on to direct Eastwood in another film adapted the screenplay and did some research of his own on the 1962 escape attempt of Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers. The film begins very silently there is hardly any dialogue during the first 10 minutes as Frank Morris Clint Eastwood is being escorted by officers to the Alcatraz prison. The long ride to the prison cell and the extreme security measures give us a sense of how improbable it is for someone to escape the prison but Frank is determined and seems to have the IQ for the task. In case he didn't receive the message the warden Patrick McGoohan gives him a friendly reminder that he will never leave the island because no one has ever been able to escape. He is later introduced to some of the other prisoners English Paul Benjamin who works at the library and exchanges a couple of friendly racial insults with him Litmus Frank Ronzio the prisoner who enjoys the company of his mouse such a clich now for prison movies and is always bargaining with Frank for his dessert Wolf Bruce M. Fischer the bully in the prison who wants Frank to be his pet and Butts Larry Hankin who is in the cell next to his. Frank realizes that the salt in the water has eroded some of the walls and he comes up with an escape plan that he shares with Butts. When two brothers John Fred Ward and Clarence Anglin Jack Thibeau arrive at the prison Frank realizes he can use their help as well and the four come up with a plan. The suspense begins to grow as the film centers on their escape attempt. The film works much better when it focuses on the escape plan because the characters aren't really developed too well and the interactions between them are painfully dull at times. None of the prisoners have a personality of their own and every subplot is simply used as a filler. Once the escape plan gets underway however the film works at a much better pace. Eastwood is a star and he can turn any one dimensional character into someone compelling which he manages to do here. Any attempt to give the rest of the characters something compelling to do fails. You could care less about the threat that the Wolf or the warden present to Frank and the bonds he makes in prison aren't very interesting either. The scenes he shares with English were pointless. Larry Hankin is probably the only other sympathetic character here. The lack of character development kind of lowers the stakes of the actual escape but Eastwood manages to make it compelling nonetheless. The tension escalates in the second half of the film and makes the experience worthwhile but overall I felt underwhelmed by this classic.httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Clint Eastwood is one of my favorite actors always has been. However his acting range is limited and his characters never stray too far from each other but that never makes him less watchable and the guy has been in films for decades. Escape from Alcatraz is considered one of his many film classics and for good reason. It's full of entertainment suspense fun and strong characters.Filmed on location in Alcatraz makes it all the more believable and real. Despite the title the film is more about the actual prison life than it is the escape which although is being planned throughout doesn't actually happen until the last fifteen minutes of the film. Alcatraz was maximum security in every sense of the word and director Don Siegel leaves nothing out in showing us every aspect of the men's lives in this prison. Eastwood's character Frank Morris is brilliant and Eastwood plays him brilliant. He always looks like he's got something cooking and watching him as he carefully analyzes every room he enters from the very beginning. It's a small subtle thing that makes his character so well done. Eastwood by far has most of the screen time and as always he does it flawlessly and interestingly. The supporting cast is nonetheless excellent as well. Brilliant character actor Larry Hankin plays Charley Butts a rather emotional and weak man who desperately wants to escape especially upon hearing that his mother is fatally ill. Eastwood's character takes Butts under his wing but unfortunately to no avail in the end. Roberts Blossom also adds a lot of emotion to the cast as Doc a character that even the prison guards seem to like who becomes very distraught when the warden takes away his painting privileges. Fred Ward as fellow escapee and friend to Morris John Anglin doesn't have a lot of screen time but he's always good in what he does. I think the one OVERrated actor and role of the film is the nameless Warden played by Patrick McGoohan. His role was brief and although he plays the stone cold Warden well there really was nothing to his role. I noticed a lot of critics hailing him and I have to wonder why as he was in it so briefly?? The real magic of the film is the build up to the escape. No character is left untapped we feel like we are a part of this prison their every day lives their pain their emotions and finally we get to experience their glorious and seemingly flawless escape plan. It's an emotional film and has stood the test of time as a classic for a reason. I don't think anyone will be disappointed in watching this film it's just a lot of fun and a classic film!! 910".

The plot is in its own right beautiful and there is no reason why not to catch this movie just because it is a supposed clone of My Sassy Girl. There are numerous easter eggs and references to My Sassy Girl here and while I concede that some do not serve any real purpose in furthering the plot most of them are pretty interesting and would be instantly noticed by fans of My Sassy Girl.It is rather long though and at times can appear to be rather drawn out.

I must say that although it's definitely a repeat of that successful formula I personally found it every bit as funny and enjoyable as MSG. Watch especially for the part in the Police Station with the bigshot dad.The second half of this film is where things fall flat. The first problem is that there's simply too many buys that the viewer is forced to try and believe such asThe car chase scene actually not that unbelievable and JJH definitely looks hot in this one The suicide scene huge stretch The hostage scene where the baddie empties the whole clip at her and misses completely huge stretch Girl gets shot in what looks like the heart judging by the location of the blood stain and survives... highly unlikelyMaybe having just one of these things happen would be okay. Having all of the above occur just drives the film to a rather absurd level. The second problem is that the goodbye scene among others like the wind blowing scenes are drawn out too long and with rather clichd dialogue. This combined with the absurdity of other scenes makes for a rather poor second half. Some may dislike the ending but I personally had no problem with it.The two leads both do a fine job with the material that they were given. JJH is definitely one of the best young actresses in the world and I look forward to seeing more from her. I can say that if you are a fan of JJH you should definitely check this out. If you liked MSG you should also give this one a go. There are lots of references to MSG that a fan can look for. If you're used to Korean melodrama you could do a lot worse than this film. However newcomers to Korean films would probably want to watch MSG over this one. Your average viewer will probably find it somewhat enjoyable largely due to the first half.".

WARNING POTENTIAL SPOILERS As Windstruck reunites director Kwak Jaeyoung with Jeon Jihyun from the extremely popular My Sassy Girl there will always be a comparison for fans between the two. But whilst My Sassy Girl was outstanding and indeed led to the massive break for Jeon Jihyun Windstruck pales in comparison with the former and indeed some may end up disappointed.Windstruck tells of a novice cop Kyungjin Jeon who mistakenly arrests a stranger Myungwoo Hyuk Jang believing him to be a purse snatcher. Once the mistake is realised they both start dating with Myungwoo feeling he has to come to the rescue of his maverick girlfriend. Sadly one time too many and it all goes wrong as Myungwoo is killed.Windstruck isn't as well written as MSG. Whilst there is plenty of detail in the film with great attention paid to sets costumes camera angels and so on it lacks the overall substance to carry the story. Indeed it's hard to work out what really is the theme of the movie. The characters aren't developed enough and I didn't find enough chemistry being built up in the story before Myungwoo's death.Windstruck is effectively broken into two parts. The first twothirds of the movie is much about their relationship blossoming the last third is about how she copes with his death. In their blossoming relationship you see sparks of the humour and cleverness that made MSG a success. The ending has the melodramatic tone that actually is somewhat clichd. But the way it's been set up neither part ever reaches what you'd think is a completeness and you end up thinking we could have had more.And that's what really bugs me about this film. It is really two full length films spliced and edited into one. It could be a very funny falling in love romcom or it could be a very good drama about coping with death. But wrapping the two movie themes into one leaves you thinking it didn't have enough substance. Plus the whole thing could have been more cleverly edited.Having seen all of Jeon JiHyun's movies to date I can say that she is a very talented actress. However the shortening and splicing does mean that I don't feel her talent has been fully used. And much the same for Hyuk Jang.Overall there isn't enough magic for it to match MSG nor the brilliance of Jeon Jihyun's other films. But having said that for most it is still a pretty good film and it's still worth a watch. One for a windy day.".

	schema:reviewBody "Asians tend to like melodramatic romantic movie and this is one of them. It's basically a sorta a prequel to My Sassy Girl except some parts from the flashback in My Sassy Girl doesn't fit. And some characters seems to have moved around or at least the actor and actresses in the movie that is also in the other movie. The scenarios is sort of the same except the main guy protagonist this time is played by Jang Hyuk who I am a fan of as an actor. And is a way way much more likable character than GyunwooCha TaeHyun. Even if his character is less tough compared to the girl he falls for. If your one of those audiences that thought My Sassy Girl is ridiculous with it's scenarios. This one takes it to a whole another level and it can get pretty lame sometimes. It becomes really cartoon like sometimes with it's dialogues. The first half of this movie is the build up of the relationship between Ko MyungWooJang Hyuk and Yeo KyungJinGianna Jun who is a female cop in this. And it shows why she acted the way she did with getting drunk and all but some aspect just seems a bit forced in out of nowhere. Not that I think the director planned for a prequel while making My Sassy Girl or anything like that.

	onyx:emotionText "Asians tend to like melodramatic romantic movie and this is one of them. It's basically a sorta a prequel to My Sassy Girl except some parts from the flashback in My Sassy Girl doesn't fit. And some characters seems to have moved around or at least the actor and actresses in the movie that is also in the other movie. The scenarios is sort of the same except the main guy protagonist this time is played by Jang Hyuk who I am a fan of as an actor. And is a way way much more likable character than GyunwooCha TaeHyun. Even if his character is less tough compared to the girl he falls for. If your one of those audiences that thought My Sassy Girl is ridiculous with it's scenarios. This one takes it to a whole another level and it can get pretty lame sometimes. It becomes really cartoon like sometimes with it's dialogues. The first half of this movie is the build up of the relationship between Ko MyungWooJang Hyuk and Yeo KyungJinGianna Jun who is a female cop in this. And it shows why she acted the way she did with getting drunk and all but some aspect just seems a bit forced in out of nowhere. Not that I think the director planned for a prequel while making My Sassy Girl or anything like that. If you enjoy slightly cheesy fantasy and yet realistic style comedic romantic comedy this one might be for you. Which is like in My Sassy Girl which I think it's a slightly better flick.7.510";

What makes it wrong is that Kwak Jayoung SASSY's writerdirector tries to imitate his own masterpiece with this mediocre  overlong effort complete with the Sassy Girl herself Jeon Jihyun. And it is inevitable that people would compare both pics.The story is about a braveinborderlinecrazy female police officer who in the line of duty bonds with a weaker male teacher.

The last part well I'm not sure where the last part actually begins. It has too many endings too many climaxes to really work.However Kwak's subtle touch is there and the dancing in the rain sendup is funny. But this doesn't justify its 124minute running time.Jeon probably the most gifted young actress in the world today is back with her sassy persona which is great actually. And the lead actor Jang Hyuk is game too. But he's no Cha Taehyun SASSY's lead actor either. And the chemistry's not there.Oh talking about SASSY if you're one of the movie's fans don't miss the final minute of the movie. I wouldn't know what your reaction would be but it'll surely make you smile. To me it and the two leads' performance almost save the movie. Almost.12 out of ".

I have seen the original My Sassy Girl in Korean twice astonishing  brilliant  perfect  one of the best romances ever filmed as well as the various knockoffs of MSG from the US and Japan and elsewhere. I am also a huge fan of Korean cinema and indeed have reviewed a handful right here for IMDb. One of the things I absolutely love about Korean movies is that they have absolutely no respect for the standard plot twists and plot devices that most other filmmakers revere regardless of where in the world the story originates. This is usually  emphasize the word USUALLY  refreshing beyond belief as when you have perhaps too many movies in one lifetime you start to anticipate the narrative and that can take the joy out of a movie very quickly. OK with the explanation over I have to say that this is the first Korean movie in my experience where the usual positive  that lack of interest in maintaining the traditional narrative  actually worked against the production. What you have here  and I defy anyone to prove otherwise  is two very different stories migwelded at the hip. In story 1 we have what might in some alternate universe have passed for a sequel to the alreadyperfect MY SASSY GIRL only this time Jeon Jihyun is a cop and her shy boyfriend risks his life literally every time he hangs with her. It was an interesting twist with potential. About halfway through we are suddenly thrust into story 2 a Korean version of GHOST as the aforesaid boyfriend has one NDE too many and finally shuffles off this mortal coil. And then just as in Ghost Jeon Jihyun tries to connect with him just one last time. Again an interesting tale overall and one with potential. The problem  the flaw that keeps this from being in the same class as MSG  is that the fitting of the two different tales is awkward. Even if the viewer has emotionally connected with the characters not hard to do the acting is as expected wonderful and Jeon Jihyun is one of the most photogenic actresses on the planet the demands the script places on you are nothing short of heroic. It is hard so hard to watch this beginning to end without having at least one small WTF moment. In short novel entertaining fun challenging. But not one of the best films of all time.".

Watching the first half of this is a twohour movie one couldn't help but wonder what Kwak has stooped to with the runofthemill police sequences banal comedy and nottooinspiring romance. But then getting into the last 45 minutes the audience was reminded that this was Kwak after all. Every little bit of detail you saw earlier that didn't register much at the time was picked up later echoes and had a meaning right down to the voiceover narration in the very beginning and the very end.Again Kwak has played a clever game with the audience but this time it is not quite as brilliant as MSG. After the mist is cleared this movie is really another copy of Ghost Story and as far as that goes who can do better than the original? This movie can also be as suggested in its very last minute seen very loosely as the prequel to MSG. All told while there are some interesting elements Windstruck is more of the same of what we have seen from Director Kwak but not quite up to par with MSG. However the idea on using the theme of the wind as well as it execution in one good element. The English title may very well be 'Inherit the Wind' which by the way will be performed in town in a translated version something eagerly looked forward to by devoted theater lovers.".

One of the problems is the story and characters. Jun Jihyun in a role of a policewoman didn't look exactly convincing even though her acting was really good. Also some rather banal and pointless situations typical to silly Hollywood 'romantic comedies' in fact lots of them made this film quite a disappointment compared to 'My Sassy Girl'.

None. They don't share a single tender moment on screen bar them holding hands while being cuffed. There's simple nothing where you get why they love each other. Look at the Classic this chemistry is established in 20 minutes.Then there are all these terribly directed action scenes with terrible effects and pointless use of explosions. I don't think the girl is a bad actor but she certainly does not make a good cop.The whole wind thing was blown so much out of proportion and became so melodramatic it was painful to watch.I also like how this movie tries to ruin My Sassy Girl in the last scene by connecting the couple that movie in this one. Way to ruin that too.I would have given it 0 stars saved by the only two enjoyable scenes in this movie. The class room scene with the girls screaming and the scene where the guy screams that the mafia dudes. That's the kind of stuff I wanted from this movie and I got so little. Instead I got suicide attempts and 5 minutes after she's blowing up cars and 5 minutes after that she's crying and yadda yadda.Do not watch this movie. I'm out.".

I don't think the girl is a bad actor but she certainly does not make a good cop.The whole wind thing was blown so much out of proportion and became so melodramatic it was painful to watch.I also like how this movie tries to ruin My Sassy Girl in the last scene by connecting the couple that movie in this one. Way to ruin that too.I would have given it 0 stars saved by the only two enjoyable scenes in this movie. The class room scene with the girls screaming and the scene where the guy screams that the mafia dudes. That's the kind of stuff I wanted from this movie and I got so little. Instead I got suicide attempts and 5 minutes after she's blowing up cars and 5 minutes after that she's crying and yadda yadda.Do not watch this movie. I'm out.";

	schema:reviewBody "Windstruck is the reunion of Gianna Jun and Kwak JaeYongstar and director of the 2001 hit classic My Sassy Girl respectively. It is a film about a female police officer who is mourning the death of her boyfriend. The movie features themes about love moving forward after a loss of a loved one and hope for happiness after experiencing tragedy in life. The movie has a mix of drama and comedy. Aside from that it presents actorsactresses who appeared in My Sassy Girl and recreating events that have taken place in the said film. Highlighting that is the cameo appearance of Cha TaeHyun in the final scene. The story is good but not exceptional. The use of the song Knocking On Heaven's Door was a big plus for the plot.The performance of Gianna Jun in this film is truly exceptional. It has truly cemented her being Asia's premiere actress. Her portrayal of a sorrowing police officer is marked by sincerity. Viewers will get affected by the emotions she has expressed like her sorrow and anguish. Sadly her performance was the only bright spot as far as the acting is concerned. All the other cast ever decent including the male lead Jang Hyukwho unfortunately could not match Jun JiHyun's acting caliber. In summary Windstruck is a good film but not a great one that would be considered a classic like My Sassy Girl. Inspite of this I still give this film a 10 out of 10 rating for Gianna Jun's excellent performance merits the highest rating. See it to fully understand what I mean.".

	schema:reviewBody "First review on IMDb and I'm afraid it's not a very positive one. I have seen and loved many titles from the same director Kwak Jaeyong but Windstruck just doesn't quite do it for me. I thought of creating an account to share my two cents. Hopefully I'm doing this right!Even without degrading or negatively comparing this film based on its smashhit predecessors as other reviewers have unjustly done  is this a trend here?! this movie viewed in its lone and unbiased perspective still does not leave me with full satisfaction. I'm left discontented as the credits roll unlike the other more welldeveloped films by Director Kwak which had received my personal rounds of applause.I agree with some other reviewers that Windstruck seemed like two films thrown into one the transitioning could have been made better to accommodate the jump from light comedy to serious melodrama. Given the runtime at slightly under two hours I could have expected more scenes that actually contributed to the plot line instead of some extra lighthearted parts unrelated to the main story. An example would be the part where the two teenagers save Kyungjin at the top of the building and prevent her from suicide. I would have preferred something along the lines of the wind saving her or something that could further reinforce the supernatural idea of Myungwoo's spirit in the wind. Additionally this scene tried to reintroduce the comical aspect of the film directly after the sad sequences which confuses the viewer even more. Event pacing and logicality is fairly consistent note that this is partially a comedy and not too rushed at least until the final few scenes. I could tolerate the sudden switch to foreshadowed tragedy in the landslide scene where male lead Myungwoo almost died and even the actual death scene but the appearance of Myungwoo and him stepping into heaven just had me in disbelief. Some scenes could have been cut down in terms of length. Kyungjin desperately holding onto the wounded Myungwoo and screaming at the top of her lungs and her shooting scene against the criminal Changsoo Shin are prime examples as well as the part where Kyungjin repetitively calls Myungwoo's name while the wind blows into her room. Something that didn't really make sense was when she envisioned Myungwoo alive as she's lying in the hospital and he says he is alive with one lung. I'm baffled by the significance of that sequence but maybe it has something to do with Korean tradition. As for plot holes at the end one thing I didn't enjoy was the fact that Kyungjin was never shown to realize she had not shot her own boyfriend and that it was really her new partner who had done so. He didn't confess this fact to her and Myunwoo never told her either when he came back so I find it hard to believe that she didn't bring up this subject when talking to him. Another silly thing was the cameo appearance of Cha Taehyun as an apparent homage to My Sassy Girl. It wasn't really necessary to connect the two films and is partially why people claim Windstruck to be the prequel. The ending was abrupt. It felt like Myungwoo just said okay believe in me you'll find another person who shares my passion and Kyungjin simply forgets about her previous sorrows. It was too fast of an ending in my opinion.As always there is the bad and then there is the good. Several prominent features are found in Mr. Kwak's many films including this one among them the brilliant soundtrack which sets the mood in nicely and of course the talented female lead Gianna Jun Jun Jihyun. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that many people watch these Korean films only because of her amazing presence for reasons which I won't disclose here because you can already find many detailed comments about her in other reviews. Jang Hyuk does an ideal job playing Myungwoo and I love his hilarious expressions at the beginning of the movie. We get a lot of time focused on the two main protagonists spending quality time together so we are able to see some of their personalities and how close they've gotten to each other. Other subtle devices both funny and romantic really added to the overall picture. The act of replacing black piano keys with white ones as a romantic sign of affection was amazing and it really showed Myungwoo's concern for Kyungjin's family loss. I also liked the introduction of the page flipping animations which I thought was cute and the paper air plane symbol. Someone previously noted that it was a continuity issue because the paper air plane was seen being unfolded in Kyungjin's first encounter and then the same one seen floating around in the next instance. However I would like to think of it as being a totally different air plane folded by some stranger somewhere around the world who happened to use the same magazine paper and Myungwoo using his influence in the wind to make it fly to Kyungjin I realize it sounds absurd it's just me being delusional p. The theme is interesting with the wind protecting her from gunshots albeit a little too unbelievable. But really expecting absolute realism in a comedymelodrama is pointless.Overall it isn't a HORRIBLE movie but it certainly could do with improvement. If you're looking for a sweet story and a little side serving of comedy this is the one to watch. Familyenvironment friendly. The beginning will make you laugh some and then depending on your manlineI mean tolerance to tearjerking scenes you could either end up half disappointed like me or drowning in a mountain of tissues. It's a good watch if you want something to pass time.".

Doomsday Book is a South Korean sciencefiction film divided in three uneven segments1 A Brave New World the research scientist Yoon Seokwoo stays alone at home while his parents travel for a holiday with his sister. He is in charge of cleaning their apartment and he dumps all the garbage including a rotten apple in a disposal recycling system. This apple becomes animal food and soon the cow meet contaminates the population of Seoul that becomes zombies. This segment is the best one with a funny story and beautiful but nasty cinematography.2 The Heavenly Creature the technician Park Dowan is summoned to repair the robot InMyung in a monastery since the robot claims that he is Buddhist and has reached enlightenment. Park is not capable to fix the robot and the company's president decides to decommission the robot.

Doomsday Book is a South Korean sciencefiction film divided in three uneven segments1 A Brave New World the research scientist Yoon Seokwoo stays alone at home while his parents travel for a holiday with his sister. He is in charge of cleaning their apartment and he dumps all the garbage including a rotten apple in a disposal recycling system. This apple becomes animal food and soon the cow meet contaminates the population of Seoul that becomes zombies. This segment is the best one with a funny story and beautiful but nasty cinematography.2 The Heavenly Creature the technician Park Dowan is summoned to repair the robot InMyung in a monastery since the robot claims that he is Buddhist and has reached enlightenment. Park is not capable to fix the robot and the company's president decides to decommission the robot. This segment is boring and annoying despite the great cinematography and special effects.3 Happy Birthday a girls damages an 8 ball and she buys another one in the computer of her father.

	schema:reviewBody "We waited 6 years for this?Doomsday Book is a 3 part Korean anthology film about the future of mankind. Its 3 separate story lines are basically broken down as follows 1. Zombie Apocalypse 2. Robot Enlightenment and 3. AlienAsteroid destruction. Each of the stories is independent from one another and all are acted written and directed by various teams. SPOILERS AHEAD!While not terrible this movie does have some problems and it seems strangely out dated despite its futuristic themes. This film debuted earlier this year 2012 and therein lies the bulk of its problems this production originally began back in 2006 but funding problems and other delays hampered its release and it was shelved for quite a while. As a result some stories were wrapped up years ago one never got made another was added on post haste to finally get the film out the door etc...The end result is an uneven amalgam of flavors and styles and eras that doesn't quite come together as a whole as was hoped for.Story 1. Brave New World i.e. the Zombie story. Easily my least favorite of the 3 works and the one that suffers the most from the production delays. This story has 2006 written all over it and revolves around the world's population deevolving into zombie like creatures as a result of a virus born of tainted meat processing procedures. This would have been right proper back in '06 but how many stories about contaminated mass food production end of world viruses etc have been made since then?... And we've got zombies! Sorry but it's almost 2013 now so enough with the freakin zombies already unless you have a more original idea to implement them! This story is ultimately not worth investing in primarily because it was so overdone by the time it was released. There's also no zombie love story angle as suggested that I can recall unless there is some extended version I haven't seen. Basically guy goes on a date guy runs into date later on during the wash and everybody is now a zombie or will soon become one!Summary Somewhat OK I guess!Story 2. Creation of Heaven i.e. the Robot with a soul story. Probably the best of the 3 stories and easily the most philosophical  cerebral. Fairly interesting and well done story overall. It's basically your human created machine gains intelligence sentience thought free will etc. Then various humans with differing opinions and motives on the subject must decide what to do with it. This story would perhaps have been better suited to be a full feature movie on its own. It does work pretty well as a short but I could easily see it being successfully expanded into a longer production similar to what was done with the Dumplings portion of the 3 Extremes anthology.Summary Not bad at all!Story 3. Happy Birthday i.e. the We need to tack on another 3040 minute tale 6 years later to finally release this film story. I like the somewhat odd premise of this segment but unfortunately it just doesn't work that well overall. This is the story that has the young girl trying to replace her dad's missing 8ball via the internet. The internet is a magical place indeed but I think we're still a long way away from alien races fulfilling Amazon.com orders through space and time via giant asteroids. This episode felt a bit rushed and I think would have been far better served if it played up the comedicsurreal aspect of the plot which it reluctantly seemed to not want to fully embrace.Summary Ultimately disappointing!Bottom Line Overall I was not impressed! A bit of a missed opportunity that's OK to watch but I recommend you don't set your hopes too high going in if you're going to check it out. I'm not going to destroy it because it ain't terrible. Occasionally though delaystimingfunding get in the way of the best laid plans here's Exhibit A in regards! That's just the way it goes sometimes!6 out of 10 stars overall!".

	schema:reviewBody "This film presents three futuristthemed stories which either directly or indirectly hint at apocalyptic overtones.The first story called Brave New World is a simple zombiepocalypse brought on by some kind of mutant food poisoning. As this one dude turns into a zombie he's also searching for the girl of his dreams. Plenty of gnarly violence and partying ensues.Unarguably the most worthwhile story will be the middle one entitled Heavenly Creature in which a robot at a Buddhist temple attains enlightenment and everybody tries to figure out what to do with him or it depending on perspectives. While this story seems to move the slowest it's most interesting for its philosophical implications especially in regards to Buddhism the story does a fine job of underscoring the key Buddhist themes of materialism perspectives and cycles of life. Even if you don't care for all that the film will spark some good brain activity with the simple moral notion of whether or not it's wise to terminate a spiritual robot.The final story Happy Birthday is easily the most absurd a little girl breaks her daddy's 8ball and orders a new one online. The 8ball appears two years later...as a meteor traveling at hypervelocity. The end of the world ensues.Each story offers a little of something a little bit of quirky humor a little bit of heart a little bit of style and even a little food for thought. Even though Heavenly Creature will stand out as the strongest work of science fiction coming close to approaching Isaac Asimov levels of greatness Brave New World is an entertaining thing to watch and one can't help but to appreciate how straight Happy Birthday plays out. This might be one of the best and maybe coming close to strangest anthology of short films I've seen since the Tokyo! anthology.Despite some stylistic excess in Brave New World each film is crafted with superbly stylish photography and editing. Acting and writing are impeccable all around. The films use just enough sets props costumes and special effects to tell their stories and is quite effective.If you're a fan of Korean cinema science fiction or endoftheworld stories then I do recommend giving this film a try. As a fan of all three I found it quite enthralling.4.55 Entertainment Very Good  Stories Good  Film Very Good".

I generally don't like to do this for films with subtitles as the first time I focus of course on reading the dialogue where as the next few times I can truly see the rest of the movie. The first story is of a man and his love as they go thru the Zombie apocalypse. I'd say it's a romance complemented by some horror and a dash of humor. Nothing great here but a well done story. 610The film's second act is about a sentient robot that faces his potential demise and the technician who is put in the middle of it all. This part of the film is excellent. It's incredibly well done all the way around. If you like scifi that truly makes you think that makes you question how you define the human experience then you will like this. The story's exploration of the philosophy of existence using a Buddhist backdrop is incredibly interesting. This section alone is worth seeing the movie over and over again in my opinion. 1210The third narrative involves a girl accidentally ordering an alien oversize billiard ball that ends up destroying life on earth. This section to me was pointless and unnecessary. There was nothing entertaining or redeeming about it. Standing on its own I think it would be bad. Fitting it together with the other 2 stories just makes it appear even worse and throws off the flow of the film. 110These grades average out to about a 6 but I bumped the overall grade up to a 7 based on the incredible strength of the second narrative. Check it out and if your crunched for time just skip the 3rd act.".

The first segment directed by PilSung Yim of the Korean Hansel  Gretel movie is the part that can be definitively labeled horror. Tainted beef turns people into zombies. The film has some decent comic moments but it never really goes anywhere. Plus I'm absolutely sick of zombies. The third segment also directed by Yim concerns a gigantic pool ball from space on a collision course with Earth. Turns out a young girl accidentally ordered an alien attack on the planet. This segment is so absolutely bizarre I have no idea what they were going for. It is at least a bit amusing even if baffling. Bae DoonNa appears at the very end of this segment in the last ten minutes of the movie and director Bong JoonHo also appears. The middle segment directed by Kim JeeWoon cannot be considered horror at all. It concerns a robot which has achieved enlightenment and is considered by his fellow monks to be the reincarnation of Buddha. His makers are incensed at the idea though and wish to destroy him. This starts off as the most interesting segment but as it goes on it gets lost in endless dialogue. Kim is a great action filmmaker and has no ability to make abstract concepts interesting. It's the most boring segment of the film unfortunately. The one thing I can say for the film as a whole is that it always looks fantastic. Even when it's dull which is often it's always pretty.".

The first film is a truly unremarkable runofthemill zombieesque feature which is lackluster and while it does get amusing with some humor at the end it's not a great start. The second film at first is the most intriguing and sparks interest to see where it goes but it soon becomes packed with sleepinducing philosophical monologues that will make you wonder what relevance it had of being in this collection. However despite the first two letdowns the third and final film is where Doomsday book really delivers. The third film has a bizarre premise and is funny too but for me it was truly the only good film in the set and there there was no better place to have it as it felt like a reward for sitting through the first two.".

It's a superb critic of a society drowned in consumerism the abuse of other life forms and the worshipping of the shallow. It also presents us with the hypocrisy people live by with somehow subtle imagery of religion and the disregard for those same values when it comes to feeling pleasure through the material and sex. The point of view is original for which we see the event unfold mostly from the perspective of a zombie rather than a hero trying to save himherself. The film is filled with humour although an underlying seriousness is palpable.The second movie is a completely different story. It's comparable to Ghost in the Shell for its cyberpunk elements as well as deep philosophy. There's no comedy here. It's the only film with no direct doomsday scenario although the human folly is obviously present. The future presented here is most plausible and indeed this is likely to happen sooner or later. This film is worth watching on its own if you want to skip the other 2.The last film is pure absurd comedy. I personally didn't find it amusing particularly after watching the previous one. The nonsensical idea of this movie is not helped by the fact that the plot wasn't really thought throughly and not much effort was put into giving any sense to anything even to the parts that supposedly help the movie unfolds i.e. they randomly find silly solutions out of nowhere comparable to the deus ex machina a child playing with toys would create.Alas I'd give individual scores as follows First movie 510 Second one 710 Final movie 210".

	schema:reviewBody "This Anthology features 3 tales 2 of which are somewhat religious and another one dabs more on an alien Hitchhiker's Guide to The Galaxy way. All three have to do with the fall of mankind.Story 1 910 My favorite A Brave New World depicts a basic zombie uprising in the plague form but what is different is the overall direction the story goes and the characters development... of zombies. Rarely do zombie films give the zombie POV but we are able to get that here. A great aspect of this story is the strong acting by the leading actor a guy who gets bullied by those around him and is very awkward in a nerdy way. He goes on a date with this girl and they seem to have a great connection but then he begins to turn and she is scared off. What happens at the end throws in a bible element to the story which I didn't much care for but I understood the creators message of a new world. Overall I thought this tale was hilarious and sweet and well acted with enough zombie chaos to intrigue hardcore zombie fans.Story 2 610 The Heavenly Creature. This story is about a Robot that becomes Buddha or at least to the monks. When the factory finds out they seek to destroy the machine for attempting to forget it's duty to serve man and instead attaining man's greatest goal. This is deemed a threat and an insult to mankind. While I like the message of man's jealousy over a near perfect machine I was turned off by the Robot's final message to man. It seemed idealistic to me and hard to swallow. Overall it was slow paced and more of a thought provoking study on people and our desires and fears. Might be a good watch for a philosophyBuddhist student. Story 3 510 Happy Birthday to me this was the cheesiest of all the stories and cute but less thought provoking. Like the first story it had comical moments and was quite enjoyable at times it also felt like a family story and not on the same level as the other stories. You could actually watch this one with your 8 year old and they might really like it. A problem with this story to me is how things aren't really explained especially a scene in the end. I laughed off my interpretation of it but am unsure of the message. There is a adorable aspect of it about trusting your child and having faith in them which was very sweet but for me it wasn't enough to give it a very favorable review. I would have definitely liked to have seen a different story here that didn't have such an absurd scenario... I giant 8 ball heading to earth... why would aliens have giant pool tables and websites dedicated to selling individual balls to different planets? Too silly to me.".

I admit I have some prejudices against a culture of violence and domination but the Koreans can't pretend to be otherwise. The Japanese seem to disguise their violence and cruelty quite well for instance. So it takes me a few dozens films of Korea to get me to overcome the bias. Having said that the central episode  story of this 3part anthology is most breathtaking. Beautifully shot. Clear and clean script. Thoughtprovoking underlined message. I am a Buddhist. I experience firsthand the great contrast of scientific gogetting and religious cry for us to accept whatever the present. The Buddha robot represents us very well and quite understandable to the ones who are not Buddhists. This episode does not set to convert anybody religiously but it successfully conveys the anguishes and selfconflicts reasonably well. I am not very much into the first and the final episodes. They are too abrasive and too loud to think anything deep. Even a death or freaking zombies can be nice and serene. The eighth ball that destroyed the world? Entertaining and imaginative in young adults' way. It leaves nothing. Cinematically there are some scenes or shots which I think memorable and telling. A dirty trash can with strayed cats around is one. Creepy and indicative. Buddha robot's movement in general is another. Serene and internalizing. Korean filmmakers are now on top of their game productionwise. But for culture and internal feelings that's another story.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is segment movie that has 3 different stories in one movie. This movie took 6 yrs to make because of budget issues and for a movie that took 6 yrs it's just mediocre at best.The first segment is about a guy that eats a contaminated apple inside a cows intestine and turns into a zombie and starts infecting others. The biblical verse at the end of this segment doesn't make much sense for the context of this segment. It has a bit of Korean culture and dating elements but besides that nothing stands out about this segment. It's just zombies eating humans and the zombie population in Korea keeps increasing and soon they all get nuked at the end. Yep hardly any substance besides the Korean culture and personalities shown in this segment.410 This second segment is my favorite out of the three. It's like a mix between IRobot and Ghost in the Shell 2 Innocence. Except this one has shorter budget and shorter length. The different philosophical theory is what drives this one. With the debate that revolves around enlightenment spirit and machines. It's not one sided but both sides has interesting things to say which makes the debate even more intriguing.710 The third segment is the end of the world by a giant 8 ball story with Korean style humor thrown in. The humor in this works way better than Seeking a Friend for the End of the World. It's one of those stories where all the characters are awkward and the humor is awkward as well but it works. Since it's short it doesn't have much development and isn't anything special but it's passable.610 5.810".

	onyx:emotionText "This is segment movie that has 3 different stories in one movie. This movie took 6 yrs to make because of budget issues and for a movie that took 6 yrs it's just mediocre at best.The first segment is about a guy that eats a contaminated apple inside a cows intestine and turns into a zombie and starts infecting others. The biblical verse at the end of this segment doesn't make much sense for the context of this segment. It has a bit of Korean culture and dating elements but besides that nothing stands out about this segment. It's just zombies eating humans and the zombie population in Korea keeps increasing and soon they all get nuked at the end. Yep hardly any substance besides the Korean culture and personalities shown in this segment.410 This second segment is my favorite out of the three. It's like a mix between IRobot and Ghost in the Shell 2 Innocence. Except this one has shorter budget and shorter length. The different philosophical theory is what drives this one. With the debate that revolves around enlightenment spirit and machines. It's not one sided but both sides has interesting things to say which makes the debate even more intriguing.710 The third segment is the end of the world by a giant 8 ball story with Korean style humor thrown in. The humor in this works way better than Seeking a Friend for the End of the World. It's one of those stories where all the characters are awkward and the humor is awkward as well but it works. Since it's short it doesn't have much development and isn't anything special but it's passable.610 5.810";

	schema:reviewBody "I sat down to watch Doomsday Book without having a single clue what it was about and decided to give it a go simply because it was a Korean movie. And now having seen this movie I will have to say that this was a different experience in many ways.First of all this is not a single movie but a movie comprised of three different short stories that are independent upon one another and dealing with very different subjects.The first segment titled A Brave New World 8 out of 10 rating was without a doubt the best of the three segments in my personal opinion. Both storywise and also entertainmentwise. It is about a man who contracts a strange disease from eating tainted meat and ends up turning into a zombie. It was a different approach to the zombie genre but all together a very good one. I thoroughly enjoyed this segment because it was nicely made a fresh new take of the zombie genre and also proved to be the better of the three segments. Great makeup and great effects a well worthy Korean addition to the zombie vault.Segment two titled The Heavenly Creature 5 out of 10 rating is about robots having a major part in the life of humans to the extend where they are so much integrated part of life and structure that they might start to become a threat to mankind. In a Buddhist monastery an older robot model have found spiritual and religious enlightenment. Well I will say that the director here had come up with an interesting concept. However this particular segment turned out to be a little bit too heavy on the ethics and morals compared to the other two segments. And as such it turned out to be somewhat of a hard pill to swallow. Aside from that then the segment was well constructed and nicely filmed and the robots were quite amazing.The third and final segment titled Happy Birthday 4 out of 10 rating was without a doubt the most odd and bizarre of the three segments. It is about a young girl who orders an 8ball on the Internet for her father but as luck would have it a 10 kilometer wide meteor is heading towards Earth threatening to end life as we know it. It turns out that the meteor is the 8ball ordered by the girl. Yeah odd story isn't it? The segment itself was nicely edited and nicely filmed but the story was just too strange to fully wrap your head around and embrace it for what it was. It sort of felt a little bit out of place in the segments.I suppose there is a little bit of something for everybody in these three segments and we would all individually have our different favorite and least favorite of the segments. However they all do bring something unique and outstanding to the enjoyment of the movie.For an Asian movie then Doomsday Book was a bit out of the ordinary. As a collective rating then I would rate the entire movie a 6 out of 10 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having watched so many Korean movies and dramas that end with someone having a terminal illness Autumn in My Heart I'm Sorry I Love You remember those? I thought I'd discovered all the tearjerker tricks... Nothing however could have prepared me for this one... Unlike the previous deals the illness doesn't so much kill you physically as it does mentally and trust me that is much much worse... First of all I'd like to commend the screenwriter for hitting the right spot with the first half... I thought the history between the couple is presented really well... I don't know why some people think it's too fastpaced cos it is possible for people to fall in love and get married in that amount of time and I thought the use of elliptical editing was just right not so excessive that you feel like you're seeing a trailer... The second half is the one that I think felt a little bit rushed but the story is so mesmerizing that honestly you don't really care... And Cheolsoo is one heck of a husband I don't know if I'd ever be able to do what he did and let me warn you girls that guys like Cheolsoo exist only in movies... And I didn't think the ending was ambiguous more like openended... The last scene is guaranteed to make you shed buckets... The cinematography is beautiful as others have mentioned... They did a lot of closeups with both characters in the same frame which I think is really endearing... And also panoramic shots of the land where they wanted to build their house which were beautiful... My favorite thing however is the soundtrack... The Spanish songs are right on target but my absolute favorite is when they played Nessun Dorma! from Turandot my favorite aria of all time during the wedding scene... I cried and it wasn't even the sad part yet... All and all fabulous fabulous movie... 1010".

A moment to remember will make you cry big time no matter how much you try opposing it no matter how macho and insensitive you think you are YOU WILL CRY guaranteed. if you don't believe a word i'm saying or if you think this is B.S watch the movie and when you get to the middle and the beginning of the second half and throughout the end you will see my point.the story is well developed not too slow and not too fast the perfect pace for such a dramatic film no plot holes at all and excellent acting which shows the actors took heartedly to the story. it's the kind of story that makes you feel sorry for one of the main character and the kind of fate that you would never wish upon anyone because it is irreversible. instead of having alzheimer we'd all be better off dead no matter how much our loved ones suffer. it's you you have to think of first in such a given situation and not them no matter how selfish it may or may not seem. peace all !! and enjoy this wonderful piece of cinematography.".

A moment to remember will make you cry big time no matter how much you try opposing it no matter how macho and insensitive you think you are YOU WILL CRY guaranteed. if you don't believe a word i'm saying or if you think this is B.S watch the movie and when you get to the middle and the beginning of the second half and throughout the end you will see my point.the story is well developed not too slow and not too fast the perfect pace for such a dramatic film no plot holes at all and excellent acting which shows the actors took heartedly to the story. it's the kind of story that makes you feel sorry for one of the main character and the kind of fate that you would never wish upon anyone because it is irreversible. instead of having alzheimer we'd all be better off dead no matter how much our loved ones suffer. it's you you have to think of first in such a given situation and not them no matter how selfish it may or may not seem. peace all !! and enjoy this wonderful piece of cinematography.";

	schema:reviewBody "The best movie i have ever seen....hands down!!! One can easily connect to the story for it is so natural and you are bound to cry at times. The main credit goes to the actors. Son Ye Jin was ecstatic as Su Jin. She has a very cute and innocent face that she perfectly fits into the character. The director has made a smart move by selecting her to portray the character that was cute at the initial stages and required some serious acting skills towards the end. Son Ye Jin has given more than her 100 per cent to get into the skin of the character. The scene where she asks Jung Woo Sung to reunite with his mother and he refuses she did a fabulous job. The scene where she knows the truth about her disease and asks her Jung Woo Sung if he wants to have a baby she was simply amazing. Both these scenes are completely contrasting. The former is an emotional scene and the latter is something which is really hard to describe as it consists of mixed emotions. She came out with flying colors in these both scenes. These are a testimony to her acting prowess.Jung Woo Sung was good as well. He did a great job by portraying himself as a rough carpenter and he fits the bill. The most important thing that needs to be mentioned here is the chemistry between the two actors. It was out of the world. They seemed like real life pair and in each every scene it was like we are seeing a pair next door. The director also needs a special mention as he did an amazing job by working on the screenplay and the chemistry between the actors with a script that has nothing new in the store. Hats off to him!!! Even the background score was good. The camera work was mind blowing. Subtle and simple especially in close up shotsthe guy has got some serious talent.On the whole it is movie worth watching which is like an oasis in a desert of meaningless movies!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "The reasons I've decided to write a review for this movie is not only because it is one of my favorite movies but because I would like to point out the fact that it's not just a tearjerker.The plot is quite simple a man and a woman who are married and the woman has a very rare case of the Alzheimer's disease. Hence you know she will be dying since there still isn't any cure for this disease and the movie was shot in 2004.The events which occur in the movie could be misleading in the sense that they could leave you with the feeling that it's just another very sad and emotional Korean dramatic movie with beautiful moments and captures and a heartbreaking ending. And while those events capture our hearts we forget that the main issue that this movie is trying to display is the problems of the Alzheimer's disease.Alzheimer's disease is exactly the title of the film An eraser in my head. You can't do anything against it you can just slow it down. Your memories will eventually all disappear from the most recent memories to the oldest ones. You lose all knowledge all identity until you are nothing inside anymore. And the worst part of it is that you don't even know what's happening to you so even if it awakens old wounds that hurt you you'll be healed the next day since you would have already forgotten about what was left in your mind the previous day.The movie focuses on a 28yearold woman who bears a very rare case of the Alzheimer's disease which runs in her family. It shows how much it is painful for the people who are close to her to accept the fact that she is gradually forgetting about them about her life about everything. Not only is she losing her own identity without even realizing it but they are losing their identity towards her. The situation is cruel because she's so young but it would've been the same with a cast of 60yearold people.The movie is so realistic because it shows how much the people around her are hurting and they can't even blame it on her since it isn't her fault. And that's the underlying problem of Alzheimer's disease.So yes it's a sweet beautiful and heartbreaking movie but for the people who are actually in the same situation it points out that you should keep faith in the person who is sick that if they forget about you it's not because they didn't care about you but because they can't help it. And it can get really hard for the people who are close to the person who bears the disease.I believe that's the most important message we can get out of this movie. It is truly a mustsee.".

The only other movie which had such an effect on me was 'Schindler's List'.First I'd love to say that the casting couldn't be more perfect. The chemistry between the actors are so perfect. Yejin Son you just can't get enough of the aura she lets out with her smile. A 'childlike innocence'not to be confused with 'childishness' is a quality anyone will notice in her which makes this movie more closer to your heart.The movie really makes you think how devastating it would have been for people who had to undergo such situations in life. The point to be noted is that its not the patient but the loved ones who are affected more. I loved every moment of the movie to the core. Still I have 3 moments which still keeps hitting back on me 1. The scenes in 2nd half where the Yejin Son suddenly gets back her memory and feels so sorry for forgetting her husband and writing a note to him explaining how much she loves him. The dialogue script in that scenes is so perfect and it really made my heart race! 2. To the end Woosung finds Yejin Son in a carehome. When he comes close to her the camera focuses onto a few sheets of paper on which she is 'trying' to draw a picture of her husband's face from her fading memory sadly not recognizing that the person standing in front of her is the person she is trying to draw! 3. To the end Woosung recreates the situation by which they met trying to help Yejin Son recall her memory!Fabulous movie I have no words! Sorry for letting out such a verbose note.".

	schema:reviewBody "Traveling to the cinema in South Korea must be one of the single most excruciating pastimes when one considers the emotional features their country is known for producing  imagine 200 South Koreans sitting in a room with a massive screen bawling their eyes out as the most melodramatic material plays out before them. A Moment to Remember is beautifully representative of this and though some have previously criticized the feature as resembling The Notebook not only is the film vastly different it is also superior.Based upon the Japanese TV program Pure Soul the feature opens immediately with SuJin Son YeJin a young woman who experiences forgetfulness on a daily basis. As she later admits it was her poor memory that led her to meet CheolSu Jung WuSung who she later has difficulty placing when she happens to bump into him once again. Ms. YeJin is absolutely phenomenal in this role the desperation and tearfulness she articulates while trying to remember something coupled with the blankness in her eyes when a memory has completely been erased making for a truly heartbreaking experience. This is furthered by the performance of Mr. WuSung both of the leads having superb onscreen chemistry that brings the gorgeousness and the agony of their relationship to life.The visuals from the lavish openness of the natural environment CheolSu intends to build their dream home upon to the hominess of their residence is sublime at capturing the affectionate beauty of the world that exists around the characters. The costumes brilliantly suit the leads as well both in their occupations and their personal lives but it is the attire they wear to their wedding that is easily the most glamorous capturing the romantic atmosphere of this touching moment.Although SuJin's memory deteriorates over time rather than the tragedy been an instant occurrence we the audience helplessly and painlessly watch as the gorgeous couple begin to experience the unforgivable pain that comes between them their love and their memories though CheolSu's determination to remain by SuJin's side is possibly the most painfully beautiful occurrence of all. It should already be colossally obvious that this feature is bound to cause some tears the later stages of the feature especially requiring tissues.Originally loathed by some of her coworkers for instigating a relationship with a fellow individual in their department Seo YoungMin Baek JongHak a married man prior to the commencement of the film's storyline as SuJin's memory begins to fracture and Seo ventures back into her life desperate to rekindle their affair SuJin begins exhibiting difficulty attempting to differentiate the past from the present.Though SuJin later stipulates how CheolSu never vocally admitted his love for her the tears he sheds after admitting he couldn't cry no more after experiencing a painful upbringing brilliantly visualizes the agony he suffers each time he looks at the woman he loves only to have her look at him like a stranger. The performances by the other cast members assist in further drawing the viewer into the world of the characters and though the doctor who discovers SuJin's condition D Lee Kwon ByungGil is blunt and unforgiving in his description of her mental affliction he captures the unsympathetic realism that so many doctors demonstrate in reality.The script which accentuates the dramatic elements alongside using occasional humor is delightful and the soundtrack that is designed to help the audience comprehend the feelings taking place during the accompanying moments is equally excellent. Occasionally cute touching sad but always honest in its depictions A Moment to Remember is not a film that can be watched  it has to be for it is dramatic excellence at its finest.".

There was a certain philosophical message in this movie in which I think we all take for granted. Adam Sandler did a great job in playing a workaholic. It is always great to see Christopher Walkin in any movie and in Click he played the eccentric scientist who provides Adam Sandler with his life controlling remote.I Recommend this to anyone looking for a quality film with a good laugh.

A lot of the time people that write comments will judge a film without seeing it and it gives the film a bad name.

Adam Sandler has shown that he is capable of playing a serious character in contrast o the aggressive and funny character he normally plays in his film Click is no different Sandler is both funny and serious at the right moments Kate Bekinsale is great as Donna his wife and Christopher Walken is excellent as always as Morty the Bed Bath and Beyond Employee. David Hasselhoff Henry Winkler and Jennifer Coolidge are funny in their supporting roles in this film. Australian audiences expecting to see Sophie Monk in a major role will be disappointed as she is honestly a very minor character in the film in contrast to what the Comedy Chanel is running about her on FoxtelAustar.All in all I do recommend seeing this film if not to learn a valuable lesson about priorities in life but to have a laugh and to enjoy a film that is better than what was expected of it.".

Based on the trailer one can assume that Adam Sandler playing Michael Newman in his latest movie has made a movie that is just like Adam Sandler's last movie... and Adam Sandler's movie before that... and the one before that... i.e. the comedy at which you groan shake your head say what the... and yet can't help from laughing out loud. That's what you get in the first hour of this film. That hour is also as much as the trailer shows and for good reason.Director Frank Coraci who also worked with Adam Sandler in directing The Waterboy and The Wedding Singer makes excellent use of a technique that should be taken advantage of more often by more directors. He sets us up in the aforementioned first hour of the movie for laughs and manages to do this quite a few times and not just with the moments seen in the trailer like other comedies. And based on one's presupposed knowledge of the typical Adam Sandler movie one expects there to be a spiral out of control for Michael a realization of the right thing to do and everything to end happily with a monologue and one final punchline all while remaining lighthearted and humorous. However having this expectation makes the power and the drama of the movie's second hour so much more heartfelt and emotional. This drama never comes off as forced or unnecessary because the pacing of the transition between the two utterly different tempos is perfect. Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe the cowriters of this movie used a similar technique in Bruce Almighty and it worked very effectively there as well.There's not much to be said about the ending without the possibility of spoiling it for someone but suffice to say it accomplishes what it needs to accomplish without making you feel like you've just been cheated.Far and away the best movie I've seen all year likely one of the best I have or will seen for many many years. There's so much more to see in this movie than what the trailer offers. See it... you won't regret it.".

That being said this movie isn't all that the trailers portray it to be.If you're going to see Click solely for a good laugh you'll love the first 45 minutes and hate the rest of it. The script takes a swerve closer to the end and unlike any of Sandler's previous movies the down part of the movie where the main character goes through rough times is actually very well done. Click goes from being a comedy to a drama  just for a little while.The dramatic portion of the movie allows Sandler to act as a regular human being a man who faces the real life consequences of putting his work ahead of his family. It's something a lot of people can relate to and all of the characters in the movie contribute to the storyline very well.Click provides great comedy and Sandler's best dramatic performance in a movie. It's clean enough for the kids okay the early teenagers a good laugh with the guys or girls and turns out to be a surprisingly good date movie.Thumbs up".

	schema:headline " Funny  Touching  A Good Combination";
	schema:reviewBody "This was a funny and  near the end  a touching movie. That's a nice combination to have. My only complaint is that it certainly isn't family fare for a nice story and should have been rated R not PG13. There's simply too much sexual material and and fword for PG13. With some editing this could have been a great story for everyone.However for us adults who like to laugh there is plenty in here to do that. The jokes come pretty fast right from the getgo. The premise would good with a televisionlike remote control you could control your life. You could fastforward through all the unpleasant scenes in your life or freeze frame something that is happening now or you could go back into time with your life. It all sounds good but as our main character Michael Newman Adam Sandler found out it's not so cool. That's a key message here too that avoiding the bad things is not necessarily what's best for us. The major message however was that spending time with your family is more important than putting your job ahead of them as far as priorities go. That theme leads to some touching scenes in the final 30 minutes of this comedy. As funny as this film is you would be hardpressed not to have some tears in your eyes at some point near the end of this film.Sandler plays a typical role for him and utters some great lines and uses sight gags as well for plenty of his laughs. Kate Bekinsale who plays his wife Donna looks absolutely beautiful the prettiest I've seen her since Pearl Harbor. She plays a nice lady in here too. Their little kids  especially the girl Tatum McCann  are cute and funny at times. I won't mention the dog. I can't without being crude. Christopher Walken is here and that usually means good news as he tends to play funandinteresting characters. Unfortunately  just a warning  this comedy as so many modernday ones are has its share of crude moments some language and the abovementioned sexual material. Overall it was extremely entertaining however.".

My only complaint is that it certainly isn't family fare for a nice story and should have been rated R not PG13. There's simply too much sexual material and and fword for PG13. With some editing this could have been a great story for everyone.However for us adults who like to laugh there is plenty in here to do that. The jokes come pretty fast right from the getgo. The premise would good with a televisionlike remote control you could control your life. You could fastforward through all the unpleasant scenes in your life or freeze frame something that is happening now or you could go back into time with your life. It all sounds good but as our main character Michael Newman Adam Sandler found out it's not so cool. That's a key message here too that avoiding the bad things is not necessarily what's best for us. The major message however was that spending time with your family is more important than putting your job ahead of them as far as priorities go. That theme leads to some touching scenes in the final 30 minutes of this comedy. As funny as this film is you would be hardpressed not to have some tears in your eyes at some point near the end of this film.Sandler plays a typical role for him and utters some great lines and uses sight gags as well for plenty of his laughs. Kate Bekinsale who plays his wife Donna looks absolutely beautiful the prettiest I've seen her since Pearl Harbor. She plays a nice lady in here too. Their little kids  especially the girl Tatum McCann  are cute and funny at times. I won't mention the dog. I can't without being crude. Christopher Walken is here and that usually means good news as he tends to play funandinteresting characters. Unfortunately  just a warning  this comedy as so many modernday ones are has its share of crude moments some language and the abovementioned sexual material. Overall it was extremely entertaining however.";

The funny jokes weren't a result of Sandler's screaming but of plot development. The especially sad part of the movie was fantastic and showed a completely different side of Sandler.The only problem I saw with the movie...they didn't develop Christopher Walken's and Nick Swardson's characters enough.

When the tired Michael goes to a department store to buy an universal remote control he rests on a bed and he meets the weird salesman Morty Christopher Walken that offers him a remote control capable of controlling his own universe. Michael uses too much and loses the control of the device having his own life controlled by the remote control. Then Michael sees the worthwhile parts of his personal life he missed while working and in the end of his life he lately concludes that the family comes first.Click is a very interesting comedy with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses. Adam Sandler performs the role of a liberal professional that does not give priority to his family trying to be successful in his own career and having the chance to see how his procedure would affect his beloved family. There are some low level jokes like the entertainment of his dog but they are also hilarious. Kate Beckinsale is extremely beautiful as usual even when she is aged and shows a great chemistry with Adam Sandler. Christopher Walken is very funny in the role of a quite crazy angel. In the end this highly recommended Click is a big surprise leaving the important message that family comes first and many entertaining moments. My vote is eight.Title Brazil Click".

One dayhe argues with Donna that he could not stay with his family in an important camp day and goes out angry to buy a universal remote control since he always had problems with the amount of remote controls they had in their house. He then meets Morty a strange man and inventor that gives him a oneofakind universal remote control that cannot be returned. Michael finds out that the remote is literally universal it controls the universe and interprets his wishesaltering time and reality as well as he can ''forward'' things he doesn't want to wait and ''pause'' others. Michael starts using the remote in his way and discovers that he boss waits forever to give him a promotion while making him spend more and more time with work each time. The time passes very quick and the remote is automatically programmed by his usage of it to skip or fastforward many important things of Michael's life. When he sees the thing is out of control he tries to destroy the remote but it doesn't work.''Click '' is a mix of comedy and drama but if I needed to choose a category it would be drama for sure. The funny parts are only in the beginning and the rest of the movie it's actually sad. It's the first movie with Adam Sandler that I think is worthwhile to watch since it is the first movie I watch with him that is not full of silly jokes.  I think comedy actors should make more drama movies  it's impressive how many of them actually are good and beyond the silly cheap movies. Like Jim Carrey who was great in ''Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind''. The movie is a life lesson for itself since it shows a man who faces the consequences of always putting his family behind his work duties a thing that happens a lot in our modern society. It's very sad to see how Michael's anxiety for promotion made him be so away from his family and a cold man as well as his family giving up on him.As I read in the message board this movie has many things in common to ''It's a Wonderful Life'' a movie that I would definitely recommend to everybody to watch before or after ''Click''.".

	schema:reviewBody "We've seen this movie way too many times...A fisherman catches a magic fish let's say. Magic fish gives him all the power in the world. When it comes down to it the magic fish's power doesn't mean anything at all because the fisherman is a lonely guy with no love around from friends or family. Or let's look at A Christmas Carol a classic Christmastime story about how it's better to give than to receive.Then we have Click a glimpse of a busy workingman in America who has a strange amount of laziness when it comes to his family. He doesn't deserve anybody in his life the way he treats them especially given his choices after he receives a magic remote control that allows his to speed his way through life or alter the way things are perceived to him ie muting his wife's girlfriend or pausing his wife in the middle of an argument. So in the beginning you really don't care about him because his character is so selfish and lazy...as most of these movies go he'll quickly learn the error of his ways...or will he? I really don't know what the originality in this film was. I used to love Adam Sandler in everything he released that he starred in but what is this cheap ripoff of so many films as Truman Show Bruce Almighty It's a Wonderful Life and Christmas Carol? And Pleasantville comes to mind although to put that great movie alongside this doesn't seem right...I had to give it a 5. It had slightly funny parts especially when Rob Schneider wasn't onscreen a terribly overused comedic soundtrack interested gags Christopher Walken was in it for a second like in Envy...yeah average...".

I cannot remember anything much that he said and yet someone like Kate Beckinsale fell for him.The angel of death was a ludicrous character in a ? comedy.I think I was expecting a clever comedic fantasy film and was given rubbish. Only amazement that this film could exist kept me watching.Kate Beckinsale seemed to be in another film altogether apart from her character's acceptance of the dogs' behaviour!If the only reason for going into a bedding shop to get a television remote control was to use the word beyond the film failed before it started.

His demanding boss is adequately portrayed by David Hasselhoff. Sandler tries frantically to please his superior but his efforts largely go unnoticed. The result is continual work dissatisfaction and mounting pressure on his home life.Sandler's wife is played by the exquisite Kate Beckinsale.

She is the doting wife of an overworked architect and the attentive mother of two delightful children.

What it doesn't allow for are changes to deeds already committed. The angel of death who hands Sandler the remote cautions him that the device is nonreturnable.Naturally Sandler's curiosity is piqued and he begins toying with the quirky device. A series of humorous incidents ensue but the comedy is hardly worth laughing at. The audiences remained largely quiet throughout the duration of the film with the exception of the usual sexual innuendo and toilet humour which cracked a few smiles.The film goes off the rails for a while but just when it starts losing the audience it utilizes drama to great effect to reel the crowds back in. Sandler is surprisingly effective in his dramatic performance. It is a detraction from the norm but one which will leave you teary eyed and heartbroken until the final ten minutes of the film. Christopher Walken is a spectacle to behold in this dramatic comedy.This is a mustsee Sandler film not because the laughs come thick and fast but because it is able to work on raw emotions so effectively. The concept of family and priorities are essential to the film and you are bound to be wiping the tears from your face in the last quarter.Twothumbs up!".

	schema:headline " Not the best Sandler vehicle but quite enjoyable";
	schema:reviewBody "In a nod to Jim Carrey's Bruce Almighty  in which a regular Schmoe becomes almost omnipotent  Adam Sandler stars as a loser who is offered a universal remote control device which gives him power over time and space  among other things.The remote is given to him by the otherworldly Morty Christopher Walken who is tinkering in the bowels of a Bed Bath  Beyond store. Actually the plot is taken from the Twilight Zone episode A Kind Of Stopwatch which originally aired on Oct. 18 1963 but this contraption also allows Michael Newman Sandler to mute pause review his past and especially fastforward things around him.It's that latter feature though that causes the most havoc in his life because as soon as he zips through one crisis getting a cold arguing with his wife wishing for a promotion having sex etc. after another the machine programs itself automatically forwarding through similar situations and causing his existence to pass all too quickly before his eyes.While he strives to climb the company ladder at his architect firm he begins to use the thing to avoid the months and years of hard work it would take for him to succeed soon however as in most films of this fantasy ilk the bad side is revealed. While his brain is fastforwarding through bits of unpleasantness his body remains  with little or no reaction to the things actually going on around him in his family's reality. Before he realizes it his wife Donna Kate Beckinsale is drifting away from him and the relationship with his kids Ben and Samantha Joseph Castanon and Tatum McCann is going to pot. Donna eventually divorces Michael and marries swim instructor Bill Sean Astin Lord of the Rings 50 First Dates while the kids grow up estranged from their father. He's a big man at his company sure but no amount of success on the job can compensate for failure in the home.The lesson here is to spend as much quality time with your loved ones Family comes first and there are no quick fixes in life. A bit maudlin and sappy at times although there are some pretty funny moments plus about 10 minutes too long for my taste but nice supporting work from Walken who steals the picture Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner as Michael's meshugana parents as well as David Hasselhoff as his weirdedout boss make this one of Sandler's better vehicles.Not his best  that was The Wedding Singer so far  but good enough to enjoy.".

Actually the plot is taken from the Twilight Zone episode A Kind Of Stopwatch which originally aired on Oct. 18 1963 but this contraption also allows Michael Newman Sandler to mute pause review his past and especially fastforward things around him.It's that latter feature though that causes the most havoc in his life because as soon as he zips through one crisis getting a cold arguing with his wife wishing for a promotion having sex etc. after another the machine programs itself automatically forwarding through similar situations and causing his existence to pass all too quickly before his eyes.While he strives to climb the company ladder at his architect firm he begins to use the thing to avoid the months and years of hard work it would take for him to succeed soon however as in most films of this fantasy ilk the bad side is revealed. While his brain is fastforwarding through bits of unpleasantness his body remains  with little or no reaction to the things actually going on around him in his family's reality. Before he realizes it his wife Donna Kate Beckinsale is drifting away from him and the relationship with his kids Ben and Samantha Joseph Castanon and Tatum McCann is going to pot. Donna eventually divorces Michael and marries swim instructor Bill Sean Astin Lord of the Rings 50 First Dates while the kids grow up estranged from their father. He's a big man at his company sure but no amount of success on the job can compensate for failure in the home.The lesson here is to spend as much quality time with your loved ones Family comes first and there are no quick fixes in life. A bit maudlin and sappy at times although there are some pretty funny moments plus about 10 minutes too long for my taste but nice supporting work from Walken who steals the picture Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner as Michael's meshugana parents as well as David Hasselhoff as his weirdedout boss make this one of Sandler's better vehicles.Not his best  that was The Wedding Singer so far  but good enough to enjoy.";

The different layers of the story adds much deserved humanity to the characters  which were well cast. Especially the crazy girl of the village Hyejeong Kang from the film Old Boy. The film brings together the South KoreanAmerican Allies and the Communist North so that they saw eye to eye as human beings due to the example of innocence radiating from the village. I'm looking forward to the director of Welcome to Dongmakgol's future work.Basically a really really good film! Korean cinema is really finding its way. Many Thanks Ricky Thind".

The film is even handed in its treatment of all sides in this war other than perhaps the military command as it is quite antiwar. There is a bit of violence and gore so it isn't for young children.

Sick of the murder of his own men High Comrade Lee SuHwa refuses to kill the few remaining wounded soldiers. Yet his secondincommand is all to ready to follow the orders of high command and tries to stir up a mutiny versus the High Comrade.

Pyo readying himself to commit suicide. The medic stops the man from doing so but almost gets killed himself. As with the North Korean soldiers these two men make their way into the wilderness.While resting the three North Korean soldiers encounter an odd girl dressed in traditional clothing with flowers in her hair. Although each man points a gun at her she shows little concern and informs the men that they should move because they are standing close to a snake rock. After a snake falls on the arm of Sgt. Jang the three men unload their weapons at the rock. With their guns empty the three men follow the girl Yeoil to Dongmakgol. Later the South Korean soldiers arrive and of course there is a stand off between the two groups. However after a few events including the food storehouse blowing up and defeating a wild boar the five Koreans along with an American pilot named Kent Smith whose plane crashed at the very beginning of the film are able to come to terms with each other temporarily but with the threat of other outsiders looming on the horizon can this fragile friendship be maintained? One of South Korea's biggest hits in 2005 Welcome to Dongmakgol is truly a visual delight. The natural scenery is quite stunning and the CG a brilliant sequence with a wild boar and a rain of popcorn is very well done. The actors especially Shin Hakyun Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance Joint Security Area Save the Green Planet and Jeong Jaeyeong the Quiet Family Guns and Talks do an extraordinary job of portraying adversaries who eventually warm to each other. While not the best of friends their friendship does shine through. Kang Hyejeong Oldboy Antarctic Journal does a good job portraying the nutty but sweet girl Yeoil.While primarily a comedy Welcome to Dongmakgol also contains a few graphic scenes of violence such as the eradication of the North Korean soldiers at the beginning of the film and a few scenes near the end of the film. While the film might be written off by some as a hurrah that both Koreas can work together those of Western decent might be a little shocked by the portrayal of Western soldiery i.e. American in an otherwise comedic film.".

Soldiers from the North and South as well as an American pilot find themselves in a secluded village its residents largely unaware of the outside world including the war.The movie has its own quintessence of the characters every character is so lovable that you will find it tangible. The screenplay is immaculate every frame of the movie is eloquent and displays diverse emotions of the characters.The best part of the movie is the humor the subtlety of comic scenes is fantastically portrayed. The cinematography is dazzling every scene is crafted perfectly. The slowmotion scenes looked wellpaced the lush and green outskirts of Korea are shown with elegance the rains are amazing.The patriotism of North and South Korean soldiers is ardently poignant and their measured character development towards the harmonious grounds is simply overwhelming.I mean having watched a lot of Korean Movies I think every movie is better than the other one.Recommended for everyone.".

	schema:reviewBody "I found the movie simply brilliant and i must say i find weird that many people focus their attention on the war which is not the key of the movie itself. In my opinion the war is roughly depicted because it is just a place within which the main story unfolds. The emphasis is on the characters their unpredictable encounter and the situations that make possible for them to become friends and maybe even companions. There is a phrase said Smith taking back the grandma while the village keeps up with the party that somehow sums up the movie Such a good time. That's life..Besides i particularly appreciated the acting of the crazy girl Hyejeong Kang which i already saw in Old Boy which is also probably the best character. Watching the movie i found more than a similitude with two movies from Hayao Miyazaki Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi for the hidden village idea and the lanternstatues as well and Mononoke Hime for the wild boar scene which by the way is one of the best of Dongmakgol original and simply brilliant. Only later i realized it was mostly due to the music which is in fact composed by Joe Hisaishi who made the music for these Miyazaki movies too once again his work is superb.One thing i always wait for is a movie's ending scene mostly cause i've seen too many movies ruined in the last part... A.I. for example and i must say i loved this one when we see why the young communist soldier had a flower too and who gave him it. No special happy ending for the village or whatever just a moment when all of them where together 6 as the 6 butterflies that we saw flying away from the snow a few moments before. ".

Absolutely F'in glad i did its such a well shot beautiful tale the cinematography is highly original for the premise of a war film the colours and dialogue were spot on and the actors all came correct. I found myself wishing that i could just F it all and go live in that cool village with that crazy girl for the rest of my days ha ha. Thats not to say this film is completely void of any gritty and sometimes gory realism on the 'war' front but it just doesn't focus so much on the agony more so on the individual and the reasons behind such atrocities. Its not a short film but i found myself not wanting it to end. Some scenes in particular bring light relief and patch the whole thing up into a marvellous little epic.

	schema:reviewBody "I thought that this film would be another one of those feelgood touchy storyline that seems to be dominating Korean movies lately. But the way that this movie displayed the story in a simple manner not overdoing too much war story but not completely overriding it with the human story impressed me.The year is 1950 and the Korean War is at its climax. An American pilot lands near a small isolated village located in the mountains. Meanwhile a troop of North Korean soldiers are attacked and only 3 live to trudge through the harsh mountains. A South Korean soldier who ran away from his troop meets another soldier in same position. These soldiers meet together in a small village called Dongmakgol where innocent and very oldfashioned villagers are surprised to hear that there's been a war going on.I loved seeing the scenes where the audience gets to know the good side of characters who seem harsh on the outside. This movie has some great acting. The scenes are not only touching they have some amount of dry Korean humor as well. I laughed and cried.The one thing I can specifically point out as a fault in this movie was the portrayal of Americans or the Allies troops. The dialogue wasn't so bad considering it was made in Korea. I've heard a lot worse. But the Allies had a typical onedimensional feel and I was disappointed to find that they were viewed in such a way. It only showed what some Koreans like to call a kojengeeh image. The movie explained why they had to take certain actions but I still felt it was something that could have been improved.".

	schema:reviewBody "Welcome to Dongmakgol is a South Korean film set during the Korean War during the 1950's.A U.S. Navy pilot Neil Smith is caught in a mysterious storm of butterflies and crashlands his plane whilst flying over a remote part of Korea. He is found by local villagers who nurse him back to health. In the small village of Dongmakgol time appears to stand still. They have no knowledge of modern technology such as guns and grenades. All villagers are unaware to the conflict within Korea. Meanwhile not far from the village a platoon of North Korean and South Korean soldiers have an encounter and the ensuing gunfight leaves most of the North Koreans dead. The surviving soldiers from the North manage to escape through a mountain passage. The North Korean soldiers are found by an odd girl Yeoilwho acts crazy. She leads them to the village where to their astonishment they find two South Korean soldiers.The South Korean soldiers who have both deserted their units had also been led to the village which is housing the injured U.S. Navy pilot Smith by a different villager.The unexpected encounter causes an armed standoff that lasts for several days. The villagers have no idea what the stir is about and wonder why the two sides are standing there pointing those sticks at each other. The confrontation ends only when a soldier holding a grenade is worn by fatigue and accidentally drops it. Another soldier heroically throws himself onto the grenade but it does not explode. He discards the dud over his shoulder in contempt and it rolls into the village storehouse and blows up the village's stockpile of corn for the winter. The remnants fall down from the sky surrealistically as popcorn.The two groups of Korean soldiers and Smith now have to face the fact that their quarrel condemned the village to starvation in the following winter. They help the villagers in the fields to make up for the damage they have caused and even work together to kill one of the wild boars that trouble the village. Tensions between the two groups of Korean soldiers gradually lessen though members of both sides are haunted by the memory of terrible things they have experienced during the war. While this is happening Allied commanders who have lost several other planes in the area are preparing a rescue team to recover Smith whom they mistakenly believe has been captured by enemy units and is being held at a hidden base. The plan when the rescue team finds and recovers Smith a bomber unit is to fly in and destroy the antiaircraft guns they presume are sited in the village which means that the innocent villagers are now in grave peril.The rescue team drops in by parachute at night suffering heavy casualties from the rough terrain. They enter the village and under the assumption it is a cover for an enemy base begin roughing up toward the villagers. Despite the efforts of the villagers to conceal the Korean soldiers by disguising them as villagers a firefight breaks out in which all the members of the rescue team but one are killed and Yeoil is fatally wounded by a bullet. The only survivor of the rescue team the Korean translator is hit over the head by Smith and is captured by the villagers. Through the translator the people in the village find out about the bombing plan. The North and South Korean soldiers realize there is no time to make it back to his base to stop the bombing. The only possible way to save the village they decide is to create a decoy enemy base using equipment from the rescue team parachute drop so that the bombing unit will attack them instead of the village.Meanwhile the decoy is successful and the remaining North and South Korean soldiers die smiling while a barrage of bombs explode around them. The village is saved but at the cost of the lives of the former enemies who had later become friends.Welcome To Dongmakgol was the debut film of director Park Kwanghyun.It stars Shin Hakyun Jeong Jaeyeong and Kang Hyejeongin her Best Supporting Actress winning role as Yeoil.The film has an antiwar film that is presented in a different way through fantasy.Alsoit provides the viewers a message that human beings aren't violent in nature.In the endit only shows that loving others is truly the inherent nature of human beings.The film is based on the longrunning play by Jang Jin. It is a mustsee and highly recommended film.No question about it.".

The villagers have no idea what the stir is about and wonder why the two sides are standing there pointing those sticks at each other. The confrontation ends only when a soldier holding a grenade is worn by fatigue and accidentally drops it. Another soldier heroically throws himself onto the grenade but it does not explode. He discards the dud over his shoulder in contempt and it rolls into the village storehouse and blows up the village's stockpile of corn for the winter. The remnants fall down from the sky surrealistically as popcorn.The two groups of Korean soldiers and Smith now have to face the fact that their quarrel condemned the village to starvation in the following winter. They help the villagers in the fields to make up for the damage they have caused and even work together to kill one of the wild boars that trouble the village. Tensions between the two groups of Korean soldiers gradually lessen though members of both sides are haunted by the memory of terrible things they have experienced during the war. While this is happening Allied commanders who have lost several other planes in the area are preparing a rescue team to recover Smith whom they mistakenly believe has been captured by enemy units and is being held at a hidden base. The plan when the rescue team finds and recovers Smith a bomber unit is to fly in and destroy the antiaircraft guns they presume are sited in the village which means that the innocent villagers are now in grave peril.The rescue team drops in by parachute at night suffering heavy casualties from the rough terrain. They enter the village and under the assumption it is a cover for an enemy base begin roughing up toward the villagers. Despite the efforts of the villagers to conceal the Korean soldiers by disguising them as villagers a firefight breaks out in which all the members of the rescue team but one are killed and Yeoil is fatally wounded by a bullet. The only survivor of the rescue team the Korean translator is hit over the head by Smith and is captured by the villagers. Through the translator the people in the village find out about the bombing plan. The North and South Korean soldiers realize there is no time to make it back to his base to stop the bombing. The only possible way to save the village they decide is to create a decoy enemy base using equipment from the rescue team parachute drop so that the bombing unit will attack them instead of the village.Meanwhile the decoy is successful and the remaining North and South Korean soldiers die smiling while a barrage of bombs explode around them. The village is saved but at the cost of the lives of the former enemies who had later become friends.Welcome To Dongmakgol was the debut film of director Park Kwanghyun.It stars Shin Hakyun Jeong Jaeyeong and Kang Hyejeongin her Best Supporting Actress winning role as Yeoil.The film has an antiwar film that is presented in a different way through fantasy.Alsoit provides the viewers a message that human beings aren't violent in nature.In the endit only shows that loving others is truly the inherent nature of human beings.The film is based on the longrunning play by Jang Jin. It is a mustsee and highly recommended film.No question about it.";

During their stay at Dongmakgol however they come to realize what is truly worth fighting for and ultimately trade their lives to preserve it.To me it seems that the movie yearns for the innocence that Korea lost during the Korean War. Dongmakgol the village  exemplified by the young exceedingly naive and perhaps a bit crazy but cute woman  is sort of Korea's Eden. The villagers know nothing of guns grenades or even that there's a war going on. When one villager asks one of the soldiers who has attacked Korea the soldier has trouble getting the villager to understand that it is Korea that has attacked itself. For the villager it just doesn't compute.There's a somewhat nonsosubtle theme of the hope of reunification but definitely a bias toward South Korea which reminds me of Taegukgi.This is the director Kwanghyun Park's first film I believe. For being so young he is an adept director. I anticipate his next film with hope.".

This was a sweet innocent comedy film with a deep underlying theme. It is beautifully filmed and the popcorn scene and the boar scene were just awesome filmed in such a unique way.

The film is about a former detective turn pimp trying to catch a serial killer who is killing his prostitutes. It's a big cat and mouse game between the two throughout the whole movie. The plot sounds thin but there is so much more than what meets the eye. This is one of the best thrillerserial killer movies I have ever seen and I don't want to say too much about the plot because it is very edge of your seat kind of stuff. The film never drags and it becomes more intriguing the more you watch and you feel like you know the character because the actors portray them so well. This is a very violent and gruesome film that shouldn't be viewed by the squeamish even though there isn't that many bloody scenes for being a serial killer movie. The movie achieves so much more with less which hardly ever works in films that need violence to be a success. I wish that Hollywood or even European films would have the brass to make a film this unique and daring at the same time. The thing that this film has going for it the most is that it's wonderfully erratic. You can never guess what is going to happen next and that is the reason why Korean movies are so fantastically entertaining. I rank this movie in my top three greatest thrillerserial killer movies of all time somewhere between Seven and Silence of the Lambs. The characters of this film really flesh out the story and let you jump right in. I can't help but stress the point that this film is very unpredictable and the style of the story telling is subtle but very effective. This film is a sure bet and you will not leave disappointed.".

	schema:reviewBody "Korean cinema does it again. The Chaser is another great movie from the Korean film stable. The plot stems around an amoral excop turned pimp who after losing some of his working girls decides to track down and find the client behind this. He ends up finding himself involved in more than he bargained for with the client being a serial killer and its then a chase to find his last girl sent to him whilst the police also try to pin him down but are hampered by legal red tape and politics.As you'd expect from a Korean film from the cop thriller genre it can be very violent and there's no denying that for this film however thankfully it doesn't overshadow the rest of the movie. The chase is on and the roller coaster of emotions following the pimp and the cops trying to stop the serial killer is nothing less than gripping watching them go from one success to despair in short spaces of time. The tension is high and will tug on you right to the end.Importantly there is a lot of humour. The main character Joongho Eom is incredibly drywitted and is a release valve for the tension in the film. As he carries the film the acting is important and both he and the serial killer are exceptionally good. Can't argue with either or even the general ensemble.There is possibly an American remake in the offing. Fair enough I guess as that's become the norm now but I hope it doesn't dilute the central story or the action. This film is a great gem and follows on from some of the other greats in the genre such as Memories of a Murder which is a classic. It will unsettle but for an intelligent thriller it really is up there with the best in the past few years.".

I have been watching movies for quite some time now. And I have seen almost all movies from the IMDb top 250. But this movie deserves to be in the top 20. No question about it no exaggeration. Just look at my vote statistics and you will see that only gave a few movies a ten.So what's the story of the movie? A former detective who is now a pimp thinks 2 of his girls ran away from him. So he tries to find those girls. After some research he learns the truth is a little bit different. From that point on the movie never loses your grip. Never get's dull. Always keeps you right on the edge of your chair. For the rest you really gotta see it. I won't spoil any of your viewing pleasure by telling you too much about the story.The other comment said something about a horror element and a bit gore. But in my opinion there is no horror. Sure there is some blood but it doesn't play a big part.So why are you still reading my comment. Go and see where you can watch this movie!!".

	schema:headline " Nice psychothriller! Slow burner but great climax!";
	schema:reviewBody "Wow! I caught wind of this through a magazine review and checked it out and was very glad I did. Some of the great stuff coming out of South Korea will blow your mind and this is no exception. The references people made to this movie being in the caliber of Oldboy and Memories of Murder are well substantiated but I would liken it more to Memories of Murder and not quite in the same league as Oldboy. The only movie in league with Oldboy is Seven. While the plot kind of reminded me of some of the classic 80s and 90s psychokiller thrillers we have had come out of the US it does hold up well on its own for being a foreign film. Not the most original plot but a decent twist on it nonetheless. Nothing in the plot or sequence of events stood out as unbelievable and there are some real gripping scenes that'll make you whiteknuckle. There are some good character developments and reversals that I enjoyed as we see our main character a former cop turned pimp trying to find the guy who's been killing his girls and coming to grips with his personal responsibilities and justice. I don't want to give away the plot other than that as it would detract from your enjoyment. It does burn a little slow after the first 20 minutes of the movie as we see events unfold so be prepared for the reward in the last 30 minutes of the movie as the sequence of events crescendo. I'll be keeping an eye on this great director.".

What's amazing about this movie is that it lets you know who is the killer right from the start. It shows what its cards are but it still controls the game completely from the beginning to end without ever giving out any dully moment.Having loved some of the recent Korean movies such as 'Memories of Murder' 'Old Boy' 'The Host' etc I had a high expectation of this movie after a strong recommendation from my Korean friend who advised me not to take my pregnant wife to the movie due to gory violence.It is indeed gory but at least the scenes stop before the actual execution of bloody things such as hammering a huge nail into a victim's head etc. I guess it's less violent that the Saw series.Fantastic direction from a rookie director fantastic acting  a fantastic thriller.

	schema:headline " Suspenseful thrilling and funny S Korea is at it again";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is so Korean. The way it is shot and the way the story is told doesn't conform to the way many Americans think genre clues should be presented and adhered to. At it's heart The Chaser is a crime drama about a serial killer and the guy who's chasing him but it evolves from many different angles. It's a comedy of errors in the way the police and politicians are portrayed a melodrama with its inclusion of the precocious little girl who belongs to the woman serving as the film's primary chase and investigative point a psychological thriller in the way the serial killer messes with the minds of the police a mildly gory film in the way the bad guy uses a hammer and chisel a bit of a tragedy in the way it ends. The only thing missing from this film is romance. Thank god they didn't make one of the missing girls a love interest of the pimphe's only after the money they owe him. That's where the brilliance of the chase begins.There's a fight scene early on where our protagonist an exdetective gone bad turned pimp is beating the crap out of some guy he thinks has kidnapped and sold some of his girls. A long uphill foot chase precedes the brawl so both combatants are extremely winded when the fighting beginspunches don't land and there's a girly incompetence to the whole thing which is to say it's realistic. After finally landing a few punches that subdue his opponent momentarily the pimp gets up and starts kicking him in disgust. He's very angry still a bit winded and out of control. One of his kicks only grazes its target causing him to lose his balance and fall on his butt and because of momentum he begins to roll and his feet fly up in the air. It seems funny but it's not. You have to sneak in your chuckle as he gets up and continues kicking the guy. When he's finally pummeled his adversary into unconsciousness he uses his foot to roll him onto his side so he can get to the wallet in his back pocket and ID him. He attempts to sit on him not to keep him down but because he's bone tired from all the fighting. He doesn't land squarely and ends up rolling on his butt again. It seems funny but it's not.After the fight scene both men are brought to the police station for questioning. Because the pimp is an exdetective with a reputation the cops initially sympathize with the other guy thinking the pimp overreactednot to mention the causal fenderbender that brought the two men together in the first place. The pimp doesn't know that the other guy just took a hammer and chisel to the head of the girl he is trying to get back he thinks she's just freshly been sold making his sense of urgency misplaced where it remains throughout most of the film. It's kind of awkward for the police to find much urgency in one pimp accusing another of stealing one of his girls. The bad guy insists he didn't sell the girl and then mumbles under his breathe I killed her and confesses in great detail how he killed her and several other girls. The pimp screams at the cops Can't you see he's just pretending to be crazy now?And so it goes. We know there's been killing going on and we know who's been doing it from very early on in the film but it manages to remain suspenseful throughout. The Chaser is a gripping thriller from the beginning until a few minutes from the end. The two main characters are portrayed with impeccable nuance. It's Yunseok Kim's performance as the bewildered pimp that takes this film to great heights. There are so many things that don't go the way he wants them to like people hanging up on him when he's talking to them on the phone a little girl who startles him and asks too many smart questions the cops can't do anything right and every time his subdued response of confused disbelief made me laugh. He brings a Kangho Songish melancholy humor to the film I can't think of an American actor to compare him to while Jungwoo Ha as the impotent serial killer is so normal and unmoved it's creepy.There are a handful of groan out loud plot moves in The Chaser but so what. There are also more than a handful of plot moves this film doesn't do moves that most people will be guessing it will do that it more than makes up for it. This is a film I know I'll watch again just for the performance of it. The plot won't matter. It's that good.More reviews at sitenoiseatthemovies.blogspot.com".

The main killer is caught and get this...for no reason at all...they free him almost immediately. It literally makes no sense at all. In the movie they act as if there is no proof of his deeds although there is heaps of proof. They collected DNA evidence they found that he beat a kid with a hammer three years prior the way he conducted the murders matches the case descriptions exactly he stole a car and he has called all of the missing girls.I was so angry at the end of the movie. I just wasted two hours with a movie about catching a brutal killer...he is caught...and then...lets just set him free to kill yet again in his unpatrolled empty neighborhood in broad daylight and then he walks back home to bury more dead bodies. RIDICULOUS!!!If you want to waste two hours with a ridiculous story about a murderer being treated like a princess watch this.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE CHASER is a another example of the cutting edge of Asian cinema and its universal influence especially on western cinema as this is currently in the process of being set to be remade in Hollywood by the team who created the INFERNAL AFFAIRS remake THE DEPARTED. The story follows Jung Ho an ex cop who is now a pimp and who is looking for two of his girls who have disappeared. Unbeknowst to Jung the girls have become victim to twisted serial killer Young min who Jung suspects to be instead a rival pimp buying his girls off him without his knowledge. Through a series of events Jung ho and Young min clash into each other and eventually a chase and beating ensues with Young min being taken to the local police station and eventually confessing to nine murders. The police task force behind the murder investigation strongly believe that he is the murderer and have 12 hours to find and gather evidence against him or he will be set free without charge and the same time Jung ho has to look for another one of his girls Min jin who has become captive by the psychopath. Aside from a slow start the film really kicks in once Young min is detained and the police have 12 hours to build a case against him. At the same time Jung ho's character undergoes a change from being a bit of a bastard to eventually setting out on a desperate effort to find Min jin especially as he finds out and develops a kind of bond with her daughter. The performances are superb and the portrayal of psycho Young min is excellent as he is an instantly dislikeable person who is playing the police at there own game and leading round in circles. The direction is tight and stylish with some superb suspense and nail biting scenes and there's also a strain of humour throughout the film that provide a slight relief from the dark undertone. Overall another strong and impressive entry that highlights the excellence and originality of Asian cinema.".

	schema:reviewBody "My love for Korean cinema like many fans began with Oldboy about ten years ago. Now thanks to Netflix and those who purchase the rights to distribute these films in America I've gotten the chance to watch everything Mr. Park has to offer. I've since moved on to Joonho Bong's work and after watching his three masterpieces Mother Host and Memories of Murder I decided to delve into any and all Korean drama I could find. This brought me to the easily accessible Chaser on Netflix.Chaser sports the usual gritty cinematography conflicted antihero Yunseok Kim and a despicable villain Jungwoo Ha. Both of their performances are very strong however neither truly wows primarily because of the lack luster writing. My overall displeasure with the film lies here. Every thrilling event or spectacle seemed contrived in order to produce a scene of explicit tension. The best scenes of the film all occur out of luck which when written is actually just the writer deciding something is going to conveniently happen. This same trial is faced in Bong's Memories of a Murder though the same air of realism is not found in Chaser to support the moments of happenstance. Likewise the film is also reminiscent of Kim Jeewoon's I Saw the Devil which in fairness came after Chaser. And perhaps the failures of Chaser needed to occur so they could go further in I Saw the Devil which had its flaws as well. The problem is that Chaser doesn't define it's own choices strong enough. It is neither subtle and sprawling as Memories nor voracious and uncompromising as Devil. It struggles with the monotony of a overused plot without the flare of anything unique or engaging.Summation Chaser has some very intense and memorable scenes however the artifice leading up to them is poorly managed and unforgivable. Hongjin Na is not a terrible director and there is a good film in here somewhere though it's likely found in either Memories of Murder or I Saw The Devil.".

The best scenes of the film all occur out of luck which when written is actually just the writer deciding something is going to conveniently happen. This same trial is faced in Bong's Memories of a Murder though the same air of realism is not found in Chaser to support the moments of happenstance. Likewise the film is also reminiscent of Kim Jeewoon's I Saw the Devil which in fairness came after Chaser. And perhaps the failures of Chaser needed to occur so they could go further in I Saw the Devil which had its flaws as well. The problem is that Chaser doesn't define it's own choices strong enough. It is neither subtle and sprawling as Memories nor voracious and uncompromising as Devil. It struggles with the monotony of a overused plot without the flare of anything unique or engaging.Summation Chaser has some very intense and memorable scenes however the artifice leading up to them is poorly managed and unforgivable. Hongjin Na is not a terrible director and there is a good film in here somewhere though it's likely found in either Memories of Murder or I Saw The Devil.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm a person who hates bullst. And this movie is full of it. Don't get me wrong the movie itself is pretty good. Let me explain.Here be spoilers. The movie is about a pimp whose girls go missing one after another. The pimp is also an exdetective. After sending one of his last girls to a client he suspects said client to be the cause of his troubles. At this point in the movie though he still thinks that the 'client' kidnaps his girls and sells them elsewhere. Long story short the exdetective pimp starts searching for the girlabductor accidentally bumps into him they end up at the police station and that's where the movie starts going downhill.Question what should the police do after they apprehend two men who fought each other after a common car accident and after one of them in the presence of at least 34 other policemen can't recall now commits to having murdered 12 women? Did I mention that the police are also looking for an unknown serial killer known for at least 3 homicides? The guy continues to mention in great detail how he killed the women all details match police records he has blood all over his shirt was apprehended while driving a friend's car he forgot the friend's name how unfortunate doesn't have any form of ID can't remember where he lives etc. All the while the other guy the detectivepimp is shouting from the other side of the room that the 'client' abducted his women. Surely this is no difficult puzzle. If you're a sane person and answered at least put him behind bars until everything's cleared out  you're wrong. It appears that the policemen are most concerned not about the fact that they have a serial killer in their station but that said serial killer is badly bruised. I'm not kidding the cops' main topic of discussion is how they will explain to the press why the guy is beat up like that the pimp did it. So they do the next best thing  leave him alone in an officelike room with what seems a 90 pound woman who is more interesting in typing up something on her computer than watching a serial killer who IS STILL NOT BEHIND BARS but on a chair in the middle of the officeroom. Apparently they don't have jails in Korea. The police fail to gather any evidence it's the middle of the night and to be honest they're not really trying so they let the man go some 12 hours later.Next problem you're the pimp. You found where the guy lives finally. You fight. You throw the serial killer on the floor and choke him for 5 seconds. What do you do next? If you're thinking  check if he's dead or keep choking for a few more seconds just to be sure  you can't be more wrong. Apparently what you do is you get up look to the side and stare at an aquarium some 56 metres away for some time. Just enough time for the serial killer to regain consciousness. I could go on. I refuse to believe that people in Korea are that stupid. The film is filled with one logical fallacy after another it's just horrendous. Everyone is an idiot incapable of logic thought everyone seems to have their heads in the clouds missing the point. The prosecutor who should be the one man most interested in catching a serial killer gives the following reasoning to let him go previously that evening a crazy person smeared feces on the city mayor and one of the policemen was unofficially held responsible for not preventing the event. Because the same policeman was in the room at the police station with the suspect serial killer the killer should be let go so as to not make it seem that the station is desperate to hide the feces smearing event. As in they're trying to blame the innocent man of the murders so the public would not focus on a cop who let his guard down which ended up in the politician being humiliated. Seriously? The only thing that saved it was the ending hence the three stars.".

The movie was critically acclaimed everywhere even internationally. Oh boy are we in for some surprises.The movie has a very dark tone and it instantly sucks the audience into the plot. The whole plot is simplistic while disturbing and sets up a good exposition. The Chaser starts out well paced and engaging but it starts to lose focus during the second act. A lot of the suspense is dropped and it becomes a flat investigation plot that runs in circles.Rather than external anxiety the majority of the suspense comes from the atmosphere itself. The movie is very suspenseful and horrific when it's supposed to be but it doesn't occur as often as it should. This is the reason why the climax didn't do it for me. The movie doesn't keep building and by the end it's just a violent dog fight.Most of the violence is not directly shown and is edited so that the audience can use their imagination. Points for that.The audience can relate to the characters and feel sympathetic throughout the film. The movie can be funny when it wants to be from time to time there are some cute moments here and there especially with the child actor accompanying the protagonist. But I just hate s like that when Korean movies try to add humor to a serious movie. All the characters are distinguishable at a first glimpse. The characters have a lot to work with which is why the actors do a pretty good job.The main problem with this movie is that the protagonist and the antagonist don't conflict throughout the movie as much they should. The antagonist doesn't propose much of a threat except in the exposition and the climax. He is rather a spectator and I felt that the interaction between the two was missing.The ending was subjectively bad for me. It's somewhat of a surprise and I like how it's clich free. However it all comes down to the point where I just don't care about anything anymore.It's not a bad film but it's certainly overrated. Hopefully the remake is better.".

	schema:headline " Stylish dark entertaining and depressing movie";
	schema:reviewBody "This was a very dark movie even by Korean standards. The movie starts of as a kind of black comedy. The protagonist is a pimp who has a hard time controlling his prostitutes. When one of his girls doesn't return he believes that someone is picking them up and selling them. He calls his former buddies in the police force that unfortunately is busy dealing with a case of someone throwing feces in the face of the city mayor. The comical mood changes when the perspective changes to one of his girls who finds herself in a very creepy house with an even more creepy customer. This is not about a typical chase where the protagonist has to track down and capture the antagonist. That all happens inside the first 15 minutes. This chase is about tracking down the girl and later about tracking down evidence in order to convict the antagonist. But it also becomes far more complicated than that. During this chase you are really feeling the frustrations that the main character is having. You get equally mad at the incompetent police force and you will feel a need to scream pick up the phone moron! or Noo don't go in there! on several occasions. The chase scenes are very well done and the actionfighting scenes are also very well done. They feel very realistic and are well choreographed and violent. Also the villain of this movie does not look like a villain. But you will still end up getting the chills every time he looks into the camera. The dialogue is harsh. It's mainly the protagonist throwing insults at the people he is encountering it can be comical at times but it can also be the exact opposite. No one is talking nice to each other in this movie.The cinematography is well done. It's a very dark toned movie but that doesn't bring down the beautiful shots of the city Seoul. It really helps set the correct mood for the movie.My only complaints would be that it becomes a little too long for it's own good and some of the scenes felt a bit forced in order to finish the storyline.".

	onyx:emotionText "This was a very dark movie even by Korean standards. The movie starts of as a kind of black comedy. The protagonist is a pimp who has a hard time controlling his prostitutes. When one of his girls doesn't return he believes that someone is picking them up and selling them. He calls his former buddies in the police force that unfortunately is busy dealing with a case of someone throwing feces in the face of the city mayor. The comical mood changes when the perspective changes to one of his girls who finds herself in a very creepy house with an even more creepy customer. This is not about a typical chase where the protagonist has to track down and capture the antagonist. That all happens inside the first 15 minutes. This chase is about tracking down the girl and later about tracking down evidence in order to convict the antagonist. But it also becomes far more complicated than that. During this chase you are really feeling the frustrations that the main character is having. You get equally mad at the incompetent police force and you will feel a need to scream pick up the phone moron! or Noo don't go in there! on several occasions. The chase scenes are very well done and the actionfighting scenes are also very well done. They feel very realistic and are well choreographed and violent. Also the villain of this movie does not look like a villain. But you will still end up getting the chills every time he looks into the camera. The dialogue is harsh.

I was asleep turned over at about 205 AM opened my eyes focused on the TV and the Korean actor Kim YoonSeok my TV watches me while I sleep and was HOOKED for the next 2 hours. I agree with other reviewers who feel that this film gives you the same gutpunches and edge of your seat thrills as Silence of the Lambs. The bad guy gives Hannibal Lector a run for his money. In one scene the little girls widemouth seemingly endless wail is still rocking my world. If you love intelligent realistic mostly nothings perfect thrilling cinema watch this film at your earliest convenience. I am now off to find what other work this firsttime director has done. He knocked it out of the park with this one.".
