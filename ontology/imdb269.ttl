	schema:reviewBody "Obviously looking to cash in on the vampire craze this film mixes together your typical slasher flick but with a vampiric twist without actually every using the word vampire. There is absolutely no substance to the movie whatsoever. It starts out typically enough...slightly post teens partying stripping and generally acting the way Jason Voorhees hated. But this doesn't make a bad horror movie its just the recipe for a slasher flick. You know the lead character has some sort of strange past that she doesn't remember so that's intriguing enough to stay with it. Everything feels like a slasher flick so if you are a fan like myself you stay with it right up until the monsters arrive. The monsters who are vampires show up at about the 45 minute mark and they cut through the cast in about five minutes give or take and when the slaughter is done you're bored...plain and simple. Blood and guts spew no unique kills just slaughter slaughter slaughter and then its over. You're left with the unravelling of the main characters past but by the time you simply don't care and the story is too weak to keep your interest.Courtney Hope is our scream queen with the murky past. She is decent nothing wrong with her performance. The script doesn't give her a lot to work with. The rest of the cast are literally a write off. They are fodder for the monsters and are all basically the same sex crazed drinking pot smoking postteenagers that get killed off in minutes. Saxon Trainor is the evil villainess and head of the vampires. She's okay but gets little actual screen time to establish herself as a great villain. Bruce Payne is the same vote. He starts good as the mysterious stranger that helps them and traps them but then he is given virtually nothing else to do.Prowl is a poor excuse for slapping together and churning out a horror flick. The story is so weak that it won't even please the most hardcore fans. Patrik Syversen has had some experience behind the camera but doesn't look like he's ever had a decent budget to work with. Prowl probably didn't have a huge budget but more than it should have had and it was underused. Really the fault of this clunker is in the hands of screenwriter Tim Tori. Its just poorly told and the pacing is completely off. This one should be skipped. The special effects are good the lead actress does well but the rest is a write off. 410".

There are some unexplained snippets  with ominous visions that include people chasing her and decomposing  bodies. Is something calling her or is it just the stress and mounting  pressure of cabin fever? She wants to move away and get her own  apartment in Chicago but first she has to get there with a deposit  before another prospective tenant. Her five friends tag along for the  road trip until right outside of the city limits their car breaks  down. As chance would have it a friendly semitruck driver pulls over  and they beg him to take them to the windy city but not before telling  him they want to snap his picture that one should ride up front and  of course their family should know who they're with for safety's sake.  Can never be too careful or can you?   They hang loose in the back cargo area by playing games drinking and  smoking drugs. Suddenly they take a nasty swerve and get thrown about.  They call the driver and he gives them the run around to stop which  makes them suspicious enough to call 911 though where they just  entered the signal doesn't go through. The driver backs in to a loading  area of an abandoned warehouse that looks like it used to be a  slaughterhouse. After the back door opens everything turns into chaos  when they step out into the factory with no visible way out and strange  creatures who fly through the air crawl on the walls and want to  consume their flesh sooner than they can rip it off. From then on out  it ends up being something like The Most Dangerous Game as these  victims are treated like not only lunch but challenging sport.  Prowl is a director's film first and foremost. It has a steady pacing  that keeps up a certain element of mystery without laying out a full  view of its blueprints as well as it manages to escalate the story to  different levels while still slowing down in a few areas to catch its  breath and explain. The dialogue also dances around and doesn't lay it  all out for the audience which gives it some challenge and curious  questions even after the credits roll. It manages to cover up its plot  holessometimes after the fact which makes you wonder about a few in  the meantimesuch as certain physicalities. It gradually unveils the  bloodcraving beasts from quick shots to extended which keeps a viewer  guessing as to what they are and what it all means whilethank the  horror Gods!doesn't fold in on itself and make what they have going  too cheesy. This is more intriguing and mysterious like a thriller than  it is continually scary like a horror though there are still a few  jumping shocks used to rile one's pulse even if not terrifying.

	schema:headline " Forced creativity is the best kind and what better way than with a low budget horror film!";
	schema:reviewBody "'PROWL' Three Stars Out of Five   Another entry in this year's 'After Dark HorrorFest'. This 'After Dark  Original' focuses on a group of youths who are attacked by blood  thirsty vampires in an abandoned slaughterhouse. It's directed by  Patrik Syversen and written by Tim Tori a couple rookie horror  filmmakers each with one other feature under their belt. The cast is  filled with fresh newbies as well with the exception of Bruce Payne  who you may remember as the bad guy in 'PASSENGER 57' as well as many  others. There isn't a lot to the film thanks to it's extremely low  budget but there is a fair amount of creative tricks and it's pretty  well made considering.  The film tells the story of a young woman named Amber Courtney Hope  who keeps having nightmarish visions and can't wait to get out of the  small town she's felt stuck in all her life. She convinces five of her  friends to help her move to Chicago. As soon as they get on the road  though their car dies. A passing by truck driver Payne stops to help  them out and the groups ends up hitching a ride in the back of his  semi. They soon learn there are packages of blood in the back of the  truck with them and the driver has taken a sudden detour. Next thing  they know they're trapped in an abandoned slaughterhouse and being  hunted by blood thirsty creatures.  I think the horror genre is the best for showing off creative talent  and skills on a low budget. A low budget actually forces more  creativity. This movie is pretty routine and unoriginal but it has some  nice new ways of telling the same old story. The characters are likable  and the acting is decent Payne shines. The directing is impressive  and the movie as a whole didn't make me sorry for spending 84 minutes  with it. It's a better than average splatter film probably enhanced by  it's low budget.".

	schema:reviewBody "After crashing down on a remote highway a group of friends find the towtruck at their rescue is delivering them to an abandoned warehouse to be of use for a group of bloodthirsty creatures in hunting training.This ending up becoming one of the biggest disappointments around and it really had no reason to do so. There's some exceptionally good times here with the story as it has an awesome premise that's incredibly original which is played off really nicely here. The growing realization of their predicament when they arrive in the back of the truck and the uncertainty of what's coming next give these scenes a really great sense of tension by not adhering to a set pattern. Even once they're released and can go look around in a creepy location filled with pretty chilling creatures there's some really fun times here as the relentless attacks by the voracious predators come of really fun as the numerous attacks throughout the facility and the surrounding buildings utilizing their speed and agility to launch surprise attacks on the group filled with boatloads of gore yet instead of playing with this as expected there's just not a lot of other good stuff here. Among the main flaws featured here is that we have way too much time in the beginning with the group of friends trying to establish their relationship together and none of this is appealing or enjoyable. That it's all so bland as they hand out and party at the house just goes nowhere and feels endless overall without any kind of real purpose being setup as a drama about needing to get out of the small town. Even more troubling is that after they arrive at the location the film's confrontations with the creatures within the abandoned building really tend to stop and start quite readily dragging itself out in the middle by going through their investigation of the area rather than dealing with the creature encounters. There's a really downbeat sense of energy here when this should be building up furiously during that point and becoming the film's highlight when instead it becomes a dull dreary mess. There's also the fact that even if the pacing during these scenes where fine the rapidfire editing during the action scenes that make it really indecipherable what's going on as the blurry creatures are quite hard to see as well further the rather troubling section. The other flaw to this is that the final twist at the end doesn't help matters by being so ludicrous and really ends up putting the film on a rather confusing note. Too bad as it doesn't need a whole lot of work to end up pretty awesome.Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language Brief Nudity and drug use.".

All characters are your typical teenagers without any background storyexcept for Amber and they die so quickly you won't even care for any of them. There is some gore in itand plenty of blood which was well done but because in many moments the movie is almost pitch black it doesn't impress like it could. Not much can be said about the vampires there is not many of them and makeup is rather weak. Cinematography is so so and I didn't liked the editing much. There is no suspense whatsoever action is kinda fast paced but still rather boring and ending is quick and extremely disappointing.I was expecting some good interesting movie but 'After Dark' series gets worse and worse every next year.".

Rather I enjoy a vampire movie that contains some lore and back story that explains why the vampires are there who they are and what they are up to in the movie.What I liked about this movie is that it appears as though a bunch of dumb teens are just dropped off in a wharehouse complex full of mindless zombie vampire automaton's ready and willing to consume the teenagers in a burst of blood and gore. In fact thats exactly what does happen to about half of them. Then some storyline appears when the head vampire shows up explains what she is doing here and why these vampires are all in one location. I really liked that some story was brought into the movie at this point. We learn that the mother vampire has collected vampire children that are orphans and placed them all in this wharehouse complex in the middle of nowhere as a means to train them how to kill how to survive and how to feed. This is fantastic! One by one the teens are killed off until we reach the final teen who for some reason has been able to survive the onslaught of vampire attacks. It is then that we learn that the protagonist is not only a survivor but someone special who has abilities and powers not dissimilar to the vampires themselves. We learn that her heritage is tied to that of the vampires and that she is 'special'Fantastic twist at the end! While this movie isn't a blockbuster go into it expecting a solid B vampire movie and if you enjoy these types of films then I think your hunger will be satisfied!".

So it was somewhat of a surprise to me when the nature of the movie was revealed. At first I thought it was a horror movie about the young people being abducted and then tortured by the truck driver. But the movie was more than just that.For a vampire movie then I will say that Prowl is a step up from the usual teenage nonsense that passes as vampire stuff these days in movies and in TV series. The vampires here are fierce feral and bloody not charming teenagers with sparkling skin and big hair. And that was a refreshing thing to see.However the movie wasn't particularly interesting or entertaining though sadly enough. The story was rather shallow and didn't even end in a proper way. That ending was the worst I have seen in a long time. And just who in their right minds gets into the back of a stranger's truck?The effects in the movie were alright though lots of blood to be seen. However most of the time the vampires are just moving about in a blur making it difficult to see them in great detail and that was a big nuisance actually.It was a surprise to see Bruce Payne playing Bernard in the movie and especially speaking with that odd accent. He was one of the bright moments of the movie. Saxon Trainor playing Veronica was also doing a good job and helped keep the movie afloat. I have never seen her before but she was good in Prowl. None of the young people in the movie were actually remarkable or memorable in any way.If you like vampire movies that step outside the norm that passes for being vampires in 2011 then you might want to check out Prowl just don't keep your hopes up because it is a shallow movie experience with only a few good moments along the way.".

I know thats a shallow thing to say but i couldn't believe it.Typical horror film with vampires but it works in a funky 80's sort of way. Reminded me a little bit of ghosts of mars when we finally came to the warehouse and the vampires were effective but not overused.The only bad thing about this movie was the twist at the end which was pointless and not needed and it sort of ruined the film a little. If they had made the film a little more macabre for the ending it would have been something.But they gave a character safe passage which didn't really work for me.".

I know thats a shallow thing to say but i couldn't believe it.Typical horror film with vampires but it works in a funky 80's sort of way. Reminded me a little bit of ghosts of mars when we finally came to the warehouse and the vampires were effective but not overused.The only bad thing about this movie was the twist at the end which was pointless and not needed and it sort of ruined the film a little. If they had made the film a little more macabre for the ending it would have been something.But they gave a character safe passage which didn't really work for me.";

Common wisdom among us was to stay away from public pools in the summer. I don't know if this helped but at least we felt it did.

The therapeutic stages are understandably emphasized along with a generally hopeful resolution that shouldfor a moviecome as no surprise. Kudoes to Ida Lupino and husband Collier Young for producing a film on what was then 1949 a sensitive subject. Note how the word 'polio' is hardly used in the screenplay. The movie's mostly well acted without going over the top. I suspect the romantic angle is played up for greater commercial appeal along with the alternate title 'Young Lovers'. After all how many folks would be attracted by a disease themed screenplay. All in all the human drama of dealing with affliction remains affecting though the scourge of polio has fortunately receded. In that sense the film still appeals over and above its time period.".

I love and admire Ida Lupino as an actress and a pioneer for women directors and I have seen quite a bit of her directing. She always tackled difficult subjects. However she never seemed to have much of a budget. Because of this I assume she couldn't afford to get really good actors.This is a powerful story written by Lupino and her thenhusband Collier Young. It's the story of Carol Sally Forrest a talented young dancer who works with Guy Keefe Brasselle. They're not only dance partners but they're in love as well. Carol becomes ill and it turns out that she has polio. She is moved to a facility for rehab.I was too young to know the full impact of polio the worst of it was when I was very small. I certainly did know people who had it and I know how frightening it was. Since no one was sure how it was contracted I remember a woman in an AIDS documentary talking about people she knew good Christians as she called them who would leave food at the front door of a victim's family.The problem I had with this film was the acting which I consider abominable for the most part. Sally Forrest a pretty young woman was misdirected in the role and comes off as unpleasant. One of course understands anger and selfpity but she was absolutely hateful for most of the movie. And one minute she would be screaming at a fellow victim Len Hugh O'Brian and then in the next scene she'd be friendly.Keefe Brasselle could never act and if what I know of him is correct had the success he did thanks to mob connections. Apparently the President of CBS Television claimed he was forced by the mob to give Brasselle three TV series without a pilot or script. They all flopped and a lawsuit followed as well as the president being ousted. Anyway he's not very good and when he begs Carol Be a woman for me I need you as she's sitting there with polio one wonders if she maybe needed something too and possibly the script needed a rewrite.What is interesting is to see the therapy that polio patients had and the support and encouragement. The end of this film was very touching demonstrating that with a few tweaks it could have been good and a tearjerker. Unfortunately I just couldn't warm up to Carol until close to the end.Hugh O'Brian here has an early role. He and I are from the same home town and about 15 years ago I interviewed him. At a Hollywood Museum opening a year ago I saw a man in a wheelchair who looked like a mountain man  long gray hair and gray beard  and I said to the person I was with I think that's Hugh O'Brian. No one believed me. I spoke with him. He was 90 then still had all his marbles was very funny and completely deaf.".

The movie starts with the two dancing at a typical venue Supper Club. After words a picturesque beach front scene as Carol is toweling down from an earlier midnight swim in the Pacific.They discus how there's nothing stopping them now with their act taking off to new heights.Marriage at this point is eminent and you wonder where this story is heading. The following day apparently Carol got up and walked to her studio in full leotards yet she looked lethargic lying on the floor as her fianc oblivious to her illness is practicing on the piano. Finally he turns around and see's she is feverish and weak as he wraps her in a blanket and it's off to the doctor for further examination.The prognosis is Polio the damaging viral illness which affects the nervous system and causing temporary or permanent damage to limbs the legs especially in Carol's case. Guy despite the hopeless situation is confident to get a job and is still determined to wed his afflicted bride to be as the feverish Carol lie hopelessly in bed. For Carol her legs were affected the most and rehab was the only way out of her quagmire. Guy finds work as a realtor with no prospects but does develop a love interest. Carol on the other hand is adjusting to her new surroundings at the center. You as the viewer hang on in this hopeless situation as Director Ida Lupino captures the difficulties of change in our leading characters. Choreography comes into play as well with a square dance the likes you'll never see. Well written story by Ida Lupino and screenplay by Collier Young as our misplaced lovers face enviable changes and adjust and move onward in a different direction. Sally forest who portrays crippled Carol obviously visited polio afflicted people and studied their mannerisms. Keefe Brassele who plays the leading man appeared to be on the goofy side and always seemed to be a little off.I literately took a double take and thought I was looking at Carl Switzer Alfalfa.The highest praises to Writer Director Ida Lupino for delving into dark post war subjects. As my Grandma Sadie used to say If you have your health you have everything.".

Guy despite the hopeless situation is confident to get a job and is still determined to wed his afflicted bride to be as the feverish Carol lie hopelessly in bed. For Carol her legs were affected the most and rehab was the only way out of her quagmire. Guy finds work as a realtor with no prospects but does develop a love interest. Carol on the other hand is adjusting to her new surroundings at the center. You as the viewer hang on in this hopeless situation as Director Ida Lupino captures the difficulties of change in our leading characters. Choreography comes into play as well with a square dance the likes you'll never see. Well written story by Ida Lupino and screenplay by Collier Young as our misplaced lovers face enviable changes and adjust and move onward in a different direction. Sally forest who portrays crippled Carol obviously visited polio afflicted people and studied their mannerisms. Keefe Brassele who plays the leading man appeared to be on the goofy side and always seemed to be a little off.I literately took a double take and thought I was looking at Carl Switzer Alfalfa.The highest praises to Writer Director Ida Lupino for delving into dark post war subjects. As my Grandma Sadie used to say If you have your health you have everything.";

	schema:reviewBody "In Never Fear Guy and Carol are struggling dancing partners. But finally after a performance that he choreographed their agent gets them a twoweek engagement at a major night club. They now have enough money to get married which is something she has been hoping for. In Outrage 1950 another movie written and directed by Ida Lupino that has a similar structure Ann and Jim are also in love. When Jim gets a raise he tells Ann they now have enough money to get married something she has been hoping for.Then tragedy strikes and the woman in each of these movies ends up regarding herself as damaged goods. In Never Fear Carol is stricken with polio. Guy still wants to marry Carol but she pushes him away telling him she won't marry him because things would never be the same. In part she does not want Guy to marry her out of pity but she also has lost her sex drive. She does not say this explicitly this was 1949 after all but much later in the movie she makes a remark about how she finally feels like a woman again. Note when the doctor offers Carol a cigarette as she lies in bed she refuses the offer. This is taken as a sign that she is depressed. Later when she starts smoking again this indicates that she is getting better psychologically. In Outrage Jim still wants to marry Ann but she pushes him away. In part she tells him he would never be able to forget that she had been raped but she also now regards sex as something repulsive.In Never Fear Carol goes to a hospital and then to an institution for therapy. There she meets Len played by Hugh O'Brian who has an even more severe case of polio than Carol. He is a kind of spiritual figure. At one point the doctor that heads the institution says that Len has a special power. In Outrage Ann runs away from home without telling Jim or her parents where she is going. She collapses on the side of the road and is rescued by Doc so called because he is a reverend. He takes her to a house owned by a married couple he is friends with and they take her in.In Never Fear Guy keeps coming around trying to get Carol to marry him. He has been trying to make a go of it selling houses but she tells him to forget about her to find himself another dancing partner. They have a bitter argument and do not see each other for a long time. Eventually Carol begins to feel better about herself and she has reached the point where she is able to walk with crutches. She writes him a letter hoping to make amends. He shows up at her birthday party with flowers. At first she thinks they will be able to get married after all but then he tells her that he took her advice. He has another dancing partner and they will be performing in Las Vegas soon which is why he cannot stay long. After he leaves she throws herself at Len on the rebound telling him they are alike and that they will be good for each other it is here she makes the remark about feeling like a woman again. But Len knows she still loves Guy. He tells her that she is just looking for someone to be comfortable with and that is not enough for marriage. In Outrage we never see Jim again because he does not know where Ann is. She hopes that Doc will marry her but Doc knows that she still loves Jim and that they must go their separate ways.In Never Fear when the day finally arrives for Carol to leave the institution she has progressed to the point where she only needs a cane. As she walks down the street she is apprehensive about facing the world alone except for her father with whom she will be living for a while. But then Guy shows up with flowers. It is clear that they will get married and live happily ever after. In Outrage a man starts making advances to Ann at a picnic and she goes all flashback thinking he is the man who raped her. She hits him with a wrench. It puts him in the hospital and she goes to jail. However the man does not want to press charges and the judge agrees to let Ann go provided she receives psychiatric care for a year. In other words Ann receives professional care same as Carol only hers is delayed. Doc puts Ann on a bus back to her home where Jim and her parents are waiting for her. And in case you were wondering the rapist was caught.In one sense the ending of Never Fear was not farfetched. People who don't dance tend to assume that dancing partners are lovers but dancers know that very often they are not. So Carol would not have had any reason to feel jealous about Guy and his new dancing partner. However I still did not like what comes across as an artificial tackedon happy ending. I would have preferred that Carol leave the institution knowing that she will have to face the world alone except for the support her father could give her at least for a while. It would have given the movie a tougher harder edge. In fact I was a little bothered by the way the movie portrayed Carol's attitude as wrongheaded. If she wanted to make a clean break with her past that was her business. In Outrage on the other hand the happy ending seemed reasonable and natural.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ida Lupino directed this story of Sally Forrest a dancer who contracts polio and winds up doing a long stretch in a rehabilitation facility. It seems to be one of a spate of movies in the last half of the 1940s that dealt with physical disability some better than others. The Men was far more dramatic and so was the blinded John Garfield in Pride of the Marines. The plight of one of the characters in The Best Years of Our Lives was heartbreaking.Along with other studies of disabilities like Bright Victory Never Fear is rather routine. It takes us through the varying degrees of acceptance of the disability and shows us what the process of rehabilitation and physical therapy look like. It's not a bad film. It's just that it was one example out of many and some of the others are better done. We're looking here at a movie with animated points of view. It's largely predictable and the performances  again not shameful  just pedestrian. And the central figure is a woman instead of a wounded veteran. The principal idea behind her recovery is a clich. Therapy doesn't work unless you FIGHT for it to work. You must WANT to recover. You have to stop feeling sorry for yourself. That takes us into free will and a bit beyond which is unfamiliar territory for me.Sally Forrest is an attractive actress and appears to have had some dance training. Her onscreen career was that of a dancer who was a rising star before being struck down by the virus. As her fianc Keefe Brasselle hits his marks and projects the proper emotions. Hugh O'Brian is on hand as another patient to provide reassurance. Confined to a wheelchair he struts less than usual.Ida Lupino's direction is functional but sometimes it's hard to tell what's going on. At one point Forrest collapses emotionally and shouts at Brasselle I'm a CRIPPLE! She and her lover then have an angry exchange and Lupino has framed Brasselle with a lifesized statue of Pan or Bacchus  or sometimes only its mysterious shadow  behind him. The image is marked and repeated. If the director was getting at something it eluded me.Polio was a terrible disease. President Franklin D. Roosevelt literally could not walk. Photos always show him seated or holding someone's arm. Both of his legs were encased in steel braces and he imitated walking by swinging his right and left hips forward one at a time the momentum carrying each leg with it. There was a massive outbreak in the US as recently as 1952 and it left some dead and the rest disabled to some degree. Due to considerable effort by WHO and The March of Dimes Jonas Salk developed the first vaccine which virtually eliminated the disease in all but a few nations. Salk refused to patent his discovery. He gave the cure to the rest of the world free of charge. Where are the altruists of today?".

Mon who becomes the team leader was a very talented player who constantly failed to be selected for various teams because he was gay. Jung Mon's best friend also experienced the same treatment but was always more optimistic about things. Their chance comes when Coach Bee is selected to put together a winning team and she announces that the team will be open for all to tryout. But when the coach selects both Jung and Mon to be on the team some of the more macho players resign in protest. In order to form a team the coach asks Mon to find a few of his friends to join the team. They select Nong a gay sergeant in the army Pia the transsexual star of a cabaret show and Wit whose parents don't know that their only son is gay.";

The Iron Ladies truly delivers on all accounts.The true story of a Thai volleyball team made up mostly of gay men drag queens and transgendered women katoueys that wins the men's national championship The Iron Ladies is sassy funny and extraordinary.Crossdressing Jung Chaicharn Nimpulsawasdi makeup loving soldier Nong Giorgio Maiocchi and transsexual cabaret star Pia Kokkorn Benjathikoon are the standouts in this hilarious cast of characters who unite together to overcome the adversity they face on a daily basis and take Thailand by storm. Shiriohana Hongsopon gives probably the best performance as Coach Bee the glue that holds the often hottempered and always effervescent team together.As we see the Iron Ladies through to the national finals all the characters receive a touch of humanity from each other and rally together to reach the top. This hilarious romp will keep you laughing and it will definitely be a film you will never forget! For it's fantastic script three stars...the amazing acting one more star...and because it's a movie you'll want to see again and again one more. 5 stars out of 5!".

The Iron Ladies truly delivers on all accounts.The true story of a Thai volleyball team made up mostly of gay men drag queens and transgendered women katoueys that wins the men's national championship The Iron Ladies is sassy funny and extraordinary.Crossdressing Jung Chaicharn Nimpulsawasdi makeup loving soldier Nong Giorgio Maiocchi and transsexual cabaret star Pia Kokkorn Benjathikoon are the standouts in this hilarious cast of characters who unite together to overcome the adversity they face on a daily basis and take Thailand by storm. Shiriohana Hongsopon gives probably the best performance as Coach Bee the glue that holds the often hottempered and always effervescent team together.As we see the Iron Ladies through to the national finals all the characters receive a touch of humanity from each other and rally together to reach the top. This hilarious romp will keep you laughing and it will definitely be a film you will never forget! For it's fantastic script three stars...the amazing acting one more star...and because it's a movie you'll want to see again and again one more. 5 stars out of 5!";

Representing its district and now competing at the national level they are clearly face down at odds. In spite of this and their individual personal issues they strive for championships and national recognition creating an Asian phenomenon on the way.The film is very Hollywoodslick but at the same time very Asian. It is a unique picture of very unconventional sportsmen battling bigotry on and off the court. IRON LADIES breathes new life into both the screwball comedy and the rootforthe underdog sports movie.

It pretty much revolves around a bunch of drag queen playing volleyball  entering competitionsportsman ship team work relationship between transsexuals and real men sexual discrimination. You will enjoy this movie from the start till the end although sometimes in some scenes the director didnt really make it clear why on earth that particular scenes is needed for. The actors and actresses made a good job as drag queen and gay people considering the fact that all of them except one claimed to be straight and most of them are in 'straight relationship' and also you'll get to learn and see the wonders or Thailand and also the way they made a movie about volleyball in thailand considering that Volleyball is not a popular sports in Thailand yet this movie still manage to emerged as the 2nd highest grossing movie ever in Thailand behind the movie NangNak.

	schema:reviewBody "The Iron Ladies Satree Lek is just one of those type of comedies that will stick with you once you've seen it for the first time. It is a wonderful underdog story.The story is about a team of gay transsexual and ladyboys participating in the 1996 Thai national championship volleyball. They participate against all odds having everything stacked against them from a male dominated sport narrowminded and sexist players on other teams and even on the volleyball committee.Despite this being a comedy there there aren't a lot of scenes that will have you spilling your drink from laughing but there is in turn heaps of situations that will make you smile and feel good. It is indeed a comedy about acceptance and overcoming odds even when stacked against you. And being based on an actual real story just makes it all the more better and has a bigger impact.The characters in the movie are lovable funny and very real. And they are so well portrayed by the cast that you just delve right into the story the characters and their problems successes and failures right away.I remember watching this movie back in the mid2K's approximately and found it enjoyable back then. And having finally gotten around to purchasing both part 1 and 2 from Amazon in 2013 it was indeed a joyous revisit to the movie and I can honestly say that I am looking forward to watching part 2.The Iron Ladies is well worth a watch for many reason be it for the love of Asian cinema be it for the love and support of gayslesbianstransgendered everywhere be it for the love of volleyball be it for the love of a great movie be it for the love of great acting the list just goes on and on.Thumbs up from this reviewer and a definite 7 out of 10 star rating.".

Chuckle as the 'ladies' make it oh so easy to laugh at rather than with a gay population.The telling subtitle 'Are you gay because you're not a real man or are you gay because you wish you were a woman' to that effect is the crux of the movie. There is no honest attempt to examine the range of sexuality and celebrate gay differentness in myriad of colours. Here it's a shrill highpitched pink.Thank God for the dignified acting by Hangsopon as the Coach  truly inspired acting and a pivotal role that raises this film from the depths of total stereotype. Phohklee as Chai and Buranapansit as Wit give good performances. Even two dimensional acting is better than one dimensional acting and that's the kindest that can be said for most.In all a really disappointing film. 12 out of 4".

	schema:reviewBody "When he fails to make the volleyball team Mon suspects it is because he is gay  a position not helped by the very loud presence of his drag queen boyfriend Jung. They sign up for the local state team and are good enough for new coach Bee to pick them alongside the usual tall butch players. However captain Mann refuses to play with fags and quits the team  taking all the strongest players with him. Without a squad to draw from Bee listens to Mon's suggestion that they rebuild the team from their friends  who mostly happen to be gay like them.With the sort of plot that you don't associate with the Thailand market I thought this was worth a look despite the fact that I prefer Thai films with minimal dialogue simply because I find it a rather grating language to have to listen to for any length of time. Regardless I quite enjoyed it although you should know that it is neither as original nor as funny as some of the other reviewers seem to think it is. The plot is the usual underdogs sports story with the twist of the gay characters  the latter being the main thrust of the film as there is actually quite few big game moments on the way to the climax. Part of the problem for me is that most of the characters never went beyond the level of caricature and it was only one or two scenes where I felt the film had something interesting to say or show me. For the rest of it the queen clichs are enjoyable enough but did occasionally grate on me. The to thine own self be true stuff is OK but hardly that clever or different  par for the genre course really all this film has done is put makeup on it to make it appear a bit fresher.In terms of laughs the film is amusing but rarely hilarious. This may be partly down to me not liking the queen stereotypes that much but I think it is mostly down to the material not being that strong. The cast are pretty good regardless and at least seem to be having fun but I think the lack of a big game moment might be something to do with the majority of them not actually being able to play. They help the comedy be consistent at least with their delivery and it is not their fault if the film rarely goes deeper than that.So an amusing genre film then but not a great deal more than that. The story and characters are serviceable without the beauty or touching stuff that the genre delivered in pieces such as Babe. Different enough to be worth a look but just don't expect it to be any different from American be yourself and sports underdog genreclich films just because it comes from Thailand.".

It completely changed the point of the movie. In the novel the focus was upon the relationship between the two characters Alan Breck and David Balfour how they liked each other despite their severe political differences and how they came to respect each other as well.The addition of the girl just made it into a trite coming of age romance with Alan Breck turning into hardly more than a colorful sidekick.I also feel that Dan O'Herlihy played Alan Breck as an entirely too genteel a gentleman. Peter Finch captured him much more closely in the Disney film of 1960. Alan Breck was a gentleman yes but also a wild highlander with none of the daintiness affected by O'Herlihy.".

On the downside the fight scenes are very badly choreographed and I wonder why everyone in Scotland uses the same variety of sword whether they're sailors soldiers of the French king or elderly landowners all with approximately equal levels of competence  save O'Herlihy who although he looks to be at the same level can defeat three other men.The story is one that has been remade many times from a major production by the Edison in 1917 to a TV movie in 2005. Stevenson basically basically invented the Young Adult Novel with this and TREASURE ISLAND and his youthful heroes strong stories and exciting adventures have made him a favorite for moviemakers. Although there are better versions of this story I prefer the superbly cast Disney version there's little to complain of in this one  I have in my usual manner already done so  and MacDowall's performance is perfect.".

Our old friend Roland Winters much more animated than usual hands in a good account of Captain Hoseason while Jeff Corey Houseley Stevenson Alex Frazer and Olaf Hytten submit admirable portraits of manysided villainy. The scriptwriter W. Scott Darling is to be commended for preserving so much of Stevenson's narrative and even his dialogue.

	schema:headline " Mustviewing just to begin to understand apartheid's legacy";
	schema:reviewBody "CRY FREEDOM is an excellent primer for those wanting an overview of apartheid's cruelty in just a couple of hours. Famed director Richard Attenborough GANDHI is certainly no stranger to the genre and the collaboration of the reallife Mr. and Mrs. Woods the main white characters in their book and in this film lends further authenticity to CRY FREEDOM. The video now in release actually runs a little over 2 and a half hours since 23 minutes of extra footage was inserted to make it a two part TV miniseries after the film's initial theatrical release. While the added length serves to heighten the film's forgivable flaws uneven character development and blanket stereotyping in particular another possible flaw the insistence on the white characters' fate over that of the African ones may work out as a strength. Viewing CRYING FREEDOM as a politically and historically educational film as I think it should over its artistic merits the story is one which black Africans know only too well though the younger generation may now need to see it on film for full impact. It is the whites who have always been the film's and the book's target audience hopefully driving them to change. Now twelve years after the movie's production CRY FREEDOM is in many ways a more interesting film to watch. Almost ten years after black majority rule has been at least theorically in place 1987's CRY FREEDOM's ideals remain by and large unrealized. It therefore remains as imperative as ever for white South Africans particularly the younger ones who have only heard of these actions to see it and absorb the film's messages. In total contrast to American slavery and the Jewish Holocaust's exposure South Africans' struggles have been told by a mere two or three stories CRY FREEDOM CRY THE BELOVED COUNTRY OK Count it twice if you include the remake and SARAFINA did I miss one?. All three dramas also clumsily feature American and British actors in both the white and black roles. Not one South African actor has played a major role white coloured Indian or Black!. And yes I did miss another international South African drama MANDELA and DEKLERK. Though this also highly recommended biopic was released after black majority rule was instituted MANDELA was played by a Black American Sidney Poitier who also starred in the original S.A.themed CRY THE BELOVED COUNTRY while the Afrikaner DeKlerk was played by a bald very British Michael Caine a good performance if you can dismiss that the very essence of Afrikanerdom is vehement antiBritish feelings. Until local SABC TV and African films start dealing with their own legacy CRY FREEDOM is about as authentic as you'll get. As villified as the whites particularly the Afrikaners are portrayed in the film any observant noncasual visitor to South Africa even now in 1999 not to mention 1977 when CRY FREEDOM takes place will generally find white's attitudes towards blacks restrained even understated. Looking at CRY FREEDOM in hindsight it is amazing that reconciliation can take place at all and it is. But CRY FREEDOM at time shows not much has really changed in many people's minds yet and that the  Black Africans' goal to FREEDOM and reconciliation is still ongoing. This is why if you're a novice to the situation CRY FREEDOM is your best introduction.".

	onyx:emotionText "CRY FREEDOM is an excellent primer for those wanting an overview of apartheid's cruelty in just a couple of hours. Famed director Richard Attenborough GANDHI is certainly no stranger to the genre and the collaboration of the reallife Mr. and Mrs. Woods the main white characters in their book and in this film lends further authenticity to CRY FREEDOM. The video now in release actually runs a little over 2 and a half hours since 23 minutes of extra footage was inserted to make it a two part TV miniseries after the film's initial theatrical release. While the added length serves to heighten the film's forgivable flaws uneven character development and blanket stereotyping in particular another possible flaw the insistence on the white characters' fate over that of the African ones may work out as a strength. Viewing CRYING FREEDOM as a politically and historically educational film as I think it should over its artistic merits the story is one which black Africans know only too well though the younger generation may now need to see it on film for full impact. It is the whites who have always been the film's and the book's target audience hopefully driving them to change. Now twelve years after the movie's production CRY FREEDOM is in many ways a more interesting film to watch. Almost ten years after black majority rule has been at least theorically in place 1987's CRY FREEDOM's ideals remain by and large unrealized. It therefore remains as imperative as ever for white South Africans particularly the younger ones who have only heard of these actions to see it and absorb the film's messages. In total contrast to American slavery and the Jewish Holocaust's exposure South Africans' struggles have been told by a mere two or three stories CRY FREEDOM CRY THE BELOVED COUNTRY OK Count it twice if you include the remake and SARAFINA did I miss one?. All three dramas also clumsily feature American and British actors in both the white and black roles. Not one South African actor has played a major role white coloured Indian or Black!. And yes I did miss another international South African drama MANDELA and DEKLERK. Though this also highly recommended biopic was released after black majority rule was instituted MANDELA was played by a Black American Sidney Poitier who also starred in the original S.A.themed CRY THE BELOVED COUNTRY while the Afrikaner DeKlerk was played by a bald very British Michael Caine a good performance if you can dismiss that the very essence of Afrikanerdom is vehement antiBritish feelings. Until local SABC TV and African films start dealing with their own legacy CRY FREEDOM is about as authentic as you'll get. As villified as the whites particularly the Afrikaners are portrayed in the film any observant noncasual visitor to South Africa even now in 1999 not to mention 1977 when CRY FREEDOM takes place will generally find white's attitudes towards blacks restrained even understated. Looking at CRY FREEDOM in hindsight it is amazing that reconciliation can take place at all and it is.

The film is seen with the eyes of Donald Woods his friend journalist who quit the country with his family for being too close to the black battles...The first part of the film is really excellent.

The second part when Woods Kline organizes the run of his family from South Africa becomes more conventional and shot in a very Hollywood style although the film is British!.

	schema:reviewBody "Richard Attenborough is a director whose name is synonymous with the Academy Award winning 'Gandhi' back in '83. I didn't know of any other work of his till i recently came across 'Cry Freedom' released back in 1987. While it may not have been as popular as his Gandhi it is every bit as gripping if not more and was released when South Africa still had not got rid of the shackles of apartheid. While most movies on social issues come out after the event had happened i guess this one released during the time.The story is based on real life characters and events. The book on which the movie was based was written by Donald Woods Kevin Kline a journalist who used to work in South Africa until the end of the seventies. It traces the origins of Woods friendship with the charismatic black leader Steve Biko who is wonderfully portrayed by Denzel Washington. I cannot imagine a better choice for the role. Washington exudes a natural charm and screen presence which Biko's character required.While initially Woods was against what he felt was black racism being spread by Biko after meeting the man he could not help being drawn into his struggles and ideas. The bond between them grows stronger and Woods and his family realise and become more sensitive to the plight of the people Biko represents.However finally tragedy strikes and Woods must now concentrate on escaping from South Africa with his book so that he can get it published and let the outside world know what is going on. The second half of the movie is a gripping tale of his escape from South Africa along with his family and will keep you on tenterhooks.There are some deliciously humorous dialogues too. The scene between Biko and the lawyer in the courtroom is an example.Lawyer Do you advocate violence? Biko I advocate a confrontation. Lawyer Well isn't that violence Mr. Biko? Biko Not necessarily. You and I are having a confrontation now but i don't see any violence.However there are moments that bring you back to the horrors that pervaded the country before better sense prevailed. The scene where the army opens fire on a protest by school children is gut wrenching and heartbreaking.This is definitely a must watch. I would suggest those not familiar with Attenborough's work do take time out for this. There are movies which make a lot of money. And there are movies which make lives. I would any day prefer the latter.".

'Cry Freedom' is set in the late 1970s during the apartheid era of South Africa and centers around the reallife events involving black activist Steve Biko and his friend Donald Woods who initially finds him destructive and attempts to understand his way of life.'Cry Freedom' delves into the ideas of discrimination political corruption and the repercussions of violence. Based on a pair of books by journalist Donald Woods this humantragedy is wonderfully written by John Briley. Also the dialogue at places give you gooseflesh. Sure the writing does drag a bit but that doesn't effect it's impact.Richard Attenborough knows what he's making. He knows this isn't an easy story to make. But the veteran directs each frame with flourish. Cinematography by Ronnie Taylor is excellent. Editing  Art Design are perfect.PerformanceWise Denzel Washington is fantastic as Steve Biko. He delivers a performance that easily ranks amongst his finest works to date. Kevin Kline as Donald Woods on the otherhand is restrained all through. Not once does he go over the top. Penelope Wilton is effective. Kevin McNally scores. Others lend good support.On the whole 'Cry Freedom' is a terrific film that overshadows it's flaws cleverly. Don't miss this one!".

	schema:reviewBody "What a movie! I never imagined Richard Attenborough could have such a movie in him. Gandhi has always left me indifferent apart from Ben Kingsley's performance and I never considered Attenborough a particularly good filmmaker. But Cry Freedom held my interest like few movies have in recent times. It's an exciting mesmerizing political movie with great performances by Kevin Kline and a young Denzel Washington.Kline plays Donald Woods a South Africa newspaper editor who befriends the civil rights activist Steve Biko. It starts as a difficult friendship for Woods sees Biko as a black supremacist preaching hatred against whites. But Biko with his kind words upbeat attitude and complete transparency wins over Woods and introduces him to a reality about Apartheid that Woods knew nothing about.Biko is a decent lawabiding citizen who altruistically stands up against all prejudice and the system that keeps down his people. One night coming from an illegal meeting he's arrested and beaten to death. The authorities try to hush up the matter because Biko has become a huge personality in South Africa. But through the efforts of Woods the truth comes out. But what should be a triumph only becomes a nightmare as Woods and his family become targets for the secret police.This movie has an interesting structure. It has in fact two narratives first it narrates the life and death of Biko. It's an amazing first half completely dominated by the charisma of Washington in what may be his greatest performance yet.The second half no less interesting narrates Woods attempt to escape from South Africa to publish a book about Biko. Woods has become an enemy of state a banned person which means he can't meet people or leave his country. Plus he's constantly spied by the police. Kevin Kline gives a great performance in this second half too.Although the first half is quite straightforward the second does interesting things with editing by giving flashbacks of Biko and of events that show the repression against the black South Africans. Some may argue this is to make it more interesting but for me the second half just as captivating as Woods and his family devise a bold plan to escape South Africa.The last minutes were so heartbreaking I was in tears. George Fenton and Jonas Gwangwa's score certainly had something to do with it. Although I've never been much of a fan of Fenton cannot stand his Gandhi score I do think the score for Cry Freedom is one of the most beautiful ever composed for cinema. The movie thanks to the music married to the powerful images at times reached incredible peaks of emotion.Cry Freedom is definitely not a movie just to watch because of Denzel Washington. This is a movie to be cherished in its entirety. Acting writing music editing cinematography come together in a perfect synthesis to create an ode to the power of the human spirit. This movie deserve a place alongside movies like The Pianist Life Is beautiful and The Shawshank Redemption.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a brilliant film. I will admit it is very ambitious with the subject matter. At a little over two and a half hours it is a very long film too. But neither of these pointers are flaws in any way. Cry Freedom despite the minor flaws it may have is a powerful moving and compelling film about the story of the black activist Steve Biko in his struggles to awaken South Africa to the horrors of the apartheid. It is true that the first half is stronger than the second in terms of emotional impact. People have also complained that the film suffers from too much Woods not enough Biko. I may be wrong but although it is Biko's story it is told in the perspective of Woods so Woods is an important character in conveying Biko's story to the world.Cry Freedom visually looks amazing. With the showstopping cinematography and the stunning South African scenery it was a visual feast. The opening scenes especially were brilliantly shot. George Fenton's music brought real dramatic weight to most scenes. It was subtle in scenes in the second half but stirring and dramatic in the crowd scenes. The script was of exceptional quality the courtroom scenes with Biko were enough to really make you think wow this is real quality stuff. The first half with Biko as the main focus constantly had something to feel emotional about whether it was the police's attack of the South African citizens or Biko's death. The second half entirely about Donald Woods carries less of an emotional punch but is compensated by how it is shot performed and written. And there are parts that are genuinely suspenseful as well. The performances were exceptional from the entire cast from the most minor character to the two leads there wasn't a single bad performance. Regardless of the accents that is but it is forgiven so easily by how much the performances draw you in. Denzel Washington in one of his more understated performances gives a truly compelling performance as Biko and Kevin Kline shows that he can be as good at drama as he is at comedy for he gave a suitably subtle performance to match that of Washington's. And the two men's chemistry is believable and never strikes a false note. Penelope Wilton is lovely as Donald's wife Wendy and she is a great actress anyway. Out the supporting performances and there may be some bias two stood out for me. One was Timothy West who relishes his role as Captain DeWet. The other was the ever exceptional John Thaw in a brilliantly chilling cameorole as Kruger. Lord Richard Attenborough's direction is focused and constantly sensitive as usual.Overall a truly wonderful film. Ambitious and long it is but never ceases to be compelling powerful and achingly moving. A definite winner from Lord Richard Attenborough and worthy of a lot more praise. 1010 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "When this film appeared in 1987 it was considered very liberal and enlightened. However when seen today I could easily see someone criticizing the film for being paternalisticand the same could be said for films like A Dry White Season and even the recent Bang Bang Club made in South Africa itself only two years ago. After all when Hollywood did a film about the apartheid era it seemed to always feature a white guy in the lead and in the films whites seemed to need to help rescue the poor oppressed blacksand even Bang Bang Club to a degree. While the stories ARE true framing the stories these ways is a bit sad and I would love to see films that were about the black leaders in the fight for freedom. Despite this legitimate complaint the film should not be written off as it's an important and true story. And for that matter it's quite compelling.The film begins with Steven Biko Denzel Washington approaching the liberal white reporter Donald Woods Kevin Klein. While Woods thinks he's enlightened he is a supporter of the white regime and is blind to some of the evils of apartheid. Over time Biko is able to win over Woodsand Woods is introduced to black society within the township of Soweto. Later after incurring the wrath of the white government Biko is arrested and beaten to death. However the death was written off as just some accident and Woods is determined to get out of the country and expose the brutality of the South African regime. The problem is they are not about to just let him leave. So Woods and his family come up with a very daring plana plan that takes half the film. As a sort of epilogue the film ends with the bloody police attack on student protests in 1977ending with over 700 children being shot to death. The ending is very fitting and quite moving.In general I like the film. I cannot comment however on the accents done by Klein and WashingtonI am an American who isn't attuned to such things. But the acting is good the film VERY compelling and it leaves you feeling raw at the end. My only complaint other than paternalism is the odd device of having Biko's character seeming to come to life during the film in flashback scenes or to dialog with Woodseven though he was 100 dead. Odd that's for sure.By the way if you are a geek and I guess this means I am look for Nick Tate near the very end playing a pilot. He also played a pilot on Space 1999and was a regular on the series in case his face is familiar to you.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a film that everyone should watch. Quite apart from raising hugely important points while South Africa is on the road to recovery there are still many countries in similar situations now it is superbly directed while Denzel Washington gives in my opinion the best performance in his career so far. Kline also gives a good performance although perhaps not as stunning as Washington's. John Thaw also puts in a good turn as the Chief of Police.There are so many possible areas where a film on apartheid could fall down but all of these have been avoided. It would be easy to simply portray white people as the bad guys and black people as the good guys but Attenborough has not done this. Sure there were some white characters who seemed inherently evil such as the Captain at the Soweto uprising but to add extra dimensions to all the characters would make the film unbearably long. Some people complain about the length of the film as it is but I think it needs the whole two and a half hours to tell the whole story for it really is an incredible one.The best scene in the film is that of Steve Biko's funeral. When the whole crowd begins to sing the South African national anthem it is probably one of if not the most moving scenes I have seen.If you haven't seen this film already watch it.

	onyx:emotionText "This is a film that everyone should watch. Quite apart from raising hugely important points while South Africa is on the road to recovery there are still many countries in similar situations now it is superbly directed while Denzel Washington gives in my opinion the best performance in his career so far. Kline also gives a good performance although perhaps not as stunning as Washington's. John Thaw also puts in a good turn as the Chief of Police.There are so many possible areas where a film on apartheid could fall down but all of these have been avoided. It would be easy to simply portray white people as the bad guys and black people as the good guys but Attenborough has not done this. Sure there were some white characters who seemed inherently evil such as the Captain at the Soweto uprising but to add extra dimensions to all the characters would make the film unbearably long. Some people complain about the length of the film as it is but I think it needs the whole two and a half hours to tell the whole story for it really is an incredible one.The best scene in the film is that of Steve Biko's funeral. When the whole crowd begins to sing the South African national anthem it is probably one of if not the most moving scenes I have seen.If you haven't seen this film already watch it. It may not be comfortable viewing but it's certainly worth it.";

William Powell would hit his stride a few years after this film in The Thin Man.

He is William Powell the most debonair leading man of the 30's.  She is Kay Francis the best dressed woman of the 30's.  They are both very attractive yet doomed.Such is the basic storyline for this wonderful drama filled with tears humor and drama.  The team of Powell and Francis had appeared together in four films at Paramount before being signed by Warner Brothers in 1932 when they made this film along with another classic Jewel Robbery.  Where Powell and his later partner Myrna Loy exemplified sophisticated humor several years later at MGM Powell and Francis were a romantic couple.  Both Loy and Francis were welldressed darkhaired beauties.  While Loy had a career that lasted almost 60 years Francis would retire from the screen by the midlate 40's.  As a result she was one of Hollywood's forgotten leading ladies until the success of Ted Turner's classic movie channel brought her back into the limelight.One Way Passage is the team's most beloved film and its Academy Award winning story is just one of the highlights.  The stars are another but the supporting cast was simply superb as well.  Frank McHugh as a drunken conman is perfect comedy relief along with the fabulous Aline MacMahon as the phony countess.  If there had been Supporting Academy Awards for acting in 1932 she would have won for this film handsdown.  She is simply wonderful.  There is not a moment of hers on screen where she doesn't dominate it.  Warner Brothers apparently offered her the chance to become a leading lady but the realistic MacMahon realized that her best parts would come with the character roles that often stole the limelight away from the stars. Catch MacMahon in the very well known Gold Diggers of 1933 and more obscure films such as The Merry Frinks and While the Patient Slept to see what I mean.  Her later films Dragon Seed and The Search are perfect examples of what a gem she was as a performer.The music score later heard in the background of many a Warners B film is classic.  The screenplay is superb and the lengthwell a mere 68 minutes which goes to show that good things do come in small packages. Sadly after this and Jewel Robbery Powell and Francis were never paired again Powell went onto MGM where better things awaited him while Francis remained at Warners for many similar films none of which could surpass the charm of this film.  It was remade of course by Warner Brothers in 1940 as Till We Meet Again with George Brent and Merle Oberon.  That version was not bad but certainly an also ran compared to this film.  The ending will leave you joyfully heartbroken.".

All are in fine form.What ensues on shipboard is romance at its weepiest......a love that is fated to end when the ship docks. But the promise is made to meet on New Year's Eve in Mexico thus leading to that ending that causes the audience to bring out the hankies.Often movies made in the early 30s are a bit corny but not so here. The film seems rather modern and the dialogue although there are a lot of darlings and dearests is fairly contemporary. If you don't like weepers better pass on this one....BUT if you are a sucker for a tragic love story with an almost ethereal feel to it this is the one for you. Be sure to bring the Kleenex.".

But the promise is made to meet on New Year's Eve in Mexico thus leading to that ending that causes the audience to bring out the hankies.Often movies made in the early 30s are a bit corny but not so here. The film seems rather modern and the dialogue although there are a lot of darlings and dearests is fairly contemporary. If you don't like weepers better pass on this one....BUT if you are a sucker for a tragic love story with an almost ethereal feel to it this is the one for you. Be sure to bring the Kleenex.";

From the opening shot at a Far East bar complete with a marvelous singing trio to the final heartbreaking moment this film is the perfect 1930s concoction of great stars and a ridiculously silly plot made totally believable and palatable. Kay Francis was one of the top stars of the decade and this is one of her best films William Powell also underrated has never been more suave. Both deserved Oscar nominations for this great fiolm as did MacMahon and McHugh for support not a category for another few years. Kay Francis did everything during her reign as a top Warners star. It's amazing how she was able to go from fragile heroine to hardedged woman and then throw in a comedy. A truly versatile and wonderful star rescued by TCM from obscurity. Sadly neither Powell nor Francis would ever win an OscarJulia Roberts indeed!".

	schema:reviewBody "In the grim year of 1932 with Warner Bros. losing money like all the major studios except MGM RKO and Paramount both went into receivership thanks to the Depression along comes the movie One Way Passage dealing with what seems are the petty cares of grifters on a Pacific cruise. Only this movie is not a screwball comedy or a story about rich people in tuxedos chitchatting when they are not dancing. Writer Robert Lord's frequent writing partner in 1932 and 1933 Wilson Mizner specialized in stories about people on the margins of society peaking with the great Heroes For Sale. In one way or another most of the characters in One Way Passage are nearing the end of their line. When Frank McHugh's character Skippy drinks alone at a bar in Agua Caliente on New Year's Eve there is no longer the usual smile on his face as he stares at his drink. The opening credits of the movie put Kay Francis' name above the title but she is just one of several Warners stock company actors at their peak in this movie including Warren Hymer as the tough detective who always gets his man.The year 1939 is described as Hollywood's peak year when movies like Gone With The Wind and Gunga Din were in release. But judging movies by how they stand the test of time movies released in 1932 and 1933 stand up better. One Way Passage is proof of that. Warner Bros. may have treated its employees like slaves working stars and crew until 200 AM with no overtime to meet the 12 day production time limit the studio imposed on most movies with a 6 day work week but look at the results. One Way Passage. Baby Face. Mystery of the Wax Museum. Lady Killer. Joan Blondell described Warners Bros. studio then as a place where things were really cooking. And now almost 75 years later One Way Passage can still hold a viewer's attention with its story of some passengers on a last voyage before everything changes.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a classic demonstration that good things come in small packages this film clocking in at just under 70 minutes has a terrific cast enacting a wildly romantic yet fun and stylish story. Powell plays a slick somewhat shady type who has committed a murder though the victim was apparently someone who deeply deserved to get it. He is picked up in Hong Kong by Hymer who vows to take him to San Francisco namely to San Quentin to be hanged for his crime. Boarding a cruise liner Powell attempts to escape and nearly drowns Hymer in the process. When he saves Hymer's life Hymer allows him to roam the ship freely once they've set out. Powell runs into glamorous and charming socialite Francis and the two strike up a tentative romance. They enjoy a memorable if messy penchant for smashing their glasses after each drink and crossing the stems on the bar. Unfortunately she's in very poor health and isn't supposed to experience any shocks or touch any alcohol. Her verve where Powell is concerned however causes her to cast away any safeguards and live her remaining life to its fullest. Also on board are McHugh as a con man who's always got an angle and MacMahon as a con woman who's posing as a wealthy countess in order to bilk a fellow passenger out of some dough. These two play a part in aiding the romance of Powell and Francis when Hymer begins to tighten Powell's leash. Eventually the ship docks in San Francisco and the lovers discover each other's secret while not realizing that the other one knows it. Thus a classic tearjerking setup is achieved topped off by an epilogue that suggests that perhaps even death can't truly separate these two. Powell is solid and assured in his role veering comfortably between humor and pathos as needed. Francis a major star of the 30's who is all but forgotten today is as vigorous and fashionable as she is romantic and tender. They make a memorable couple. Hymer so often a thickheaded lug as he basically is in this film as well gives an enjoyably grumpy performance. MacMahon is striking showing a gift for characterization and an attractive look that may startle those who only know her from her later frowzy parts. McHugh who was a drinking pal of Spencer Tracy and Pat O'Brien among other Irish actors stationed in Hollywood is a delight. His trademark singsong laugh is utilized often but remains amusing each time. Hs underrated persona adds a lot to the film. It's a brief but welldone jewelry box of a film that runs the gamut from comedy to romance to tragedy very adeptly.".

He is a remarkably subtle actor more so than many others in the early 30's a transitional period as talkies wiped out silents and acting styles were in flux. His Thin Man movies though fun don't do him justice. I think his best acting is in earlier films like this one and MANHATTAN MELODRAMA.William Powell plays a captured crook heading for execution at San Quentin. Kay Francis is a dying woman he meets in a bar in Hong Kong they wind up together on a ship for San Francisco. The plot centers around their shipboard romance and how they try to keep their respective terminal conditions secret from each other. For a 1932 movie it's quite modern in feellots of nice but not grandiose stylistic touches like some sweeping camera movements especially the ones along a bar that open and close the movie. Considering there is only one plotline the supporting cast really gets a chance to shine Aline McMahon plays somewhat against type as a con artist traveling as a duchess and Frank McHugh is another crook who pulls con jobs while acting perpetually drunk. They team up to help Powell outsmart the cop who has him under lock and key Warren Hymer. The character of the cop is interestinghe eventually is seen in a fairly favorable light despite his antagonism toward Powell.  I'm not a big Kay Francis fan but she's adequate here.".

There is a similarity in the FrancisPowell relationship as there is in that of Cary Grant  Deborah Kerr in An Affair to Remember 1957 in terms of depth but FrancisPowell's is deeper. The supporting cast is superbly led by Aline McMahon and Frank McHugh. McMahon is a fine actress in this movie and quite beautiful too. McHugh's style gets off to the right start in this movie and shows off his acting skill quickly. His later movies especially in the Busby Berkeley musicals of the 1930s emphasized more silliness but One Way Passage shows more of what McHugh can really do when given the opportunity. I'm sure the director Tay Garnett had a lot to do with that. I don't understand why this superb film is not available for purchase. It is worth more than one viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "I haven't seen 'Love Affair 1939' but I have seen 'An Affair to Remember 1957' and that film undoubtedly owed something to Tay Garnett's 'One Way Passage 1932.' In McCarey's film a transAtlantic liner becomes a metaphor for love two people fall hopelessly for one another becoming adrift on a vessel of passion that precludes all former relationships or future life plans. When the ship reaches its destination  New York  reality intrudes on emotion and love is thrown into turmoil. In 'One Way Passage' the reality is death itself. Joan Kay Francis has been diagnosed with a terminal illness and will be lucky to survive the journey to America. Dan William Powell has been convicted for murder and in San Quentin awaits his gallows. Neither knows that the other is walking death row either figuratively or literally but love intercedes on their behalf just as a star is brightest before its extinction so too is love at its most passionate when the lovers' time is limited. Despite its very brief running time 67 minutes 'One Way Passage' is one of the great unsung romances. An aura of hope pervades the film. Though the viewer is always aware of the inevitable I loathe to describe the story as a doomed romance. Such a label would properly refer to say Lean's 'Brief Encounter 1945' or Ophls' 'Letter from an Unknown Woman 1948' in which the prevailing mood is that of tragedy and misspent emotion. In 'One Way Passage' not an ounce of passion goes to waste each lover fully aware that their time together is brief. I was also struck by the notion that love doesn't necessarily entail complete openness between lovers. Lying if done to protect rather than deceive can be the most heartbreakingly romantic thing of all I'm reminded of the devoted father in 'A Night to Remember 1958' who with admirable composure assures his family that the Titanic will not sink despite knowing that his own death is unavoidable. Garnett's casual use of long takes in masterful giving the story a poetic fluidity without drawing attention to itself.William Powell was one of the busiest stars of the 1930s enjoying the security of not one but two recurring characters Philo Vance and Nick Charles both detectives. 'One Way Passage' was produced by Warner Brothers before he moved to MGM in 1934. Even before 'The Thin Man 1934' however Powell was one of the classiest stars in Hollywood here delivering his dialogue with unsurpassed aplomb. Kay Francis was a new face for me but her eyes simply sparkle with life and emotion her character torn between the joys of love and the heartbreak of impending death. Of the supporting players only Frank McHugh  as a drunken pickpocket with a weaselly cackle  destroyed the mood of the film his alcoholism far less amusing than Nick Charles' subsequent hankering for martinis. While Aline MacMahon and Warren Hymer are strong 'One Way Passage' truly belongs to Powell and Francis and to a love than persists long after its participants have moved on to other worlds.".

	schema:headline " Final Destination";
	schema:reviewBody "ONE WAY PASSAGE Warner Brothers 1932 directed by Tay Garnett is a tender love story set on board a luxury liner that involves a final destination that awaits its two central characters. Of the many shipboard romances that have been produced before and since this one stood out with an original premise. How original was it? Well original enough to have earned Robert Lord an Academy Award in the category for Best Original Screenplay. Featuring William Powell and Kay Francis both new recruits to the Warner studio following their few years at Paramount ONE WAY PASSAGE is considered by many to be the finest of their nine collaborations together with Paramount's STREET OF CHANCE 1930 and Warner's JEWEL ROBBERY 1932 being two honorable mentions.As a camera pans towards three vocalists singing If I Had My Way in a barroom the plot takes its toll shortly before the S.S. Maloa leaves port from Hong Kong to San Francisco. Dan Hardesty William Powell encounters Joan Ames Kay Francis an attractive socialite at the bar where they immediately become attracted to one other. After drinking a toast they break their champagne glasses on the counter then part company with Dan bidding farewell to the German phrase Auf Wiedersehe. As Joan returns to her friends Allan Lane and Ruth Hall Dan waves heading through the swing doors. At that moment Dan is approached and handcuffed by Steve Burke Warren Hymer a police detective out to capture and deliver his eluding prisoner back to San Quentin to be executed on a murder charge. Later after falling overboard Dan sacrifices his freedom by saving Burke from drowning as he notices Joan up on deck among the crowd observing the incident. Because of his heroic deed Burke agrees to let his prisoner roam free after the boat leaves port to spend quality time with Joan. As Dan keeps his past a secret so does Joan who suffers from heart disease. Regardless of orders by her doctor Frederick Burton to give up parties cigarettes dancing and cocktails Joan chooses to enjoy whatever time allows in the company of her newfound lover during the four week ocean voyage. Also along for the ride are Skippy Frank McHugh Dan's friend and professional pickpocket and Barrelhouse Betty Aline MacMahon a confidence woman posing as the accented speaking Countess Barilhaud who keeps Burke's attention while Dan schemes his getaway during the ship's stopover in Honolulu.Film buffs should take notice by the familiar faces in uncredited roles including Roscoe Karns The Bartender Douglas Gerrard Sir Harold Herbert Mundin The Steward Stanley Fields The Captain and Dewey Robinson The Honolulu Contact. Director Tay Garnett keeps the action afloat through notification of time frame with superimposed numerical days listed on screen every few minutes. So well received in 1932 that Warners retold the story eight years later under its new title TILL WE MEET AGAIN 1940. Starring Merle Oberon George Brent and Pat O'Brien in the Francis Powell and Hymer roles with Binnie Barnes filling in for MacMahon Frank McHugh reprises his role under a different character name Rockie T. Rockingham. Interestingly the remake which follows the original quite closely happens to be a half hour longer than its originally released 67 minute product. Unlike Turner Classic Movies where both versions have been presented since its 1994 cable TV premiere many local television stations during the precable TV era very much preferred broadcasting the 1940 edition during the 1960s and 70s as opposed to the original. Take note that both versions contained the oftplayed underscoring theme to Where Was I?Nearly perfect storytelling its only main disappointment is the casting of Warren Hymer as the cop out keeping his prisoner under tight observation while on board. Warners stock players as Allen Jenkins or better yet Guy Kibbee might have fit the bill to perfection but no doubt were unavailable. Hymer best known for playing dopey sidekicks or gangsters tries his best playing it tough and straight. Unfortunately his comical looking face gets in the way making his performance hard to be taken seriously. The remake redeems itself with the casting of the nononsense O'Brien in Hymer's original role. Had O'Brien been contracted at Warners at this time maybe he would have been assigned that part. Powell and Francis as doomed lovers handle their roles convincingly. At first glance Powell seemed to be all wrong playing the condemned killer but as the movie progresses so does any doubt of Powell's ability in handling such an offbeat role. Under incapable direction or miscasting ONE WAY PASSAGE could have turned into a forgettable programmer with unintentional laughs by its viewers. Speaking of laughs MacMahon and McHugh as secondary couple with questionable pasts offer some amusements that occur between dramatic interchanges to balance the story. McHugh's trademark ha ha laughter and drunken mannerisms offer some bright spots to a point while MacMahon's straightlace humor comes across naturally. Considering its age ONE WAY PASSAGE holds up remarkably well especially the memorable New Year's Eve sequence at Aqua Caliente that should still leave a lump in one's throat long after the movie is over. Auf Wiedersehe.".

	onyx:emotionText "ONE WAY PASSAGE Warner Brothers 1932 directed by Tay Garnett is a tender love story set on board a luxury liner that involves a final destination that awaits its two central characters. Of the many shipboard romances that have been produced before and since this one stood out with an original premise. How original was it? Well original enough to have earned Robert Lord an Academy Award in the category for Best Original Screenplay. Featuring William Powell and Kay Francis both new recruits to the Warner studio following their few years at Paramount ONE WAY PASSAGE is considered by many to be the finest of their nine collaborations together with Paramount's STREET OF CHANCE 1930 and Warner's JEWEL ROBBERY 1932 being two honorable mentions.As a camera pans towards three vocalists singing If I Had My Way in a barroom the plot takes its toll shortly before the S.S. Maloa leaves port from Hong Kong to San Francisco. Dan Hardesty William Powell encounters Joan Ames Kay Francis an attractive socialite at the bar where they immediately become attracted to one other. After drinking a toast they break their champagne glasses on the counter then part company with Dan bidding farewell to the German phrase Auf Wiedersehe. As Joan returns to her friends Allan Lane and Ruth Hall Dan waves heading through the swing doors. At that moment Dan is approached and handcuffed by Steve Burke Warren Hymer a police detective out to capture and deliver his eluding prisoner back to San Quentin to be executed on a murder charge. Later after falling overboard Dan sacrifices his freedom by saving Burke from drowning as he notices Joan up on deck among the crowd observing the incident. Because of his heroic deed Burke agrees to let his prisoner roam free after the boat leaves port to spend quality time with Joan. As Dan keeps his past a secret so does Joan who suffers from heart disease. Regardless of orders by her doctor Frederick Burton to give up parties cigarettes dancing and cocktails Joan chooses to enjoy whatever time allows in the company of her newfound lover during the four week ocean voyage. Also along for the ride are Skippy Frank McHugh Dan's friend and professional pickpocket and Barrelhouse Betty Aline MacMahon a confidence woman posing as the accented speaking Countess Barilhaud who keeps Burke's attention while Dan schemes his getaway during the ship's stopover in Honolulu.Film buffs should take notice by the familiar faces in uncredited roles including Roscoe Karns The Bartender Douglas Gerrard Sir Harold Herbert Mundin The Steward Stanley Fields The Captain and Dewey Robinson The Honolulu Contact. Director Tay Garnett keeps the action afloat through notification of time frame with superimposed numerical days listed on screen every few minutes. So well received in 1932 that Warners retold the story eight years later under its new title TILL WE MEET AGAIN 1940. Starring Merle Oberon George Brent and Pat O'Brien in the Francis Powell and Hymer roles with Binnie Barnes filling in for MacMahon Frank McHugh reprises his role under a different character name Rockie T. Rockingham. Interestingly the remake which follows the original quite closely happens to be a half hour longer than its originally released 67 minute product. Unlike Turner Classic Movies where both versions have been presented since its 1994 cable TV premiere many local television stations during the precable TV era very much preferred broadcasting the 1940 edition during the 1960s and 70s as opposed to the original. Take note that both versions contained the oftplayed underscoring theme to Where Was I?Nearly perfect storytelling its only main disappointment is the casting of Warren Hymer as the cop out keeping his prisoner under tight observation while on board. Warners stock players as Allen Jenkins or better yet Guy Kibbee might have fit the bill to perfection but no doubt were unavailable. Hymer best known for playing dopey sidekicks or gangsters tries his best playing it tough and straight. Unfortunately his comical looking face gets in the way making his performance hard to be taken seriously. The remake redeems itself with the casting of the nononsense O'Brien in Hymer's original role. Had O'Brien been contracted at Warners at this time maybe he would have been assigned that part. Powell and Francis as doomed lovers handle their roles convincingly. At first glance Powell seemed to be all wrong playing the condemned killer but as the movie progresses so does any doubt of Powell's ability in handling such an offbeat role. Under incapable direction or miscasting ONE WAY PASSAGE could have turned into a forgettable programmer with unintentional laughs by its viewers. Speaking of laughs MacMahon and McHugh as secondary couple with questionable pasts offer some amusements that occur between dramatic interchanges to balance the story. McHugh's trademark ha ha laughter and drunken mannerisms offer some bright spots to a point while MacMahon's straightlace humor comes across naturally. Considering its age ONE WAY PASSAGE holds up remarkably well especially the memorable New Year's Eve sequence at Aqua Caliente that should still leave a lump in one's throat long after the movie is over. Auf Wiedersehe.";

As a preCode when among other things criminals didn't necessarily have to be punished for their crimes picture there's uncertainty about how things will end as well as a scene that although not in the slightest bit racy leaves no doubt that sexual intercourse has occurred. William Powell and Kay Francis have wonderful starryeyed chemistry together and it's one of those onlyinthemovies affairs that ropes you in. There's also some terrific business involving the supporting players especially Aline MacMahon and Warren Hymer. A couple of the drunken bits with Frank McHugh are dumb but they're the only missteps in the film and he has some other moments that are quite funny. The camerawork is really exceptional for its time with a number of lyrical movements and expressive shots including one that would be echoed in Borzage's MOONRISE. I've liked Tay Garnett's noir for the most part but this swept me off my feet. A very enjoyable impressive and touchingly sweet film that's packed with charm.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having brought Kay Francis and William Powell over from Paramount in 1932 Warner Brothers reteamed them in a romance that turned out to be as good as anything they did at their former studio.Kay Francis plays Joan a doomed girl with an unnamed disease on her way to a sanitarium in San Francisco. Her case is fatal it is just a matter of whether it is months or weeks or days. William Powell plays Dan an escaped murderer who has been sentenced to hang that is recaptured in Hong Kong by a detective Warren Hymer who has the flattest of feet. Hymer usually played dense types but here he has a head on his shoulders most of the time. Dan and Joan meet in a bar in Hong Kong and it is love at first sight.They wind up on the same boat headed back to San Francisco. Dan has convinced the cop to let him wander about the boat freely because he saved the cop from drowning though he did so reluctantly. Joan sees Dan on the boat and decides she is going to live life to the fullest even if it shortens her days. Ultimately both of them wind up losing their lives for the sake of their love for the other. Dan loses a couple of opportunities to escape to help Joan and Joan shortens her life by not staying in bed during the whole voyage and ultimately dies upon the shock of hearing about Dan's fate and seeing Dan led away in handcuffs as they dock in San Francisco.Now this might seem like a depressing movie but Warners did lighten it up a bit by sticking in a romance between a conwoman Aline MacMahon posing as a Russian countess and the cop who at first sees Dan as a great prize to take back to the states but by film's end feels very sorry for the guy to the point you can tell he wishes he could just let him go. Frank McHugh rounds things out as a pickpocket.The final scene gets me every time. Dan and Joan through their entire 24 day voyage have been lying to each other about their fate and vow to meet in Agua Caliente for New Year's Eve if they can't find each other before. Thus the final scene is a sad McHugh drinking alone in Agua Caliente as New Year's partying goes on around him. There is a sound of breaking glass. There with nobody around are the stems of two broken glasses laying side by side  which was what Joan and Dan did with their glasses when they had their first drink together. The glasses disappear and become as invisible as the lovers presumably reunited at last in the hereafter.If this doesn't choke you up check to see if you have a pulse. You could be dead yourself.".

	schema:reviewBody "My first impression was Gangsta flick with chicks.  And to some extent that's what I got.  But there was a lot more and I was deeply impressed with the realism with one exception.  The exception comes near the end and I won't give it away but it involves police officers taking shots at a suspect with a bus full of people in the background.One of the recurring themes of this film is how innocence and good intentions can turn into a nightmarish reality.A bank teller is confronted by a robber that she knows from childhood.  She can hardly believe what is happening and she doesn't react in the manner in which all bank tellers are trained.  A hostage dies and she loses her job. A slow reaction leads to a death accusations and the loss employment.A bright young man gets a haircut that is identical to a robbery suspect's. The police surround him.  He has a champagne bottle in his coat that he doesn't want to break and tries to pull it out.  They think it is a gun. An innocent mistake leads to a death.A loving mother can no longer afford a babysitter.  She has to bring her child to work and he gets into some cleaning supplies.  A mother's good intention turns into a hospital trip and a custody battle.There were other instances where one mistake led to dire consequences but I found them all believable and none of them gave me the impression of being mere vehicles to advance the plot.I enjoyed some of the other representations of Life as it is.  One being the inclusion of a lesbian Latifa in the cast without making a big deal out of it.  Although exhibiting some stereotypical lesbian traits denim overalls for example she wasn't overly butch.  And homosexuality wasn't used as a plot device to include nudity either.  Speaking of which the sex in the movie was pretty well done.  When there was love the sex was passionate. When Stony was doing it for money she looked ready to burst into tears. For the most part the sex came without nudity disappointing in some ways but adding credibility to the movie in others.I did have a few problems with this movie.  One is a failing that I see in many movies.  When a character's friend or family member is killed he or she expresses initial shock and pain but later on exhibits no outward mental stress.  There is also the I would have done it differently factor. I felt this a few times the first being the opening scene where Frankie Fox is being held up.  Or when Cleo Latifa is stealing get away cars and tossing the previous owner's CDs out the window.  Both of these are cases in which one needs to move fast and do what is needed to move on.  You don't have time to stare blankly at your old friend.  You don't have time to select the proper driving ambience.  But these flaws didn't take too much from the general feeling.I rated it 8 of 10.".

The exception comes near the end and I won't give it away but it involves police officers taking shots at a suspect with a bus full of people in the background.One of the recurring themes of this film is how innocence and good intentions can turn into a nightmarish reality.A bank teller is confronted by a robber that she knows from childhood.  She can hardly believe what is happening and she doesn't react in the manner in which all bank tellers are trained.  A hostage dies and she loses her job. A slow reaction leads to a death accusations and the loss employment.A bright young man gets a haircut that is identical to a robbery suspect's. The police surround him.  He has a champagne bottle in his coat that he doesn't want to break and tries to pull it out.  They think it is a gun. An innocent mistake leads to a death.A loving mother can no longer afford a babysitter.  She has to bring her child to work and he gets into some cleaning supplies.

Not only was the action there but the sentiment of the girls and what they've been through and what they go through shows how unfortunate they were and even worse I damn near almost started crying at the ending 'cause it made me feel so bad.

They don't rob banks for sheer enjoyment or because they have nothing better to do.  No they rob them because they are getting back at the system that they feel has screwed them over in their lives.  Here are the reasons in the opening bank robbery sequence FrankieFox who was at the time a teller was fired simply because she knew the suspect who robbed it Stony'sSmith younger brother Stevie was killed by police after being mistaken for the robbery suspect  CleoLatifah joins them simply because she is ped off at society TiseanElise is a single mother who is barely able to support her son and when he is accidently poisoned and taken away by child services decides she has no other choice.  I feel I must point out that up until that point she is reluctant to join the other three women.This is a really good movie that is definitely Oscarworthy material. Maybe not for the Best Picture category but definitely Oscarworthy.  The performances are excellent especially from all four of our young stars. Queen Latifah should definitely should have gotten an Oscar or Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress.  Her portrayal of a fiery lesbian is right on key.  F. Gary Gray who also directed Ice Cube and Chris Tucker in Friday is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors.  I don't think you should really call Set It Off an action movie since there isn't really action until the ending.A line from the movie if that crackhead Darnell can rob a bank then so can we.  This quote outlines the main message that the movie is trying to tell the social standing of women in our society saying that they have rights too.  The movie says that women can basically do anything men can do and probably better and they must be applauded for their efforts.  Now I'm not saying that women should all go out and round up their friends and start robbing banks.  Director F. Gary Gray definitely should be praised for his smart casting choices.1010P.S.

What made this film so very riveting to watch was the electrifying performance of actress Queen Latifahin one of the most surprising roles ever accompanish by a actressis a thrill to watch as Cleo. No one else but Latifah can bring this riveting and pulsating character to life with her outlandish style of guntoting and sometimes extremely foul mouthed criminal flair. InsteadSet It Off is fast paced and very wellacted.The director F. Gary Graymost notably for the original comedy Fridaywith Ice Cube and Chris Tuckerand the fast paced crime thriller The Negotiatorwith Kevin Spacey and Samuel L. Jackson makes imaginative use of L.A. landscapebut still will leave a feeling of social conscienceespecially when it touches the issue concerning the explosive rage inside the angry black womanand the harsh realities of trying to survive in a rugged landscape.".

Three of the group who stars in Set It Offconstitute the hottest young black female actresses of their day. You have Jada PinkettSmithThe Nutty ProfessorMenace II Society Jason's LyricCollateralVivica A. FoxIndependence DaySoul Foodrappersitcomsinger star Queen Latifahfrom the television series Living SingleChicagonot to mention at the time newcomer Kimberly EliseJohn QDiary of a Angry Black Woman. What made this film so very riveting to watch was the electrifying performance of actress Queen Latifahin one of the most surprising roles ever accompanish by a actressis a thrill to watch as Cleo. No one else but Latifah can bring this riveting and pulsating character to life with her outlandish style of guntoting and sometimes extremely foul mouthed criminal flair. InsteadSet It Off is fast paced and very wellacted.The director F. Gary Graymost notably for the original comedy Fridaywith Ice Cube and Chris Tuckerand the fast paced crime thriller The Negotiatorwith Kevin Spacey and Samuel L. Jackson makes imaginative use of L.A. landscapebut still will leave a feeling of social conscienceespecially when it touches the issue concerning the explosive rage inside the angry black womanand the harsh realities of trying to survive in a rugged landscape.";

Jada's character was like others said more based on reality than the other ones and she did really well. Kimberly though her role wasn't as big as the other ones she did really well on her character. You could see the emotion of love that she had for that child and how a young mother reacts to having someone take them away. Overall I give this movie a straight up 10!".

	schema:headline " Amateurish but entertaining";
	schema:reviewBody "Set it Off is far from remarkable but it's amiable and entertaining.  The screenplay was definitely written by amateurs packing as much melodrama into the storyline as possible.  First we introduce the character of Jada Pinkett's brother.  She's like a mother figure to him since their parents are dead.  He's a nice guy gets into a fight with his sister and flees the house.  It's no surprise when he turns out dead two scenes later.  Then Kimberly Elise's child accidentally swallows some household substances and the custody of the kid is handed over to child services.  We have Vivica A. Fox who got fired from her job at the bank and Queen Latifah who's just plain crazy.  Basically the character motivations seem ripped from a soap opera.  The film is predictable from the getgo so just strap in for the ride. Don't expect highclass writing and highclass direction especially from the guy who made Friday.  Don't get me wrong that was a good movie but like Set it Off it's only valuable as lightweight entertainment. One thing I have to say is this is one black movie that didn't go for the humdrum white people bad black people good premise.  I assumed that was the direction the film was going after watching the first scene in which the white bank manager fires Vivica for not following procedure totally ignoring the fact that she was at gunpoint along with everyone else in the bank.  But then we get introduced to the other two managers who are both black and both sleazy.  Not to say that black people are sleazy it's just good knowing that the writers weren't associating the term white with sleazy and didn't see the characters in terms of color.  Even the John C. McGinley character the detective who is out to get the four women isn't entirely sadistic.  SPOILERS AHEADThere are a few moments that are just too silly for their own good.  Are you telling me two cops are gonna be so distracted by an obnoxious vagrant that they'll totally disregard a bank robbery literally taking place right behind them?  As I said you can tell this was written by amateurs.  And then we have Queen Latifah driving through the bank in a minivan which is stupid in the first place and shown simply for cinematic pretentiousness and the four women drive out still not being actively pursued by the cops. Latifah makes one turn and suddenly she loses the cops altogether?  That's too much disbelief to suspend.  And of course in the usual cinematic tradition the minor characters have to die first.  Kimberly Elise dies in standard operatic fashionin someone's arms saying her last words.  Only in the movies can someone die like that 90  of the time.The acting is pretty good though sometimes hammy.  When Jada sees her brother dead on the street screaming and crying out Whyyyyy!!!! I could be paraphrasing that was too much.  Latifah's role as a crazy thug wasn't much of a stretch especially since this film was made back in her hiphop days.  She is a fine actress though and I prefer her more mature roles in films like Living Out Loud.  John C. McGinley and Blair Underwood add a touch of class.  If F. Gary Gray weren't so dependent on melodrama and big action spectacles to create tension this wouldn't been a much more compelling film.  Maybe someone like John Singleton or the Hughes Brothers could've made this a more powerful film.  Just don't set your expectations too high and you should have a good time.  My score  7 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Four black female friends are struggling in their own ways.  Frankie has a good job at the bank but when someone she knows robs the place she gets fired for being potentially involved.  She gets a job with the others as a cleaning service but soon all their situations worsen leading them to plan a bank robbery themselves.  The job goes great but soon they need another job and another  but the police are slowly closing in on them.I'm missed seeing this several times and looked forward to it a bit.  The plot is basically the same as several other crime flicks you'll have seen  gang begins robbery spree how will it turn out? etc.  However the twist here is that the gang are all women and all black.  As a twist this is quite good as there are very few all black all female thrillers out there so they deserve at least one!  The plot is pretty solid and allows for good robbery pieces as well as the usual standoffs and quite exciting climax.It does also have many weaknesses.  There are too many ghetto movie clichs thrown into the mix for my liking.  Whether it be the boy bound for college who gets shot the single mother trying to make it the low riders etc.  I understand why they're all there but really it hurts the film a bit. One little weakness that bothered me was Stony's romance with Keith  he seemed too good to be true and doesn't fit in with all the grit etc that's going on around the rest of the film.  But that's it  aside from some sex scenes to help get men into the cinema and some lesbian stuff that appears to be the only reason to have made Cleo gay.Pinkett as she was then is pretty good in fact pretty and good!  She's the only one whose character stays someone resembling reality.  I like Fox in several things but she starts normal and quickly turns into a guntoting criminal.  Elsie is OK in her first role and is suitably soft and trapped but Latifah overplays her butch lesbian.  Underwood is as greasy as his hair and I didn't like him and McGinley does good despite his role basically being an attempt to make the white audience feel good about their role. Outside of that Dr Dre makes a laid back cameo.Overall it doesn't rise above the level of the heist thriller generally but it's still enjoyable and is at least a different direction for all black female films  at least it's not yet another waiting to exhale'!".

	schema:headline " Cynical degrading parade of racial and gender stereotypes";
	schema:reviewBody "After a lively if predictable opening bankheist scene 'Set It Off' plummets straight into the gutter and continues to sink. This is a movie that deals in nasty threadbare stereotypes instead of characters preposterous manipulation instead of coherent plotting and a hideous cocktail of cloying sentimentality and gratuitous violence instead of thought wit or feeling. In short it's no different from 90 of Hollywood product. But it's the racial angle that makes 'Set It Off' a particularly saddening example of contemporary filmmaking. Posing as a celebration of 'sistahood' the film is actually a celebration of the most virulent forms of denigrating AficanAmerican 'gangsta' stereotype.

Not only does the film suggest that gangsterism is a default identity for all African Americans strapped for cash or feeling a bit hassled by the Man it presents its sistas as shallow materialists who prize money and bling above all else. Worse 'Set It Off' exploits the theme of racial discrimination and disadvantage simply as a device to prop up its feeble plot structure. Serious racerelated social issues are wheeled on in contrived and opportunistic fashion in order to justify armed robbery then they're ditched as soon as the film has to produce the inevitably conventional ending in which crime is punished the LAPD turns out to be a bunch of caring guiltridden liberals tell that to Rodney King and aspirational 'good' sista Jada Pinkett Smith follows the path of upward mobility out of the 'hood and into a world of middleclass selfindulgence opened up for her by her buppie bankmanager boyfriend. 'Set It Off' illustrates the abysmal state of the contemporary blaxploitation film pandering to mindless gangsta stereotypes and pretending to celebrate life in the 'hood while all the time despising it. While the likes of 'Shaft' and 'Superfly' in the 1970s might have peddled stereotypes and rehashed wellworn plots they had a freshness an energy and an innocence that struck a chord with audiences of all races and still makes them fun to watch. 'Set It Off' wouldn't be worth getting angry over if wasn't a symptom of the tragic decline and ghettoisation of AfricanAmerican filmmaking since the promising breakthrough days of the early 1990s.".

	onyx:emotionText "After a lively if predictable opening bankheist scene 'Set It Off' plummets straight into the gutter and continues to sink. This is a movie that deals in nasty threadbare stereotypes instead of characters preposterous manipulation instead of coherent plotting and a hideous cocktail of cloying sentimentality and gratuitous violence instead of thought wit or feeling. In short it's no different from 90 of Hollywood product. But it's the racial angle that makes 'Set It Off' a particularly saddening example of contemporary filmmaking. Posing as a celebration of 'sistahood' the film is actually a celebration of the most virulent forms of denigrating AficanAmerican 'gangsta' stereotype.

I've never known what it's like to be kept below the line that divides those who should be educated and those who should be left in the dark. For that reason I by no means have any right to speak for those people. But after watching the 1996 movie Set it Off I can't understand why no one seemed to get offended at its ignorance about and exploitation of the lower class in particular the struggling black communities of urban areas.Set it Off is about four closeknit women who have all had tough breaks in life. They made the best out of growing up in the projects and became for the most part honest hardworking and selfrespecting young women. The story starts off with Francesca a bank clerk getting held up and witnessing a violent shoot out that her fear crippled her from possibly preventing. A by the numbers detective named Strode blames her for it causing her to get fired. The story shifts to its main character Lida Francesca's friend who is a janitor in an upperclass apartment building soon learning she has to compromise all of her good traits just to break even in life. To help her little brother get some money for college she gives in to her shady employer's sexual demands. When her brother is coincidentally mistaken for the bank robber by Strode he is shot and killed with no apologies.The movie was off to a good start but I quickly started noticing that its scenes were getting progressively dumber. First off all Strode seems to be on every case that the L.A.P.D. has to offer. Being that I have heard much praise for this film I was surprised when more and more coincidences started trying my patience. The movie started feeling like a predictable crowdpleaser although it was supposed to be a hardhitting protest about why the lower class seems to have abandoned.Any high school or college writing class teaches that to evaluate something is to see how closely or effectively it comes to its intended mark. My problem with Set it Off is that it is unclear as to what its mark really is. It shakily walks the line between action movie and sociallyconscious drama so much that I started to question how dumb does the screenwriter thought his audience was. Since there is an objective made early on in the script that there must be a reckoning for the unfair treatment of these women and the lowerclass community at large it is questionable when it starts to stray.In his three and a half star out of four review of the film Roger Ebert calls it observant and wellinformed. Sure the film had some very relatable characters and situations but the screenplay is far from Observant and wellinformed. If anything the writing is histrionic. A realistic screenplay would have characters who were less heroic and aware of their exploitation. Sure Queen Latifah is fabulous as a guntoting lesbian but does such a character really represent underprivileged women? A competent screenplay also wouldn't rely on coincidences and action sequences to make its point.1 and 12 out of 4".

Since there's nothing outside for him to do with his skills that he learned in the US Marines unless he decides to become a mob hitman. Backett reluctantly accepts his fate as a lifetime professional killer for his country.The story of the film Sniper is focused on Sgt.Beckett with the assistance of former sharp shooting silver medalist and US government agent Richard Miller Billy Zane being sent deep inside the Panamanian jungle. The two snipers are to take out rebel General Miguel Alveraze Frederick Miraglittoa and Colombian drug kingpin Raul Ochoa Carlos Alveraze who's supporting him in a planned a military takeover of the country. We see earlier in the movie Sgt. Beckett scope and take out a rebel leader which I feel was the best scene in Sniper. For it shows step by step how Sgt. Beckett with the help of his spotter Cpt. Papich Aden Young does his job. There's also a subplot that was later aborted in the movie about a rebel sniper DeSilva Eward Wiley who was stalking Beckett and who later killed Papich as they were both waiting to be lifted out of the jungle by a military helicopter. You would have thought that a deadly cat and mouse was being played out between the two that would culminate when the movie ended but Sgt. Beckett had no trouble at all in dispatching DeSilva early in the film by using an unsuspecting Miller as bait.What hurt the movie the most was ironically the last fifteen or so minutes when the story went from a one shot one kill sniper movie to a Rambolike ending with Sgt. Beckett and Agent Miller fighting off an entire battalion of rebels with bullets flying as thick as a London fog.Sniper is still well worth watching for the fact that it tells the story about a person who until now has not really been glamorized in war movies A solitary killer who kills with the precision and skill of a master diamond cutter or accomplished neurosurgeon and who does it in total secrecy.".

Sniper uses a classic movie formula which many dismiss immediately as flawing the movie.  While sniper does not reflect the 100 truth about how our country's Military Snipers work it does give those who know nothing about the Professional Sniper a glimpse into the world of the Sniper.  And yes the movie has many flaws but what movie doesn't?  There are many good scenes and good acting by Tom Berenger. I have to say the 2 worst scenes are at the beginning of the movie with Billy Zane in the Helicopter followed by Zane in the Marine's bar scene. The best scene in Sniper is with Berenger in the middle of a field with the opposing force sweeping it!!  Also there are plenty of good shots of the jungle and some classic shots using the camera as though you are looking through a riflescope.  And yes the Sniper Motto is one shot one kill'.

Tomas Beccket  who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills looked as if he was coldhearted. However after Beccket showed his day dream of Montana we can clearly see his softness inside. It was the cruel war and his partners' sacrifice that made Beccket become so called coldhearted.Millar on the contrary was a new comer a green hand and was even not qualified as a sniper. Billy Zane did quite well to show millar's hesitation and fear when he first tried to put a bullet through one's heartas what Beccket said. What he thought about the actuall suicide  mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the award.These two guys were quite different in their personalities and I think that the movie had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personalities. These two snipers quarreled suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the other.Sniper isn't a good action movie but a good psychological one.".

	schema:headline " You could sure do a lot worse than this initial Sniper offering.";
	schema:reviewBody "Master Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Beckett is The Best. The best at being a sniper that is. He's a hardcore dedicated Marine who gives his all to his craft. He's truly turned sniping into an art. Beckett is stationed in the jungles of Panama and his mission is to eliminate a rebel leader as well as his drug lord financier. Beckett is infamous because his spotters all end up getting shot but his latest one is one Richard Miller Zane a government flack who was an Olympic marksman. Miller is green and Beckett has to show him the ropes. But after spending some time in the jungle Miller gets cocky and he challenges Beckett often. Not only do they still have to execute their mission but there is also an evil sniper trying to outsnipe them and he may or may not be a traitorous American. Will Beckett and Miller live to snipe another day? While plotwise Sniper may be a fairly standard El Presidente movie it can also probably stand as the ultimate sniper movie. That may seem obvious but this movie goes into many of the ins and outs of the sniper's creed. It can best be boiled down to one line One shot. One kill. No exceptions. The pace of the movie follows suit as Beckett explains there is a lot of waiting and setup before he can take his shot. The movie mirrors that. But there's plenty of junglebased machine gun shooting as well. Sniper was a Hollywood movie that was released to theaters so it has high production values and a somewhat classy feel.Director Llosa also directed Hour of the Assassin 1987 which is pretty similar to this. But while that one starred Erik Estrada now we have Berenger and Zane. Berenger is completely believable as Beckett. He's really a great actor you never once doubt that Beckett is authentic. He carries not only this movie but the next two sequels as well. Why exactly there are a total of FOUR Sniper movies to date is unknown but like Steve Guttenberg after the first three Police Academy movies he realized it was time to bail. Billy Zane is Miller the guy who has no confirmed kills but is still trying to assert his authority and so is in something of a moral quandary. He does a good job at that as well. J.T. Walsh was in one scene. We would have liked to have seen more Walsh.And while Sniper could have been a lot dumber it's really not that dumb. Thankfully there are no stupid jokes and corny humor either. We really appreciated that. This easily could have devolved into a Mercenary 2 1999type slog. On the technical front there are the high tech bullet and reticule effects which were perfect for their time and predate The Matrix 1999. They seemed designed specifically for teenagers of the 90's to go Woah. in true Joey Lawrence fashion. Speaking of the 90's Beckett speaks about feeling the rush which is a very 90's thing to say. Clearly killing someone from a long distance makes you thirsty for Mountain Dew. Note that Beckett does not talk about feeling the rush in the sequels which were filmed in the 2000's.Of the three Sniper movies we've seen this first one is the best one. If jungle action floats your boat you could sure do a lot worse than this initial Sniper offering.For more action insanity please visit comeuppancereviews.com".

	onyx:emotionText "Master Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Beckett is The Best. The best at being a sniper that is. He's a hardcore dedicated Marine who gives his all to his craft. He's truly turned sniping into an art. Beckett is stationed in the jungles of Panama and his mission is to eliminate a rebel leader as well as his drug lord financier. Beckett is infamous because his spotters all end up getting shot but his latest one is one Richard Miller Zane a government flack who was an Olympic marksman. Miller is green and Beckett has to show him the ropes. But after spending some time in the jungle Miller gets cocky and he challenges Beckett often. Not only do they still have to execute their mission but there is also an evil sniper trying to outsnipe them and he may or may not be a traitorous American. Will Beckett and Miller live to snipe another day? While plotwise Sniper may be a fairly standard El Presidente movie it can also probably stand as the ultimate sniper movie. That may seem obvious but this movie goes into many of the ins and outs of the sniper's creed. It can best be boiled down to one line One shot. One kill. No exceptions. The pace of the movie follows suit as Beckett explains there is a lot of waiting and setup before he can take his shot. The movie mirrors that. But there's plenty of junglebased machine gun shooting as well. Sniper was a Hollywood movie that was released to theaters so it has high production values and a somewhat classy feel.Director Llosa also directed Hour of the Assassin 1987 which is pretty similar to this.

Billy Zane is Richard Miller the new guy who the old sniper has to train he is less cardboard but still unoriginal. Noticeable Camera work It is a 90's action movie so I wouldn't hold out too much faith for any interesting angles an shots. But I would expect POV and voyeuristic shots as this is a sniper movie which has them being chased by an enemy sniper. The movie dos not disappoint on that end as we get out first POV sniper scope shot at 3 minutes in. The movie continues to use standard shots with a few POV or voyeuristic shots so the movie is alright for an action movie were camera angles are concerned. Incorrect Science The movie has got quite a few militaryesk errors such as how to address a Master Gunny Sergeant Altering the ballistic properties of a bullet by smoothing the edges of it Trying to dry fire a weapon knowing a weapon by hearing the hammer strike Trying to talk while in a helicopter without a mic. Overall Feel If you want a good sniperwar movie you'll like this film. It is your typical war type action movie. One thing I loved about this movie and about most sniper movies is the unshackling sense of mystery and stealth. Of course that is the whole point of snipers but it is still fun to watch movies and enjoy that in them. The camera works is as good as you'll get from a 90's action movie and the acting is decent if not predictable.".

The pressure is on!SNIPER is a mediocre motion picture. This film tries to be more of a psychological drama than an action thriller. True there are lots of macho philosophizing slow motion bullets flying at close range bold tough guy effrontery and an almost all male cast with no female leads. What makes SNIPER more unique though is that this movie has better character angles than expected. Billy Zane for one actually shows the right stuff in this movie.  Zane does a superb job portraying a rookie sniper  with a conscious...and a short fuse. He demonstrates the vulnerability the problems and the integrity of a soldier coping with the focus of his mission...and the nature of his deeds.  Berenger does a fine job also delineating a cocky overthetop Sergeant with an itchy finger constantly on the trigger. The two leads have created a couple of emotionally ambivalent characters although fabricated in a banal manner who must deal with their purpose...and each other's weaknesses.Excellent performances by Tom Berenger and a young showstealing Billy Zane lift SNIPER from turning into a complete fiasco. Consequently though in spite of some well executed action scenes and an inkling of tension permeating throughout the movie SNIPER is surprisingly tepid in the adventure genre.  The technically wellstaged  action  scenes     for example are somewhat unpolished and they lack finesse. The photography is also swift just the rest of the movie including character development doesn't really come close to swiftness.This ambitious character study just misses the mark. The nuances of character are there but the film as a whole is no different from most other action pictures. Unfortunately the pace in SNIPER is extremely vapid with more screen time spent on characters talking and running around rather than generating any real action.In spite of the faults evidently gathered in SNIPER this flick is a tolerable action movie. The action isn't really exhilarating and the thrills in SNIPER are left to be desired for. Still Billy Zane and Tom Berenger salvage this film from transforming into a complete mess. They work well together and though the plot is itself contrived and these two characters are atrociously full of clichs the two main leads do add credibility to their parts. Director Luis Llosa ANACONDA THE SPECIALIST has designed a dubious but OK just not great film. If you are not demanding a high caliber thriller then you'll find this motion picture to be serviceable.RATING  out of .".

Tom Berenger plays an army sniper who is saddled with a new young knowitall partner Billy Zane and the two must work together on a dangerous mission in South America. The one part of the film that was burned into my memory is a key sequence where the two are outside a military compound trying to move into position for a shot on their target. The best moment of that sequence is Zane looking through a scope across the field only to see a clump of grass unexpectedly slide across the field which is Berenger stealthily getting into position. The buildup to this sequence of Berenger and Zane trekking through the jungle is not especially well written but the two actors make the most of it and do manage to make it watchable. The events of the film occurring afterwards aren't all that interesting either. The filmmakers clearly wanted to make this a taught psychological thriller of dueling snipers and diverging world views but the script is nowhere smart enough for that. I did see that Walon Green The Wild Bunch Hill Street Blues was one of the executive producers and Barry Levinson The Wire Bugsy was attached to direct at one point so very likely this was going to be a much smarter film somewhere along the line. Still that one set piece in the middle of the film and strong performances by Berenger and Zane make Sniper worth checking out. The great J.T. Walsh also appears in the film but if you want a great sniper duel film watch Enemy at the Gates instead.".

Everyone displays dry performances and even though Berenger was the highlight of the cast he still seems to be partially coasting through the film which is disappointing considering he was fantastic in Platoon only several years prior. The plot has a very typical mission which I would not critique by itself but there is no real climax and you will probably feel unfulfilled by the end. Finally the many decisions by the director like the in flight bullet effects Scope point of views and slow motion hits and deaths along with everything touched on earlier make it painfully cheesy and something that you would expect in a much older movie considering what else was already done in the genre and what was being put out in 1993. Ultimately I went in expecting a different type of military movie based on Berenger's previous performances. Even though it would not be on my list of recommendations if you go in with a hankering for mindless action and cheese you will probably be entertained enough.".

The teenager in question is Anne Shirley a young and prominent contract player for RKO Radio whose career specialized in playing such wholesome characters as presented in CHATTERBOX. As much as this sort of characterization might display her to contemporary viewers as a weak sister she is in fact strongwilled without losing her feminine charm.Inspired by Shirley's early characterization which began with ANNE OF GREEN GABLES RKO 1934 where she was more of a chatterbox than she was in this production Shirley does bring forth her titledrole in its early stages of the story as a lonely teenager whose only pleasure is constantly talking to anyone who would listen to her. Blending in the elements of ANNE OF GREEN GABLES 1934  the talkative teenager with Al Jolson in THE JAZZ SINGER 1927  going against family authority by doing what she feels she's meant to do and forbidden to return home and Katharine Hepburn in MORNING GLORY 1933  taking her profession so seriously that members of the troupe secretly regard her as goofy the duration of the story concerns Jenny Yates Anne Shirley wanting to carry on the tradition of her deceased mother an actress many years ago. She hopes to attend the upcoming presentation of the Village Players revival of Virtue's Reward which her mother had appeared being presented at the Hale Barn Theater. She is forbidden by Uriah her grandfather Edward Ellis who warns her that once she steps out that door like her mother it will be locked to her forever. After she does leave home Uriah has a change of heart and leaves the door unlocked only to have it closed by their handyman Michael Arbuckle George Offerman Jr. who does it in spite since Jenny knows enough about Michael ranging from missing articles to the accidental burning of their barn to get him fired. Jenny does return home only to find the door locked. With no other place to go she hides inside the rumble seat of a car belonging to Philip Green Phillips Holmes a struggling young artist on his way to New York. After he arranges for Jenny in obtaining the lead role in Virtue's Reward reality sets in once she steps foot upon that wicked stage.While Anne Shirley's presence makes the film she's not in every scene. There are moments when time allows Uriah Ellis and Philip Green Sr. Granville Bates to brag about their ancestors but on the whole there are others in the cast worthy of honorable mention. Erik Rhodes famous for his comedic Italian characters in two Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals THE GAY Divorce and TOP HAT plays it straight as Archie Fisher director of the theatrical troupe. Then there's Margaret Hamilton three years before immortalizing herself as the Wicked Witch in THE WIZARD OF OZ 1939 as Tippy a sympathetic landlady once an actress herself whose oneonone talk with Jenny about the realities of theatrical life comes across realistically and sincere and a very young and blonde Lucille Ball as a temperamental stage actress who wants nothing more than to get her back salary.CHATTERBOX a feel good movie that says it all in its brief 68 minutes is one of many Anne Shirley movies produced during that time to be overlooked and forgotten due to lack of television revivals. Formerly shown on American Movie Classics during its early years during the 1980s to 1993 it can be seen whenever possible on Turner Classic Movies at one point in time was shown as part of a viewer's request night and available on video cassette through a private collector. Film buffs take note the title CHATTERBOX was later used for a 1943 comedy for Republic Studios starring Judy Canova and Joe E. Brown which can stir up come confusion whenever found in the TV listings. While the premise to CHATTERBOX is basically a story much to the liking of teenage girls it does win the appeal of others as well. 12".

He wishes she'd just settle down and marry a responsible young man which doesn't include their farm hand George Offerman or Phillips Holmes a rich kid who'd rather paint than make money. Holmes is as much a trial to his father Granville Bates as Shirley is to Ellis.Anyway when a small theater company wants to revive the play Anne eagerly wants the part and gets it of course on the strength of her name. But with changing public taste what was great Victorian melodrama back in the day is now high camp and played absolutely straight might bring down the house. We hear about many of the stage legends of the past and the names come down to us but you never see the works revived because public tastes have changed. With film you can measure the changing tastes of the public and when reviewing items for this forum you always have to try and watch it through the eyes of the public of the time as well as through your own. Sometimes films are hopelessly dated and you must say so.However Chatterbox is an interesting film because it deals with the phenomenon of changing public tastes in a gentle manner. I daresay it could be remade today and some of the work that was done on the stage then would be camp today.Not everything lasts forever.".

We hear about many of the stage legends of the past and the names come down to us but you never see the works revived because public tastes have changed. With film you can measure the changing tastes of the public and when reviewing items for this forum you always have to try and watch it through the eyes of the public of the time as well as through your own. Sometimes films are hopelessly dated and you must say so.However Chatterbox is an interesting film because it deals with the phenomenon of changing public tastes in a gentle manner. I daresay it could be remade today and some of the work that was done on the stage then would be camp today.Not everything lasts forever.";

Her mother had been one 20 years earlier playing a part on stage in Virtue's Reward. Ironically a New York acting company has been perfecting this very same play in Jenny's sleeping little town working out the kinks before taking it to the Big Apple.But Jenny's mum had effectively run away from home and been banished never to return by her father Uriah Lowell Edward Ellis for wanting to pursue an acting career. Now Jenny lives a rather sheltered life with the same man her grandfather and a young farmhand named Michael Arbuckle George Offerman Jr. who tattles on her. She's learned everything 'knows' about etiquette proper behavior and acting ! from an Emily PostFarmer's Almanac type book which is to say she's very naive uninformed and a ham actress at best.Jenny meets Philip Greene Jr. Phillips Holmes outside the barn that's being used as the playhouse for the New York company's production. Phil is a standin actor who's been helping out his friend the play's director Archie Fisher Erik Rhodes since Phil is a wannabe painter the Vermont countryside has provided him with an opportunity to paint trees etc.. Phil also happens to be the son of a wealthy man who doesn't want to follow in his father's footsteps or work in the family business.Jenny interrupts Phil while he's working on one of his paintings and effectively tells him and 'us' her whole life's story. He's polite but otherwise at least initially uninterested he excuses himself after a while but not before offering to leave a ticker for her at the box office so that she might see the play that evening. When Jenny returns home her stern grandfather who'd learned about the play through a flier in his newspaper cautions her to stay away from the playhouse and after some discussion warns her that if she goes to the show she'll find herself locked out forever e.g. just like her mother had been.Of course Jenny can't resist sneaking out of the house to see the play her mother had once starred in but she's surprised to find that Virtue's Reward is not that evening's production. A fellow patron whispers something about an ill actress earlier director Fisher's lead actress a sophisticated urbanite named Lillian Temple Lucille Ball had complained about not being paid.Disappointed Jenny walks out and returns home to find the door has been latched she'd thought her grandfather was keeping his word but he'd actually had a change of heart and Michael had locked the door out of revenge for an earlier disagreement they'd had. Driving back home Phil discovers that Jenny is a stowaway in the trunk of his automobile. A starving artist without enough gas to drive her back again he reluctantly agrees to take her on to New York with him. Encouraged by Jenny's enthusiasm for acting and his understanding landlord Emily 'Tippie' Tipton Margaret Hamilton Phil writes a letter of introduction for Jenny to Archie Fisher his letter really asks him to let her down easy.When Jenny arrives at the theater with Phil's letter in hand she ends up ham acting several parts of Virtue's Reward in the waiting room charming the stage manager and veteran actors in attendance who are polite enough not to laugh at her. Fisher sees the performance and decides that Jenny is a perfect replacement for Lillian because unbeknownst only to Jenny the revival of Virtue's Reward is a campy burlesque show. Fisher threatens to fire anyone who laughs at Jenny's acting and forbids them from telling her the truth about the production.Phil is surprised to learn that his friend has hired Jenny learns that the joke's on her but can't bring himself to tell her because of how happy and grateful she is. Tippie can't do it either. Meanwhile Uriah who's been trying to find his granddaughter has tracked her to New York and the offices of Philip Greene Sr. Granville Bates. The two old codgers get along famously drinking expensive liquor and smoking cigars while they try to out B.S. each other about their family's legacies bragging about involvement with Paul Revere and the signing of the U.S. Constitution!.Both Uriah and Greene Sr. eventually arrive at Tipton's boarding house where they learn about Jenny from Tippie and Phil who was debatably on his way to opening night. Naturally Jenny plays her part straight and the audience erupts in laughter bringing tears to her eyes. Phil rushes to her dressing room where he tries to console her but she throws him out with the older men look on. However driving home with her understanding grandfather Jenny hears a noise when the car goes over a bump.

	schema:reviewBody "When I watched this movie for the first time in over a decade I instantly thought of that 1960 classic You Talk too Much which describes someone who never shuts up and never listens. Even when they do listen they are hearing only what they want to hear and in Anne Shirley's case what she hears is not anything close to what anybody her grandfather a worried suitor her New York landlady are trying to tell her. Basically she's a country bumpkin a stage struck young lady who is living through the legend of her late mother once an actress who appeared in a hoary old melodrama back in Boston that some New York producers are now reviving as a burlesque. By chance she's cast in the same part that her mother played but when young painter Phillips Holmes whose car trunk she smuggled herself to New York in tries to tell her that the role she's taking seriously is now being played for laughs Shirley only hears his affections for her. Holmes sends in their nononsense landlady a delightful Margaret Hamilton who gets a bit closer to revealing the truth but still Shirley's mind is closed. When her very strict grandfather Edward Ellis arrives just in time for opening night by accident all is revealed for the heartbroken Shirley and hopefully this will give her more incentive to listen to every word when people are speaking to her!The film starts off in Shirley's small hometown where the play is in rehearsal with a very young Lucille Ball in that part. Shirley is having a feud with her grandfather's rascally hired hand George Offerman Jr. who locks her out after Ellis threatens to do the same but changes his mind if she leaves to go see the play. It is this sequence that leads to her to stowing away in Holmes' car. In a sense it's nothing but a variation of Anne Shirley's character in Anne of Green Gables with a different name with Shirley just as stubborn and determined yet likable in spite of her constant jabbering and inability to hear the serious message of what everybody is trying to tell her. I just wonder where in New York when this was set would they burlesque an old play like the one here and realized perhaps way Off Broadway on 14th Street where many old burlesques were before being shut down. This one wouldn't get shut down because it's one of those old gaslight plays that hasn't played anywhere probably since the 1940's but there's a brief bit of blackface in it that seems straight out of a minstrel show that might raise some eyebrows. It's nice however to see the always wonderful Margaret Hamilton in a major part and one where she is seen holding a broom where her character doesn't seem like someone who might end up flying on it.".

Even when they do listen they are hearing only what they want to hear and in Anne Shirley's case what she hears is not anything close to what anybody her grandfather a worried suitor her New York landlady are trying to tell her. Basically she's a country bumpkin a stage struck young lady who is living through the legend of her late mother once an actress who appeared in a hoary old melodrama back in Boston that some New York producers are now reviving as a burlesque.

But this production is somewhat special and should be watched and appreciated by today's audiences.In addition to Miss Shirley's fine work CHATTERBOX offers those who care to take the time to watch it a most sincere performance from Margaret Hamilton. Miss Hamilton usually is given mean characters to play. But she is no witch in this one and instead portrays a kind landlady.

But I was truly shocked and touched by this film.At first the two characters seemed so strange it was like they were trying TOO hard to be bizarre.  But as the film progressed their behavior took a backseat to the story that emergedsimply that of a starcrossed love and the difficulty of being different in a society that has no place for you.In a story that seems most familiar the two go from one locale to another seeking medicine and comfort but are turned away.  The only friendly face they find is a selfostracized woodsman a selfconfessed chicken lover. Just see it and you'll understand.There were a couple of Harold and Maude references including the final scene over Niagara Falls.  It was just so powerful the tension building to a moment you knew would be devastating...but it's almost impossible to accept how devastating it becomes.  Left my crying for a good fifteen minutes.  But it wasn't all sad.

The relationship between the two and just the slightest details in the film are so acurate and believable. I usually hate romance and love films but this movie truly touched me. I so recommend this movie to anyone with the ability of vision.".

She pulls it off fantastically.We know early on this film is going to end tragically but you cannot take your eyes off of it.

It's definitely not one to watch if you want to walk off smiling. This movie is unpredictable and intense. Some scenes are downright frightening even after multiple viewings because this kind of stuff really can happen. It will most definitely keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole ride. And after you see the ending if you're not deeply disturbed you really should check yourself for a pulse.The acting was phenomenal. Marcy with her rather extreme case of tourette's shifts from quirkycute to utterly terrifying sometimes appearing so outofcontrol that she looks like the undead. Seth was great too. The focus of the movie definitely does not fall nearly as much on him as it does on Marcy though he happens to be the one that gains the most momentum as a blossoming character.It's a classic love story with some unconventional twists and it's also my favorite love story next to True Romance. There are two bad reviews for it up here but one of the people who gave such a review didn't have his facts straight and admitted to not seeing the whole film while the other was just looking for some Hollywood thrills without the deep characters and perhaps was a little thrown off by the apparent shallowness of the plot seeing as the end goal revolves around stealing a black bobbi head from a toy store. The point is that this movie is not for those who want to see something normal or lighthearted. This one is messed up and indie as can be and won't let you go until the heavy climax.".

Their interest in each other gets them caught up in chaotic scenarios and ultimately puts their relationship in peril even if one of them has a lot of crazy life stories to tell to future children or something.The characters were sort of bland GenXer 90's models of 20somethings who had niche interests in petty theft and living life outside of the local rules. Robin Tunney gives a good performance as the Tourette's girl name forgotten but Henry Thomas' character her significant other was dull and not bright at alla real pain to watch. The worst part about the film was the missing logic during most of the characters' encounters with people along their journey to Canada. So many awkward experiences could have been avoided if the guy just explained her mental condition in a calm manner to others.Overall it's a memorable film to me but it gets lost in the shuffle between the aforementioned movies and films like Girl Interrupted which explore more mentallychallenged characters on a deeper more logical level. It feels more middleoftheroad which is why I give it a 5 star rating. A better ending would have boosted that rating up a notch as well.".

The filmmakers made absolutely no attempt to inject any Canadian reality into the section of the movie set in Canada. Toronto is a 2hour coach ride from Niagara Falls. As to why they wouldn't just go to nearby Buffalo I'll assume that was because of their obsessiveness. The store employees supposedly in a Toronto shopping plaza spoke with American accents.

I cannot describe the way the movie made me feel while watching it and how I felt as it ended and also how I feel about it now. Very few movies have such an effect on me. I like them or I do not. I look at Niagra Niagra as a work of art. We all see something in it and it may remind us of something or it may instill fear or fun etc... This movie had me in not the best mood. In fact it left me feeling empty somehow. I guess because the lives these two persons led were so empty in so many ways. They had no direction. Their only direction was to have no direction. They had many problems to deal with and I guess needed to get away from what could not have been a happy life. But on the way things really only got worse. A steady decline from where it started. It was sad as it was so well acted and I guess we have all most likely seen someone in some situation that may in some way resemble the situation these folks were in. They might have had a good life if they had any idea how. But it Wes clear they did not know what to do. So they kind of Rambled to someplace they had heard about. No real goal. They had no idea how to have a goal. They had no idea how to overcome the life that was set before them. I felt bad but could not stop watching the movie. Only good actors can make me feel so much about a movie that I would not like if just anyone played the parts. These two did a great job to the point you just did not see the acting. I am very impressed and want to buy the movie when it is available on DVD. You know. It left me feeling a little like Leaving Los Vegas did. But again it is in a class of its own. Not a great movie but well worth an hour or two on the right day. If you are a person who has problems I would not suggest you watch it. It could depress you. It depressed me and I have not the conditions these folks had. JimmyJoeJetter".

In Requiem For A Dream the characters start out doing some harder drugs and you barely get to see where everything goes wrong it just seemed to be like that all of a sudden. The characters aren't as likable and I thought it ended a bit abruptly leaving us no knowledge of what is to become of the characters. I have to give it props though for some brilliant scenes like when they all go into the fetal position at the end.  Basketball Diaries on the other hand gets you involved and attached to the characters. You get to watch them throw away their basketball careers and their lives. The part where Lewis is going through withdrawal is so real and horrible. And after he goes through all that pain he throws it away and goes straight back to the drugs. This movie is so incredible I really wish more people would see it and think the same.Shay".

This movie is so incredible I really wish more people would see it and think the same.Shay";

	schema:reviewBody "I think 'The basketball diaries' is a realistic and very important movie. It shows the road that one walks to being addicted to drugs. From taking dope once a week to taking dope every day every hour. Leonardo DiCaprio playes a basketballplayer a schoolkidJim Carrol who walks this path. He experiments with drugs 'till there is no way back. He gets himself in all kinds of stupid situations. He starts robbing stores ripping off money from old ladies just to get some cash for dope. His life is beginning to look like a living hell. His basketballcoach wants to have sex with him and when he passes out on the basketballfield due to taking a wrong kind of 'peppil' he gets kicked out of the basketball team and from school. From this moment on everything goes in a downward spiral for DiCaprio.An excellent scenario you would say and it is. The acting from DiCaprio is great. We saw it earlier on in his career when he got oscarnominated for 'What's eating gilbert grape'. A gripping drama in which he playes a disabled kid. But in 'The basketball diaries' he playes an equally difficult part. Not a lot actors would have put down this kid who's life is wrecked and who is constantly thinking about dope as well as DiCaprio did.The statement the movie delivers is a powerfull one. Being addicted to drugs is horrible. Usually people learn about this aspect trough seminars or televisonshows such as Oprah Winfrey. But it never really gets the kind of attention and understanding from the audience as 'The Basketball diaries' delivers.The amazing performance by DiCaprio the fact that this movie is actually based on a true story and the reality the movie is set in 'The basketball diaries' deserves a 9 out of 10.".

I mean the story is always the same a guy begins having drugs for fun or because he's boring or just because he's young and wants to try new experiences then he gets hooked starts to rob or to prostitute himself and eventually ends up in prison. That's what we see in Christiane F. El Pico Trainspotting Drugstore Cowboy... There may be differences in the form and in the characters but the content is always the same. The dinstictive feature of Basketball Diaries is that the main character actually exists Jim Carroll a writersingerperformer born in NYC in the 50's. And this is supposed to be his autobiography or the cinema adaptation of some diaries he wrote when he was a teenager heroinaddicted. Because of that Basketball D. is more poetic than the rest of the movies I named before the voice over of DiCaprio's character is present all along the film telling us about his thoughts rather nihilistic's  with a style near to Burroughs or Jack Kerouac urban poetry tough and without ornament. Maybe that's the strong point of Basketball Diaries because movies such as Christiane F. or El Pico recreates much better what it means to be a drugaddict they're much more explicit more dirty much harder...DiCaprio's performance deserves a new paragraph 'cause it's simply astonishing. His best performance EVER plenty of different shades. As he did in Gilbert Grape or This Boy's Life he shows us how versatile he can be. If only he'd choose better the films he works in. My rate 710".

Leo plays Jim Carroll a high school student with a love of basketball and a flare for writing whose life goes right down the toilet when he becomes a heroine addict. Yes perhaps Leo gets hooked a little too quickly but everything that happens to him after he gets hooked is totally real. Along with CLEAN AND SOBER this movie so clearly and honestly demonstrates where drug addiction can take you...how nothing else becomes important but how and where that next high is coming from. There is one harrowing scene after another here. We see Jim returning to his mother Lorraine Bracco after being kicked out of the house and we see Jim turn from begging child to threatening thug in a matter of seconds a scene brilliantly performed by DiCaprio. We see Jim and his friends beat up an old lady for her purse and we even see Jim prostitute himself with a man in order to get money. It's a frightening and realistic spiral downward that Jim takes and he does make it back but it is important to remember when watching this film that a lot don't. DiCaprio gets solid support from future star Mark Wahlberg Bruno Kirby Jr. Juliette Lewis and Michael Imperioli. A harrowing film experience that will not be forgotten once the credits roll.".

The movie doesn't glorify drugs or violence and I didn't find it at all unrealistic until that scene outside of his mother's door. I expected Jim to be considerably more violent and desperate but instead he just kind of paws at the door and at his mother and then whimpers and cries on the steps outside her door oh he half heartedly yells out a few times but where is that desperate strength that animal rage that should have been there?. And then at the end  Jim is redeemed so quickly  how and why? What does he have to live for? Why does he cleanup in jail? What is his life about after the drugs? Telling and retelling his horrific drughead days? That's not redemption. I did not find this movie to be as good as I was lead to believe it was going to be.".

Unlike Traffic the most recent antidrug movie Diaries is carefullypaced interesting and most importantly it speaks directly to the audience. DiCaprio's Carroll or the film version is someone who has to sacrifice his dream  which is to become a basketball player  to feed his seemingly neverending hunger to get high.

I regard Leonardo along with Joaquin Phoenix as the finest actor of his generation and it's not hard to know why. I read a comment here that said he overacted during the scene outside his mom's apartment. Well I beg to differ. How else was he supposed to act under such extreme desperation? DiCaprio's wailings and whinings were spoton 'cause that is exactly how I sound when I cry and I mean REALLY cry. That scene was the most memorable one for me followed by his withdrawal scene which I felt was worth the price of the DVD alone. DiCaprio looked disgusting with drool all over his face which was bloodied earlier on and it was completely effective. Mark Wahlberg Patrick McGaw and James Madio all gave strong support but the star here is really DiCaprio.To reiterate The Basketball Diaries is one of the most important movies I've seen and the book is one of the best and also important I've read.

	schema:reviewBody "Kalvert's portrayal of a catholic school basketball star turned junkie is touching but definitely flawed. DiCaprio is pretty good in the lead role of Jim Caroll although he had some problems with the drug scenes especially the first one and the basketball scenes he played like he sucked other than that his performance was pretty good. The film had a great supporting cast with Lorraine Bracco shining as his mother and Mark Wahlberg Bruno Kirby and James Madio were all great in their roles as well as Michael Rapaport who stole his single scene from DiCaprio. The problem I had was that the film was not the most realistic although a lot of the stuff it did portray I can either relate to or have seen go on in my high school not exactly the most safe environment California high schools or NY.... The direction was good keeping it interesting at most times but i felt the screenplay was a bit weak and especially in the 3rd act it fell apart although the ending was a bit clich it still helped as it rescued the 3rd act which seemed to be going nowhere. The acting was good direction was nice and music used was also well done screenplay was lackluster however. 810 207 on my list of alltime favorite films".

All of that because of 'Titanic.' I really hate to admit that now that I have seen the majority of his work. The first time I really began changing my mind was in 2002 when he starred in both 'Gangs of New York' and 'Catch Me if You Can.' What got me thinking is that both Scorsese and Spielberg aren't the type of directors to hire an actor just because they have a teenage fanbase and also DeCaprio's performances in both were excellent.But it wasn't until recently that I changed my mind completely and realized just how much of an underappreciated actor he is. He has done films like 'The Beach' 'Basketball Diaries' and more all of which received high acclaim but because of 'Titanic' people won't give him a seconds glance. And he was great in 'Titanic.'Honestly I doubt that there is any other actor out there who could've done a better job as Jim Carrol. Hell even Mark Whalberg did a great job. He is another underappreciated actor.If you are one of the many people who say that they won't see 'Basketball Diaries' because of Leo don't be so judgmental. He made the movie so wonderful. It is an excellent film and he is an excellent actor.910".

After watching this film I really appreciate what a marvelous actor he is. He's so convincing as Jim Carroll a basketball player poetdrug addict and lost youth shedding his innocence in the seedy city of New York. Most powerful scene in the movie is when he is begging his 'Ma'for some money for a fix which is absolutely heartbreaking to watch. Leo's acting really shines when he does a cold turkey scene which is one Oscar nomination well over due! It was so convincing hairs on the back of your neck will stand up!Mark Wahlberg plays a disturbed tough guyschool pal very well Lorraine Bracco is great as Jim's despairing mother and Jim Carroll himself the authormakes a great cameo. If you haven't read the book the film will prompt you because it's a great read too. The commentary with extracts from Jim's poetry are very fitting and a very beautiful backdrop for Jim and his pals getting up to no good.One of my favourite films could you tell?

Although please don't be fooled by the above as the film only charts a mere fraction of his adolescent youth all of which is crammed into 97 minutes. But this is effective stuff. The acting is solid and at times superbin particular is Bruno Kirby's perverse turn as Basketball coach 'Swifty'even good old Ernie Ghostbusters Hudson makes his presence known with very subtle delivery especially as the film spirals deep into its very lucid heroine addiction centre. Stand out performances would have to go to Lorraine Bracco who plays Jim's tortured mother Mark Wahlbergs 'fresh off the street rebel swagger' is fantastic to watch and we can't forget Leo's own characterisation of Jim Carrol. Clearly Leo is far more comfortable in these kind of roles. With stand out performances covered it must have made it easier for director Scott Kalvert to concentrate on the look of the film. Which is wonderfully dark gritty and in places quite beautiful. The directors only faults are his interpretation of the time period. The time of Jim Carrol's life that is being portrayed here is the 1970's but when watching it you can't help but think it's more late 80's early 90's. Not too much wrong though a bit longer would have been nice. This could even be considered a strong honest 'don't do drugs lesson' for school children. and there's nothing wrong with that as this is a bold film with solid characterisation and fantastic imagery.

If you understand those two points then you already know everything The Basketball Diaries is trying to tell you. If you think the drug issue is any more complex than that then prepare to be disappointed by this movie.The movie started off somewhat promisingly with a look at the lives of Jim Caroll and his friends as interpreted by the moviemakers of course. The first part is in turns funny and sad and is generally realistic enough to be poignant.As soon as Leonardo diCaprio is forced to play someone spiralling into a nightmare of addiction however everything goes downhill. If this movie has any subtle or interesting point to make about drug abuse or society it forgets it here. It just goes back and forth between silly druginduced dreams and numerous scenes of petty crime filthy rooms and Jim looking increasingly corpselike.The main reason why this part of the movie seems so absurd is the performance of diCaprio himself. The scenes where he tries to get money from his mother and where he goes through withdrawal were so hammily overacted that I stopped being shocked and started laughing. Then I stopped laughing and started wanting to hit the mute button. There is one scene where he seems like he does nothing but moan maaaaaaaaaa... wahhhhh for minutes on end. There is a difference between drama and melodrama. It's clear that this movie can't resist portraying the latter at the expense of the former.Anyhow if you want a movie that will challenge you to think about the drug issue watch Traffic. If you want an afterschool special watch the Basketball Diaries.".

The first part is in turns funny and sad and is generally realistic enough to be poignant.As soon as Leonardo diCaprio is forced to play someone spiralling into a nightmare of addiction however everything goes downhill. If this movie has any subtle or interesting point to make about drug abuse or society it forgets it here. It just goes back and forth between silly druginduced dreams and numerous scenes of petty crime filthy rooms and Jim looking increasingly corpselike.The main reason why this part of the movie seems so absurd is the performance of diCaprio himself. The scenes where he tries to get money from his mother and where he goes through withdrawal were so hammily overacted that I stopped being shocked and started laughing. Then I stopped laughing and started wanting to hit the mute button. There is one scene where he seems like he does nothing but moan maaaaaaaaaa... wahhhhh for minutes on end. There is a difference between drama and melodrama. It's clear that this movie can't resist portraying the latter at the expense of the former.Anyhow if you want a movie that will challenge you to think about the drug issue watch Traffic. If you want an afterschool special watch the Basketball Diaries.";

His portrayal of Jim was so real and raw that he gave so much of himself to the role that it began to look effortless. So many scenes in this movie were beautifully done. A few stand out moments to name The basketball scene in the rain every confrontation between Jim and his mother and the Withdrawal scene where once again Leo gives a spine tingling performance. If you want to enjoy The Basketball diaries you must go into it with an open mind and take the film for what it is. It isn't a fancy modern stylized glamorized film about drugs but rather an honest raw bold and touching movie about the selfdestruction of a boy who falls head first into the harrowing world of drug addiction. This movie for me is an overlooked underrated piece of art. Which is why I love it. I wouldn't change one thing about it.".

If it wasnt for the run of the mill script this could have been a very powerful film unfortunately its doesnt reach its potential due to that.

The supporting cast is superb though Lorraine BracoGoodfellas Bruno KirbyCity Slikers Mark WahlbergBoogie Nights Ernie HudsonGhostbusters and Juliette LewisCape Fear From Dusk Till Dawn all give impressive performances.

The movie opens up with a narrative so the poor parents that took their kids to watch this movie could understand what is going on but it wouldn't change the fact that parents are guaranteed to be bored watching this. The movie takes place after season 3. The plot is just the same as the TV show predictable and obvious. The movie is mainly focused on kaiba's bitter rivalry with yugi because of not being able to handle being a sore loser after losing to a card game lasting 6 episodes from the previous season. The villain shows up at the last 10 minutes of the movie. The English dub is butchered with cheesy dialogue the animation lacks in quality compared to the TV show and the movie itself is boring. I recommend skipping this movie and go straight to watching season 4 and watch the abridged movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Scientists estimate that the average human being has around 100000000000 100 Billion brain cells or neurons and that after the age of 20 we tend to lose them at a rate of around 9000 neurons per day. There are activities that can enhance that such as sniffing paint or glue which can accelerate that loss to about 300000 a day...remarkable to say the least. In my own research this past week I have discovered that exposure to the new movie YuGiOh! makes the paint huffers of the world feel a little better about their eroding brain cells as I believe I may have lost in the area of about 1.6 billion neurons in the time span of an hour and a half.YuGiOh is a fantasy card game that has taken over our children's lives and depleted our parents pocketbooks of hardearned cash and has given us some of the most confusing conversations we have ever been subjected to. The cards have turned our sons and some daughters into poster children for ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder without any help in sight. Either my son is OCD or he is a genius but to follow this game with any type of success I suspect he would have to be a mixture of both.This leads me to YuGiOh! the movie. My 9 yearold son has problems with his handwriting he has issues with the use of pencils upsetting his tactile senses and his reading could be better but he can utilize the internet to find the release dates of ANY movie that may or may not be in production at any moment. I on other hand am lucky if I can remember to shave in the morning. Anyway he knew months in advance when this movie was coming out and quickly began to pine away the days with a sense of wistful yearning that is usually reserved for Sonic the Hedgehog and Spiderman...I knew at that very moment that my brain cells were at risk.In the weeks preceding the release of YuGiOh! I thought of so many ways to get out of seeing this celluloid nightmare. Maybe I would be called away to business in a Third World country...maybe I would be forced to sell soap to the criminally incarcerated...maybe I could pay a babysitter to go to the movie with him. In the end after debating with my ex and also realizing I was too poor to afford a babysitter I subjected myself to the experience.We arrived at the movie theater my son a portrait of unheralded joy with a hint of trembling angst and me saddled with the look of a man who has realized that the Governor is not going to call with a stay of execution...I am resigned to my own fate. As I expected we got MORE cards upon payment of the tickets though I did save some money by going to the matine so that's a positive. We started to the theater and as providence would have it the movie actually started early so we missed the first 3 minutes or so which probably saved me approximately 300000 neurons.I cannot remember that much about the actual movie but I do remember the plot and I use that term loosely was just what I thought it would be. It can be broken down into this easy to understand dialogueEnemy Guy I have this incredible card!YuGi Oh yeah? Well I have this incredible card!Enemy Guy Well you may think that but I have this card which combined with this other card makes your card obsolete!YuGi Ha! You only think that but I have this face down card that when combined with this magic card and this other spell card combine to create the ultimate monster that you could never dream of stopping!This goes on for an hour and a half. I am not kidding. I got you...you got me...I got you again. Finally someone got someone else and a card that was never before seen makes an appearance and changes the dynamics of the film. It was like watching theoretical Dungeons and Dragons geeks if they were to spar on ESPN only the latter would probably be more entertaining because of the commercials. Speaking of commercials this is literally an hour and a half infommercial. Finally its over...its over...its over. I keep having to assure myself that this is indeed the case. In the moments after I realize that I cannot remember the names of any of my teachers in grade school and that I can no longer pinpoint the exact moment when my hair began to recede. Thankfully these memories are not as important as others and YuGiOh! has not taken everything from me. The only thing I can actually remember from the movie is that the Blue Eyes Shining Dragon is not one to be trifle with.In closing I would be remiss if I did not quote that great sage Dean Vernon Wormer Fat drunk and stupid is no way to go through life son. After seeing YuGiOh! I might tend to disagree.".

While Kaiba and the Pharoah are in the pyramid of light any life points they lose will affect their physical life force. One problem with this movie is that It is the usual Kaibi wants to defeat Yugi plot that has been seen plenty of times in the show. It would have been a lot more interesting if they went in a similar direction to the Pokemon movies where team rocket are not the main villains but still somewhat relevant to the plot. Because of this direction the outcome is pretty predictable.I normally prefer dubs over subs but the dialogue in this movie is pretty cringeworthy. In one scene inside the Egyptian god puzzle Joey says I believe we're not in Kansas anymore which just felt forced and unnecessary.The biggest problem with the movie is the main villain Anibus who doesn't appear until near the end of the movie and by this point you just know that the pharaoh is going to make quick work of him.If you are a hardcore fan of the anime you may enjoy this movie but otherwise I do not recommend it.".

Now had the movie focused on the gang's battle against Anubis then it would have been watchable.Then the monkey wench came in the form of 2 words Seto Kaiba. Maximillion Pegasus appears but he ain't the villain. And even the evil sorcerer Anubis can't be the big bad he only appears for about 10 seconds egxagerating here. Nope it's Kaiba and his obsession to beat Yugi this guy needs a hobby! that drives the movie start to finish.Anyone who has watched the anime knows how annoying Kaiba can be. You'd think that if the guy runs a multinational corporation he'd have a brain. But even Kaiba can't figure out something's wrong when Anubis whispers in his ear and the monster attacks physically hurt the duelist. Guess he doesn't have a brain! The movie simply combines 2 good elements that mix to form nothing A card game and an undead evil. Picture the cast of The Mummy playing poker and you'll get an idea of how bad the movie was. It was basically a 90 minute episode of Yugioh. It contributes nothing to the anime and actually creates a huge plot hole the opening sequence mentions Yugi has been dueling for 3 years meaning that seasons 3 and 4 in the anime take place at least 2 years apart. And the Pyramid of Light is never mentioned ever again nor is Anubis and all cards seen in the film are never seen again either. If I as a fan didn't like this movie how enjoyable do you think it would be for a nonfan? Save yourself an hour an a half and skip seeing this.".

Essentially a guy decides to destroy the world. the only difference between this plot and billions of others? The entire movie is about a card game!!!! yes while playing this game the poorly drawn and hilariously named monsters on the cards come to life !!!! in the form of holograms to destroy the world!!! My biggest question about this movie is why do none of the characters simply forgo the dam card game and just shoot the guy in the knees? Does it not occur to anyone in the entire city that it would be far less time consuming and way less expensive to just buy a gun as opposed to buying thousands of booster packs of cards?".

If however you have enough of your senses to check your watch in frustration you'll recognize this film for the complete and utter garbage it was. The plot is chockfull of bizarre inaccuracies Anubis the Egyptian God with a dog's head comes back as a buff blonde sorcerer! which will leave anyone confused even those who's knowledge of Egyptian history extends as far as the The Mummy series.Now I recognize that today 90 of kids animated movies are pretty cheesy but almost every phrase out of these characters' mouths are hamhanded references to destiny and believing in yourself and never giving up. And this is the worst bit I don't hate this movie because it was based on a cartoon. I have seen the cartoons both the original Japanese and the 4Kids versions and they weren't nearly as bad as this hell I thought some of it was really cool. But this movie like the 'Pokemon' movies and like the 'Mortal Kombat 'and 'Street Fighter' movies is the extremely unfortunate result of big business trying to cash in on what is ostensibly a current fad before popularity dies. Unfortunately like all the aforementioned franchises in retrospect this movie will undoubtedly have done more to kill the franchise than to boost it.".

It's a movie for the fans made to sell trading cards. I still play that game and find it as fun as ever. This film is in short a movie for people who like the YuGiOh series not any one else. The animation is mediocre. Not bad or good. The story? Very standard YuGiOh filler story. The villain has no motives what so ever but that's the case with many children's films. There is actually a nice build up to him but when he appears it's a disappointment. He has one good line Soon the worms will feed on your flesh just as they did on mine. The acting? Standard. The music? Super special awesome! They did really put effort into the soundtrack and it shows or is heard... The songs and the music is very good and are placed well.The movie is a spin off of a TVseries based on a manga. The manga or at least the 7 first volumes are great. It was a very dark story about a bullied teenager named Yugi who got possessed by an ancient Egyptian spirit. The spirit was a sadist with a thing for sick gamesif you loosed you could die but with a strong sense of right and wrong. There where some good stories and we sometimes meet up with other mystical people with the same game powers as the Spirit. The card game did not appear until volume 2 which was a story that featured a Magic the Gathering tribute. In that story the monsters in the cards came to life a very inventive story. It was quite popular and spawned a followup in later volumes. That story was great too and was about Yugi and his friends being captured by a psychotic childor rather teen billionaire named Seto Kaiba who put them in a Sawlike labyrinth. The story culminated in a card game between the Yugi and Seto.The card game became very popular and soon took over the entire series resulting in the anim which only featured the card game.If your kid wants to see this film let him. But don't watch it with him. Because you won't get it and if I wheren't a fan I wound't either.But if you like this film or not you will love Martin Billany's ingenious spoof httpwww.imdb.comtitlett1781955".

I am from Romania so I can't put it exactly how this kind of entertainment affects American children o other children in the world but to put it shortly.. it's like people forgetting who Abraham Lincoln was!";

If I wanted to see people play cards I would go to Las Vegas and play cards. At least the don't have crappy little drawings on them and you win money. If you thinking about seeing it then don't. It also has the most worse drawings ever since Speed Racer and that show actually was funny after a while cause he always made a stupid face. The only way I would watch that movie again would to sit there laughing my ass off at how crappy this movie is. So don't waste your money on this movie. This movie does't even deserve a 1 it deserves a negative 1 with three zeros on it and it's literally lowest at the worst movie's ever made chart. I would actually rename it and make the name YuGiOh Death of the Crappy Shattering Animation.".

	schema:headline " Not for people who haven't watched the show! slight spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "Okay every single official review of this movie that I have seen says it was basically the worst movie ever or at least a contender. And yet all of my friends who saw it thought it was awesome. Neither my friends nor I'm assuming the reviewers are stupid people so there must be some reason for the huge discrepancy. The reason clearly is that we are people who have watched a lot of the show and already have an appreciation for the complexities of the characters and ideas in it. This movie is simply not made for people who are viewing it with little or no context. That's all there is to it.Of course it's true that the plot is terribly contrived the characters not very thoroughly drawn at all and a good deal of the time taken up with the card game. Is it just a merchandising ploy? Well yes it is a merchandising ploy but that doesn't mean that that's all it isin fact if you know how to play the card game and know all the different cards and their significance much of the dueling is quite interesting. Is the plot nothing but a clichd save the world from evil sort of plot? Well...it's more that way than I personally would have done had I been given the task of making a Yugioh movieI would have ignored all the ancient Egyptian and God Card stuff and focused perhaps on Kaiba's history and relationship with Yugi and Joey or something. But let's face it especially in America the main market for this movie was preadolescent boys and they tend to like powerful evil beings trying to take over the world. So I understand why they had to make it that way. Not my first choice but understandable. The significance placed on the God Cards is also quite annoying. In fact in the show they are not used the same wayYugi does not keep them in his deck. But they wanted to use them here. Kinda stupid but whatever.All that said in my opinion within the framework of creating a movie based on a show that revolves around this card game and needing to make it marketable in the right way they did an awesome job making the movie funny and interesting for people who know the characters and the show. Everyone I've talked to agrees that the dialogue between Kaiba and Pegasus is priceless. If you don't know Kaiba and Pegasus you can't appreciate the line Do you ever shut up? I know what it means! If you've watched Duelist Kingdom you'll find it funny. Same for many other such lines.One thing I especially appreciated was the role given to Yugi himself. The Pharaoh Yugi's other half isn't actually the hero of the movie which is nice. Without little Yugi persisting inside the puzzle during the duel the Pharaoh would have been toast. The movie made no attempt to make Yugi cooler than he is which I was afraid it might. They let him be an innocent shy short little high school kid not your typical hero.Kaiba is an excellent example of why one needs to have watched the show to get the depth of the movie. They don't do much to develop Kaiba's personality so it really helps to go into the movie already having an appreciation of it. If you do then you'll find his struggles against the influence of Anubis to be interesting and you'll understand his internal conflicts and appreciate the significance of his throwing the Shining Dragon card to Yugi.Basically overall I would never suggest that this movie could stand on its own as a great accomplishment of cinematic drama. Not even close. It's for people who appreciate the show and all the characters and symbolism of it and who are willing to accept that a somewhat contrived and overdramatic plot was necessary for marketing and who will enjoy the dialogue and character interaction and even the dueling. If you don't like it fine. Not all movies have to be for everyone. But if you're not a fan of the show then you have to realize that you're not going to get much out of the movie. That doesn't mean it's the worst movie ever made it means you're not the right person to appreciate it. Personally I thought it was amusing and interesting.".

	schema:reviewBody "Finally got to see YuGiOh the Movie for myself and find out what the hype was all about.After watching it all I can say is I'm glad I didn't buy the ticket with my own money.Before I begin let me just say that those who say that the voice acting here is very good are both deaf and probably have the IQ level of a monkey's. That being said let's begin.Not much has changed in the YuGiOh movie. The animation is the same as the one that comes out on TV virtually no color depth light shading or added cels to enhance the fluidity of motions in the characters and the voice actors are with the exception of Kaiba and Pegasus pure crap then again when was 4Kids ever known for good VAs? insert sarcastic laugh here.For those of you who don't know or who haven't seen the flick yet I discourage you from reading the rest of this because it's a spoiler. Basically the story revolves around Yugi Moto and how he is the King of Monsters blah blah blah. We all know he became so darn good because once he finished completing the Millennium Puzzle he was suddenly inhabited by the spirit of Pharoah. No name for this Pharaoh. Why? I'd like to know that myself.Anyway unbeknownst to Yugi when he released Pharoah he also released Anubis the stereotypical ancientuberbad guycomebacktolifetocontinuewhathedidinlife to wait for it.... DESTROY THE WORLD bum bum bum dramatic reverb! So its up to Yugi and his friends mostly Yugi to kick this guy's tuckus and send Anubis back from whence he came.Pretty straightforward no? Not to mention predictableThe plot is very very simple. Good guy runs into bad guy. Bad guy wants to destroy the world in the most horrible way possible even though the reason for wanting to destroy said world is never discussed. Good guy inevitably beats bad guy against all odds because good guy has the cause of justice going for him and everyone lives happily ever after content once again that good has triumphed over evil well that's what wishful thinking is all about.Character development is shot all to HE double toothpicks. Those who are hardcore fans for YuGiOh will undoubtedly know which bozo is which and will probably ignore this lapse. But Joe Average? Fuggedaboutit! Before we really know what drives characters other than Yugi to do what they do the next duel is on! Why does Joey keep talking tough even though he usually ends up flat on his face? Why do Yugi's friends keep trying to help him save the world when no one could care less whether they exist or not due to Yugi's overwhelming presencehe IS the star and title of the show.? Why does Tea even try to show some scrap of independence and fire when in the end she's nothing more than spare baggage? If Pegasus really wanted to keep the Shining Blue Eyes out of Kaiba's hands why did he opt to duel with him instead of just having a whole battalion of guards smoke Kaibaboy? In the end why did Pegasus even bother saving Yugi's grandparent and friends when he was once the bad guy a long time ago? If Anubis was a powerful as he said he was why didn't he just bring all of his monsters to life and and wreak havoc on the world instead of engaging Yugi in a duel? The fate of the world is on the line and you two are settling it with CARDS!?In other words what drives the characters to make the decisions the made? What makes them do what they do? Is any of this explored? Oh no no no.So what we have are 2Dimensional characters thrust into some meaningless but nevertheless visually entertaining dance and whom we wouldn't care less about if they died or not as long as Yugi came through.Shonen Jump4Kids Entertainment duh We think that the game is so popular that even those who don't play the game know the show. So we trust that they uh will all under...unerst...get it. Ahyuk!The sense of excitement and suspense is also destroyed by Yugi being portrayed as the typical invincible male hero who can never do anything wrong and who always comes out at the top with the winning combination. How in blue blazes can you root for a guy you know will win anyways? Where's the fun in that? Like Kaiba I was so waiting for him to finally trounce Yugi after hearing the little twerp preach about the heart of the cards and the power of friendship. But then I remembered this is Yugi the guy who never EVER gets anything as horrible as a bad hand or a bad draw. So I was forced to sit through a 90min. movie waiting for the inevitable to happen. Yugi Wins Again. All I can say is THANK GOD FOR ROOTBEER!The dialogue is one of the most mediocre things I have ever had the displeasure of hearing. Never have I seen a movie filled to brimming with corny oneliners and clichs after clichs in a pathetic attempt to be funny. When Joey said I coulda been a contender I was this close to flinging my drink at the screen but you'd have to be crazy to throw away a perfectly good 2liters of rootbeer. I've heard better comebacks and lines from a turkey sandwich. I was looking for snappy and witty lines like the ones from Tarzan Treasure Planet The Power Puff girls or The Simpsons. Instead I got dialogue written by melodramatic halfwits who probably have delusions of being the next Shakespeare.I think I could have ignored the horrible dialogue if the voice actors had just been brilliant VAs like Charlie Adler Hank Azaria April Winchell Tom Kenny Nick Backay Nicole Sullivan Emma Thompson or Richard Horvitz. Instead I'm stuck with Bclass people like Wayne Grayson and Dan Green!? AAAAAAAGGGGHHHH!!!!!The sound and music is forgettable at best. Who sang these songs? The Alan Parson's Project or Wangchung? Ugh!And the movie like the TV series can never just end without Yugi or one of his friends launching into their long rhetoric about the heart of the cards or the importance of the power of friendship. How in hell can the power of friendship influence the way the tides of a duel turns? Even if you got your whole crew of 20 backing you up if you're going up against a guy with more experience and better cards and strategies then you are going down. The only time the power of friendship works is if you take that crew of twenty of yours and mess up the guy who beat you in some dark alley and make a break for it before the cops come. That's the real power of friendship! When Yugi broke into his speech again during the final minutes I had to tell myself Must...resist...the...urge...to...fall...into...a. ..coma. Why do movies like Pokemon and YuGiOh and Beyblade never fail to preach? Talk about your selfrighteous streak!Perhaps the only redeeming parts of the movie were the showing of the new cards and monsters and the duels themselves which showed some pretty nifty combos and attacks and counterattacks that can be used in the game. Unfortunately only the card players will understand any of the duels.All in all YuGiOh the Movie is a watch once. Fans cannot blame the average movie watcher's ignorance of the game for them not liking the movie. The movie is nothing more than a longer version of the TV series. It's just not memorable. My dad has never heard of Tarzan but he enjoyed the animated movie from Disney immensely. My mother has never read Treasure island but was glued to the screen when Treasure Planet came to town. YuGiOh preaches too much and patronizes kids waaay too much. Adults in the theater kept looking at their watches praying for the flick to end while I was ready to screw the head of the next brat behind me who yelled That's Blue Eyes White Dragon! I have that card! To which his idiot companion responded with equal volume My Exodia can beat that!!I guess I'm just thankful that YuGiOh the Movie is not as brain dead as Dragonball Z.For diehard YuGiOh fans you'll probably like this. For others looking for a movie with more depth and a meatier story stay far far faaaaar away from this flick as humanly possible.".

Fans cannot blame the average movie watcher's ignorance of the game for them not liking the movie. The movie is nothing more than a longer version of the TV series. It's just not memorable. My dad has never heard of Tarzan but he enjoyed the animated movie from Disney immensely. My mother has never read Treasure island but was glued to the screen when Treasure Planet came to town. YuGiOh preaches too much and patronizes kids waaay too much. Adults in the theater kept looking at their watches praying for the flick to end while I was ready to screw the head of the next brat behind me who yelled That's Blue Eyes White Dragon! I have that card! To which his idiot companion responded with equal volume My Exodia can beat that!!I guess I'm just thankful that YuGiOh the Movie is not as brain dead as Dragonball Z.For diehard YuGiOh fans you'll probably like this. For others looking for a movie with more depth and a meatier story stay far far faaaaar away from this flick as humanly possible.";

At the time I actually saw it in the theater snuck in of course hoping maybe that the film might be slightly different from the onesided approach on the TV show that makes Pokemon look like Miyazaki. I knew that there was also a whole big trading card side to the whole shebang but that maybe the filmmakers might forgo that for an actual story or at least one or two characters to have some sort of interest in at least in Pokemon there was the villains out to stop Pikachu and those other kids. After about 30 minutes of the film I started to get the same sensation I felt having seen Digimon in the theater years before the sensation of being numbed by overthetop hideous displays of anime via lots and lots and lots of battles between characters that I couldn't give a hoot about. So much is invested into making the cardplayers with their animals fight off incredibly stylish and colorful which here and there it was they forgot that they're making a movie. If it was something just short and small to show at an anime or comicbook convention fine but not for 90 minutes! After said 30 minutes I did a rarity on my part which was to walk out feeling that even though something was sort of going on with the character of Yugi going into Egypt for some rare creature to face off or whatever there wasn't anything really to see more of that I didn't already get bombarded with already. It's got more flashy gimmicks than a magician hopped up on 10 cups of Starbucks but nothing really goes on that redeems all of this with content. For the fanboys of the series or the cards or maybe for the most diehard of KIDS anime shows and flicks it might be worth a look or a glance though its current status on the IMDb bottom 100 is not really without merit. Pretty disposable as I remember it.".

Anyone who knows YuGiOh knows that 4Kids does an OK job at best editing and dubbing the original anime for American viewers. So how could they treat a movie? Especially one that they made themselves?I'm pleased to announce that for once 4Kids did a good job. The plot was well written. For starters it made sense. It managed to incorporate the show's past while not giving away its future. In fact the only spoiler was for the end of Battle City. As if we had any doubts In regards to that I was pleasantly surprised that more was not given away regarding the Battle City Championship. It made that part of the show still worth watching.Most of our favorite characters were portrayed similar to how they are in the show. Except for maybe Kaiba but that's a matter of opinion There were great duels some of the best I've seen yet in fact. Duels that can leave you on the edge of your seat. And one has to love new monsters. And free promo cards.As a fan I was both surprised and pleased with the content and pace of the movie. It had some more subtle adult humor which I found refreshing as an adult fan. I'm almost 20 Also it moved a lot quicker than the show because they weren't explaining every move in the duel and why they were doing it like they do in the show.All in all I've seen this movie twice and I enjoyed it both times. First I saw it with my mom who had never seen the show but had to admit it was still a good movie once I answered her questions and explained who was who. The next time I took my 16 yr old sister who had never seen the show but is now a converted fan. Any movie that can capture new fans can't be that bad. I think that if you just give it a chance then it could definitely be worth seeing.".

Anubis seems to be the villain here. Nowcome on. Any idiot knows Anubis wasn't ever human. he was a dietythe God of Afterlife judgment. The whole Pyramid of Light concept was okaybut I wouldn't have called it a Millennium Item. It wasn't even gold plated for Ra's sake! I liked the fights with the corpse. ButI will say this.

Especially if you are working class and come from the UK.How it is viewed elsewhere is beyond my telling but reading reviews on this site I get the impression that people from all over the world can relate to its central themes  even if the locations and accents are alien.Director Franc Roddam was smart enough to cast a young Phil Daniels in the central role of Jimmy. Daniels is a good actor but he is neither smooth or particularly good looking. This prevents him being accused of glamorising some of the things that he gets up to.Jimmy is indeed also a bit naive. He has a boring job in the post room of an advertising agency note the satire about pushing smoking  this is the no health warning 60's! and rides around on a scooter with lots of lights on the front.Life for him is about getting through the day and partying at nightweekends to the hip sounds of the day  the nonWho soundtrack album is a taster to mid 60's Brit Pop.His parents don't understand him either  but this could be taken as read in this style of movie!As most of us know and a few even tell Jimmy in the movie proper Life cannot be all parties cheap thrills and gang fights but he doesn't seem to want to listen. He is one of the world's great there must be more to life than this merchants  in this he is right but you need to be brighter better educated or better looking to have it. There is a good cast of British new wavers on show here Leslie Ash plays Jimmy's love interest and Sting gets to be the Ace Face  the good looking top dog mod that Jimmy wants to be. The home truth about this character leaves Jimmy even more exposed.Quadrophenia is one of the greatest films about being a teenager ever made and thank god we have video cassettes DVDs and cablesat TV so people can actually see it. A low budget classic that deserves to seen at least once by all film buffs and several times if it reflects your life in any way.".

I identified in some respects with the main character Jimmy and his life was bleak and depressing. Seeing it over 20 years later I love it!  It's a superb mix of the 1960s British Angry Young Men films the Who's great album and 1979 sensibilities.  It's about Jimmy excellent performance by Phil Daniels and his friends.  It takes place in 1964 London and there are constant battles between the Mods Jimmy and friends and the Rockers.  The film is full of violence sex VERY strong language good luck with the accents anger alienation...the works.  However there is a strong sense of humor a break in at a drug store is hilarious and it does have a sort of happy ending. But it is very dark and depressing.  The music score is excellent.  It's not just the Who but other 1960s groups are used also.  The direction by Franc Roddam is wonderfulit perfectly merges the music imagery and story especially with Love Reign Over Me. My only real complaintwhy not use the whole album Quadrophenia?  Only about 18 of the two record set is used!  Also interesting to see Sting in his first movie.  Don't miss this one!".

	schema:reviewBody "Franc Roddam the director of Quadrophenia did not disappoint me with his interpretation of The Who's rock opera unlike Tommy which had it's moments but didn't was all over the map so to speak. He lets a viewer who may not be entirely familiar to what occurred between the mods and the rockers in the early to mid 1960's Britain in on what the energy the attitudes were like among the young and old. It's not even classifiable as a rock opera as a film because it becomes a hybrid it's part motorcycle flick with some well staged intense fight scenes rumbles riots etc it's part antiestablishmentarianist take on what it's like to be at an age when you don't know what to do you with your life and outside of the pleasures of being with friends and kicking' ass you tend to be aimless or work for people you don't like. It's also major in fact a psychological character study of one of these antiestablishment kids a mod named Jimmy Phil Daniels who may be a little off balance in the head due to a fueling desire to be both with the excitement of his gang and with his need to find himself by himself as well as to the blues pills.There isn't as much of a story as there is character development which sticks true to the source material written by the clever and driving force of The Who Pete Townsend. As Jimmy goes through parties fights a little love with a girl Steph played well by Leslie Ash a riot and problems with his parents and job he enters a downward spiral. This is a tricky sort of story and character to pull off because lay it on too thick and the audience could see the character as naive and perhaps the character is which makes sense in a sense but add on the toughness and onedimensional side of the biker attitude and it becomes a Bmovie motorcycle flick. This doesn't happen. Somehow the elements come together in the film with the performances by the way Sting's debut performance is both mysterious and ultimately kinda funny the documentarystyle direction and editing by Brian Trainspotting Tefano and the music. The Who themselves serve as musical directors and it's highly interesting for both Who and nonWho fans in how they choose only parts of songs sometimes Punk and the Godfather Dr. Jimmy and leave some out completely Sea and Sand Drowned two songs I hoped would've made the final cut. By the time the third act reaches it's heated peak the music starts to perfectly embody what the character's going through. It also doesn't come off as cheesy due to the power of the songs.Maybe I might be a little biased in writing this review when I was around seventeen eighteen years old this was my favorite album behind Jimi Hendrix's Are You Experienced. Besides it containing some of the Who's most daring somber and fun work 515 Bell Boy I'm One the story was something that I could identify with strongly as its themes are very knowing of what it's like for any guy at that point of crossing the bend from childhood to adulthood. Not to mention it rivaled Tommy in its ambition via the compositions the entertainment value etc. So I was almost hesitant to watch the film as I thought I might have my expectations raised too high and it would be too loosely translated and made as not my kind of rock musical i.e. like Tommy. For me the experience was contradictory to what I thought I ended up learning more about this atmosphere the essence of living in Brighton by the beach and feeling the need for competition acceptance and then anger and loneliness. By the end of Quadrophenia I looked at Jimmy as being a character in the tradition of Humphrey Bogart in Treasure of the Sierra Madre an antihero that may be doomed but a viewer can still care about him. Overall an unexpected treat and will surely please both Who and nonWho fans alike though for Who fans the added treat is that the the emotion and strength of the group and songs translate excellently in the film.

I'm just a bit too young to remember anything about the vicious Mods v Rockers pitched battles at Brighton or the Mod lifestyle I'm not sure just how far north it made it up to Scotland it always seemed to me principally a Londonbased movement.Nevertheless the broader themes in the film of the generation gap between teenagers and their parents the pain of rejection youthful revolt against authority plus the less intellectual need for young kids to get drunk drugged violent and sexed up are universal and seemingly constant which with the background of great 60's music made for an engrossing and enjoyable if occasionally challenging watch.This is Phil Daniel's Jimmy Fenton's worm's eyeview of life in the mid60's working in a deadend job out of touch with his parents and although on the face of it there doesn't appear to be much to rebel against sure enough he loses his way and his mind as he suffers rejection from his employer said parents wouldbe girlfriend Leslie Ash and after seeing his Mod Hero 'aceface played by Sting meekly conform to society mores carrying bags at a hotel he gets pushed over the edge literally. His only way out of the tormenting feelings he's experiencing for the first time sadly involve just a oneway ticket.The film adopts a realistic warts and all approach with no letup in the levels of bad language used scenes of drug use although it is only pillpopping uppers or blues as they're called in the film and of course the centrepiece of the film the recreation of the infamous Mods and Rockers Battle Of Brighton of 1965. There's some earthy humour though to leaven things particularly two Mods encounter in the dark with a bunch of sleeping rockers although one or two stray elements of sentimentality Jimmy's heartto heart with his longsuffering dad his friendship with an old pal turned rocker slightly jar. Fan as I am I could have done too without the too obvious genuflecting to the film's producers The Who Jimmy putting on the My Generation single at a party then gazing in awe at the band on Ready Steady Go I guess he who pays the piper and all that.Central to the movie is a superb performance by Daniels as Jimmy his moodswings oscillating violently as he takes or comes off his pills wired to the moon as we say today. His energy and vividness set the tone for the whole film. Interestingly director Franc Roddam later the creator of Auf Weidersehn Pet and ...er Masterchef on TV changes the ending and placement of songs from the album but there's no denying the memorable climax to the piece.In the end I was transported not only back into the era depicted but more importantly into the head of helpless dancer Jimmy and would state that the movie well complements the great album The Who originally released a rarity in rock movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a fabulous movie that goes far beyond the usual onedimensional teenager struggleswithsociety'sconformity tale. In it the main character Jimmy has got a good job but which seems pointless to him. He's a member of a posse of Mods a midsixties image group that included quasiBeatlesstyle clothes and haircuts the use of Vespa scooters and of course sex drugs and rock 'n' roll.Jimmy hates the conformity as symbolized by his TVwatching emotionallydetached parents and dreads the prospect of becoming an icecold working stiff. Bus as time passes he begins to squirm in the conformity imposed by being a Mod a conformity so ruthless it costs him a friendship.Everything that seems to be a key to happiness whether it's romance with Steph a beautiful member of his posse or taking part in a kind of Mod Woodstock or adoring the King of the Mods played perfectly by Sting or even just trying to escape it all aboard his trusty Vespa becomes a dead end of conformity.Throughout the movie his frustration is building and he can't figure out why. In the end he finally realizes the source of his anguish and without giving anything away addresses the heart of the matter.Excellent performances in this movie though the accents will be downright impenetrable for some viewers great directing strong writing and of course it marvelously portrays the Mod lifestyle. All the groups shown in the movie can be taken as symbols for just about any community you could think of.Best of all the soundtrack is superb. Unfortunately you can't really get the sense of it just watching the movie so pick up the CD if you like The Who it's one of their very best.Overall a mustsee.".

	schema:reviewBody "First as you perhaps can tell by my name I'm a diehard The Who fan and have been for a long time. Listening to the original Quadrophenia rock opera is almost a religious act for me. I also have to add that I was born in 1984 and the sixties for me are some kind of paradise perished forever. I had to wait several years after listening to the album before seeing the movie. During the first half hour I was disappointed how few of the music was in it but then the movie began to fascinate me by itself it really dragged me in. This is mostly due to the great Phil Daniels. It is his portrait of Jim that really keeps the film alive. He is the mod of the sixties he shows in every single scene why they were mods and why it couldn't last. The other actors also do a good job nothing spectacular but solid. Sting is entertaining too. There are several changes in the story compared to the Quadrophenia CD booklet but they make sense and work well. It would have been interesting to stay still closer to the rock opera but regarding that when the movie was made more than a decade had passed since the time depicted it is understandable that the movie makers wouldn't want to go totally musical as in the pathetic Tommy film. Quadrophenia in my opinion is better than Tommy because the story isn't torn to pieces and then mixed with tons of whatever they had left on the cutting room floor it is a coherent line of events with the songs put in in the right moment except perhaps for the divine Love reign o'er me. Over all the movie really thrilled me. It is a very good adaptation of the rock opera but also a great youth film in its own right. Call it cult if you don't like it it has deserved it.".

Better still this film acquires extra potency and resonance because of its harshly realistic and unsentimental tone complete with a mixedup protagonist who's more interesting than sympathetic a grim central message on how misapplied rebellion can lead to isolation rather than liberation and a devastating gut punch of a downbeat ending in which Jimmy learns a painful lesson about how selfdiscovery can't be acquired by simply glomming onto the latest teen trend that's fashionable at the moment. Leslie Ash contributes an appealing turn as the lovely and sassy yet ultimately unattainable Steph Sting makes a striking impression as the charismatic Ace Face and Ray Winstone acquits himself well as the scruffy Kevin.

The images I tend to conjure of this important era in Britain's history is that of The Beatles running from a screaming crowd of ecstatic girls in A Hard Day's Night 1964. While Richard Lester's film has the fortune of being made at the time this movement was thriving it's lighthearted fare albeit a terrific one.Quadrophenia doesn't pull its punches and portrays the mods in particular the young alienated Jimmy Phil Daniels in all of their roughandtumble amphetaminepopping glory. Adorned in the latest fashion and riding around London on his customised scooter Jimmy funds his lifestyle by begrudgingly working as a post room boy for the kind of stiffupperlipped types he loathes. Outside of his job he is a living nightmare for his parents constantly out all hours listening to rock music with his friends and popping blue uppers to keep him on edge.He is romantically invested in Steph Leslie Ash who is currently involved with another chap but after he does finally sleep with her he discovers that the experience didn't have the same lasting effect it did on him. Jimmy also learns that his friend Kevin Ray Winstone fresh out of the army is a rocker and therefore an enemy. A sense of alienation builds inside of the protagonist with only the sense of belonging within the gang and cheap drugs to help drag him through his depression. It all builds up to a visit to Brighton where along with supercool mod Ace Face Sting meet up for a huge brawl with a gang of rockers.Backed by a terrific soundtrack from The Who Quadrophenia recreates a fashion craze now longgone and does so convincingly with a real sense of time and place. Jimmy and his gang are all workingclass slumping through deadend jobs to fund their lifestyle in spite of their humble upbringings infusing the film with a sense of social awareness. The group show no desire whatsoever to fit in the social structure of a society they feel is unfair with Jimmy in particular feeling left hung out to dry. But the most impressive aspect of the film is the young Phil Daniels as the raging tearaway whose character often treads dangerously close to being plain loathsome. He plays the role with an irresistible charm and swagger that make him entirely sympathetic. An underrated cult gem.".

	schema:reviewBody "Directed by Franc Roddam and produced by The Who this partnership brings us one of most grittiest and realistic movies of the late 1970's set in London during the Swinging Sixties at the height of the clash of the two dominating working class subculture's Mod's and Rocker's. During their heyday the Mods and Rockers would converge in the Seaside town of Brighton and their differences would end in extreme conflict.The Who were the biggest Mod band during the sixties feeding off each other for inspiration's such as dance moves and fashion's for example's. What they also had in common were the use of drug's both the Mod's and The Who would be taking Speed a drug that would help keep them awake and hyperactive far longer than the body and mind could sometimes cope. After the sixties had ended and the Mods and Rockers had passed away and other fads fashions and ideals had emerged during the Glam Rock day's of the early Seventies The Who produced a concept album the reminiscent Quadrophenia. A double vinyl album that came out in 1973 and the story being about Jimmy the Mod. Being a mental condition similar to schizophrenia were the illness is spilt into two traits the Quadrophenia sufferer has a four way split though not hearing voices as such but still a mental degeneration in it's own right. Jimmy who is the recipient of this condition due to the over use of the drugs and booze that his working class life style dictates.As time went by the late '70's had arrived and The Who were delving into movie production. Quadrophenia the movie had arrived. Starring up and coming English actresses and actor's as Phil Daniels as Jimmy Leslie Ash as Steph and Toyah Wilcox as Monkey. This movie too contains some of the most realistic and extremely harsh language that I have heard in a movie the London locations are great as well as the wonderful scooters that are ridden by these pilledup Wild Ones very nostalgic. To see Jimmy and his two mates riding along Tower Bridge late at night to score drugs for the Brighton meet is well nice.The musical score is as you would expect from a Who soundtrack Thunderous and poignant and Townsends' lyrics' delving into the troubled mindset of this young protagonist as a Physiatrist that delves and then reports his findings to his audience.

You have to remember that the movie is of Jimmy the boy the boy who is betrayed by his best friend his girlfriend and let down by his parents.

The irony is that being a Mod is not to be like anyone else to be different from the heard.

	onyx:emotionText "Directed by Franc Roddam and produced by The Who this partnership brings us one of most grittiest and realistic movies of the late 1970's set in London during the Swinging Sixties at the height of the clash of the two dominating working class subculture's Mod's and Rocker's. During their heyday the Mods and Rockers would converge in the Seaside town of Brighton and their differences would end in extreme conflict.The Who were the biggest Mod band during the sixties feeding off each other for inspiration's such as dance moves and fashion's for example's. What they also had in common were the use of drug's both the Mod's and The Who would be taking Speed a drug that would help keep them awake and hyperactive far longer than the body and mind could sometimes cope. After the sixties had ended and the Mods and Rockers had passed away and other fads fashions and ideals had emerged during the Glam Rock day's of the early Seventies The Who produced a concept album the reminiscent Quadrophenia. A double vinyl album that came out in 1973 and the story being about Jimmy the Mod. Being a mental condition similar to schizophrenia were the illness is spilt into two traits the Quadrophenia sufferer has a four way split though not hearing voices as such but still a mental degeneration in it's own right. Jimmy who is the recipient of this condition due to the over use of the drugs and booze that his working class life style dictates.As time went by the late '70's had arrived and The Who were delving into movie production. Quadrophenia the movie had arrived. Starring up and coming English actresses and actor's as Phil Daniels as Jimmy Leslie Ash as Steph and Toyah Wilcox as Monkey. This movie too contains some of the most realistic and extremely harsh language that I have heard in a movie the London locations are great as well as the wonderful scooters that are ridden by these pilledup Wild Ones very nostalgic. To see Jimmy and his two mates riding along Tower Bridge late at night to score drugs for the Brighton meet is well nice.The musical score is as you would expect from a Who soundtrack Thunderous and poignant and Townsends' lyrics' delving into the troubled mindset of this young protagonist as a Physiatrist that delves and then reports his findings to his audience. During the opening scene a silhouette of Jimmy walking back up from the cliff tops is seen.

	schema:reviewBody "If Easy Rider proved the elegiac tombstone for the 1960s American dream Quadrophenia happily tosses up a vsign as its British counterpart. It's as rousing and evocative a portrait of youth culture and the stagnation and selfdestructive impotence of aimless rebellion as any with a scrappy sense of fck it helping keep its angst in check. A cornerstone of '70s British cinema Quadrophenia may tread debatably intentionally familiar ground in its microcosmic coming of age parable in 1960s mods 'n rockers England but with the guitars synths and Daltry blaring and the scooters growling it's hard not to be swept up in its infectious furious and often beautiful listlessness. Although Quadrophenia is adapted from the second rock opera by the almost peerlessly superb the Who gone are the trippy surrealist musical trappings of Tommy's big screen debut. Instead director Franc Roddam skews for gritty period authenticity in conveying the war for 1960s British youth culture which is strikingly immersive in the uncanny disjuncture between immaculately precise fashion and the grimy bloody and emotionally fraught world the mods and rockers throw down in. We have our uppers Jimmy grinning infectiously as he trawls around in his beloved scooter dancing like a maniac on the rafters of a mod club and the film's centrepiece beach brawlriot startlingly believable in its kinetic infectious we are the mods braying frenzy. We have our downers Jimmy's burnout downward spiral being thrown out by a screeching mother and erupting at the prissy boss of his soulless day job is so flamboyant even one of his mod buds whispers Is there trouble at home? like a concerned parent in one of the film's many viciously funnysad moments. Either way as the band themselves quip blood flows and the music is the film's lifeblood here pounding away with an ace soundtrack by the Kinks and Yardbirds as well as the incomparable Who. Granted even in 1979 Quadrophenia's howl of adolescent angst felt like something we'd heard too many times before amidst the countless radio broadcasts warning of the psychotic epidemic of the teenagers and their flamin' rock music. Still Roddamn and the Who cough up every ounce of passion in revisiting it while the inevitable Stingbellboy twist collapses the entire pipe dream with a hilarious sombre reflexivity. All the while Roddamn rounds the package with a pinch of haunting iconicity  Jimmy brooding and pacing by the pier at Brighton like a mod Rebel Without a Cause and zooming across the cliffs on his scooter are the definitive ones but his bugeyed manic panic slathered in eyeshadow on the 515 train as the Who's titular track blares is also one for the ages. Familiar as Jimmy's tribulations may be Quadrophenia pulses with vibrant urgency lending his journey the allconsuming urgency that only a teenager's crisis can conjure. Apart from the ongoing game of 'spot the future star' in the cast of wholly convincing British supporting players hi Ray Winstone and Timothy Spall! Phil Daniels gives a blistering harshly believable performance as Jimmy embodying the overstimulating torments of adolescent life with enough of a frantic scrappy magnetism to remain wanly sympathetic even in the midst of one of cinema's most petulant teen burnouts. Leslie Ash is luminously unpredictable as the object of Jimmy's young lust and Ash is entirely believable as the party girl out for a lark but unafraid to lash out at those more hypocritical than her. Finally an onthecuspofmegastardom Sting is beyond perfection as the impossibly suave figurehead of the mods radiating effortless cool but with the sublimely sadly funny twist of him sulkily emasculated subsumed by the system in his menial bellboy job looming under his scruffy jacketed nonchalance. Jimmy may feign struggling with a fourway split personality but his film couldn't be more cohesive and in tune. Rough and tumble gritty moody fun and genuine as they come all while roaring along with a riotously awesome set of tunes Quadrophenia is the real deal. And if it has more passion than profundity or innovation to shed on the angst of growing up seeing 'the real me' and finding one's way in a barmy world? Well that's part of the point my son. So grab your bellboy hat and mod jacket and hop on your scooter. Because no matter what generation you are Quadrophenia is the lament of 'my generation' and worth experiencing at fulltilt. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Quadrophenia is a movie that is based in part on the album of the same name by The Who. It also was cowritten by Pete Townshend and some of the executive producers included the four members of the band. It's set in the earlymid 1960s in England and concerns Jimmy and his group of 'Mod' friends. The Mods were well before my time but apparently they liked to dress stylishly drive mopeds and tended towards RB instead of popular rock 'n roll. Also the Mods in this film are mostly angry directionless and seem in many ways like precursors to the punks of the 1970sthough with a much greater fashion sense. Plus I really cannot imagine punks riding around in motor scooters. But they both seemed to share a love of violence drugs and anger.As far as the plot goes the film is much like the Modsrather directionless. This isn't a complaint and the film deliberately chose to show the lack of structure and anger of the Mods. For the most part these teens drink fight take amphetamines listen to music and stay up all night. Jimmy seems to be among the angriest and most likely to get himself killed. Later in the film Jimmy and his blokes head to Brighton for a holiday and mayhem ensues. Exactly what happens you'll need to see for yourself.As I said above how much you like the film will depend a lot on you. If you grew up at the same time and place as these hooligans then perhaps you'll have a feeling of nostalgia watching it. As for me although the film was well made it was also unpleasant and I got a bit tired of all the pointlessly angry and disaffected youth. It just wasn't my thing and it's hard to love a film where you cannot stand any of the characters.A few final observations I don't think it was unintentional that the leading man Jimmy sure looked quite a bit like Townshend. The film sure could have used captions. I saw it on HULU and had to really pay attention to get what they were saying due to the accents. There's also a bit of male frontal nuditythough considering all the violence and anger I doubt if it's a film you'd show your mom or your kids! Also the music was very nicethe best part of the film really.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a film that has stayed with me throughout my life. It was a film I grew up with and has always been a film close to my heart. Quadrophenia is the story of Jimmy a mod who rides fast on his lambretta and lives faster fuelled by drugs drink and a huge ego. Back in the 1970's Quadrophenia was a mere idea of musical rebellion on vinyl. Later with Franc Roddam who later directed Auf Wiedersehen Pet they brought flesh and blood to a now legendary rock opera to the big screen. With key British talent playing the youth of tomorrow Quadrophenia the movie was born. Noone at the time knew what cult classic it would become later in life but it has and will forever be. Quadrophenia is a movie where you can relate to the characters and you feel you are right with them through all the loud parties and the runs on the scooters right up to the fights and the arguments. Jimmy is after being the face the leader of the mods and as we journey through this film we can see that his wish may be the nightmare that he doesn't want. Filled with anger and hate Jimmy's world slowly begins to crumble he stands to lose everything that he holds dear to his heart. His world of delusions is dragging him kicking and screaming back to the real world. Phil Daniels gives a heartwarming performance as Jimmy that makes you believe exactly what the character is going through and makes you eventually sympathise with Jimmy. Ray Winstone is great and sometimes funny as his mate Kevin who has a new surprise for Jimmy. It's good to see Two of the cream of London Cockney's working together in a film that boasts the old trait of MADE IN Britain. The first time that they worked together was as rivals in the brutally realistic movie SCUM. I'd love to see another movie with these two sparring off against each other. Toyah it's a mystery Wilcox does a star turn in this as the girl who wants to get off with Jimmy Dave Wingett makes you laugh as Dave Jimmy's best mate Phillip Davis provides some laughs as Chalky check out the scene in the chemist Leslie Ash does well in the role as Steph the girl who Jimmy wants and Sting as the face of the mods who Jimmy tries to outstage in Brighton. Backed by The Who's rocktastic soundtrack Quadrophenia is a movie about what it's like to think you're somebody when you ain't and then get brought back to reality with a thud. The spectacular ending to this is the cream on top of this cult classic souffl with the song that perfectly compliments the final scene sung with gusto by Roger Daltrey I'VE HAD ENOUGH which clearly words exactly what is going through Jimmy's mind at that particular point of the film. My advice is see it now if you haven't seen it before someone spoils the ending for you. Can you see the real me.......can ya?.........CAN YA?!!!".

The first time that they worked together was as rivals in the brutally realistic movie SCUM. I'd love to see another movie with these two sparring off against each other. Toyah it's a mystery Wilcox does a star turn in this as the girl who wants to get off with Jimmy Dave Wingett makes you laugh as Dave Jimmy's best mate Phillip Davis provides some laughs as Chalky check out the scene in the chemist Leslie Ash does well in the role as Steph the girl who Jimmy wants and Sting as the face of the mods who Jimmy tries to outstage in Brighton. Backed by The Who's rocktastic soundtrack Quadrophenia is a movie about what it's like to think you're somebody when you ain't and then get brought back to reality with a thud. The spectacular ending to this is the cream on top of this cult classic souffl with the song that perfectly compliments the final scene sung with gusto by Roger Daltrey I'VE HAD ENOUGH which clearly words exactly what is going through Jimmy's mind at that particular point of the film. My advice is see it now if you haven't seen it before someone spoils the ending for you. Can you see the real me.......can ya?.........CAN YA?!!!";

He's dedicated to his mod friends but is repeatedly let down by them and his way of life.It's not a flawless film but it is the best example of a rock opera movie adaptation and it keeps in the spirit of the brilliant Quadrophenia album.Transport yourself back to the mod days.

Although the soundtrack is quite good largely with tracks from The Who the title comes from a Who album the story at least for me since I have little interest in or sympathy for the story's arrogant young characters is quite dull. True one might identify with the lead's impatience for the distance between he and his parents or the mundane work detail as a mailroom clerk or that he can't seem to hang on to the girl he desires whenever they meet or the contest for attention between he and the 'head' mod played with little emotion by Sting but unless you want to watch a character drown himself in his miseries and not do much else then you probably won't have much fun with this film. Not to mention the poor sound quality that prevents much of the early dialogue from being heard. Nonetheless it is one of the few if not only movies that I have seen that was about mod.".

He reckons he's a face but when he gets tired of fitting in getting loaded with his mates fighting with his parents and his girlfriend slutting around he has some hard decisions to make.This is a pretty good teenage angst movie a kind of nineteensixties British version of Rebel Without A Cause or Pump Up The Volume. The backdrop is fairly unique  London and Brighton in 1964 as the mod movement was just peaking and burning out and the movie does an excellent job of recreating the times especially the notorious beachfights. Although an original movie script it's inspired by The Who's classic 1973 concept album and its story by Pete Townshend and book photography by Ethan A. Russell. For me it has some great moments when the music is playing albeit briefly such as when Jimmy stares at the canal and Townshend sings I'm One. Where it runs out of steam for me is the kitchensink drama which is played okay but is pretty boring. Daniels is good in the lead as the likably unlikeable Jimmy and Elphick and Winstone give good support but the rest of the cast aren't very exciting with the exception of a young Sting as the iconic Ace Face. When Jimmy's on the move or thinking things through it's good but his lame antics with his buddies and brainless rows with Steph are kinda tedious. An interesting flick nonetheless with a cult following and a terrific soundtrack. Shot in Brighton and around Shepherd's Bush Acton and Wembley in west London where The Who all grew up. For a better movie of a record by The Who check out Ken Russell's Tommy instead.".

But that wouldn't take into account the fact that Miller is nothing if not sincere. The movie works by capturing literal abstractions if that makes any sense  out of focus closeups that work both as simple pieces of formal beauty Joe's silhouetted face on the street with a golden background as he talks to Andrea Feldman and as insistent closeness.This is the real reality of drug use  dirty pimpled deglamorized and above all boring. Morrissey has always worked with satire and seriousness intertwined so it might be difficult for some people to note the complexity of his work. When Joe begins to rape a woman it turns into semipassionate sex. Another woman hears about this and asks him to rape her. Another woman suggests that since you have sex with strangers why not family? Morrissey is making fun of all of this at the same time as he's probing into it this isn't just a comedy it's much more than that  look at the scene where Jane Forth says to Dallesandro that his complexion is looking a little rough a statement so intimate so aware so personal that it knocks him off guard. Sometimes it's just sex without any moral judgment such as when Holly Woodlawn in a performance that defies categorization declothes and fondles a young boy.It's often absurd as in the scene where Joe is stoned stupid and naked and Forth and her husband are bickering as he stumbles around their living room a scene of bourgeois mockery. When Forth's husband asks him what it's like being a junky his curiosity almost makes it seem like the junky life is a worthy life  at least it's individualistic. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "Trash does everything a good underground movie should it portrays a squalid milieu unabashedly it deconstructs cinema technique to the point of obliterating it it provides the kind of transgressive kicks that can normally only be had in places frequented by men in raincoats. It's a sick movie but it's far from repulsive. Spatially it's a disaster and performancewise it's even worse but the rawness of it the nearly complete lack of pretense is refreshing given the false nobility of so many films that seek to criticize the same dregs the same lowerrung washouts that this movie unflinchingly presents. The film offers undistilled squalor unfiltered dubious behavior but does so with its tongue planted firmly in its cheek.The plot is a loosely connected series of episodes involving the strangely magnetic Joe Dallesandro's encounters with various women all of whom want to get in his pants. What Joe wants is not sex but drugs he's an unapologetic junkie whose life entails drifting from one partner to another holing up here and there doing whatever women want as long as he thinks they'll give him money. And what an array of women first there's the young gogo dancer Geri Miller who does a charming nude frolic to a rock and roll tune then there's Holly the drag queen Holly Woodlawn Joe's main source of housing and income a bucktoothed broad ? who furnishes her apartment with garbage she picks up off the side of the road her coffee table is a lobstertrap. And of course we mustn't forget the woman identified only as Rich Girl Andrea Feldman a Grosse Pointe Michigan deb transplanted to New York whose house Joe breaks into much to her delight. The most memorable sequence involves Rich Girl who becomes giddy at the prospect of the muscular wellendowed Joe raping her she invites him to do it on the couch then helps Joe bathe while her husband Rich Guy? waits in the living room. The performance of Andrea Feldman can only be described as gratingly offkey but Feldman with her plucked eyebrows and fabulous bonestructure is fun to watch anyway doing the most outrageous unfair caricature of uppercrust vacuity imaginable. The sequence reaches a kind of crazy comic height when Joe starts shooting heroin with Rich Girl and her hubby watching Rich Girl rattling on and on about how she's never seen anyone shoot drugs before and has never done drugs herself and was a virgin when she married her husband the heaviness of Dallesandro's muscular veiny body providing a kind of counterpoint to the vapid nasally flow of words. Much of the movie hinges on the contrast between Dallesandro's druggy torpor his eyes barely able to focus and the nervous energy thrown off by the various women. The parade of horrendous highpitched female acting streams past while Dallesandro remains immovable a lean sexuallyindifferent force of nature.It's amazing to watch Dallesandro a man devoid of anything you might call talent but blessed with more raw magnetism than most Hollywood stars. You can't say that he has personality exactly but he does have an overpowering physical presence and a strangely likable quality that he conveys almost in spite of himself. He spends almost the entire movie listening to women babble enduring their clumsy seductions and what makes it all so funny is how oblivious he is how unconcerned with anything but figuring out how to score more smack. Joe the character is a man of total integrity  he makes no particular effort to ingratiate himself and doesn't pretend to be anything other than what he is. Director Paul Morrissey has an enormous affection for Joe who he sees as a silent movie character a smackhead Little Tramp the film opens and closes with a tune straight out of a silent movie. Had the film been made in the twenties Joe would've been the dogged hero suffering the abuses of society while never losing his dignity or his hat in the '60s Joe is not dignified so much as impenetrably dense and whatever drives him forward is not doggedness but a kind of blind instinct for survival. Society's abuses are not delineated much except in the clankingly phony last scene where Joe and Holly try to swindle a crooked Welfare rep and the tone becomes almost selfrighteous but there's always this suggestion of forces at work against Joe and his companions the looming specter of injustice.The film is consistent in its antifilm aesthetic its transgressive attitude its subhardcore sense of shock. It's not an avantgarde film in the same knowing selfabsorbed way as one of Kenneth Anger's fetishistic devilish orgies. It has an innocence to it the innocence of two kids playing doctor in the bushes. It's not the kind of movie that wants to beat you over the head with hipness it's a surprisingly accessible film at times a lovable one. Of course it helps not to be too uptight when viewing it a catalogue of the film's more explicit content includes oralsex shot from behind the man the woman's hands all over his pimply butt some rather blunt notparticularlyerotic regular sex numerous images of Dallesandro's impressive member penetrationbybeerbottle and of course lots of needles going into veins and one pubescent backside. In another film this might all seem repugnant even irresponsible but in Trash this material represents the mere facts of life. And who but the most easily offended could get riled about the facts of life?".

One thing about this trilogy FleshHeatTrash is that you feel like your watching documentaries not movies. The fact that these films really have no beginning or ending lends itself to this definition. I'm always anticipating meeting the characters in these films. They may not be individuals that I would want to know  ie.neurotics psychotics junkies poseurs losers and the like. But they are the environment in which the main characters are forced to reside. John Waters' films of this era were similar but have a more scripted sensation to them. We will never see the likes of this type of filmmaking again. It is an era unto itself. It's obvious that the late 70'searly '80's films of R.

	schema:reviewBody "I became familiar with the Paul MorrisseyJoe Dallesandro trilogy by watching Flesh. I loved it but there were many flaws that could not be overlooked i.e. forgettable acting bad editing and sound boring intervals in plot. I did expect better with Trash and it delivered more than I wished for.Joe Dallesandro gives another fantastic performance as a junkie who will do anything for heroin. But unlike his appearance in Flesh Joe barely creates any sexual longing from the audience. The plotline is simple Joe wants heroin his girlfriend Holly wants welfare and you get to see some strange characters and situations as they try to reach their goals. Morrissey produced several winning actors in Flesh one of which was Geri Miller as a ditzy but lovable stripper. Geri plays another ditzy but lovable stripper and is just as good if not better here. For those of you who remember hearing her conversation about choosing between plant juice or silicone for her breast implants you can't help but wonder which she picked for in a stripping sequence Geri's breasts are noticeably larger. It is in this film that I noticed Morrissey's casting is similar to that of John Waters MorrisseyGeri Miller WatersCookie Mueller MorrisseyJane Forth WatersMary Vivian Pearce MorrisseyAndrea Feldman WatersEdith Massey in the where the hell did they come from? categoryCandy Darling and Jackie Curtis are gone from the cast but to take both of their places is Holly Woodlawn who steals the film from absolutely everybody! She was supposed to have been nominated for an Oscar for her performance in this film but because Holly is a transvestite there was questioning as to which category? She is fabulous better than any other Warhol star before or since and is both hilarious and heartbreaking. Andrea Feldman is a wild outrageous character actress and while her voice is annoying her personality is interesting. Jane Forth a 16yearold actress has an equally annoying voice but her performance as a talkative rich snob is great. Other notable appearances include Johnny Putnam who was Holly Woodlawn's 16yearold boyfriend as a teen looking for dope and Michael Sklar as the welfare officer. Diane Podlewski as Holly's pregnant sister and Bruce Pecheur as Jane's husband aren't as memorable.Trash features better editing style better sound quality better improvised dialogue better stylistic camerawork great sets and a MUCH better ensemble cast. I would recommend this film more than any other Morrissey film besides perhaps Blood for Dracula. Highly recommended!".

Maybe but most likely not.The film isn't bad but the acting is amateurish just enough to be distracting. The film is gritty grimy and has a.... well a trashy feel to it. Even Joe's fingernails in closeups are dirty. But he is beautiful to behold. Young men today would give anything to have that body and let's be honest here the camera loves his nude physique and we see a lot of it here. Full frontal male nudity. It's hard not to become involved in the film because these people are desperate. They are barely able to survive. Somehow they manage to hold their heads up high and demand respect from other people even though they are living at the bottom of the barrel and very much need the welfare payments they are seeking.The delivery of the dialog is out of place at times and it's hard to figure out how the actors went from point A to point B. Still it is interesting to watch and Joe definitely looks good on screen.".

	onyx:emotionText "After viewing Trash a second time I have to say that if Joe Dallesandro had not been in this film I doubt people would want to sit through it more than once. Maybe but most likely not.The film isn't bad but the acting is amateurish just enough to be distracting. The film is gritty grimy and has a.... well a trashy feel to it. Even Joe's fingernails in closeups are dirty. But he is beautiful to behold. Young men today would give anything to have that body and let's be honest here the camera loves his nude physique and we see a lot of it here. Full frontal male nudity. It's hard not to become involved in the film because these people are desperate. They are barely able to survive. Somehow they manage to hold their heads up high and demand respect from other people even though they are living at the bottom of the barrel and very much need the welfare payments they are seeking.The delivery of the dialog is out of place at times and it's hard to figure out how the actors went from point A to point B. Still it is interesting to watch and Joe definitely looks good on screen.";

	schema:reviewBody "Paul Morrissey's followup to Flesh is an exploratory Xrated piece about the lives of decadent heroin junkies living in a dilapidated apartment home. This time around Joe is living with his welfare hungry girlfriend played in an outstanding performance by famous transsexual Holly Woodlawn. Unable to get by on their minimum constraints and grotesque living conditions the pair spend most of their time stealing from houses dumpster diving and drug dealing. Joe has become sexually impotent due to his addictions and is no longer able to be sexually aroused. His girlfriend for the most part uses him and treats him like utter garbage. The people that surround them both rich and poor are not getting by much better.Out of all the films in Paul Morrissey's trilogy as well as all of the films he has directed this one is definitely my favorite. This is one of the best films about drug addiction that I have ever seen. After seeing this I can see that Paul Morrissey's filmmaking style is the real deal. Never before have I seen a film about junkies that actually gets it right in every way like this film does. This film really gives a perspective feeling that these are the kinds of people you would meet on the streets of New York in a dark alley. Not only does the film really get into the lives of these people with almost no struggle but it also allows plenty of humor and heartbreak to exist in equal measure. This is the kind of film I would prefer to see when I watch a film with this sort of subject matter. This film is shocking it is brave it is disturbing it is sexually explicit and it is as brutal and cold as they come. You get the sense that the film doesn't have any interest in humanizing drug addicts nor does it give the feeling that it wants to demonize. It just wants to show the viewer the lowest of low in the most straightforward honest and breathtaking way possible and it's all done in the same Cinma vrit style as Flesh was. Flesh was a tastefully made sexually explicit film about a man whose life revolves around hustling and refusing to better himself due to fear of change. With Trash however there is simply nothing tasteful about this. This is a film about junkies made by junkies for junkies as well as for the curious and I think that it deserves to be seen simply due to the world that it shows you.Holly Woodlawn is as disgusting trashy manipulative and terrifying as you would be afraid to believe. She is simply a monster and she shows this monstrous nature of hers in nearly every scene she is in. Even in a scene in which she masturbates with a beer bottle she comes off as simply destructive. Oh my god how much I love her. Her character is so evilly sultry and unlike anything I've seen in terms of manipulative female characters. I love her face especially her overbite. She just has such a uniquely twisted presence and I cannot take my eyes off of her when she's on screen. The two best performances however come from two other women who both have only one scene each and who both take full advantage of the time that they are on screen. Andrea Feldman and Jane Forth. Oh my goodness they are both so perfect in this film! Andrea Feldman's character absolutely makes no sense in the context of the storyline and yet her character brings such an otherworldly nature to the film. The way she talks is almost hypnotic. She speaks as if she doesn't even pay attention to what she's saying. She has a slurred slinky slight tone that is so incredibly horrible and hilarious and the way the character simply looks is mindbogglingly bizarre. She's this rich girl who randomly bumps into Joe and begs him for some LSD. She takes him home with her and from there on out comes a humongous and wacky monologue that I couldn't even describe if I tried. She simply has to be seen to be believed. Jane Forth on the other hand with her constant improvising and her talkative and distant manner is a true sight to behold. As soon as she starts talking I cannot stop laughing. Never before have I seen a woman who is so bitterly sarcastic and so verbally selfabsorbed. Both her and Andrea Feldman deserve some sort of accolade for their memorable performances.Make no mistake this is still the same sort of poorly put together piece of pitiful filmmaking that you would expect from Paul Morrissey at this time in his career. However this is what gives Trash so much power and so much truth. Making a film as alternately powerful trashy ugly raw cheap and dirty as this requires a certain sort of fearlessness and I don't think that most professional filmmakers don't have the guts to really get involved in this sort of drug underworld to be able to pull it off. That's what makes this film really special I think. It is also deeply sad. Joe Dallesandro's character is nothing like his character was in Flesh. In Flesh we had a character who was joyous naive gentlenatured sensitive kind and physically strong. Here he looks tired dehumanized angry ugly bored and just generally unhappy. He still has the same pock marks all over his body and all over his ass as he did in Flesh but here we get the sense that it's less from naturally growing up and more from neglect. Joe Dallesandro proves in the span of five seconds that he is has versatile physical presence. To me this only makes the film more real and more deserving of an audience than most if not all films of it's kind. Trash is a perfect title for the most perfect film of it's kind.".

This story of sleaze begins with a closeup shot of Joe Dallesandro's ass.This time Joe plays a heroin addict who after years and years of heroin abuse has lost all ability to enjoy anything or to even get an erection. Did I mention that Joe is only 18? Also Joe looks as healthy as a horse seriously he looks like hes been hitting the weights. way to go guys. After ten minutes of nudity and incoherent conversation we're finally introduced to Joe's girlfriend Holly. Thats right you guessed it Holly is a transgender I mean a trans gender who is playing the role of a real woman otherwise that would just be weird. Holly is actually by far the trashiest thing about Trash. Joe and Holly broke and lazy living in some crummy basement stealing whatever they can dealing with his addiction and her nymphomania. Their ultimate goal? Welfare.If the people in this film gave just a little bit of a damn about their performance then Trash just wouldn't be the diamond in the rough that it is. Joe Dallesandro's natural indifference to everything and everybody more than makes up for his nonheroin addict appearance although he really just acts like a stoner I guess. Strangely the most horrifying thing about Holly would be that massive overbite which seems to grow as the movie progresses. Of course the highlight of Andy Warhol's Trash would be the hilarious Jane Forth she makes it all worth it with her inability to decide whether she's playing a crazy house wife or a braindead nymph her performance will leave you speechless Trash will leave you speechless. Normally when something is improvised like Reno 911 for example there is usually some basic idea of what's supposed to occur I don't think Trash even has that. Unlike one of John Waters' trash epics the trashiness of Trash is a little more subtle which gives our brains more room to take in exactly how funny all this is. Aside from Frankenstein and Dracula this is probably Paul Morrissey's best work. The only thing I just wish they hadn't stopped playing this on the Disney Channel. 810".

A beer bottle scene that would leave you speechless. The truth about getting welfare or better yet the inability to receive welfare. Holly prefers her silver shoes over welfare when she is asked to give them up..zombie! The woman hoards everything literally in the dump of a basement she shares with Joe. The movie will shock many with scenes so unexpected but then this is also the reality of how certain people live. There are no morals restraints or passion in this film. Well the only true passion lies with Joe in his desire to get heroin. There is nudity of mostly defiled Joe by the woman in his life. Who he finds no real use for what a life!

I say oddly enough because the expectations on this trilogy is that they are to be of the same low no budget unscripted and hastily edited mess but this one has tracking shots better quality images and the ad lib dialog is actually quite significant and not nearly as random or lengthy as the previous movie. The sound itself doesn't jump around as much and the sets are bigger have more space and they even have costuming. Without even trying Morrissey and crew just got better at what they were doing.This one is a lot more funny depressing and entertaining all at the same time. Whereas the majority of Flesh was just watching Joe Dallesandro getting naked this one has really memorable sequences such as a privileged housewife going off on inane tangents while he overdoses in front of her husband a pregnant woman and her sister planning to swap the baby to help get on welfare and Joe and his flatmate trying to defraud a germophobic welfare agent. It's weird because the honest draw to these three films is of the Factoryinspired lowest budget production where the camera rolls and the people say stuff and there's not necessarily supposed to be a craft behind it merely an observation of life in the New York underground and yet this movie almost feels like it could have been very carefully scripted even with the inanities and mundane moments.Meanwhile if you're looking for a movie to detract teenagers away from drugs but don't want anything so glossy and stylistic as Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream show 'em the sequence where Joe's flatmate who I honestly thought was a transvestite until she started taking off her clothes near the end seduces an innocent and wetbehindtheyears young high school student just looking for a quick fix before a concert. It's every virginal teenager's absolute nightmare a great cautionary tale. The rest of the movie would generally be of the same nature except that for the most part Morrissey and Warhol refuse to pass judgment on anybody and it seems the whole world fits in some way or another into all the trash.PolarisDiB".

I mean these guys were doing it completely by their own rulebook and predated what we now consider to be underground movies. It's also way before any of the cinema of transgression stuff of Nick Zedd or Richard Kern and much better made. The most amazing part of this film in some ways is the casting. Warhol's menagerie of people and Morrissey's humanistic eye together created the first window into the world of fringe dwellers in America and a distinct kind of offensive reality that made way for so many shock jock movies later on. It also pushed and provoked people into dealing with homosexuality and alternative lifestyles in general along with rampant drug use and psychological problems. All of this made something special called TRASH.".

	schema:headline " Morrissey gets nastier camper more moralistic";
	schema:reviewBody "The second of Paul Morrissey's Warhol trilogy is both more lighthearted and bleaker than the first. This one has Joe Dallesandro again playing Joe whether it's the same Joe as in Flesh or not we can't tell but this time he's a heroin addict. The film follows his misadventures as he gets dumped by his girlfriend interacts with his flatmatelover gets hassled by a broad wanting LSD and used as disposable entertainment by an affluent young married couple. Whereas the Flesh Joe was amiable and inclined to get on with everyone this Joe can barely conceal his contempt for the people he finds himself stuck with the only thing on his mind being the need to get some money for the next fix. Dallesandro's performance is very different in this second film  where in the first he'd maintained the most extraordinary naturalism this time there's an element of ironic distance as befits the film's subtle tone as comedy of no manners Dallesandro's contemptuous reactions to people are subtle and welltimed to often hilarious effect but he also manages to send his own character up as a useless idiot abandoning the studied nonjudgmental air of the first film.Whereas the protagonist in Flesh had a goal of sorts and the plot had a kind of inciting incident this time things are as random shapeless and directionless as a junkie's life must surely be. The film's style it protagonist's state of being which makes it a little less compelling than Flesh with inevitable moments of repetition and boredom setting in. In Flesh much had been made of the buying and selling of Joe's erect penis whereas a running theme throughout Trash is the fact that this Joe can't get it up. This and his bad case of acne doesn't stop people from desiring Joe but the desire goes nowhere leading to frustration and fury.Dallesandro almost has Trash stolen from him by the transvestite player Holly Woodlawn playing his female flatmate and kicking up quite a diva storm in the role George Cukor campaigned for Woodlawn to get nominated for an Oscar!. Woodlawn's Big Bad Wolf gnashers loll and drool bark and bite as she moans at Joe letches over a barely legal public schoolboy masturbates with a beer bottle plots to extort welfare monies and has a jealous hissy fit at discovering Joe screwing her sister. There's something about the fact that Holly is a man in drag playing a real woman which really challenges the viewer and we never quite know whether the character is a real female or a transvestite like the player  it may be that people are simply accepting of hisher transsexual selfdefinition  and so the film asks questions about the acceptance of people's selfdefinitions no matter how ugly absurd and risible they look and Holly looks all three.The welfare scam is the nearest the film gets to a plot and this kicks in pretty late. The scene with the corrupt welfare official who pretends to be liberal but is dead officious but willing to be bought for a pair of shoes is very funny but leaves a very bitter taste in the mouth  in the light of Morrissey's future avowed Republicanism it reads like a vicious direct salvo against welfare scroungers although it's hard to deny that there are wastrels like Joe and Holly trying to get money from public funds whilst putting nothing in. Trash makes the lives of junkies and their scene into a pretty depressing and with explicit needle injections included in lurid closeup harrowing viewing. Yet the middle classes who might see them as interesting and entertaining but who do nothing to help when they might be about to die are fingerpointed just as much. Trash coming from the amoral Warhol studio is a studiously moral piece of filmmaking although at the same time it gave the rather less moralistic John Waters a bedrock to build his entire cinematic aesthetic on. Without Trash there could be no Pink Flamingos or Female Trouble and perhaps Morrissey is the more subtle if less anarchic talent of the two.".

The artsy camera angles and documentary style film making bring the viewer into the film and the actors are terrific! Most of the dialogue is adlibbed since Warhol wrote very little actual dialogue for any of his films and this makes the acting job done by the actors that much more believable. Joe Dellasandro is brilliant and he manages to look both attractive and repulsive at the same time in his role as the lead character in the film whose sole purpose in life is scoring a fix. He is either naked or dressed in filthy grimy clothes through the entire film. The many scenes of him actually shooting up heroin are quite disturbing to watch but the constant ranting and raving of many of the actresses in the background during each of these scenes overpowers the shock value. Holly Woodlawn is absolutely brilliant in her very first film role. Her adlibbed lines are classic Ya can't make it with me...nah...you're kickin junk...but her right away...UGHN!...Fkin Her! and her appearance is a total shock. Andrea Feldman also has a memorable performance as the obnoxious LSD addicted hippie with a voice that is like fingernails on a chalk board. There is no real plot or storyline to this film but that's not the purpose of the film so it truly does not matter...it's artistic value alone is worth watching it for!".

	schema:headline " Good Thriller On A Bad Day.";
	schema:reviewBody "MGM's glitzy 1955 thriller BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK is still one of the most popular movies of the fifties. Produced for the studio by Dore Schary it was nicely written for the screen by Millard Kaufman and came from a story called Bad Time At Hondo by Howard Brisken. It is the type of movie that was made in the forties in black  white and would have been regarded as a typical classic noir. But here filmed in Cinemascope and colour by William C. Mellor it regretfully loses a lot of the noir atmosphere while thankfully hanging on to the suspense and excitement inherent in those much cherished movies of long ago. Briskly directed by John Sturges the fine cast is headed by Spencer Tracy. This was something of a departure for the actor. He hadn't really appeared in this kind of picture before. It was more like something his friend James Cagney would do with little difficulty. In fact Cagney was originally slated to do the movie but Tracy  while filming a western Tribute To A Badman  fell out with its director Robert Wise and walked off the set and was replaced by Cagney at very short notice. Since Tracy now owed MGM a picture and BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK was without a lead and a startup date imminent he reluctantly took up the assignment. But I'm not totally convinced Tracy was wholly right for the part. He was 54 years old when he made it but with his silver hair he could look ten years older. That said he does a fair enough job and it even earned him an Oscar nomination. But I still would have loved to see what sort of a job Cagney would have made of it.It is 1946 and the war has ended in Europe. Tracy plays John J. Macreedy who arrives by train in the tiny desert hamlet of Black Rock It's the first time the Streamline has stopped here in four years declares Telegraph Agent Russell Collins. He is here to present Komoko a Japanese American farmer with a medal that was posthumously awarded to his son for bravery during action in Italy. But Macreedy is greeted in the town with disdain and silence. The town is hiding a crucial secret and before long he learns that Komoko is dead and had died under suspicious circumstances. As he gets nearer and nearer to what exactly happened attempts are made on his life an exciting desert car chase is particularly effective and with the help of the kindly local doctor Walter Brennan and a remorseful hotelier John Ericson he must now endeavour to get out of Black Rock one way or another.BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK is an entertaining thriller but it's not without its faults. Most glaring is the music score by Andre Previn. Firstly it is much too loud! Almost every closing line of a scene is accompanied by screaming and I mean screaming descending string passages that have you diving for the volume control of your TV. Previn doesn't door never did subtle or sensitive. He over emphasizes and very loudly every would be suspenseful moment in the picture. Even Max Steiner a composer who was often castigated for his wall to wall and emphatic style of scoring and one whose work Previn on more than one occasion publicly and disparagingly discredited would never be so blatant. It is interesting to note here that unlike the estimable Steiner not one of Previn's film scores is worth remembering! Also a problem with the movie is the inordinate lack of character development. We never learn anything about the individuals that make up the sparse population of the town. For instance all we know about shady Reno Smith Robert Ryan is that he owns a ranch outside of town but is he married or has he a family or who works for him or what? The same goes for the other men in the town ie. Ernest Borgnine Lee Marvin Dean JaggerJohn Ericson Walter Brennan Walter Sande you never see any of the women or the families in their lives. In fact apart from barely getting a fleeting glimpse of a couple of women in the final scene watching the police arresting the baddies throughout the entire picture you will never see a woman crossing the street eating in the local diner coming or going through the hotel doing a bit of shopping or anything else that female extras are hired to do in movies. The only female in the cast is Anne Francis who has a small role as a girl who runs the local garage but we don't know if she owns it or if there is a man in her life or what. I found this whole female aspect of the film under written very strange and somewhat offputting.Nevertheless sizeable and annoying quibbles apart there is still much enjoyment to be had from BAD DAY AT BLACK ROCK thanks to the handsome mounting of the movie and some nice ensemble playing from a distinguished cast.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bad Day at Black Rock is only a short film by present day standards at just 81 minutes but in that time it manages to pack in more intrigue mystery and action than many Hollywood films of two hours or more. Expertly directed by John Sturges in breathtaking colour and CinemaScope the film holds your attention throughout its tight running time. Bad Day at Black Rock has an exceptionally talented supporting cast including Robert Ryan Ernest Borgnine Lee Marvin Anne Francis John Ericson Dean Jagger and Walter Brennan who all give accomplished performances  particularly the baddies Ryan Borgnine and Marvin.Spencer Tracy was deservedly nominated for the Best Actor Award but unfortunately for him 1955 was a very exceptional year with so many fine performances from other actors including Ernest Borgnine in Marty the winner James Cagney in Love Me Or Leave Me James Dean in East of Eden and Frank Sinatra in The Man With the Golden Arm. Tracy had in fact won the Best Actor Award twice before  for Captains Courageous in 1937 and for Boys Town in 1938 so his memorable screen acting had already been recognised by the Academy voters two years running.Tracy plays the mysterious John J. MacReedy who arrives at the small Western town of Black Rock causing suspicion and concern among the local residents who are hiding a dark secret which MacReedy eventually uncovers. Robert Ryan Reno Smith is the chief heavy well supported by his two menacing henchmen Ernest Borgnine Coley Trimble and Lee Marvin Hector David who are intent on getting rid of Tracy one way or another. Insults and intimidation seem to have no effect on Tracy who is determined to carry on with his one man investigation against all the odds. With the eventual help of Anne Francis Liz Wirth and Walter Brennan Doc Velie Tracy doggedly pursues his mission through the 24 hours period of the film. When threats and violence won't stop Tracy then Ryan has to resort to attempted murder leading to the dramatic climax.Some favourite linesTracy to Marvin I don't know why you're so interested but the name is MacReedy. It's all in the ledger.Borgnine to Tracy Well if it's not MacReedy the world's champion road hog.Walter Brennan to Tracy They're going to kill you with no hard feelings. Tracy And you're going to sit there and let 'em do it!.Train Conductor What's all the excitement? What happened?. Tracy A shooting. Train Conductor Thought it was something. First time this train line has stopped here in four years. Tracy Second time!. Last line in film.Bad Day at Black Rock is a superior high class thriller that deserves to be in anyone's Top Ten list of all time classic films.  It's certainly in mine!   1010.   Clive Roberts.".

It's shot on location in CinemaScope and Eastman Color at Lone Pine Death Valley  Alabama Hills in California with William C. Mellor on photography and Andr Previn scoring the music.A classy production that combines elements of Westerns and film noir Bad Day at Black Rock deals with racism and all the hate and bully tactics that come with such a vile subject. It tells the story of a mysterious one armed stranger John J. Macreedy Tracy who arrives at a tiny isolated town in a desert of the Southwest United States in search of a JapaneseAmerican man. From the moment he arrives he is met with hostility and mistrust. Over the course of the day Macreedy picks apart the town to uncover the secret the townsfolk had hoped had gone away.From the opening sequence of a bright red train rushing towards us it's evident that we are in the modern day West. It's just after World War II and the horse trails of the old West are now frequented by jeeps and cars. Yet the hallmarks of the old West exists and thrives because of the inhabitants of Black Rock. An ignorant group of people consisting of bullies drunks and the head in the sand softy type. Yet even tho the film is set mostly in the blazing sun in a barren one horse Western town that time forgot the film exudes a film noir sensibility. Dark secrets from the past weigh heavy on the shoulders of the towns big players And Tracy's High Noon like situation is moodily paced by the wily Sturges. In fact that a film with so little gun play action can be so tense is no mean feat with him yet again directing an ensemble cast to great effect.Tracy is at his best when he is as he is here playing subdued. Here he is a thinking man's protagonist calm and reflective in the face of constant hostility. That he is facing an impressive line up of heavies really brings home just how thoughtful a performance Tracy gives in the piece. Robert Ryan does yet another fine turn as a complicated villain whose rage is bubbling away under the surface. While Borgnine and Marvin are memorably vile as his right hand thugs. Dean Jagger as the drunken cowardly sheriff manages to pang the heart and Walter Brennan is his usual solid impacting self. Anne Francis adds the glamour but really it's a nondescript role that the film could easily have survived without.Clocking in at just 81 minutes the film never outstays its welcome. It looks great on DVD and for those interested in commentary tracks this one comes with a very good one from Dana Polan. Anyone who has not seen this film should try and seek it out. It was considered controversial back on release but now can be viewed as a smart message movie about racial tolerance. Tight taut and expertly directed and acted Bad Day At Black Rock is an important film from the 50s that still rings bells even today. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "For the first time in 4 years the train stops at the small desert town of Black Rock.  An one armed war veteran gets off looking for a man whose name causes hostility among the residents of the town led by Reno Smith. Macreedy digs deeper to find a town hiding a shameful secret that they were too apathetic to deal with.  But will they stand up now?Most people will tell you this film is famous because it was one of the first times an American film acknowledged that after Pearl Harbour oriental Americans were abused and treated badly.  However to me this film is a damnation to those who stand back and refuse to take a stand against wrong doing.  The whole plot is hinged on whether or not people ill stand up and do the right thing with Macreedy.  The film plays well as a moral fable but also as a tense thriller and both are enjoyable.The film is quite short but builds well from hostile locals to eventual violence and confrontation in the desert.  The moral of taking a stand is weaved into it well without taking away from the main drama and tension.  It isn't perfect as it is a bit simplified but in the desert heat of the small town the tension is really well recreated.The cast is surprisingly deep in hindsight.  Tracy is manners himself as the man who gets more irate by the apathy around him as he gets to uncover more and more of the town.  Ryan is cool but a little too inhuman for my tastes. Jagger and Brennan are suitably trapped in their performances and represent those happy to watch bad things happen if they get a quiet life.  In retrospect Borgnine and Marvin add star power and do well with what could have been just thugheavy roles.Overall this film worked for me on several levels.  The heat of the desert adds to the tension in the actual drama story itself.  However it also works as a moral fable with a very clear message  stand up for what is right or watch what you believe slip away at an alarming rate.".

Where strangers are suspicious secrets that take place in a town stay in the town.John Sturges has done a wonderful job of bringing all of these elements together. One of the things that I found interesting was that there were very few if any closeups. Most of the shots could have been master shots. For me this made me feel as though I were a bystander in the room with the characters while they talked. A nice touch.As expected all of the performances are great.

	schema:reviewBody "Director John Sturges doesn't waste a second. You've got to love a picture that strips itself down to its bare elements strikes right at the heart of the audience's sympathies and winds up in just over 80 minutes. 'Bad Day at Black Rock 1955' might just be one of the most suspenseful nonHitchcock films of the 1950s a nearperfect mechanical construction of unspoken tension and looming disaster. Similar in tone to intimate Western pictures such as Fred Zinnemann's 'High Noon 1952' and Delmer Daves' '310 to Yuma 1957' the picture is a curious combination of Western and War film motifs with an understated racial overtone that recognisably foreshadows Sidney Poitier in Norman Jewison's 'In the Heat of the Night 1967.' Spencer Tracy is wonderful as John J. Macreedy a onearmed WWII veteran who has arrived in the desolate town of Black Rock in search of a Japanese man. Upon arrival he discovers that the town's isolation has spawned a local law of its own and his suspicions of foulplay make him a target for the antagonism of its residents.Even from the opening seconds before anybody has displayed any illintentions the tension quietly begins to build. The inhabitants of Black Rock look up with expressions of confusion and disbelief as the locomotive unexpectedly comes to a halt at their local railway station and cautious eyes follow Macreedy as he swaggers guardedly through the dusty streets the grim wary frowns of the local men already offer sufficient warning that this day is indeed going to be a bad one. 'Bad Day at Black Rock' was photographed by William C. Mellor in CinemaScope and the widescreen cinematography spectacularly captures the vastness of the desert particularly in a dramatic opening shot that sees the camera approaching a moving train headon before rising above it at the final moment. Yet the abundance of wideopen spaces paradoxically heightens the intimacy of Macreedy's interactions with the townsfolk and Sturges masterfully communicates both the seclusion of the isolated town and the closing walls of impending doom. Macreedy responds to the antagonism directed towards him first with an air of indifference but eventually with a sort of subdued desperation.Whereas the participation of generic bad guys might have significantly hampered the film 'Bad Day at Black Rock' boasts an impressive ensemble of gifted character actors fronted by Robert Ryan as Reno Smith the crafty charismatic villain whose ability to cunningly manipulate his neighbours has made him the foremost authority in the forsaken town unofficially outranking even the cowardly alcoholic sheriff Dean Jagger. Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine in roles that helped secure their status as respected actors are very entertaining as Smith's mindless thuggish hoodlums particularly when the latter attempts to start a fight and discovers  the hard way  that even onearmed men can hit back. Walter Brennan one of Hollywood's most recognisable character actors with that docile drawl of his is initially Macreedy's sole ally in the hostile township the courage of this outranked stranger inspiring his own sense of moral decency. At the film's climax Sturges finally unleashes the steadilymounting tension and extracting every ounce of anxiety from the unusuallybrief 81 minute runningtime delivers a conclusion that is both exciting and satisfying.".

It is always interesting that Europe recognizes the better Hollywood works than the Academy Thin Red Line got the top award in Berlin Scarecrow in Cannestwo geat American films ignored at the Oscar ceremonies.I read a review of the film on IMDB pointing out the flaws in the script. They are all correct if we go by rational thinking. But the merits of this film are the superb editing the beautiful cinemascope photography and the arresting performances. Every time I see this film I am reminded of Spielberg's little known film Duel that had similar thrilling tension packed into less than 24 hours of screen timea film I admire much more as good cinema than the recent box office outputs of Spielberg.Compare this film with Sturges' The Magnificent Seven. Sturges like King Vidor seemed to pick up stories to film that looked at the oppressed and tried to present a world that could be better. The Magnificent Seven like this film had a predominantly male cast. It appealed to most viewers. And some could see a social and even a political layer beneath these films.What I find most appealing is the the ability of Sturges Vidor and the early unsung Spielberg's ability to use cinema to combine thrills human values and craft in say 81 minutes as in this film. Spencer Tracy is not to be admired for the way he delivers his lines but his body movements which remind you of majestic caged animal that can be deadly if provoked. Sturges brings to the fore evil in different waysthe dead buck strapped on the front of a vehicle menace on empty roads by big vehicles used in Duel to great effect evil women when you expect them to be good laws used in illegal ways the hotel registration scene etc. Sergio Leone made similar films in Europethe famous spaghetti westernswith laconic dialogues and emphasis on body movements and photographyIn spite of its flaws it is a film Hollywood can be proud of. I only hope TV reruns show the film in its original cinemascope grandeur which grabbed me the first time I saw it decades ago.".

The Magnificent Seven like this film had a predominantly male cast. It appealed to most viewers. And some could see a social and even a political layer beneath these films.What I find most appealing is the the ability of Sturges Vidor and the early unsung Spielberg's ability to use cinema to combine thrills human values and craft in say 81 minutes as in this film. Spencer Tracy is not to be admired for the way he delivers his lines but his body movements which remind you of majestic caged animal that can be deadly if provoked. Sturges brings to the fore evil in different waysthe dead buck strapped on the front of a vehicle menace on empty roads by big vehicles used in Duel to great effect evil women when you expect them to be good laws used in illegal ways the hotel registration scene etc. Sergio Leone made similar films in Europethe famous spaghetti westernswith laconic dialogues and emphasis on body movements and photographyIn spite of its flaws it is a film Hollywood can be proud of. I only hope TV reruns show the film in its original cinemascope grandeur which grabbed me the first time I saw it decades ago.";

	schema:headline " This is a film to which I keep returning one of Tracy's best with great support from Robert Ryan.";
	schema:reviewBody "In this film nothing is quite what it seems. The story unfolds in layers. There is nothing complicated about Tracy's motives for visiting Black Rock yet his presence unnerves the townspeople they become shifty their curiosity is not the normal variety that accompanies a stranger in a small hick town in the outback. As it becomes clear that they are hiding a secret  fearful that Tracy may uncover it the tension rises. I would have given 10 marks but I found the music intrusive a fault common to American films. The car chase required no augmentation the scene has sufficient tension  uncertainty to use the sound of the cars to heighten the drama. I might add that this is also a fault in too many British films. So I will award it 9 which is 10 for everything else in this taut exciting and understated film. Spenser Tracy had that special star quality in that you can't take your eyes off him. In every scene he exudes this. Robert Ryan probably the greatest screen villain of all time is as always outstanding. Again the menace is understated although you are in no doubt that this is an evil ruthless man totally without any redeeming feature. He is a bigot  a bully  you as an audience want to see him brought down. And John Sturges does not disappoint. The climax is also understated but wholly satisfying. And there is even humour when the conductor on the train says This is the first time this train has stopped at Black Rock. And Tracy corrects him with a great oneliner The second time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bad Day at Black Rock is a film seldom seen these days and it's a shame because this small 81 minutes movie is packed with a lot of action none of it coming from special effects or shoot outs. John Sturges directed with great care and it shows. Most of the photography was done in Lone Pine California where cinematographer William Mellor was able to capture the atmosphere of the dusty town and surrounding area with its majestic beauty. Andre Previn provided the musical score that serves the film well.Basically this is the tale of a man John Macreedy who arrives unexpectedly to a place totally dominated by a local bad guy Reno Smith and his lackeys. Smith rules over this little outpost of the West with a tight fist. The least he wants is Macreedy poking his nose in something he wants to keep a secret.Since Reno Smith practically owns the town he names whoever he wants to be the sheriff a mere figure. Smith knows immediately about the new arrival in town because it appears everyone works for him. Macreedy wants to visit a Japanese man whose son has saved his life in the war but unknown to him he has been dead for quite some time.Macreedy seems to be a symbol of justice finally arriving to town. The only other man that is sympathetic to what Macreedy is trying to do is the veterinarianmortician of the town Doc Velie who proves at the end he is up to task. Macreedy prevails in the end.The film is shot basically in long and medium shots which in a way it helps to diffuse most of the expressions of the actors in the movie. Cinemascope with its elongated technique doesn't make things better as most situations seem to disappear into the glorious backgrounds one sees. Mr. Sturges doesn't use closeups in the film to accentuate some situations they should have helped in getting the viewer more involved in the picture.Spencer Tracy does interesting work in the film. Mr. Tracy was fifty four years old when filming was done but looks much older. Robert Ryan an excellent actor is good as the evil Reno Smith. Walter Brennan plays Doc Velie with his usual charm. Ernest Borgnine Lee Marvin Dean Jagger and John Ericson are all effective under Mr. Sturges' command.".

	schema:reviewBody "Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon.Spencer Tracy rides into town on the Southern Pacific. The engine is diesel. He's carrying a suitcase and wearing a black fedora. The town is smack in the middle of the Mojave Desert just a handful of wooden buildings like the back lot at Paramount during the days when they made a lot of cowboy movies.This is and is not a cowboy movie. It's the late forties just after World War II. Tracy has the left sleeve of his suit coat tucked into the pocket. He lost an arm somewhere. He's slow to anger. He has a mission. What it is is mysterious. In fact part of the effectiveness of this unusual movie is in how mysterious everything is. Why this godforsaken town? Why are the people so uptight about his arrival? Who is he and what does he want? Robert Ryan plays the villain the leader of the gang so to speak. Lee Marvin plays a tough gunslinger. Ernest Borgnine plays a bully who gets the tar kicked out of him in a barroom fightwell the place is like a saloon only there's a soda fountaincaf counter and no swinging doors.There's a onecell jail in which the alcoholic sheriff can be found sleeping it off. There a telegraph station at the train station where telegrams might or might not be sent. Walter Brennan costars as the obligatory town Doc a washedup man ashamed of himself. So much like an oldstyle western is this slightly noir film from 1954 that at some point I actually expected to see Gabby Hayes come running up to gum a line or two. There's a gal Anne Francis looking as neat and cute as Dale Evans in her prime but she doesn't amount to much. This is a guy kind of flick a faux western in which manhood is tested in which men find out what they're made of in which the good guys win and the old movieland code is rigorously upheld.Some of the scenes were probably shot out in Simi Valley where they used to shoot the old Tom Mix and Johnny Mack Brown westerns with large granite boulders adorning dirt trails. You can almost hear the horses gallop and see the chips fly off the boulders as the bullets sing out. Instead of horses however there are Ford coupes and a Jeep. The gunfight scene at night has Robert Ryan rifling down at Tracy using the headlights of his car to see while Tracy is without firearms but of course not without resources.The plot concerns a certain Japanese man who had a homestead farm out among the boulders who ended up missing after his farm was burned to the ground. Seems that Robert Ryan's character doesn't like the Nipponese and is still fighting the war in his mind. Somehow even before it is revealed we know how Tracy lost his arm but we don't exactly know why he's here. I won't reveal that for those who haven't seen this but you might guess. He served in the infantry in Italy. Robert Ryan for mysterious reasons was not allowed to enlisthe says.Aside from the nicely developed and held tension and the beautiful score by Andre Previn the effectiveness of this movie lies in the interesting performances by the talented cast. One of the first Cinemascope movies Bad Day at Black Rock great title! is also wondrously filmed so that the empty feel of the desert and loneliness of the isolated town surrounded by stark mountains and a high blue sky will stay with you long after you see the old style The End as the film fades to black for the last time.See this for Spencer Tracy one of Hollywood's greatest a little past his prime in a long and distinguished career.".

Portrayed over a 24 hour period and shot almost exclusively in a bright oppressive sun which mirrors the welcome Tracy receives you can't help but find yourself sitting on the edge of your seat as you wonder if he'll make it or if the shear weight of angry townsfolk will make him disappear as well.

A good cast with some tense moments  shorter and simpler than I imagined.

Also being widescreen colour probably HD'ed up by now and when you add a few minutes worth of brainnumbing BBC adverts at the end it's still a favourite 85 minute timeslotfiller for UK BBC.Enigmatic one armed man steps off a gargantuan train on the edge of a sweaty nohorse town looking for the father of an old friend of his much to the edgy chagrin of a lot of the townsfolk. Racist Robert Ryan turns out to have the town in his pocket defending a dark secret and Spencer Tracy has his work cut out to get to the truth. If you haven't seen it just wait for the classic scene in the caf where Ernest Borgnine needles Tracy a little too much for his own good  a pity all yobs can't get similar peremptory treatment instead of fines or jail! It's a Man's film all right there's only a fleeting onesided love interest in it but plenty of macho incidents to get your blood pressure up and plenty to think about Dean Jagger's sudden desire at the end to Do Something jarred a little though! Unlike Gary Cooper with his badge Tracy doesn't throw the medal on the ground at the end though meaning there's supposed to be hope for the future. Well nothing's perfect.In short A terse classic.".

Also being widescreen colour probably HD'ed up by now and when you add a few minutes worth of brainnumbing BBC adverts at the end it's still a favourite 85 minute timeslotfiller for UK BBC.Enigmatic one armed man steps off a gargantuan train on the edge of a sweaty nohorse town looking for the father of an old friend of his much to the edgy chagrin of a lot of the townsfolk. Racist Robert Ryan turns out to have the town in his pocket defending a dark secret and Spencer Tracy has his work cut out to get to the truth. If you haven't seen it just wait for the classic scene in the caf where Ernest Borgnine needles Tracy a little too much for his own good  a pity all yobs can't get similar peremptory treatment instead of fines or jail! It's a Man's film all right there's only a fleeting onesided love interest in it but plenty of macho incidents to get your blood pressure up and plenty to think about Dean Jagger's sudden desire at the end to Do Something jarred a little though! Unlike Gary Cooper with his badge Tracy doesn't throw the medal on the ground at the end though meaning there's supposed to be hope for the future. Well nothing's perfect.In short A terse classic.";

Neatly told in a succinct 80 minutes and a genuine visual treat by Director John Sturgess BAD DAY is a moral fable of prejudice and mob rule and bullying played out in the desert of MGM style. This film whilst seeming dated is mainly worth seeing for the construction of the production from the outdoor set by the rail tracks to the interesting staged interiors...and of course the cast and their characters. It is a great film simply great in its simplicity and in its engrossing storyline and use of locations. It also reinforces why Spencer Tracy and Robert Ryan were truly strong actors who made any material compelling. The only weak spots are in the truly annoying back projection closeups when someone is driving a car. They are so out of place from the rest of the location lensing and really yank the viewer from the story. It is the use of widescreen photography that is such a standout and neatly showed correct use of the new medium. One long sequence of the group of men having an outdoor meeting whilst standing on the actual railwayroad crossing is a masterpiece of placement and imagery. BAD DAY must have made millions in profit for MGM and I wish I ran a cinema in 1960 just to double it up with NORTH BY NORTHWEST which I saw playing endlessly across Australia in the early days of TV. It must have looked so good on a huge rural drive in screen!".

Sturges cleverly plays the first two thirds of the film in blazing coloursoaked sunshine as if to say that the appearance of normality often hides an ugly undercurrent as Tracy's innocent goodwill  trip turns into a one  man mission to either redeem those of the townsfolk with a scrap of conscience left the Walter Brennan John Ericson and Dean Jagger characters or physically rage against and ultimately vanquish the irredeemable elements Ernst Borgnine and Robert Ryan. The good versus evil battle is outlined with the physically handicapped and hopelessly outnumbered Tracy character seemingly doomed against the sinister swaggering physically domineering characters of Ryan when was he not great in his evocation of downright orneriness Borgnine until Spence dispatches him with some aplomb in their justly famous barroom fight scene and especially Lee Marvin who really does seem like the daddy until he meets literally face on undertaker Brennan's spade in the prelude to Tracy's escape. The cinematography is great you can just feel the sweat oozing from the characters' pores and the symbolism of the train which both announces and then dissipates the tension was probably not lost on Hitchcock when working out the denouement of North by Northwest some years later. But of course it's Tracy who transcends everything with his portrayal of an everyday man confronted by petty evil and who decides not to turn the other cheek when the option to run away seems best. Perhaps there are echoes here of the contrasting responses to a similar victimisation of innocent foreigners then running high in Hollywood as McCarthyism took hold.

I'm going to have to file this one under best films I'd never heard of although by the looks of things on this board maybe it's just me. On first viewing the story is bound to keep you wondering what the mystery of Black Rock is all about as protagonist John J. Macreedy Spencer Tracy tiptoes his way through all the obstacles Reno Smith Robert Ryan and his henchmen throw his way.The film boasts an unusually strong cast particularly with Ernest Borgnine and Lee Marvin in the credits. Interestingly they along with Ryan would team up more than a dozen years later in The Great Escape. As heavies in this film they attempt to intimidate Tracy's character into some semblance of submission and fail miserably. You knew it was only a matter of time before the one armed Tracy would stand to defend himself the only question mark would be how and when.I've seen Walter Brennan recently in some uncharacteristic roles My Darling Clementine for example but here he plays closer to type as someone who can rise to the occasion with the right push. He doesn't start out that way though as he admonishes Tracy's character with a warning  They're gonna kill you with no hard feelins.If there's any fault to be found with the story it would be the way it concludes once the final confrontation between Macreedy and Reno Smith ends. Coley Borgnine and Hector Marvin are next seen in jail courtesy of turn good sheriff Tim Dean Jagger but their incarceration is dealt with off screen hardly the way most films would have handled it.Mostly the movie keeps the viewer hooked with it's mysterious set up aided by the inclusion of the name 'Komoko' which is later revealed to be instrumental in the town's deep dark secret. I enjoyed it as the Eastman Color format managed to add a modern sensibility to what might otherwise have been an out of place 1950's Western. Rounding out the main cast is the only female presence in Black Rock provided by Anne Francis. Come to think of it the biggest mystery of Black Rock might be how it even managed to survive at all until Spencer Tracy got there.".

I just watched this flick for the first time in ages and remember now why I agree that it is a cult classic!Made in 1984 way before most of the actors achieved real star status this movie has so many inside references and jokes it's a wonder that more isn't made of it! And if you are a real Star Trek fan you will know that Yoyodyne Propulsion is on the commissioning plaque for the Enterprise as well as other Star Fleet vessels. The references to Grover's Mill and Orson Wells along with the whole deadpan tone of the film makes this an unbelievably funny experience. I only wish that Buckaroo Banzai versus The World Crime League had been produced.Peter Weller Jeff Goldblum John Lithgow Ellen Barkin Dan Hedaya the entire cast must have had a great time making this movie. It is full of technojargon double speak and just plain funny stuff that pokes fun at every bad Bmovie scifi thrillercomic bookSaturday serial ever made. There is no bad language and no skin and lots to hear and see in this great movie!It has one redeeming quality above all else for me... it makes the effects on Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and all of those other poor excuses for Saturday kid's entertainment look ridiculous. If the producers of this crap on TV that passes for action need some pointers on how to take useless stuff and make a cool funny scifi flick they need look no further that The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eight Dimension!".

I just watched this flick for the first time in ages and remember now why I agree that it is a cult classic!Made in 1984 way before most of the actors achieved real star status this movie has so many inside references and jokes it's a wonder that more isn't made of it! And if you are a real Star Trek fan you will know that Yoyodyne Propulsion is on the commissioning plaque for the Enterprise as well as other Star Fleet vessels. The references to Grover's Mill and Orson Wells along with the whole deadpan tone of the film makes this an unbelievably funny experience. I only wish that Buckaroo Banzai versus The World Crime League had been produced.Peter Weller Jeff Goldblum John Lithgow Ellen Barkin Dan Hedaya the entire cast must have had a great time making this movie. It is full of technojargon double speak and just plain funny stuff that pokes fun at every bad Bmovie scifi thrillercomic bookSaturday serial ever made. There is no bad language and no skin and lots to hear and see in this great movie!It has one redeeming quality above all else for me... it makes the effects on Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and all of those other poor excuses for Saturday kid's entertainment look ridiculous. If the producers of this crap on TV that passes for action need some pointers on how to take useless stuff and make a cool funny scifi flick they need look no further that The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eight Dimension!";

	schema:reviewBody "TAOBBATED as I will acronymize this film is neither the stupid lowbudget piece of excrement nor the sublimely original cult masterpiece you've been told it is but it's a lot closer to the latter than to the former.  Peter Weller plays Buckaroo the titular neurosurgeoninventormodernday samuraiBilly Joelesque rocker and he plays him frightfully well lowkey and distant but with occasional glimmers of genius and intensity.  The stellar supporting cast includes Jeff Goldblum Clancy Brown John Lithgow Christopher Lloyd and Ellen Barkin and they're all pretty darn good.I'm not even going to pretend to be rational or unbiased about this movie. It's too utterly offbeat and original and just damned odd to not love. Some favorite scenes the opening sequence of the Jet Car test run Buckaroo's phone call with the Black Lectroids and his subsequent detection of the sinister Red Lectroid agents in his midst the eerie recorded message from the Black Lectroid leader the good guys who threaten to blow up Earth unless Buckaroo stops their enemy Dr. Lizardo Lithgow in a truly twisted scenechewing performance.  Yes it looks cheesy and dated but damn it you have to take a stand somewhere in life you have to roll up your sleeves and step up to the plate and put yourself on the line and have the courage to say I don't care what anyone thinks of me I love this movie.  That's the way I feel about old Buckaroo and his Hong Kong Cavaliers and I still consider myself a loyal Blue Blaze Irregular fifteen years after seeing this film.As a postscript I'd like to mention that the novelization of this movie written by Earl Mac Rauch is great and actually contains about 3 times the information and plot that is in the movie.  If you can find it on Amazon or at a garage sale somewhere snap it up it's worth the search.  Also there's a script for BUCKAROO BANZAI VERSUS THE WORLD CRIME LEAGUE floating around too which should be made no matter the cost if only to film one priceless scene  the cameo appearance of Jack Burton Kurt Russell's swaggering truck driver hero from John Carpenter's BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA who appears as a Blue Blaze Irregular and gives Team Banzai a lift!".

The look of the picture is quite good and considering it's meager budget highlydigestible. Given that the film never found a mass audience it is surprising that so many individuals seem to remember it as vividly and as fondly as they do. I can only hope that after everyone has gotten their fill of a certain galaxy far far away that a return to the more substantial basics of storytelling and characterization is deemed imperative.

	schema:headline " A Unique Epic Adventure";
	schema:reviewBody "Since the release of this film in 1984 it has achieved bona fide cult status and with good reason for it is without question one of the most unique offerings in the universe of cinematic science fiction.  chockfull of quirky memorable characters and scenes The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension' directed by W.D. Richter is laced with clever dialogue action adventure and surprises.  And where else are you ever going to find a main character who is a scientist brain surgeon and rock n' roll star all rolled up into one?After years of research Buckaroo Banzai Peter Weller and his colleague Professor Hikita Robert Ito have successfully developed an overthruster' a device that has allowed Buckaroo to pass through solid matter a mountain in fact driving through it at high speed in his specially designed and equipped car.  But when his achievement hits the news it captures the attention of the mad Dr. Emilio Lizardo John Lithgow who catches the story on television from his room in the insane asylum where he has been a resident for many years ever since his own attempt at developing an overthruster failed.  But though Lizardo's trial run with the overthruster failed it did put him in contact with alien beings from another realm one of whom Lord John Whorfin has since that encounter inhabited Lizardo's mind and body.  They are Red Lectroids from Planet 10 by way of the 8th dimension stranded on earth in human form and awaiting the development of the overthruster which will enable them to return home.  These are dangerous and resourceful beings and they are about to take Buckaroo Banzai currently on tour with his band The Hong Kong Cavaliers by surprise.  And soon all that will stand between the Red Lectroids and the destruction of the earth will be Buckaroo his band and some help from his loyal followers the Blue Blazer Regulars.'Working from the highly imaginative clever and detailed screenplay by Earl Mac Rauch Richter has fashioned and delivered a colorful and exciting adventure filled with subtle humor the unexpected and an array of outrageous characters from Whorfin and the Lectroids all of whom have the first name John' to Buckaroo's cohorts like Perfect Tommy Lewis Smith' and New Jersey Jeff Goldblum to the alluring mysterious woman Buckaroo encounters Penny Priddy Ellen Barkin.  It's an unconventional yet readily accessible film that Richter has packed with interesting asides lines and situations all of which drive the story forward and keep you guessing as to what could possibly happen next.  He throws so much at you in fact that it's impossible to catch it all the first time through but it's a movie that lends itself to repeated viewings because it's exactly what this kind of film is supposed to be  Pure entertainment from start to finish.Peter Weller is perfectly cast as Buckaroo and he successfully captures all of the elements that make his character the ultimate Renaissance Man of the immediate future.  With this performance Weller becomes the personification of the genius adventurer and masterofallthings it's the definitive portrayal of a unique individual quite unlike any ever presented on the silver screen before.  Weller's Buckaroo is intelligent and selfassured watching him you get the feeling there's always something going on in his head and always a step ahead of the next guy and it's his ability to convey the complexities of the character that makes him believable and his incredible exploits seem credible.  Simply put Weller has taken a comic book character and made him real and it makes the film work.As LizardoWhorfin John Lithgow takes it magnificently over the top with a character that is something of a precursor to his High Commander Dick Solomon on TV's 3rd Rock from the Sun.'  And watching this guy in action is a real kick.  He's larger than life wildly animated and extroverted while affecting an accent that's a veritable smorgasbord of dialect.  He lumbers along like a mutated Quasimodo and when he gives a speech to his fellow Red Lectroids about going home' it's one of the most hilarious scenes you're ever going to see anywhere.  There's definitely a method to Lithgow's madness and it's a terrific performance.Christopher Lloyd also turns in a winning performance as another of the Red Lectroids John Bigboote' and his exchanges with Lithgow are a riot especially when Lizardo insists on calling him BigBooty' and Bigboote adamantly insists that it is pronounced BigbooTAY!'.  And that's just an example of the many many finer and detailed elements Richter uses to make this film so enjoyable and successful from consistently funny verbal exchanges to broad physical humor all interspersed with the action and woven seamlessly into the story.The additional supporting cast includes Rosalind Cash John Emdall Pepe Serna Reno Nevada Matt Clark McKinley Clancy Brown Rawhide Carl Lumbly John Parker Vincent Schiavelli John O'Connor Dan Hedaya John Gomez Bill Henderson Casper Damon Hines Scooter Billy Vera Pinky Carruthers Ronald Lacey President Widmark and William Traylor General Catburd.  A film that will take you on a wild ride and into regions beyond the known The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension' is that most rare treasure among cinematic discoveries  A truly unique film. It's enthralling and entertaining and will keep you laughing and involved no matter how many times you see it.

	onyx:emotionText "Since the release of this film in 1984 it has achieved bona fide cult status and with good reason for it is without question one of the most unique offerings in the universe of cinematic science fiction.  chockfull of quirky memorable characters and scenes The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension' directed by W.D. Richter is laced with clever dialogue action adventure and surprises.  And where else are you ever going to find a main character who is a scientist brain surgeon and rock n' roll star all rolled up into one?After years of research Buckaroo Banzai Peter Weller and his colleague Professor Hikita Robert Ito have successfully developed an overthruster' a device that has allowed Buckaroo to pass through solid matter a mountain in fact driving through it at high speed in his specially designed and equipped car.  But when his achievement hits the news it captures the attention of the mad Dr. Emilio Lizardo John Lithgow who catches the story on television from his room in the insane asylum where he has been a resident for many years ever since his own attempt at developing an overthruster failed.  But though Lizardo's trial run with the overthruster failed it did put him in contact with alien beings from another realm one of whom Lord John Whorfin has since that encounter inhabited Lizardo's mind and body.  They are Red Lectroids from Planet 10 by way of the 8th dimension stranded on earth in human form and awaiting the development of the overthruster which will enable them to return home.  These are dangerous and resourceful beings and they are about to take Buckaroo Banzai currently on tour with his band The Hong Kong Cavaliers by surprise.  And soon all that will stand between the Red Lectroids and the destruction of the earth will be Buckaroo his band and some help from his loyal followers the Blue Blazer Regulars.'Working from the highly imaginative clever and detailed screenplay by Earl Mac Rauch Richter has fashioned and delivered a colorful and exciting adventure filled with subtle humor the unexpected and an array of outrageous characters from Whorfin and the Lectroids all of whom have the first name John' to Buckaroo's cohorts like Perfect Tommy Lewis Smith' and New Jersey Jeff Goldblum to the alluring mysterious woman Buckaroo encounters Penny Priddy Ellen Barkin.  It's an unconventional yet readily accessible film that Richter has packed with interesting asides lines and situations all of which drive the story forward and keep you guessing as to what could possibly happen next.  He throws so much at you in fact that it's impossible to catch it all the first time through but it's a movie that lends itself to repeated viewings because it's exactly what this kind of film is supposed to be  Pure entertainment from start to finish.Peter Weller is perfectly cast as Buckaroo and he successfully captures all of the elements that make his character the ultimate Renaissance Man of the immediate future.  With this performance Weller becomes the personification of the genius adventurer and masterofallthings it's the definitive portrayal of a unique individual quite unlike any ever presented on the silver screen before.  Weller's Buckaroo is intelligent and selfassured watching him you get the feeling there's always something going on in his head and always a step ahead of the next guy and it's his ability to convey the complexities of the character that makes him believable and his incredible exploits seem credible.  Simply put Weller has taken a comic book character and made him real and it makes the film work.As LizardoWhorfin John Lithgow takes it magnificently over the top with a character that is something of a precursor to his High Commander Dick Solomon on TV's 3rd Rock from the Sun.'  And watching this guy in action is a real kick.  He's larger than life wildly animated and extroverted while affecting an accent that's a veritable smorgasbord of dialect.  He lumbers along like a mutated Quasimodo and when he gives a speech to his fellow Red Lectroids about going home' it's one of the most hilarious scenes you're ever going to see anywhere.  There's definitely a method to Lithgow's madness and it's a terrific performance.Christopher Lloyd also turns in a winning performance as another of the Red Lectroids John Bigboote' and his exchanges with Lithgow are a riot especially when Lizardo insists on calling him BigBooty' and Bigboote adamantly insists that it is pronounced BigbooTAY!'.  And that's just an example of the many many finer and detailed elements Richter uses to make this film so enjoyable and successful from consistently funny verbal exchanges to broad physical humor all interspersed with the action and woven seamlessly into the story.The additional supporting cast includes Rosalind Cash John Emdall Pepe Serna Reno Nevada Matt Clark McKinley Clancy Brown Rawhide Carl Lumbly John Parker Vincent Schiavelli John O'Connor Dan Hedaya John Gomez Bill Henderson Casper Damon Hines Scooter Billy Vera Pinky Carruthers Ronald Lacey President Widmark and William Traylor General Catburd.  A film that will take you on a wild ride and into regions beyond the known The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension' is that most rare treasure among cinematic discoveries  A truly unique film. It's enthralling and entertaining and will keep you laughing and involved no matter how many times you see it.  And it's filled with great lines you'll be able to quote endlessly and use for any occasion.  Or as Buckaroo himself would say No matter where you go there you are...'  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 910.";

John has been imprisoned in Dr. Lizardo since then and wants to return home.When Dr. Lizardo breached the dimensional barrier he freed many Red Lectroids who were being imprisoned there.  All are named John and arrived on Earth in Grover's Mill New Jersey on Halloween night 1938.  They all want to return home.  But to do so they will have to steal the overthruster from Buckaroo and his Cavaliers who don't want to let it go.Peter Weller is wonderful as Buckaroo playing him with a Zenlike coolness that many have mistaken for woodenness.  He is quick with his own koantype sayings  No matter where you go there you are and This will change your life.  Or not.  Weller finds the character quickly and plays him for all he is worth.Also amusing is the way Weller is verbally described as halfJapanese but appears to have no Oriental features.  It strikes me to be in the manner of a pulp magazine where the only Orientals drawn were always villains. However many of the heroes of the pulps had mystical Oriental training were raised by wild pandas etc.The Cavaliers are wellcasted and acted particularly Reno Nevada Pepe Serna Rawhide Clancy Brown and Perfect Tommy Lewis Smith.  There are even hints about other Cavaliers who aren't in the movie such as Pecos who is in Tibet.Ellen Barkin does a fairly good job with her role as the clearlypsychotic Penny Priddy though far from her best role and Jeff Goldblum perfectly nails his role as the brain surgeon Sidney who becomes the cowboy Cavalier New Jersey.  I personally think it's his best role ever.The villains are fantastic.  John Lithgow's Lizardo is the alltime overthetop hoot.  Christopher Lloyd Dan Hedaya and Vincent Schiavelli all show up as various Black Lectroids all named John.Carl Lumbly makes an early acting appearance as a good Red Lectroid the dreadlocked John Parker.  His grin and sunny demeanor lighten up the coming apocalypse and makes his character one of the most likable ones ever on the silver screen.The movie is lowbudget and looks it.  Don't be fooled into thinking this matters.  The lowbudget look perfectly fits the pulp fiction quality that the story demanded.  The special effects border on cheesy but fit the story to a T.This movie is one of the great science fiction movies simply because it knew exactly what it was and it gave the viewer exactly that.  It was at once a spoof of 50's era science fiction and a celebration of all things sci fi.  It steeped the work in the pulp styles of Doc Savage and poked gentle fun at the pseudoscience used in those same books.  It also firmly establishes itself in the '80's and savagely sends up the politics and fashions of the same decade.I can't give this movie a grade.  I love it too much.  It's not perfect but it's damn close.  If you have a solid threedigit IQ and you haven't seen this movie do so.  I envy you for still having the experience in front of you.If you think that the late '90s Godzilla was pretty good that Men In Black rocked and that Independence Day was the greatest movie ever...don't bother.

Just looking at the list of great actors that starred in this movie should be enough for any serious movie fanatic to become giddy with excitement and rightly so.First of all Peter Weller gives a stunning performance as the main character Buckaroo Banzai an archetypical Renaissance Man whose expertise spans a significant number of different subject areas. A neurosurgeon musician quantumphysicist and realtime action hero all rolled into one he delves into the unfolding adventure in such a fearless manner that it makes our usual Rambo Indiana Jones or even James Bond characters that we are so used to watching seem wet behind the ears. Joining our main character there are the incredible performances of wellknown names such as Jeff Goldblum John Lithgow and Christopher Lloyd to name but a few.This inyourface line up of top class actors gives the viewer the setup for a incredibly entertaining movie in which the action and comedy never seems to stop never ceases to be interesting and more importantly remains plausible. Because apart from it being great entertainment it also provides a very real message that for its day was years ahead of its time. The quantumphysical theme throughout the whole movie I doubt whether the term 'quantumphysical' even existed back then will carry on teasing the eager mind and will keep you thinking for a long time. Could it be possible that this movie provided the inspiration for other box office science fiction hits such as Back to the Future or even Clive Barker's Hellraiser? Same goes for the interdimensional alien invasion theme in contrast to aliens from outer space which has since been overused many times. But this science fictionactionadventure movie does it in a way that grabs a hold of you and has no intention of letting you go for the rest of it's enjoyable ride. And neither do you want it to.I can somewhat relate to the criticism concerning the costumes and special effects. However considering the cheap and simplistic costumes paired with the sometimes incredible popularity of a series such as Star Trek for instance I truly believe the real science fiction lover will look beyond this and appreciate the overall atmosphere of the movie. Humanoid aliens may perhaps be a little less exciting than the CGI monsters in movies such as the Alien trilogy but hey in The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension this just plainly isn't the case. We're dealing with Lectoids. And in this case it's as real and exciting as it gets.Comedy lovers also get their fair share of laughs as this movie is laden with the craziest situations and jammed with drywitted oneliners. All in all this is a very underrated movie that will never get old. Definitely a classic that everyone should watch at least twice. You probably will since the longawaited sequel sadly never was made.".

	schema:headline " What are you talking about man some kind of Race War in New Jersey?  The President";
	schema:reviewBody "The film opens with Dr. Banzai Peter Weller a brilliant neurosurgeon and scientist performing surgery from a remote location to correct an Eskimo's paralysis. The Jet Car is waiting outside  which may or may not allow him to break through into the 8th dimension with the help of his Oscillation Overthruster an invention Professor Hikita and Dr. Emilio Lizardo John Lithgow have been testing and trying to perfect for the past half a century. After the surgery Banzai's experiment with the Overthruster proves to be a success. Later that evening Dr. Banzai decides to unwind by performing live with those hardrocking group of scientists the Hong Hong Cavaliers at a club owned by a fellow named Artie. Artie could care less about Banzai's scientific breakthrough he just wants some music out of these characters. During the performance a suicide attempt by a young woman named Penny Priddy HOT Ellen Barkin is thwarted by a clumsy cocktail waitress. She is apprehended immediately by authorities and taken away. The following day Dr. Banzai springs her from jail cell due to the fact he believes she is his murdered exwife's twin sister whom she was separated from at birth.Life gets even more complicated for Dr. Banzai when he along with the help of Dr. Sidney Zweibel Jeff Goldblum discover Lectroids by Planet 10 by way the 8th dimension invaded Grovers Mill New Jersey 50 years before. Orson Welles' 1939 War Of The Worlds radio broadcast actually wasn't a hoax Zweibel concludes. In the years since this invasion the Lectroids  who look like regular folks to those who don't have the formula  have basically taken over a weapons manufacturer under contract by the D.O.D. and are in the process of planning global annihilation. Unfortunately the President whose back is killing him is oblivious to this fact as he leads a country crippled by a looming cold war with Russia. It's up to Team Banzai to take matters into their own hands especially after the Lectroids abduct Penny and steal the overthruster which they would need in order to get back into the 8th dimension where they once resided.I first saw Buckaroo Banzai when I was in Jr. high during it's brief run at the theaters and am still quite fond of the film as an adult. Earl MacRauch's creative and original script is packed with exceptionally witty dry humor. Repeated viewings are a must in order to take it all in. It is no secret that this offbeat scifi adventure  comedy has developed a huge cult following over the years and there's no doubt MacRauch along with director W.D. Richter made this movie with that intention.With this and RoboCop Peter Weller should be proud of having appeared in two 80's classics. The rest of the supporting cast is great too. The underrated Clancy Brown shines in a small role as Buck's illfated counterpart Rawhide and John Lithgow gives an outstanding performance as Dr. Lizardo  Lord Whorfin. One of the many great aspects of this movie is that you feel a real sense of camaraderie amongst the members of 'Team Banzai'.I must acknowledge that over the years I have recommended this film to several people and they came back to me saying it was one of the worst movies they have ever seen. This makes me appreciate Buckaroo Banzai even more. Orson Wells the guy from the old wine commercials has nothing on W.D. Richter. This is one of the top 10 films of all time.".

	onyx:emotionText "The film opens with Dr. Banzai Peter Weller a brilliant neurosurgeon and scientist performing surgery from a remote location to correct an Eskimo's paralysis. The Jet Car is waiting outside  which may or may not allow him to break through into the 8th dimension with the help of his Oscillation Overthruster an invention Professor Hikita and Dr. Emilio Lizardo John Lithgow have been testing and trying to perfect for the past half a century. After the surgery Banzai's experiment with the Overthruster proves to be a success. Later that evening Dr. Banzai decides to unwind by performing live with those hardrocking group of scientists the Hong Hong Cavaliers at a club owned by a fellow named Artie. Artie could care less about Banzai's scientific breakthrough he just wants some music out of these characters. During the performance a suicide attempt by a young woman named Penny Priddy HOT Ellen Barkin is thwarted by a clumsy cocktail waitress. She is apprehended immediately by authorities and taken away. The following day Dr. Banzai springs her from jail cell due to the fact he believes she is his murdered exwife's twin sister whom she was separated from at birth.Life gets even more complicated for Dr. Banzai when he along with the help of Dr. Sidney Zweibel Jeff Goldblum discover Lectroids by Planet 10 by way the 8th dimension invaded Grovers Mill New Jersey 50 years before. Orson Welles' 1939 War Of The Worlds radio broadcast actually wasn't a hoax Zweibel concludes. In the years since this invasion the Lectroids  who look like regular folks to those who don't have the formula  have basically taken over a weapons manufacturer under contract by the D.O.D. and are in the process of planning global annihilation. Unfortunately the President whose back is killing him is oblivious to this fact as he leads a country crippled by a looming cold war with Russia. It's up to Team Banzai to take matters into their own hands especially after the Lectroids abduct Penny and steal the overthruster which they would need in order to get back into the 8th dimension where they once resided.I first saw Buckaroo Banzai when I was in Jr. high during it's brief run at the theaters and am still quite fond of the film as an adult. Earl MacRauch's creative and original script is packed with exceptionally witty dry humor. Repeated viewings are a must in order to take it all in. It is no secret that this offbeat scifi adventure  comedy has developed a huge cult following over the years and there's no doubt MacRauch along with director W.D. Richter made this movie with that intention.With this and RoboCop Peter Weller should be proud of having appeared in two 80's classics. The rest of the supporting cast is great too. The underrated Clancy Brown shines in a small role as Buck's illfated counterpart Rawhide and John Lithgow gives an outstanding performance as Dr. Lizardo  Lord Whorfin. One of the many great aspects of this movie is that you feel a real sense of camaraderie amongst the members of 'Team Banzai'.I must acknowledge that over the years I have recommended this film to several people and they came back to me saying it was one of the worst movies they have ever seen.

All of the 'science' is portrayed totally tonguefirmlyincheek. If you didn't get that with the baby bang reference from Doctor Penny Priddy during the press conference scene well then I'm sorry but you're hopeless.If anything this is an antiSciFi film. It's a spoof of all those 1950'sera SciFi films where the incredibly bad science interpretation is played completely seriously. I mean c'mon the Overthruster tracking device with the UPStruck turnsignal click should have clued you in that someone isn't quite serious here.What we've got here is a great romp with some future megastars having a great time. Lithgow's performance alone is worth the price of admission. Ellen Barkin is luscious in both that pink dress and her tiedup black skirt. That jailcell flirtation scene... well what more can I say? Those wonderful injokes Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems. YOYOdyne? The Future Begins Tomorrow... well of course it does. Negative we do not have crossover... we are over New Jersey. All is not lost. Well of course it isn't... or is it? Born and raised there Woodbridge Twp. sorry. To this day my sister and brotherinlaw live in New Brunswick I'm not making this up. If you own the DVD as I do then you probably know that practically nothing was created for this film. The Red Lectroid bivouac was an abandoned Firestone tire factory. If you ever did highschool drama you probably recognized Lizardo's footpedals as an ancient lighting dimmer board. The spinning Styrofoam cup in the shock tower an automotive term takes the cake.There is so much going on in this lowlowbudget film to laugh with not at. If you watch this film looking not to trash it but to laugh with it I think you will get far far more out of it.I only wish they had been able to make the sequel.And finally I originally saw this film when it was first released in the Harvard Square cinema in Cambridge Mass.

But then again there's the problem that the movie is not really funny and on top of that also not so very well made.

It developed some potentially interesting characters and plot lines but for some reason as the movie progresses they don't get handled well. The movie becomes more crazy and crazy as the movie heads toward the ending. At one point I even stopped caring and wanting to understand what the movie was all about. It was confusing it was poor but above all it was odd.The movie could had been fun the movie could had been action filled but yet it all isn't. It's wasted potential cause I guess that in essence Buckaroo Banzai isn't really a bad fun movie mainhero.The movie is only fun now really with its character's names. All of the alien's their first name is John and they have names such as John Bigboote John O'Connor and John Smallberries. But other than that there isn't really much fun present in the movie. The many famous actors however still provide the movie with some fun and this uplifts the movie. Amazing how many great actors are in this movie such as Ellen Barkin Jeff Goldblum Christopher Lloyd Clancy Brown Ronald Lacey Vincent Schiavelli and Dan Hedaya. John Lithgow is deliciously overacting as the movie its main villain but I just wish that he had more sequences and was made more interesting as a character. Peter Weller was a great leading man in the '80's and he shows with this movie how well he can carry a movie.The special effects are all decent for '80's standards but perhaps overused a bit too much. The musical score is typically '80's like and absolutely horrible. Further more the movie is fairly well looking too bad inexperienced director W.D. Richter doesn't know how to use everything to its full potential.Yet it's not all that bad and the movie still entertains so the movie obviously still has some redeeming qualities which makes this still a bit of a watchable movie.510httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Ulzana is an East German western film from over 40 years ago that was written and directed by Gottfried Kolditz one of the country's most famous filmmakers. He got help on the script by his lead actor Gojko Mitic here and Mitic was basically known as the GDR version of Winnetou back then. This movie is already over 40 years old and certainly very different compared to what the United States came up with in western films back then but this does not mean necessarily that it is inferior to most of them. And I personally believe it is better than Winnetou having seen some of the FRG's films from back then. Pierre Brice just wasn't a bad actor and the lack of shades made these occasionally painful to watch. I also think in terms of pure western action this one has more to offer and it's surprisingly graphic and in your face with the violence and shooting scenes. I believe this is a good thing. And I also believe you should watch Apaches first the prequel to this 90minute film here also starring Gojko Mitic as the title character Ulzana. If you like that one then you will probably enjoy this one too. The villains are interesting the good guys are fun to watch as well. I would not call any of these two films a really great viewing experience but they sure had their moments and overall I believe the good outweighs the bad and that's all I could ask for. Thumbs up definitely one of the better films the GDR has come up with.".

However I didn't watch it until tonight mainly because it didn't get too many favorable reviews on IMDB. That sad I was bored and decided to watch it. And from the first scene I was drawn in... This movie has a rather creepy but melancholy tension thoughout. It's a slow movie yes but boring? Definatly not. The pacing is just right. It amplifies the mystery of the story. Most people who watch scary movies nowadays just expect cheap scares instead of a truly eery atmosphere thoughout. So I think that is what makes a lot of people dislike this movie. This movie isn't big on the scares it has some but not many but what it does is make the viewer wonder.The movie basically is about Kaorushe's a very pretty girl btw whose brother is missing. He seems to have gone to visit his girlfriend in a little rural village in the middle of nowhere. That's the last he's heard from. As Koaru goes off to search for him there she finds that things are odd in the village... Everyone seems to be obsessed with a festivalJapan has a lot of festivals for many spiritual things about scarecrows. And everyone seems to want her to leave and is unwilling to help her...The ending I found wasn't a dud like someone mentioned but more like a very sad one. More I will not say about this movie. You have to watch it for yourself.This isn't a movie for people who like cheap scares. But someone who likes mystery and eery things happening will probably like this movie. very reccomended.".

Yes Kakashi is a slowpaced film not much in the way of horror... but it does work very well as a kind of weird drama although some of the scarecrow scenes are a little... silly perhaps?The cinematography is lovely the story is sensitively handled and the soundtrack is beautiful... and Kou Shibasaki is even more evil than her role as Mitsuko in Battle Royale I enjoyed it a lot and I'd definitely recommend it but more on a drama basis than a horror  it's really not very scary IMHO compared to some other Japanese films.".

I wonder if Tsuruta had this in mind when he made this film.  If he releases a sequel called KaseDori... well never mind. Besides being rather short and lessthansatisfying in its plot resolution my primary complaint about this film is the horrid transfer on the Region 3 DVD which is quite good for the daylight scenes but irritatingly pixelated during the lowlight and night shots.  And being a lowbudget horror flick this turkey has a lot of shadowy and nocturnal footage which I had a hard time following because my attention was constantly being diverted to the everchanging patches of pixels fading in and out.  Yuck. As for the movie Yoshikawa Kaoru Nonami Mahois searching for her brother Tsuyoshi Matsuoka Shunsuke who has disappeared.  A search of his apartment turns up an ambiguous and messilyscrawled letter from a girl in Kozukatamachi a small rural village. Kaoru drives to Kozukata on the eve of their Kakashimatsuri festival where she finds the cliche little town with a secret along with her brother.  Unless there is a longer version of the film out there the character development is as thin as both the plot and the special effects budget. Perhaps the movie's budget was blown on bringing in HK actress Grace Ip to play the very out of place Kozukata resident who barely speaks any Japanese.  She even has a Chinese surname in the movie which does little to explain why she's there in the middle of the rural Japanese heartland.  Shibasaki Kou who reminds me of a short Esumi Makiko plays the mysterious girl who lured Tsuyoshi to Kozukata and does a decent job with the sparse camera time she gets.  The one thing that impressed me about this movie was the excellent lighting and cinematography of the daylight scenes depicting the beauty of a small rural farming village.  Other than that let the renter beware and the buyer be laughed at.".

The director tries very hard to create a feeling of suspense but is unable to follow through. The movie does have several moments where the suspense potential is very high but the director seems to feel the need to rush through it. As far as the acting goes I thought that Maho Nonami  Kou Shibasaki did very well considering what they had to work with story wise. The music was good and much creepier then the story. The storyline also left me with more questions at the end of the movie. I just feel that more should have been explained. I hope that the comic was better written then the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kakashi like quite a few other Japanese horror films had an unresolved ending and an eskewed sense of logic. Considering a horror film about kakashiscarecrows of all things makes one wonder what the film is like. How do they make scarecrows scary? That is what I thought when I got this film.However the answer in this case at least is they can't. The scarecrows were easy to push away and tear apart even for the heroine Kaoru and they never once did anything that really showed any power to fear. In short the monsters of the show were very weak. Excessively so.The main villain a psychotically obsessive woman who killed herself is mostly an evil spirit who can make Kaoru have nightmares taunts her inside the house and who later becomes reborn as a scarecrow and dies in a blaze of laughing mania. A possible high point of the story and the scene that reveals that Izumi was dead and why she died ends up less than scary and more or less creepy. The woman was pathetically obsessed and completely manic in her childish flaunts of overdramatic and emotistic emotion. This woman has problems obviously.In fact it's safe to say that all of the characters involved in this story had some sort of problem. Kaoru had her incessant and obvious brother complex Sally and Izumi's parents were obsessed with using scarecrows and Izumi was... insane. Tsuyoshi was probably the least humanized of all the characters. Between Izumi and Kaoru he seemed more of an object to be taken. Poor guy. All in all this movie wasn't frightening even in the nightmare diary and scarecrowescape sequences like it possibly could have been. It was unbelievable in both story and in how poorly it was done. If you're looking for a good horror to give you a scare or even challenge your mind this is not it.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are enough good things about this littleknown comedy that the viewer really wants it to work. The Hudson brothers are charismatic and often funny but the overall ineptness of the production seems to smother them. Despite some very funny gags and lines Hysterical is hopelessly bogged down by redundancy and a myriad of technical problems. The fact that the director of this film has no other directorial credits may be one indication of why things went badly.The story centers around a disillusioned yet successful writer who decides to spend a month in a quaint coastal Oregon town to write the great American novel. Most of his books have been trashy sex stories and one of the running gags of the film shows people reading his latest book wherever he goes. Even inside a loony bin. Anyway no sooner does the writer arrive in his new town than things start going haywire. The body of a deceased sea captain surfaces in the harbor for example. And the spirit of his old mistress haunts the writer after he moves into the captain's old lighthouse. The town folk are baffled as to the strange goings on and two crazed adventure seekers are called in to help solve the trouble.The film is a vehicle for the three Hudson brothers who play the writer and the two adventurers. This film was apparently supposed to make them the Marx Bros of the 1980s. Needless to say that didn't happen. The three of them are likable but the material is just too cheesy in many aspects of the film. There are some very funny lines and a few of the running gags are quite funny too. One involving a crazy guy on a bike warning people they're doomed has some clever angles. Of course this is a spoof of the guy from Friday the 13th 1  2 and this film spoofs countless other films along the way. One hilarious scene spoofs The Exorcist. The film also hits some good notes with a scene in a library where apparently the only black resident of the town works.There are all kinds of things wrong with Hysterical though. First of all this film was about as technically inept as any film I've ever seen not called R.O.T.O.R.. The lighting is so minimal that you can hardly see which characters are even in some scenes. The editing is choppy and the special FX are putrid. Some gags are revisited way too often. There are a total of three musical numbers one of them seems to last forever. Then there are times when the ancient technique of speeding up the film is used to emphasize the fact that we the audience should be laughing now. And the film has a cheap look to it in general. Even if a film has a tiny budget there are ways make it look less obvious.Overall this film was a nice try but just not good enough to launch anyone's career. The Hudson brothers are like that crazy uncle everyone has who can be funny for a while but he just doesn't realize when to turn it on or off. Honestly there just wasn't enough funny material here to stretch it out into a full length movie. In the end we get a marginally funny film that looks cheap and probably resulted in more than a few wet and bored actors. Many of them appearing in much better films before and after this one.4 of 10 stars.The Hound.".

And I'm glad for that for if the Hudson Brothers had decided to make a collector's edition of their film then it would've shown that they still hadn't learned their lesson from years back.Even so like a lot of the other aficionados it's primitive and I mean that in a good way sense of humor is worth a few smiles and an occasional laugh. It's a good hearted film that means well and does no harm.Something that might've helped this movie during production would've been a better film stock grade and a more professional shooting schedule because it looks as if it were shot as a made for TV movie even though it saw theatrical release.

Hysterical IS pretty hysterically awful but it does not quite fit in the category of Movies So Bad They're Good. Yes the plot is clichd and predictable. Yes it stars the Hudson Brothers those inoffensive pop products from the Seventies who were quickly forgotten in the Eighties. I for one certainly hadn't thought about them since then and had no idea they'd made a movie. It also features a gaggle of supporting actors whose faces will be recognizable to anyone who watched movies and TV in the Sixties and Seventies or who watches TVLand today. The female lead is Cindy Pickett who looks and acts so wholesome here that it's hard to believe she appeared in an earlier film Roger Vadim's Night Games that was very erotic. She radiates essentially no sexual luster in Hysterical. Still the production values are surprisingly good for a bad movie. It looks and feels like a real movie this is not Edward D. Wood stuff. The Hudson Brothers actually manage to work up a respectable comic energy. There are a few breakout scenes that are extremely funny especially the big production number with dancing zombies in an amusement park and a toobrief scene in which the brothers try to confuse some pursuing zombies with an impromptu doowop session. The movie also works in sendups of a lot of other films Vertigo Marnie The Rocky Horror Show Chariots of Fire and Night of the Living Dead to name just a few. All in all this is a movie that is fun to see once just for laughs.".

It makes the movie just silly but what is way worse is that there is something funny going on a pun being uttered or whatever else every 5 seconds or so in the movie. This movie doesn't give you a moment to breath or think about what you have just seen or heard. This is a bad thing from its storytelling perspective but also comedywise its really harming the movie.It seems almost as if the movie was having too many good ideas. They wanted to spoof far too many movies and no matter how good or funny some of those moments are the movie as a whole just never feels like a successful one. It's perhaps also due to it that the movie is using far too many different comedy elements. You have some slapstick comedy some puns a couple of running gags and some spoof elements all crammed into one movie.Besides the movie is of course spoofing only movies and making fun of people that were only relevant around that time. It makes the movie already sort of outdated. Seriously which young people shall understand who that Ralph character was supposed to be? Or recognize Travis Bickle? The movie is filled with moments like that. You can't of course really hold it against the movie and I also wont but it's still something important to note and realize when deciding to watch this movie.The story itself is just as messy and random as its comedy really. This sounds like fun perhaps but it really isn't. It makes the movie hard to follow simply because you don't understand what is going on. It has something to do with an haunted lighthouse and a writer and a couple of ghosthunters show up while meanwhile some people are also turning into zombies. Why? I absolutely have no idea. How? I'm clueless about that as well. It's a shame since I truly feel and believe that the movie had some really good ideas and potential in it to become a good horrorcomedy or spoof.But having said all that I have to admit that the movie still made me laugh. It does definitely still has its great and effective moments mainly with its spoof elements. The Ralph character was pretty hilarious while it also was quite funny to see Murray Hamilton. I can't be too sure about it but it seems like he actually was supposed to be the same character as he played in the Jaws movies. It are some of the movie its comical moments that still make the movie somewhat worthwhile even though I still really can't recommend it to just everyone.It has its funny moments but it's really far from a great movie!510httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I think it was about five years ago when I first discovered that this 1997 lawyer comedy existed. It took me this long to finally get around to seeing it even though I've been familiar with the two stars for quite some time now. I've seen Jeff Daniels as Jim Carrey's costar in Dumb  Dumber and knew the now infamous Michael Richards obviously for his role as Kramer in the popular sitcom Seinfeld plus his roles in comedy films such as UHF and So I Married an Axe Murderer. Since I had seen both of these actors in funny moviesTV shows I figured I might find Trial and Error mildly amusing nothing more judging by its general reception. Expecting a mixed blessing I didn't get any big surprises pleasant or unpleasant.Charles Tuttle Daniels is a lawyer who will soon be married. His best friend and best man for the wedding is an outofwork actor named Richard Rietti Richards. Tuttle has been called over to Paradise Bluff Nevada to defend his fiance's relative Benny Gibbs in a class action fraud suit. When he arrives in the town Richard or Ricky is there and is ready to throw a bachelor party for his friend. After drinking and getting attacked in the bar Charlie is not well enough to work the next day so Ricky decides to go to the courtroom and claim to be a lawyer named Charles Tuttle! Charlie is not happy when he hears what Ricky has done and soon finds that he now has to pose as an actor named Richard Rietti! Since the real Rietti is not trained to be a lawyer the real Charlie pretends to be his assistant using cue cards to tell him what to do on the job while he defends Benny. Obviously this leads to a horrible mess! There weren't too many times when I laughed really hard while watching this 1997 comedy but there were many parts I found at least mildly amusing. I can't forget Ricky discovering that his sick friend in bed has emptied out his pill bottle Ricky trying to prepare Charlie for the trial while he is ill Charlie's reaction when he learns what Ricky has done and many things the main characters go through while they pose as each other. Michael Richards and Jeff Daniels are a good pair in the lead roles which might be the main reason why this film is funny. Richards with his overthetop antics playing a character with good intentions who keeps lousing up and Daniels with some of the faces he makes and his character's reactions to Ricky's doings. Unfortunately the plot isn't too interesting and if the film were hilarious that wouldn't matter but it's not funny enough to prevent the movie from being a little dull. Also the romance wasn't done so well eventually getting a little sappy and the ending leaves much to be desired.This movie came out the same year as Liar Liar another lawyer comedy. That film is definitely the more popular of the two but I have to be honest I prefer this one as crazy as many people might think I am for that. While Jim Carrey has made me laugh in other films I found that his antics went too far in that one. Richards and Daniels while not usually hilarious in the film are still pretty funny. I'm sure we all know about Richards' racist tirade in November 2006 which obviously permanently damaged his reputation and started a never ending debate over whether he really meant what he said and whether his apology was honest or not. It clearly had more impact than Mel Gibson's tirade earlier that year and the main reason for that was probably because Richards was caught on video. I remember feeling like I could never watch anything with Richards in it again after I first heard about the incident and saw the footage but now regardless of his reputation and what may go on in his head I have to admit he can still make me laugh in the comedies I see him in. If you like the two costars in Trial and Error as comedians then this flick could easily make you laugh or at least some parts could.".

	schema:reviewBody "If Hollywood had promoted Trial and Error as more than a comedy romance I'm sure it would have drawn a bigger audience and some discerning reviews about the breadth of the film. That's because this film is much more than a comedy romance. How can anyone miss the satire of our court system and the law profession? This film has some wonderful spoofing of attorneys judges juries witnesses and big law firms. It also has a very clear critique and commentary on social classes the trifles of high society weddings ambition and personal quest for power and wealth marriages of convenience without love and more. In an early scene we see the two leading men in one's new law office. It's a wraparound corner with glass windows and views over the whole city and a huge waste of space. The ridiculousness of it is accentuated by the solitary desk and chair across a huge room with nothing else in it.The film touches on the scams and frauds being perpetrated in our country especially against the gullible. My one complaint is that the writers might have chosen a better scam to be prosecuting  one in which older people especially get taken to the cleaners. But then this one lends itself perfectly to spoofing and the hilarious courtroom drama. To get an engraved likeness of Abraham Lincoln for just 17.99? Who couldn't bite? Indeed how we no longer count our pennies as a society! Trial and Error is not a movie of many funny and witty lines. Or even a great deal of romance. It doesn't have a lot of situations for outloud laughter. That may be why many of the viewers drawn to it don't think much of the film. But again had the film been promoted for its satire and breadth it likely would have drawn a wider audience and much greater appreciation. Of course there are some very good scenes of laughter. Michael Richards plays Richard Rietti an actor who is out of work at the time. Jeff Daniels plays his friend Charles Tuttle who is a lawyer. Jeff says he hopes Richard didn't do his godfather routine at his recent tryout. In a flashback we see Richard doing just that. He's hilarious and has tremendous body machinations. He bounces from one wall to another flies across a room falls to the floor and twists and turns in reaction to imaginary punches kicks and throws from imaginary mob men. The courtroom scenes are peppered with very funny antics from various people  Richard and Charles especially. But the judge too gets in the picture. Austin Pendleton plays Judge Graff. Could his name be an intentional play on words as in graft and corruption? And the jury members are definitely part of the fun and farce. Rip Torn as Benny Gibbs gives one of the best down and out pity stories on film intended to evoke laughter. And it does with me. In another scene Richard is in his hotel room watching a video on trial procedures. The speaker is the legendary Wyoming trial attorney Gerry Spence. He strikes a chord with Richard when he says that the courtroom is like a stage play and the trial lawyer is in charge. He's the producer director and star of the show. The film has subtle humor throughout as Charles tries to stick to the facts while Richard goes for the theatrics. The court system is supposed to rely on the facts but clearly emotions will win out most of the time. That's because of the human element. One must wonder if justice is truly served or if it is mostly a huge stage for lawyers to get rich. This film brings all that to the fore and it spoofs the testimony of expert witnesses as well. Charles says to Richard at one point that money will always find people willing to testify one way or another. Lying is a part of the game. But after a while our heroes decide they want to change and have the system work for real justice. That's the conclusion of the film. And oh yes there is romance and real love for both leading men. They are helped along by good performances from Charlize Theron as Billie Tyler and Jessica Steen as Elizabeth. One last plus for the film is the setting. It's supposed to be in Lone Pine Nevada for which road signs were made. But it was shot in and around Lone Pine California. So the film has nice scenic shots of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. This is a delightful film and spoof. Those who watch it for what it is are sure to enjoy it immensely.".

His buddy an unemployed actor takes his place at the trial for what is supposed to be a 5 minute appearance. The attractive female prosecutor wants to move on with the case and the substitute lawyer is committed to participate in the trial. The recovering real lawyer meets a cute waitress and enjoys her company on his day off only later to find that his friend's errors in court force a continued role as his doppelganger. The courtroom scenes are are absolutely hilarious as are the offcourtroom romantic entanglements of both friends. Don't miss this movie! It's the kind you will enjoy seeing over and over again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jeff Daniels plays a lawyer who has finally made it to partner in a bigcity law firm and he is about to marry the boss' daughter.  Michael Richards is his best man a struggling actor.  The firm sends Daniels to a town in the middle of nowhere to defend a man accused of fraud which means his bachelor party has to be postponed.  No it doesn't!  Richards and the gang show up in Nowheresville and have the party anyway. Daniels gets beat up and Richards makes a mistake with his medication meaning Daniels is in no shape to go to court the next day.  Richards knows all Daniels plans to do is ask for a continuance so he goes to court posing as Daniels' character.  The beautiful female prosecutor romantic interest for Richards? refuses demanding that the trial start right away.  Daniels is feeling better when the trial starts but of course he and Richards could get in a lot of trouble so Daniels poses as Richards' associate.  Richards stumbles through jury selection and the first part of the trial and the judge can't understand why an associate is giving him so much help.  Daniels ends up getting himself thrown out of the courtroom and the funniest moments in the movie come from his attempts to communicate with Richards.  Later Daniels starts a romance with a waitress he met at the bachelor party who he later met and told he was Richards' character. The movie's tone changes about halfway through still funny at times but no longer farcical.  Richards reminds me a lot of his Kramer character clumsy but able to pull off a scam quite well even if he never approaches being convincing as a real lawyer. But the prosecutor describes his performance as Oscarworthy and that's not too far off. SPOILERS FOLLOW  Richards eventually gets what he wants but isn't happy about it and Daniels realizes he wasn't happy in his old life. There is still more to the movie and it isn't entirely clear what will happen.  The moral dilemmas and how they were handled make the movie a little more substantial.  Still how Daniels handled his romantic situation seemed a little too neat and tidy.  We are left to assume how it must have happened.  An enjoyable picture.  If you really want to know the funniest moments Daniels falls through the courtroom ceiling after communicating through the heating vent and using a walkietalkie and a variation on Morse Code with the car horn Daniels attempts to feed signals to Richards  but a nearaccident resulting in lots of angry hornblowing results in a frenzy of ridiculous objections from Richards.".

	schema:reviewBody "What happens when a lawyer gets so drunk that in the morning he cannot make his court case and his friend has to cover for him? Well this movie outlines it quite well. The plot is interesting but the movie is nothing more than pure stupidity. The judge does not seem to be at all interested in actually running the case while the lawyer Jeff Daniels turns out to be nothing more than a bumbling fool.His friend the one who takes over the case for him knows absolutely nothing about law and can do absolutely nothing with out his friend beside him or at least in communication range. Yet the movie always takes the lawyer away to leave us laughing at the ineptitude of the friend who happens to be an actor.This movie really has nothing that makes it stand out. The lawyer is engaged to be married to a rich girl who is the daughter of the boss of the law firm for whom he works but he gives her up for a sweet city girl come country girl who has a humble background. The actor is chasing one particular woman all the way through the movie that is the prosecutor and gets away with things such as sexual harassment. In the end he lands up with her which is very typical of Hollywood.The name of the town Paradise Bluff brings up some thoughts as if it is a place that on the outside seems perfect but deep within there is some rotting evil. In this movie though there is no allusion nor is there any hidden evil. Paradise Bluff is a Paradise where the heroes live happily ever after.In my opinion Trial and Error is a very dull movie with little to no comedy in it at all. It is not worth hiring nor is it worth wasting one's time watching it on TV. The only time one should even consider watching this movie is when you are stuck on a bus between Adelaide and Sydney and there is no way off.".

	schema:headline " It's no My Cousin Vinny but funny nonetheless";
	schema:reviewBody "I was severely disappointed with this movie the first time it came out mainly because at the time I was at the peak of my Seinfeld fanaticism.  I thought Michael Richards was one of the funniest actors out there and I absolutely loved him as Kramer.  And of course the film doesn't live up to its trailerand that's something I still feel even after my second viewing.  The trailers make us assume this is a raucous fastpaced comedy with lots of physical schtick when it's actually a lot more lowkey.  It's strange because at the time I wasn't aware that Jonathan Lynn directed this film and I thought to myself Geez 'My Cousin Vinny' was so much funnier. Whoever this director is should've learned from that movie.  Of course Vinny is one of my favorite comedies of all time and it's extremely difficult to top a wonderfully original courtroom comedy of that kind. Anyway there was a sale at my local West Coast Video where I was able to purchase 5 videos for 19.99 so I decided to pick up Trial and Error with a gut feeling that this time I'll probably keep a more open mind and enjoy it a lot more.  Well I popped in the tape and I was impressed.  This is a funny film and I got a lot more laughs than I did when sitting in the theater.  Sure it's no My Cousin Vinny and I can't help but watch a courtroom comedy with that comparison in mind but I was still able to enjoy it for what it is.  Michael Richards is not nearly as funny as Joe Pesci but he was able to deliver some laughs without being overthetop which I found impressive. Sure I loved him as Kramer but the movie's name is Trial and Error and not Seinfeld and his job to play a CHARACTER.  And he did a fine job at playing this character even showing in certain scenes that he has potential as a serious actor.  Richards is a good actor and not simply a comedian who transfers his act to the big screen like in the case of a Chris Tucker or Cedric the Entertainer.  Jeff Daniels is a very funny straight man and some of his emotional outbursts are really enjoyable to watch.  Charlize Theron is her normal beautiful charming self.  I just wish Alexandra Wentworth could've been given a less thankless role.  She doesn't get much chance to flaunt her talents as a comic actress.  SPOILERS AHEADWhat prevents the movie from being a great memorable comedy is its predictable utterly formulaic plot.  Daniels is engaged to a woman who he obviously doesn't like in the first place and from one twist of fate he falls for another woman and decides to bump the marriage.  And of course there's the case with Richards where he pulls his fake lawyer act disastrously at first improves as he goes along and finally has an attack of conscience and decides to lose the case allowing the slimy defendant to pay his debt to society.  Didn't I see that in Liar Liar?  And other movies of this sort?  Despite its flaws I liked the movie and was able to accept it for what it is...the second time around.  I imagine others had the same feelings as I did on the first viewing.  Trial and Error isn't a mustsee but it's worth watching.  My score  7 out of 10".

The charge against it made by critics  it is a cut and paste of two previous Hercules films with some added new material to make it appear fresh  misses the fact that this cutandpaste approach solves one of the central problems of the swordandsandal movies. With most of these films the middle third sags horribly  usually involving a sappy love story or arcane political intrigue or both queen falls in love with Hercules and her evil brother plots against them etc. It's often hard to hold on through this to watch the exciting finale. Hercules the Avenger cuts all that crap from the source films and adds a rather brisk narrative of a Hercules impersonator bullying his way into power. It should be noted that this episode also functions as a distant but pointedly critical remark on the rise of Fascism in Italy. This also sets up a fine final wrasslin' match between the real Hercules and his impersonator.In a narrower focus I might also add that further editing has improved individual scenes borrowed from the other films. For my money the mutiny scene here is much better than it first appeared in Hercules and the Captive Women since it has been tightened with the reduction of several characters and their plot complications.There are also floppy monsters creepy underworld atmospherics borrowed literally from Mario Bava an entire city destroyed and the usual amount of lovely babes in revealing gowns. Since no one expects any of these films to compete with The Seven Samurai  or even with The Magnificent Seven  it seems a bit picky to hold the film's borrowing from other films against it.".

If you've seen Mario Bava's Hercules in the Haunted World a much superior movie then you've seen some of the best this movie has to offer. The similarities go beyond the obvious  Reg Park a daunting quest ocean voyages. etc. The similarities extend to actual set pieces. For example in both films Hercules must traverse a rope over a boiling pit of lava. Another example in both films Hercules must do battle with flying zombie type creatures. In addition Lucidi copies some of Bava's style. The underground scenes in this movie are lit with the same colored gels used by Bava. The things taken from Hercules in the Haunted World were so obvious I half expected to see Christopher Lee waiting for Hercules at the end of his journey.According to IMDb this was the last time Reg Park would play Hercules. Other than Steve Reeves I think he was the best actorbody builder to play the role. But after taking one look at Park in Hercules the Avenger I'm glad he gave it up. He looks terrible. By 1965 he was no longer the chiseled specimen as featured on the DVD cover. Instead he looks more likely to be playing Bluto than Hercules.With everything I've written being so negative I'll finish by saying you could do far worse than Hercules the Avenger. The new Region 1 DVD with Hercules and the Black Pirate a bonus is probably as good as this movie ever looked.".

Director Maurizo Lucidi relates the engrossing story at a steady pace and maintains a serious tone throughout. This film begins a little slow but really starts cooking once Hercules enters the misty and perilous subterranean spirit world Rousing highlights include Hercules grappling with a humanoid lizard beast Hercules climbing a giant gnarled tree and Hercules being attacked by a bunch of creepy rotting zombies. Better still the bizarre spirit world just reeks of spooky atmosphere gotta love that persistent thick swirling fog!. The strenuous rough'n'tumble manoamano major physical confrontation between Hercules and Antaius likewise totally rocks. Of course we also get a big mondo destructo climactic volcanic eruption as well. Allvaro Mancori's crisp widescreen cinematography gives the movie an impressively expansive sense of scope. Ugo Filippini's robust rousing score has a nifty majestic sweep to it. Okay so this flick is an obvious cheapo cute'n'paste job that uses copious footage from both Hercules in the Haunted World and Hercules and the Captive Women but it's still an extremely lively and entertaining romp all the same.".

Using scenes from two earlier Hercules films and then creating a fantastic new story and an entirely new film one which is superior to the films it borrowed from. This is a dark entry in the series free of any suggestion of comic relief. Greek mythology comes alive as Gia the Sun Goddess desires revenge on Hercules for slaying the Hydra. Imprisoning Hercules in a delirious neon colored Hades she sends her own evil son Anteo to Earth to annihilate the family of Hercules as well as their Kingdom. Anteo is an incredible villain cruel and sociopathic and full of hatred for all mankind. As Hercules tries to rescue his son from the evil spell of Gia Anteo takes the throne of Hercules murdering men women and children without a thought. Why people have a problem with the way this movie was conceived is beyond me. All that matters is the end result. Hercules the Avenger takes the finest elements from Mario Bava's Haunted World and excises everything that dragged that lesser film down such as the silly characters the slapstick comedy and continuity errors. The end result is a colossal film filled with vast sets jawdropping special effects and a hypnotic struggle between Good and Evil. This film is supposedly an allegory to the rise of Fascism in Italy. Some of the set pieces are incredible like the destruction of the city as well as an impressive lion hunt that culminates in the onscreen slaying of at least one real lion. This practice of killing animals on screen is thankfully a thing of the past. But to see actual real lions in place of the ridiculous CGI that we are all used to is quite a surreal experience. And the volcano eruption that wipes out the city makes the similar destruction in the recent Pompeii look like a joke. Honestly this film is INSANE. I would love to watch this on a huge screen with surround sound. This is one film that deserves a Bluray restoration complete with the original Italian audio. To date it is my favorite Hercules movie. Highest recommendation.".

For all I know it was filmed either at Uncle Ron's or El Matador here in town!Road House is the story of a bouncer hired to clean up a rough bar in a tiny town. He isn't just your ordinary illiterate muscle head though. It's Patrick Swayze. He's got a degree in philosophy from NYU! He owns a Mercedes! Why he's the best damn cooler in the business! And it's a good thing he is. This fictional town of Jasper MO is dominated by a slimy BossHogg type played by Ben Gazzara. He and his thugs skim money from every business in town and the last thing they want is some stranger waltzing on to the scene to break up their control of the action. Enough plot though. Let's focus on the highlights.This film has a script that should be bronzed or put on display at the Smithsonian. We get monumental lines such asIt's good to see you! spoken by a blind man when he first greets Swayze.What do you take me for? a bimbo asks another bar patron in an early scene. the reply About a hundred dollars!And this film also contains the greatest line ever spoken in the history of cinema. Decorum prohibits me from stating it verbatim but you'll probably know it when you hear it. It's spoken by pro wrestler Terry Funk who plays the bouncer Swayze replaces. The line focuses on the supposed size of Swayze's package and the size vehicle his seed could fill.The film is filled with bar fights that eventually turn into shootouts hot women fast cars monster trucks explosions you name it. Anything for guys who like movies is in abundance. The whole thing plays out like a typical night on the town for us yokels here in the red states.The film comes in surprisingly long at 114 minutes but don't worry. This is the type of film you can basically stop at any place then push play when you and your friends get back from the bars. It will be like you never left as Christopher Lloyd tells Michael J. Fox at one point in Back to the Future. The film has more than its share of logical lapses. As Roger Ebert points out in his review there is no way anyone could get as rich as Wesley by skimming this little town. It seems to only have a bar an auto parts store a Ford dealership and a cafe or two. Most of these places get wiped out as the action unfolds. It makes you wonder who would have been left for Wesley to skim from. But criticism of a film like this is useless. When faced with such an artistic statement as Road House one can either sit back and enjoy or chuck the tape out the window. 10 of 10 stars.The genius of Joel Silver my know no boundaries.Added 9142009 We'll see you on the other side Patrick! God Bless you!".

	schema:headline " Patrick Swayze's best action movie he ever did my personal number 1 favorite";
	schema:reviewBody "Road House 1989 is my personal favorite number 1 film from Patrick Swayze. This film stands alone as Patrick Swayze's best work in my opinion. It is an action classic that I grew up with it I am a fan of Patrick Swayze and I can say it is his best action film! I love this film I grew up watching it as a kid. It is my third favorite Patrick Swayze movie and It is a action martial arts classic childhood! I love this film to death I love it so damn much and I love Steel Dawn and Black Dog to death the same as I love Road House. Road House will always be his best film he work with it. I can say Nomad Dalton and Jack Crews are Patrick's favorite characters of mine he ever played! My mom loved to watching him in her favorite miniseries North and South it was her favorite show that she talked about with me.Plot Dalton Patrick Swayze is the best bar bouncer in the business but he's anything but typical. He's a little small for his trade has a degree in philosophy and he believes in being nice. But when he's hired to clean up the Double Deuce in the small town of Jasper he's pushed to his breaking point. Discovering Jasper is controlled by an evil sadist Ben Gazzara who doesn't want anyone meddling with his town. After he sends his goons to bust up the Double Deuce all hell breaks loose. Now it's no more nice guy for Dalton as he starts busting heads leading him to the alltime noholdsbarred butt whooping showdown of the century.There is a lot of action in this film a lot of kickboxing and a lot's of fights in it. Patrick Swayze does a really good fight scenes I think Patrick Swayze does really good job with a fight scenes he does very solid job I mean really bottom in my heart I really miss Patrick Swayze I really do that he is no longer with us. Road House is my favorite film it has a lot of action and kickboxing fight scenes Patrick Swayze does a really good job playing a hero for an late 80's action flick it is pretty good and I love it. It is definitely my favorite Patrick Swayze film. Road House is a film that I will always cherish and I definitely don't agree with people who doesn't like this film.You have an epic martial art's fight between Dalton Swayze and Jimmy Marshall Teague watch the fight carefully Dalton uses eagle claws technique when kills Jimmy. The choreography is a mix of various martial art styles evident in the variety of locks throws kicks and punches as used in Kickboxing Hapkido and Jujitsu with a particularly impressive flying kick from Swayze himself. The grueling work put in by the actors is visible in their strained expressions adding that noholdsbarred street fight feel to a fight scene packed with some excellent technical maneuvers.I love the beautiful music score on the end of the film When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky by The Jeff Healey Band which is very beautiful song on the end of the credits. I love the final showdown between Dalton and Wesley on the end of the movie and the happy ending.This film is directed by Rowdy Herrington who made some pretty good movies that I like Gladiator and Striking Distance with Bruce Willis which is definitely my Bruce Willis's favorite action thriller film. The rest of the cast did also good job Sam Elliott also did a terrific support cast the same as actor Ben Gazzara as the villain who is sadly no longer with us anymore. Kelly Lynch was also good as Swayze's love interest. I am hearing that Nick Cassavetes is planning a remake about this film which it is unnecessary. There was a sequel about this film that I don't care for.R.I.P.  Patrick Swayze 1952  2009 I really miss you so much and I wish you could do more bad ass action movies I am your biggest fan and so was my mom we all miss you and we all love you I love you to death! Road House why doesn't THAT film get the cultappreciationnotice of this POS Uncommon Valor Steel Dawn underrated and Black Dog are my top 4 favorite Patrick Swayze movies he ever did! This movie get's 10 out 10 the best action martial arts movie ever made!".

In doing so Swayze ends up firing a handful of close friends to Ben Gazzara a criminal who runs the town. Of course this gets Swayze into a bunch of trouble as Gazzara is completely insane and not above murder arson or driving a monster truck through a car dealership when he doesn't get his way. Man this movie is overthetop. That is its charm. For a long time I think it moves too slowly but when it starts to gain momentum in the middle it moves like a freight train. A freight train without a conductor mind you but hey. Sam Elliott costars as Swayze's longtime partner if you ever wanted to see Sam Elliott's graying pubes this is the place to go. Kelly Lynch is mostly forgettable as Swayze's love interest. The other two women in the film Julie Michaels and Kathleen Wilhoite are more interesting and arguably for Wilhoite and inarguably for Michaels cuter.".

	schema:headline " Very underrated";
	schema:reviewBody "So what kind of film do you get when you have great one liners bar fights guns knives egos strippers blues music a polar bear and a monster truck? You get one of the most enjoyable and entertaining films of the late 80's Road House. The film follows James Dalton Patrick Swayze a cooler bouncer and the best in the business as he takes employment with Frank Tilghman Kevin Tighe the owner of the Double Deuce in Jasper Missouri. The bar is the roughest in town and he needs Dalton to clean it up. However corrupt business man and crime boss Brad Wesley Ben Gazzara stands in his way. After the classic chick flick Dirty Dancing Patrick Swayze was Hollywood gold. Women loved him and men wanted to be him. The film was full of romance. Then along came Road House a complete opposite to Dirty Dancing a little romance and loads of action. The film has a great cast including Patrick Swayze Kevin Tighe Ben Gazzara Kelly Lynch Marshall R. Teague Red West Kathleen Wilhoite John William Young John Doe Kurt James Stefka Keith David  Terry Funk. The cast works well together and it is full of great performances. Naturally Patrick Swayze at the height of his career stands miles apart from the rest of the cast as Dalton. A character that can hurt you with his words just as much as his fists. Tragically 20 years later Swayze had his life cut short by cancer. His death is still a major loss to the entertainment industry but his legacy will live on in the great performances and memorable characters he played. The film also a features a great performance by the late great blues guitarist Jeff Healey as Cody. It's the music in the film that goes a long way to achieving the right feel for the film. Everything works well from the characters the music to the setting. Set in a rural area the scenery is breathtaking and it is used to great effect. But it's the fight choreography that stands out from many other films. Great bar fights are pretty much a thing of the past but here they are full of action and humour just like the classic westerns. The one on one fights are brutal mainly for the realism they portray. The script is awesome and full of classic lines mainly from Dalton and although many are cheesy when he says it it feels right. The director surprisingly hasn't made many films but the ones I have seen of his I really like and I know I am in the minority. See my review of Gladiator 1992 for more by this director. This is truly a great film although very underrated. It is also one of my personal alltime favourites. There are a couple of versions of this so ensure that you see the USA or UK version released after 2002 as these are the uncut editions. So grab a few beers and a few friends but this on a big screen and turn the sound way up for a really great movie experience.10 out of 10".

Swayze is Dalton a guy who thinks pain doesn't hurt a guy who can rip your throat out with his bare hands a guy who can kick your ass and then take home Kelly Lynch and bang her the same night. Dalton is trying to clean up the Double Duce a rough bar where the patrons aren't very friendly. The dialog is brilliant! We get lines like I f guys like you in prison! The Double Douche? Come on chicken dick! You're too stupid to have a good time. God I love the way Don Knots makes love. The movie has tons of violence a bar fight every 15 min. or so. Boobs flop around alot too and for the women and Shawn Swayze shows his buns. Ben Gazzara as the bad guy chews his scenery like Adam with wings. It's a very fun film and if you don't take it too seriously you'll enjoy it. If you liked Sense and Sensibility you'll enjoy Road House!".

The movie has its own rules and an internal structure mostly explained by the character of Dalton Swayze a supervisor of bouncers termed a Cooler. When certain entertainment establishments become too lowbrow and rowdy on a nightly basis someone like Dalton is hired on to show all the patrons how to behave in a civilized manner. He has a degree in philosophy to help facilitate his instruction plus some martial arts disciplines. In this world of bouncers club owners and alcohol dispensers Dalton has a mighty rep  they've all heard of him tho many thought he'd be bigger.Also with an older rep is Wade Garrett Elliott an aged cooler who shows up halfway in to help his protg kick some teeth in. It's amusing to watch the bouncers when introduced to Wade  they react like actors introduced to the Marlon Brando of the bouncer industry. The main villain is a local rich bigshot Gazzara usually wearing a selfsatisfied evil grin and nice clothes hiding a repugnant nature which treasures power  more power above all else. Well actually he doesn't hide it much as the pic progresses. This is where such villains make a foolish error if he'd been just a little more laidback and content with all the power he already had things would've probably stayed the same for him. But he just can't resist having total absolute control over everything  everyone  a purebred fascist if ever there was  offending the zenlike sensibilities of the usually serene Dalton. Of course having a couple of Dalton's friends killed didn't help towards a peaceful resolution.The most entertaining portions of the pic are Dalton's methods in dealing with yahoo troublemakers these dangerous dudes are reduced to clownish oafs by Dalton's effective tactics  knowhow. There's also a dark version of Dalton Gazzara's main henchman a martial arts master who seems a match for Dalton's prowess. There are frequent splashes of female nudity including by Lynch as Dalton's new girlfriend and doctor Dalton isn't invulnerable  he needs a doctor about twice a week. You also seem to learn a lot about the art of being a bouncer though some of this may be baloney. In many ways this could be the perfect guy picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "When you have a film where the men display their toned biceps by rolling up their sleeves don a mullet hairstyle and the women wear micro skirts with big hair you know that this is the quite essential 80's movie. Top billing here is Patrick Swayze who was in big demand at this time by Hollywood was able to put to to good use his physical dexterity and dancing skills to to play a martial arts expert who is a head bouncer in this testosterone laden movie. There are a lot of good character actors in support some great dialog and plenty of brawls to keep your attention.It's mostly a guy movie but it has it's chick moments although their contribution is not really very memorablehowever more importantly it's a good verses evil movie! It's not a new concept there have been many similar themes over the years and the one that in many ways stands out was the 1950's western  Shane. It very much resembled this i.e. a new kid in town who stands up to the local heavy and mobilizes and encourages the terrified locals to aid him!Personally I never cared for bouncers I used to enjoy provoking them just to see how far I could get before they got violent also I witnessed a fight outside a club once where the bouncers themselves were badly beaten up by some thugs therefor this movie aroused my attention. Patrick Swayze plays Dalton who has a reputation in the night club scene as a top cooler. This position is somebody who over sees the bouncers and make sure that nobody gets out of line. Although he has a degree in philosophy Dalton uses his martial arts skills to work in the night club business and consequently gets headhunted by a club owner from a small town in Kentucky who persuades Dalton to help him clean up a night spot called the Double Duce. The only condition Dalton insists on is that he gets well remunerated he gets what he wants  no negotiation! and demands cart blanche i.e. what he says goes and he has the final word!After driving down he doesn't fly  it's too dangerous  how ironic! and after visiting the club he realizes that this place is a slaughterhouse that will only attract trouble makes and lowlives. He soon gets up to speed and marks the thugs and decides that some of the bouncers themselves who relish the violence are as much a part of the problem as anything else not at all unusual by the way. Dalton soon assets himself and starts to sort things out and get rid of the bad apples the the place starts to resemble a reasonable night spot.However what the owner doesn't tell Dalton is that the town itself is run by a local hood and entrepreneur Brad Wesley Ben Gazzara aided and abetted by his hired muscle. Not only does Wesley have relatives that have been fired by Dalton but he also has designs on the club it self. Wesley soon realizes that Dalton is not some Johnny come lately and nor will not be a push over because after a couple of encounters with Dalton and his newly trained bouncers his goons come off second best.When Dalton cannot be bought off or reasoned with into joining his organization he lets his top enforcer the intimidating Jimmy Marshall Teagueoff the leash to really crank up the pressure. Dalton realizes that he's going to need help and asks legendary cooler Wade Garret Sam Elliot to join him down at the Double Duce. What makes it even more complicated and really irks Wesley is that one of his former girlfriends who has not only rejected him but takes a fancy to Dalton so Wesley tries to get to him by using his morality and good conscience against him.By intimidating the locals by destroying their businesses he hopes to turn the locals against him or else force Dalton into leave town as to save their livelihoods. Dalton does not back down and up to this point it's just gratuitous violence and intimidation however after a show down between Jimmy and Dalton that results in a shocking conclusion all bets are off and killing and burning down buildings are now fair game.Never the less it's great entertainment enjoyable to watch although you shouldn't take it too seriously. Two things to point out there is not a cop to be seen in this movie until the very end also special mention has to go to one of Wesley's henchman the hapless O'Conner who was not only twice on the receiving end of a Dalton beating but also suffered the indignity of a public dressing down and got slapped about by Wesley. This was for not measuring up to what Wesley had come to expect from his men as well as the inability to endure pain! Never the less there he is at the end still working for Wesley the unemployment line would surly have been a better option at this stage! Well there you have it grab the pop corn sit back and enjoy Dalton and co take out the trash and send people to barbers college!!".

Every attempt at drama flounders though it never completely ruins what is going on.Although considered a box office failure when released in 1989 ROAD HOUSE quickly became a cult hit once it reached video. Finally giving in to the cult mania MGM's new DVD version of ROAD HOUSE contains two commentaries one from director Rowdy Herrington and one by filmmakers Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier who were called in to do the track after talking ROAD HOUSE on the tenthanniversary DVD of CLERKS. Both commentaries are fun to listen to. Herrington's commentary is for those who want to know more about the flick and the SmithMosier commentary is for those that want a nice laugh at the expense of this cinematic marvel.

It would just provide the audience more information about each characther which won't even matter. Anyway I still loved this movie and thought it was a classic. Go see It".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a preacher's kid is never easy. I was one and so was my wife. This movie portrays in dramatic ways the humanity and humour of being a preacher's family living essentially on hand outs and never quite having the perfect home for the kids. I can relate to Hartzel the eldest son. Like him I wished my Dad could have been anything else but a preacher. Like Hartzel I found out in many situations just how much Dad would go through for us. This movie is nostalgic in many ways. It hearkens back to a time when values like vision and sacrifice were highly esteemed and were going the extra mile was not an option but an expected way of life. Sometimes when I look back I rewind this video and watch it.It is a human story wrapped up in the faith of a man and his family who laid hold of a dream to make God real in every facet of life and to show people that God cares about all of us. It is a story of trial and adversity and perseverance and triumph. In the end it is not the glory and accolades of man that matter but of having lived a life well lived and full to brim. The cast of this film is perfect and very believable. Some of the characters I have known personally in different churches my father pastored. It is as if they are in every congregation. The issues of never owning a home or being able to decorate as you please or not having enough groceries and even the leaky roof over our heads all resonate. I have lived through them myself. These things really happened to the circuit preachers and those who went and started new churches. These things still happen. It is a good script and is not in conflict with the book. The book is well worth the read as well. I have both the movie and the book. It sits amongst my most prized possessions. You will find yourself laughing you will shake your head in disbelief you will get ticked off but in the end you will find yourself appreciating and loving this very human family that attempts to keep loving and keep living out what they believe to love God and to love your neighbour as yourself.This movie will reveal just how much and how full a life can be and how meaningful it is to serve others. Gayle Sayers the Hall of Fame running back of the Chicago Bears said God first others second myself third. This is exactly what this movie is about. Getting the priorities right and living life to the full.".

	schema:reviewBody "One Foot in Heaven is quite simply one of the most beautiful films that I have encountered. A mainstream film of this sort would NEVER even be considered today it seems even a bit tame for 1940.And yet the world was vastly different then and the gentleloving tone of this film reflects a sort of oldtime morality that seems hopelessly lost today.This was a major Warner Brothers release and with Hal Wallis as producer one expects and gets a very high quality film which lovingly recreates scenes from the life of an ordinary Methodist minister during the first 40 years of the 20th century. No earthshaking events herejust the daytoday trials and tribulations the simple joys and heartaches the smalltown politics and frustrations that reveal humanity in all of its imperfections.I am amazed that Frederic March is sometimes regarded as a dull actor he was the epitome of subtle honest realism and he carries the narrative of this film in an amazing way tender gracious humorous a bit stodgybut always willing to bend when necessary resourceful loving and above all very human.The movie is filled with an array of Hollywood's best character actors and the extremely detailed sets costumes etc really serve as a window to another time and place in our American past.Max Steiner's extremely pious score is almost a bit much at times but it nonetheless adds a reverent strength to the proceedings.And then there is the final scene one of the most moving and unique in any film that I know. Once again the ultimate destination of the plot is nothing earthshakingbut the concept and staging of the last scene is really remarkable. A simple oldtime street on a gorgeous spring day the townspeople who have come to know and love their minister all stopping their work and joining the procession through the street as they follow the sounds of the carillon from the new church. Martha Scott Frankie Thomas Gene Lockhart Beulah Bondi Harry Davenport Laura Hope Crewsmany of whom have locked horns with Mr. March during the course of the film now join together in the dappled sunlit street finally arriving at the church where they all lift their voices together in the moving hymn The Church's One Foundation... as we see Mr. March himself seated at the carillon struggling to continue playing it through the tears streaming down his face....I think Turner Classics has a print of this film I saw and taped it off of Chicago's PBS station some years ago. Try to see it like the world it represents this beautiful film may also disappear forever.".

	schema:reviewBody "For those who are cynical about the religious life here's a movie which ought to put some of that cynicism to rest. One Foot in Heaven is the true story of a Methodist preacher and his family and it rings true not just for the humanity Frederic March brings to his role as the preacher but for the situations and characters that many of us regardless of creed will easily relate to. My dad used to say A church is its people. I think One Foot in Heaven is a perfect illustration of this truth. Though this is a story about a preacher we aren't preached at. There's a wonderful scene with the preacher gently urging his agnostic doctor to start coming to church. He doesn't beat him over the head with a Bible but tries a more humanist approach.Someone else has compared One Foot in Heaven with It's a Wonderful Life. Another film to compare is Going My Way. In fact One Foot in Heaven and Going My Way were released just a year apart. There are story similarities like the building of new churches The Bishop's Wife is another example but it's interesting to see how religion in the community is seen respectively through Protestant and Catholic lenses. Then there's the final scene. In some ways it's corny but it still moves me. It hearkens to a time when religion wasn't sectarian but seamlessly interwoven in community life unselfconsciously and unostentatiously. It was before the battle lines between religionists and secularists were drawn when America had a civil religion. Alas a time past.".

	schema:reviewBody "One Foot in Heaven is based on the memoirs of journalist Hartzell Spence's growing up as a Methodist preacher's kid in midwest USA from the Theodore Roosevelt era to the Roaring Twenties. It's what they mean when they talk about a family values film. The Camden Family of Seventh Heaven could well have been modeled on the Spence Family of generations past.Young William Spence played by Fredric March has abandoned a career in medicine after being saved at a revival meeting and goes all the way and becomes a Methodist minister. Though taken aback by the career change fianc Martha Scott still marries him and the story follows them for the next 20 years or so moving from one parish to another. Scott and March are such a good fit as the preacher and wife you would think that March was doing this with his own wife Florence Eldridge.March strikes just the right note as the minister a just and pious man without being overbearing and sanctimonious. Would that preachers today were like him. He also demonstrates a capacity to learn. When his son goes to the silent cinema in defiance of Methodist preaching against the cinema March takes him in hand to show him the error of his ways. They go to a William S. Hart western and March to his amazement finds he likes it and the western tale carries a good moral positive moral lesson. He changes his own view on the subject.He also has to deal with a whole lot of modern day pharisees in dealing with the various politics of every parish he's assigned to. Chief among his tormentors are Beulah Bondi the richest woman in town who's actually offended by him treating her gardner Harry Davenport as an equal. And there's Gene Lockhart who has something of the same role here as in Going My Way. But he's not as nice in this film. When he loses control of the church choir which Lockhart regarded as his private preserve he and wife Laura Hope Crews mount a vicious smear campaign against March's son Frankie Thomas. His confrontation with Hope Crews and her gossip circle is a high point of the film.Like Seventh Heaven there are some good humorous moments as well. I like March trolling for some marriage business down at the town clerk's office looking for some wedding fees when times are a little lean. And the usual problems of dealing with parsonages which are not the most kept up buildings in the town. The title of the film comes from March's explanation that he and his family have to set an example if in fact his profession puts them one foot in heaven already. It's good entertainment and Fredric March and Martha Scott do set the best example we'll ever see.".

Coming with his young wife Mr. Spence was not prepared for what he would find in Laketon.

When he proposed a new church to replace the older one he meets the resistance of the elder moneyed classes. When they turn against him they use every tactic including slander to get him to his knees but fortunately he knew better. At the end he was successful in giving the town what he envisioned was his contribution to the community where he spent his life.Mr. March's performance is key that brings the action together.

	schema:headline " A touching look at a Methodist minister's life.";
	schema:reviewBody "William Spence abandons his ideas of becoming a doctor instead turning to a life as a Methodist minister. He takes he new bride Hope to a small Iowa town where he sets up his congregation and over the years he and Hope along with their daughter and two sons move from town to town going through many hardships and learning many ideas about the people they preach to. The film focuses mainly on the Spence's parish in Denver where Dr. Spence would like a better church for his parishioners as well as a better home for he and his family but are turned away by the affluent parishioners of the city when Dr. Spence tries to put his ideas into the church rather than keep the status quo that has always been in place. Dr. Spence then has to fight to get the church built and protect his family from the mudslinging going around town which leads to his eldest son Hartzell getting expelled from school. An excellent look at what may be perceived as a boring subject thanks primarily to the wonderful script by Casey Robinson based on Hartzell Spence's book. March and Scott are the perfect players for the William and Hope making you believe these are real people rather than actors. A wonderful ending only heightens the enjoyment of the movie but the treat for me was the good feeling that the film leaves you with. Rating 10.".

He takes he new bride Hope to a small Iowa town where he sets up his congregation and over the years he and Hope along with their daughter and two sons move from town to town going through many hardships and learning many ideas about the people they preach to. The film focuses mainly on the Spence's parish in Denver where Dr. Spence would like a better church for his parishioners as well as a better home for he and his family but are turned away by the affluent parishioners of the city when Dr. Spence tries to put his ideas into the church rather than keep the status quo that has always been in place. Dr. Spence then has to fight to get the church built and protect his family from the mudslinging going around town which leads to his eldest son Hartzell getting expelled from school. An excellent look at what may be perceived as a boring subject thanks primarily to the wonderful script by Casey Robinson based on Hartzell Spence's book. March and Scott are the perfect players for the William and Hope making you believe these are real people rather than actors. A wonderful ending only heightens the enjoyment of the movie but the treat for me was the good feeling that the film leaves you with. Rating 10.";

He was not a thundering hypocrite as Hollywood now paints any Protestant clergy in the movies and on TV.I saw it this morning on TCM and was greatly impressed by its sensitive portrayal of the pastor played by March. Except for the film about Peter Marshall I have never seen a finer rendering of a Christian family on film. I loved the musical score it had a great mix of some of the finest hymns of the Christian Church. I must agree with a previous comment the final scene of the town folk's response to Pastor Spence's playing of the bellswas great. It brought tears to my eyes.I hope you can tell I liked this movie!

	schema:reviewBody "Though this film sounds boring a preacher's life from the time he is called until he nears the end of life's journey it is actual an exciting fastpaced sometimes humorous account of the trials and tribulations of a minister and his family showing both the good and the bad. Obviously Hollywood's design in releasing this movie in 1941 was to serve as a morale booster as the flames of war began to encircle America. Often World War I was used as a standin for World War II to stir up the urge to fight the enemy and fan the fires of patriotism. Yet many of these films such as Yankee Doodle Dandy were exceptional. One Foot in Heaven is one such achievement.Based on the real life experiences of a Methodist minister in Iowa from the perspective of his son the movie highlights certain rites of passage from the disappointment of his future inlaws when they hear that their future soninlaw has suddenly decided to change from becoming a doctor to being a preacher in a jerkwater town to his final triumph of using his skills as an organizer and arm twister to have a modern church built to replace the old deteriorated one. There is much joy along with many heart rending decisions that keep the story moving. Director Irving Rapper wisely ignores sermonizing and actual preaching to concentrate on the personal life of the Spence family.My favorite part is when the minister takes his son to a movie to instruct him why he should not be slipping around to see picture shows. The man of the cloth is surprised when the silent flick William S. Hart in The Silent Man 1917 turns out to be a moralistic tale against evil so effective that the minister uses it as the subject of his sermon on Sunday. Watching this scene gives the modern film goer a once in a lifetime chance to have a vicarious experience attending an early cinema complete with piano player and a kid attempting to read the subtitles aloud.The acting is topnotch with most of the faces being familiar to movie buffs including a walkon by a young Gig Young. Kudos to makeup artist and innovator Perc Westmore for making Fredric March and Martha Scott appear to actually age from young adults to old adults as the story progresses.".

	schema:headline " A bit heavy with the schmaltz but still a truly unique and worthy film";
	schema:reviewBody "When I first starting watching this film I was a bit afraid that the film would be very heavyhanded or superficial since it was the story about a minister. Truth be told there are a lot of really bad and preachy religious films out theremostly because Hollywood never seemed to have much of a touch with this genre. Either they turned out overdone and emotionally sterile epics or the fare was just too heavyhanded and saccharine. Fortunately while ONE FOOT IN HEAVEN is a tad heavy with the schmaltz on occasion otherwise it's a very unique and noble filmnoble because it not only shows the minister as quite human but also because he was a decent and admirable guynot a cardboard saint. Plus the film talks about a big secret among many Protestant churchesthat they often pay the ministers way too little and the churches are sometime torn apart by pettiness. While this is directly attacked the message never seems to be an attack on the church itselfjust hypocrisy and the evil little wieners who cause dissension. So anyone afraid this film will step on their toes doesn't need to worry unless they too are petty hypocrite wieners.As for the technical merits of the film the acting is just fine the script very good and the film hums along quite nicely except for a few times when the music is a bit invasive. If you love very old fashioned hymns then you won't mind though.Overall a very good film and one that surprisingly has a lot to offernot just a feel good or hit 'em over the head with theology film!".

	onyx:emotionText "When I first starting watching this film I was a bit afraid that the film would be very heavyhanded or superficial since it was the story about a minister. Truth be told there are a lot of really bad and preachy religious films out theremostly because Hollywood never seemed to have much of a touch with this genre. Either they turned out overdone and emotionally sterile epics or the fare was just too heavyhanded and saccharine. Fortunately while ONE FOOT IN HEAVEN is a tad heavy with the schmaltz on occasion otherwise it's a very unique and noble filmnoble because it not only shows the minister as quite human but also because he was a decent and admirable guynot a cardboard saint.

Fredric MarchWilliam SpenceThe Iceman Cometh'73 was the preacher who did an outstanding job acting this role it is quite obvious that he put his heart and soul into the character.

Hope Morris did everything her husband wished and sometimes I think she bit her tongue having to think about a church in Iowa. Gene LockhartPreston ThurstonRed light'49 was a great character actor who had a daughter June Lockhart who played in the LassieTV Series. Preston Thurston played a very stuffy banker who objected to everything the preacher tried to accomplish. Harry DavenportEllias SamsonThe Farmer's Daughter'47 gave a great supporting role and offered the preacher a simply cup of tea which changed the story completely around.

Soumitra Chattopadhyay and Irfan Khan were brilliant as usual. And I was delighted to see somebody caring to maintain the accents. Irfan Khan Prashant Narayanan spoke Bengali with a nonbengali accent which perfectly fitted the characters. This kind of subtle detail is murdered in most movies these days. There were a few minor anachronisms like redand yellow minibuses which were introduced to calcutta much later than the time of the story it would have been better if they could arrange some doubledeckers. The story was really good a great relief from the HollywoodBollywood formula movies where there must be a 'happily ever after' ending. Yet it was the story that was the weakest part of this movie. While the start in jutemill childlabourer's camp was unusual it soon turned out to be a childhood love story. From Ravi buying freedom for Masha till his arriving at the temple was all formula stuff and I was scared that this movie will be another disappointment. But the plot returned from the edge of the cliff as Masha ran away from Ravi due to a misunderstanding. Rest of it reminds of Sharatchandra and O Henry yes I cannot consider this as original in any way only bits and pieces from here and there cemented with good imagination. Another point where I was a little worried was when Ravi meets Masha and their grand daughter at the factory. Why should somebody start talking of her 'long story' to another person right after introduction! I was ready to give her the license of senility but as it turned out it was justified by the beautiful finishing touch.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm sorry to say this movie is just ridiculous. I started out not expecting anything either way good or bad. When the movie started it looked very good namely the whole visual look and feel photography sets colours costumes etc. and the tone of realism in the denouements  as opposed to feelgood or happy outcomes at every available opportunity  seemed to promise a lot. That was until both kids grew up. Then the nonsense started.The simple test that this moviestory fails is If a boy and a girl were to start out in the time and place where this movie starts i.e. in preIndependence Bengal over the next 60 years how many of the eventspeople are likely to have evolved as portrayed in the movie? Having lived in India nearly all my life and seeing poor people all around and having read at least some of the history of India and being aware of the social realities and their evolution in different parts of the country I am compelled to say that this movie has got it horribly wrong. To illustrate 1 The 2 lead actors seem grossly miscast for the roles they play. For a child labourer who slaved at manual labour and for a girl who was initiated into prostitution before she was 10 years old and spent over a decade there both the actors come across as very very educated. Not only do they never get under the skin of those characters I felt that it was never expected of them that they were never meantexpected to do so. The boy goes on to speak flawless English simple but flawless and the girl metamorphoses into a polished middleclass housewife after spending 10 years in a brothel. And mind you all this is happening in the '60s in Bengal. 2 The single biggest departure from reality is the ease and the nature of the girl's departure from the brothel the Madam who handles her marries her off to an eligible bachelor telling her that he is a dream husband. It doesn't need much knowledge of how prostitution operates in India and in the world in general read newspapers esp. the crime reports and the occasional news analysis article  reports by NGOs  books by social workers  watch documentaries such as Born into brothels to know that this is next to impossible. Also while a prostitute may have choice she hardly gets to act like a diva and a paying customer wouldn't court her like he would a lady in his social circle. Once again do not we're talking about '60s Bengal.Some might rebut by saying that the focus is on the love story and how the female protagonist is hard done by all the other details are irrelevant. But if two individuals couldn't possibly have gone through those times and places to emerge as portrayed then everything rings hollow demanding a suspension of disbelief similar to what stereotypical Bollywood fare demands. Some might argue that the emotions and their dynamics are universal so time and place dont really matter. But if a Customs officer would never marry a prostitute and a brothel madam would not let her breadwinner leave then where is the room for the dynamics to play out?I have to agree with the reviewer who said that this movie has nothing to do with India. I'd go some distance further and say that this story was actually a perfect fit for a European or US social environment and was lazily transplanted to India. It could still have been acceptable were it set in postliberalisation India but to set THIS story in preIndependence India is simply moronic. And also what initially struck me as realism is in the end perhaps better described as thirdworld pathos hattip to comeau for his review. For a better portrayal of similar timeplace and the problems therein one is better off watching movies by Shyam Benegal and Govind Nihalani Ankur Nishant Manthan Ardh Satya Aakrosh etc.".

	schema:reviewBody "Calcutta before the independence a young boy Ravi helps a girl Masha to escape from a carpet factory and therefore it's pedophile owner but isn't able to flee himself. Years later he has earned enough money to ransom himself and finds work at a small carpet dealer in Calcutta. Masha who ended up in a brothel after her escape but has waited for Ravi all the years finds her hopes destroyed when she sees Ravi with the salesman's daughter believing she is his wife and marries a customs officer who proposed to her. Ravi unable to find Masha marries the salesman's daughter after her father dies. After some months Masha and Ravi meet because Ravi and Masha's husband do business together. Masha and Ravi begin carry on an affair but are parted again when Mashas husband moves to Kerala with her. Years later Ravi has two children now Masha's husband visits Ravi and tells him he left Masha because he found out that her child wasn't from him but from Ravi. Ravi and Masha meet again in the brothel whereto she returned after her husband has left her. Again eons later they meet where everything has begun Ravi visits the now abandoned carpet factory and finds the now blind Masha living there but he is unable or unwilling to tell her that he is Ravi.I as a German and a fan of Indian and Bollywoodcinema was really looking forward seeing this film made by a German director set in India. Sad thing to say that I was disappointed in almost every possible way. This was one of the very few movies which really made me aggressive. After thinking a lot about how that could happen I found out that it is because Ravi is living an unhappy life only because he is too coward to make one brave decision and be true to his love. He has the change more than five times in the movie and I really hated him for being so stupid. I felt he really didn't deserve to be happy with Masha if he lets her down all the time. I know that life isn't easy but I think concerning these essential questions a movie should give us at least a little hint how to manage life. And not just show how you to do it wrong all your life like this movie does. What disappointed me as well is that the film is placed in India but has nothing to do with it. I know love is an universal thing so true love stories would be the same worldwide but when a German goes to India to make a movie I think he should include some of the problems lovers have in that specific country. That is what I like about the movies of Mani Ratnam like DIL SE or BOMBAY which are beautiful love stories but also deal with the problems of his country like terrorism religious conflicts etc. SHADOWS OF TIME features none of these topics and therefore it could also be placed in 19th century Great Britain or America for example. Sad thing is that this fact makes the beautiful setting just decor.So this movie gets one point for the decor and a half for the score which is nice but one of the typical onemusicaltuneinathousandvariationssoundtracks but it also gets at least five hundred negative points for the worst story in months. I really would like to say something different but if you are planning in investigating in this movie buying a DVD or a ticket spend it on one of the real great Indian movies besides of the one's I mentioned above I recommend KAMA SUTRA  A TALE OF LOVE and FIRE.".

Its hopeless and grim. All the technical aspects compliment the mood of the film. The camera takes an objective view by being completely still and having actions happen even if on the boarder of the frame. The naturalistic sound with no music increases a kind of uneasiness in the viewer. Furthermore the long silences scenes with just a few words and gestures natural lighting sometimes under lit great spaces and scenery surrounding characters on screen work in a way to create a very unique world with a dense psychological complexity. We are simply viewing this world from the window director Keren Yadaya has given us.When this film ended I was left feeling that people are parts of whole systems working continuously but constantly wearing down as time goes on. Where everything is connected the newer and less worn parts work more efficiently for a short time taking the work load of those in its proximity. But in the end every part is eventually going to be overworked and will become faulty.Yet despite it's rather dark message this film and others like it mostly I'm thinking Requiem for a Dream are not meant to depress people or lead to thoughts of suicide in the dark existence we inhabit. Not at all. Instead I think films like this are meant to show people how bad things can get they objectively separate us as viewers from worlds where real people like the ones portrayed might exist and as viewers we are suppose to more consciously understand the complexity of life and the characters in it. So this being the case films like these are odes to life messages to insight in us living for goodness away from darkness which the films most immediate layers transmit.This film is not entertainment it is art at its highest form. I'm glad I have discovered thanks to a friend the work of Keren Yedaya. Its artists like this who constantly reform cinema as not just mindless entertainment but truly as a powerful medium for commenting and critiquing the world around us. For that an 8 out of 10.".

The film received impressive accolades at Cannes festival which may explain why France is a major market for this film. Or Dana Ivgy in a mesmerizing performance is a teenager that spends the better part of her days on taking care of her mother Ruthie Ronit Elkabetz in an equally gut wrenching performance. Ruthie is a recovering with varying levels of success drug addict and barely adequate to take care of herself let alone support a family. That task is entirely in Or's responsibility and her odd jobs interfere with her educational agenda which will turn out to be the least of her worries.What Or is deprived in parenting she compensates by casual flings with boys who more often than not exploit her good nature and a need to be loved for well you all know what men want.Surprisingly enough despite the harshness of Or's existence she is a jubilant girl with a very strong bond with her mother and even manages to conduct a border line FriendshipRomance with a pensive classmate Ido Nesher Cohen. Unfortunately read inevitably old demons from the past threaten to shatter the already fragile family and when dubious character's appear on Or and her mother's dilapidating apartment aided with the outright disapproval of Ido's family to his relationship with Or the harsh existence calls for cutting corners solutions with devastating effects which I can't reveal.This movie is a minimalist movie with no camera movements no voice over and no music of any kind. I believe it was meant to intensify the experience as opposed to refining it. If that was the objective of the director it was accomplished fully largely to its raw direction and impressive acting. An objective that was compromised or maybe unjustly lowprioritized was depicting a subtle portrait of Or. Subtlety is very rare commodity in this film. Extensive nudity graphic sex scenes and other scenes that don't leave anything for imagination turn the already hard to absorb feature into a film that is profoundly gut wrenching but emotionally too disturbing to be enjoyed. I should note in the name of objectivity that the extremely explicit nature of this film a disturbing trait many Israeli films still hone might not deter people with a less conservative standpoint than my own but even those of you who are less troubled by nudity sex and blunt content in general should expect a very difficult film to watch and for the privilege of a film pondered on long after the screening ends one must prepare to pay for with a very unnerving viewing.8 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most of the other comments here about this movie are correct but they dance around the central issue I think. But first . . .First the acting here is superb. I had to remind myself I wasn't watching a documentary.Second the cinematography is unusual and highly effective. It's a certain style that other directors have used some Japanese guy for example whose name escapes me. Someone here describes it as minimalist and maybe it is but it has the effect of putting you in the scene as a sort of innocent bystander. For example the camera does not always follow the action rather it is stationary and the characters pass back and forth. Sometimes they drift off screen or almost off screen right in the middle of a scene. In this particular case it works to great effect. It's as if you're sitting on the couch ignored slightly embarrassed taking it all in.OK now for the story. This is a story about sex women and men in its most elemental form. Sex for money or barter whatever. Sex for cheap thrills. But mostly this is about the way that men use women and IN PARTICULAR how Israeli men relate to women. That's the crux of it because this film was not shot in Argentina or Kenya or Thailand but in the socalled Holy Land. 50 years after the establishment of the state of Israel once referred to as the Moral Vacation Spot of the World we see a society which is blatantly exploitive of women. No moral compass here. We get the landlord who cops a feel for the rent. A soldier on leave from the West Bank who demands a blow job. Drunks in the street humping an aging whore. An ex husband who couldn't care less that his former wife walks the streets. This is gritty stuff to see in the land of Jesus  Co.So not a fun movie  leaves you feeling like you just took a nap on the floor of a Greyhound terminal  but if you're up for well done realism this is for you.P.S. Lots of nudity and sex but don't expect to get turned on it's more like watching an xxx flick from inside the porn star's head.P.P.S. Written much later If you're up for another interesting look at Israeli sexuality there's a documentary called I think The First Zionist Bunny. It's about how Playboy selected a host for their cable channel in Israel. Very interesting flick.".

Although the subject is interesting and the story has logic and emotion there are two principal flaws in the production. One is the too obvious and programmatic approach which kind of pushes the viewer to the director's views rather than letting him develop his or her own feelings abut the story and the situations. The second is the length there are too many dead moments where it looks like there is nothing to be said takes where 15 seconds would be enough but the director is spending 50.

	schema:headline " True art form powerful confident socially important and brutally honest";
	schema:reviewBody "Or is probably one of my top tree favourite films ever made. When I first saw it in a theatre in Tel Aviv I was blown away by its' sheer honesty and humanity. The last scene of Or sitting on the bed knowing that her life won't ever be the same again fully aware of her consequences yet still forcing her self to block a part of her soul for the sake of her mom stayed in my head for more than a month later after viewing it for the first time.I think the most appealing thing for me about this film is how personal it is. There's nothing from the outside world that taints its' creativity and its' political personal social and artistic intentions. This is art in its purest form made to touch change and to give life to the viewer.Aside from the engaging brutally honest and socially important story the film shines with intelligence. Be it through the perfectly thought out script which shows each scene with tenderness slowly and poetically moving through locations and faces not over feeding us with information relying on the viewers emotional intelligence and understanding to have their own interpretation on the characters' arcs turning point and internal journey.Be it through the absolutely beautiful cinematography. The shots colours and angles bring so much more to the story than just visualizing it. The cinematography in Or goes hand in hand with the characters internal journey. The shots are very emotionally expressive and each angle in each scene was planned out carefully to make us feel like we are a part of their world. A lot of the shots were made in one take and seem much documented. We follow our characters in their most vulnerable spots yet never feel the need to judge them we are right there with them compassionately understanding every desperate step they take.The acting job of the two is highly humane and charismatic the lead actresses gave one of the most realistic and emotionally involved acting job I've ever seen on screen. The actresses literally give their soul to the part so much that in parts we tend to forget this is an actual feature film and not a documentary on prostitution. The actresses' physical and emotional involvement with their characters' story is what gives more spark to the sincerity of the film we can sense the confidence and trust between everyone who made this this is what touches me the most.And finally through the message. Political and social involvement plays a very big role in the director Keren Yedaya's life. She is a feminist who fights for human rights and against the Palestinian occupation in Israel. There's nothing pretty or sugar coated about this film something that is very authentic to the Israeli society. The films' message presented in a very raw and not formatted way simplicity plays a big role here. Keren's art comes from her political and personal ideals something that I highly respect in any art form and we can sense through the film that she had her reasons for making it she has her reasons for the ugliness of it.For Israel specifically this film is highly important. For the world in general this film is also very eye opening. Here the story is about something that is important both to Israel and the world the terrible world of prostitution a form of slavery that society chooses to suppress.I hope this film did cause some sort of change in people's minds. It sure shook me for the better and the people around me that have seen it. I think it's a highly inspiring intelligent emotionally aware artistic honest and non judgmental film that I would suggest anyone that is interested in any form art politics culture etc to get a hold of this film. For me it definitely stands up there with the best creations ever made and I can't wait to watch Keren Yedaya's next film.Zoey".

The last scene of Or sitting on the bed knowing that her life won't ever be the same again fully aware of her consequences yet still forcing her self to block a part of her soul for the sake of her mom stayed in my head for more than a month later after viewing it for the first time.I think the most appealing thing for me about this film is how personal it is. There's nothing from the outside world that taints its' creativity and its' political personal social and artistic intentions. This is art in its purest form made to touch change and to give life to the viewer.Aside from the engaging brutally honest and socially important story the film shines with intelligence. Be it through the perfectly thought out script which shows each scene with tenderness slowly and poetically moving through locations and faces not over feeding us with information relying on the viewers emotional intelligence and understanding to have their own interpretation on the characters' arcs turning point and internal journey.Be it through the absolutely beautiful cinematography. The shots colours and angles bring so much more to the story than just visualizing it. The cinematography in Or goes hand in hand with the characters internal journey. The shots are very emotionally expressive and each angle in each scene was planned out carefully to make us feel like we are a part of their world. A lot of the shots were made in one take and seem much documented. We follow our characters in their most vulnerable spots yet never feel the need to judge them we are right there with them compassionately understanding every desperate step they take.The acting job of the two is highly humane and charismatic the lead actresses gave one of the most realistic and emotionally involved acting job I've ever seen on screen. The actresses literally give their soul to the part so much that in parts we tend to forget this is an actual feature film and not a documentary on prostitution. The actresses' physical and emotional involvement with their characters' story is what gives more spark to the sincerity of the film we can sense the confidence and trust between everyone who made this this is what touches me the most.And finally through the message. Political and social involvement plays a very big role in the director Keren Yedaya's life. She is a feminist who fights for human rights and against the Palestinian occupation in Israel. There's nothing pretty or sugar coated about this film something that is very authentic to the Israeli society. The films' message presented in a very raw and not formatted way simplicity plays a big role here. Keren's art comes from her political and personal ideals something that I highly respect in any art form and we can sense through the film that she had her reasons for making it she has her reasons for the ugliness of it.For Israel specifically this film is highly important. For the world in general this film is also very eye opening. Here the story is about something that is important both to Israel and the world the terrible world of prostitution a form of slavery that society chooses to suppress.I hope this film did cause some sort of change in people's minds. It sure shook me for the better and the people around me that have seen it. I think it's a highly inspiring intelligent emotionally aware artistic honest and non judgmental film that I would suggest anyone that is interested in any form art politics culture etc to get a hold of this film. For me it definitely stands up there with the best creations ever made and I can't wait to watch Keren Yedaya's next film.Zoey";

	schema:reviewBody "Cecil B. DeMille's fame as a leading movie director is still secure because of his innovative nature. He certainly developed spectacle movies and even today he is remembered as the pioneer. But that does not blind us to his flaws. His characters are not three dimensional usually but black or white in personality. His dialog is for the birds. He does fall into stereotypes too often. It is understandable that the Medveds included Northwest Mounted Police among the 50 worst movies ever made. Yet one can't easily dismiss it. It was DeMille's first color movie. It was the second of four films with Gary Cooper one of four made Goddard and one of three made with Robert Preston. Preston made good action films in this period but was always in support. In the early 1950s he returned to the stage and the fame that eluded him in Hollywood. Came The Music Man The Lion In Winter and Mack and Mabel and the recognition of Preston the adept entertainer. Came the call back to Hollywood for his filmed performances as Harold Hill and Toddy in VictorVictoria. Preston was that rarity an actor who proved his star qualities in middleage. DeMille would never have been his kind of director he had no light touch for comedy and he did not do musicals. Still for some good straight performances as doomed weaklings Preston did well in this filmUnion Pacific and Reap the Wild Wind.The film's historic content is interesting. DeMille's earlier historic films Cleopatra Sign of the Cross The Crusades dealt with old world history. But after the last DeMille concentrated on American history with The Plainsman The Buccaneer Union Pacific Reap The Wild Wind and The Unconquered. Even the modern The Story of Dr. Wassell was based on a true tale connected with the current war in the Pacific. Because of his American History period Northwest Mounted Police is an odd film. Cooper's character is the only link in it to American history in the 1880s as a Texas Ranger after George Bancroft Le Corbeau for murder. The film is set firmly in Canada which was the scene of two revolts of the Metis people under Louis Riel in 1870 and 1885. As such this becomes somewhat unique among the historic films of Hollywood.Canada does poorly regarding it's history in Hollywood. This movie actually covers one of the most troubling moments of modern Canadian history the fate of Louis Riel. We don't know about it down here. Riel was a lawyer and teacher with some mental problems. Riel helped found the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan thus making him one of Canadian history's founding fathers. But he was also aware that French Canadians and his Metis people got a suspiciously short deal from the British Canadians in Canada. Canada was firmly controlled by the Tory party led by Sir John MacDonald. MacDonald was corrupt but made one of the great comebacks in political history in 1879. Riel had led a revolt in 1870 which was crushed. He fled to the U.S. and spent some time in asylums here. He was released taught school in Montana and then returned to Canada illegally in 1884. He organized a second Metis revolt which nearly succeeded in winning an independent state. A British army crushed it in 1885 captured Riel and he was tried for treason.Lives had been lost and property destroyed. MacDonald's son had been sent to Manitoba to run the province and he had been humiliated by the revolt. Riel however had some legitimate gripes about the treatment of French Canadians and the Metis. The treason trial came and he was found guilty. MacDonald apparently never had a moment's hesitation about what to do. He refused to stop Riel's execution. The Tory Party in Canada has never recovered from this mistake. The backbone of Liberal Party strength to the current day is French Canadien Quebec  they have never forgiven the Tories for not acting humanely to Louis and putting him in a Canadian asylum for life.DeMille is not totally antiRiel. Riel is not unlike the American John Brown inthe contemporary film Santa Fe Trail who is murderous and possibly insane but fighting for certain principles that actually get the audience's sympathy. In this film Riel is committed to a Metis revolt and state and he will stop at nothing to prevent it's success. But he also is shown as a kindly man to young children he was a school teacher remember.He is trying to save a way of life that a juggernaut threatens. And he is resigned to his fate at the end realizing that in dying he may still win which happened. We need a subsidiary villain like Van Heflin in Sante Fe Trail who is villainous for money. Here it is Bancroft a murderer and criminal who is Riel's assistant. His villainy is passed down through his genes to his daughter Goddard who tempts and betrays Preston. One wonders had Riel formed a successful government and state how long before Le Corbeau would have arranged an accident or assassination by a Tory agent of course of Riel in order to cement his control over the Metis nation. So when he gets his just deserts at the end unlike poor Louis we are cheered by it. One has to congratulate DeMille in trying to be fair to Louis when he could have just made his a super villain.".

	schema:reviewBody "You first have to understand that DeMille has taken considerable poetic licence while using the story of the return of Louis Riel to Canada and the subsequent Duck Lake massacre of a large unit of Mounties. Even the pronunciation by DeMille of the word Metis at the introduction to the movie is quite incorrect.Fun to watch the fictional introduction of Gary Cooper as a Texas marshal travelling into Canada in pursuit of a Metis criminal.Some good aspects of the film include the historical accuracy of the uniforms at that time... no wide brimmed hats... and the correctness of the name of the Mounties at that time. The only item of historical inaccuracy is the fur hats that DeMille has the Mounties wear. During the warmer weather they wore either a pill box hat or a white helmet. They did wear fur hats during the winter with their Buffalo hide coats but DeMille did not like the design of any of the head wear that was part of the actual uniform so he had this design made for the picture.The two key bad guys are historical fact although whether they acted as they are shown in the movie is another question. Whether there was a gatling gun at the Duck Lake massacre is another question the historians will have to answer.Generally a good romp... a great movie to sit back and watch with popcorn and a soft drink.".

	onyx:emotionText "You first have to understand that DeMille has taken considerable poetic licence while using the story of the return of Louis Riel to Canada and the subsequent Duck Lake massacre of a large unit of Mounties. Even the pronunciation by DeMille of the word Metis at the introduction to the movie is quite incorrect.Fun to watch the fictional introduction of Gary Cooper as a Texas marshal travelling into Canada in pursuit of a Metis criminal.Some good aspects of the film include the historical accuracy of the uniforms at that time... no wide brimmed hats... and the correctness of the name of the Mounties at that time. The only item of historical inaccuracy is the fur hats that DeMille has the Mounties wear. During the warmer weather they wore either a pill box hat or a white helmet. They did wear fur hats during the winter with their Buffalo hide coats but DeMille did not like the design of any of the head wear that was part of the actual uniform so he had this design made for the picture.The two key bad guys are historical fact although whether they acted as they are shown in the movie is another question. Whether there was a gatling gun at the Duck Lake massacre is another question the historians will have to answer.Generally a good romp... a great movie to sit back and watch with popcorn and a soft drink.";

This time it concerns the Royal Canadian Mounties Red Coats a Texas Ranger in search of a criminal dealing with the Indians in frontier Canada during the eighteeneighties by selling them guns and the halfbreeds that are being controlled by the Mounties.Along the way the Texas RangerGary Cooperfalls for a pretty Army nurse Madelaine Carroll who is also courted by a Mountie Officer Preston Foster.  The nurse's brother also a Mountie Robert Preston is under the spell of a beautiful halfbreed Paulette Goddard who's father is the criminal George Bancroft that is being sought.As in DeMille plots the hero saves the day but not without a sacrifice of some of the supporting players.  Won't tell you who.  See the picture.Coop and Carroll do a wonderful job taking some pretty silly lines even for the forties and making them work.  Both look  their best at the peaks of their careers.   Preston and Foster Robert and Preston that is do admirable jobs.  Robert Preston looking very young with a full head of blonde curly hair.  Playing the tempestuous halfbreed Paulette Goddard got a big break in her career with this role.  It is said she wanted the part so bad she donned herself in dark skin makeup put on an Indian getup with feathers and walked into DeMille's office saying You teenk you wan beeg director hah?  Me Louvette show you!   She got the part and played it to the hilt with her dark skin and beautiful blue eyes beating out Marlene Dietrich and Rita Hayworth also up for the role.  Goddard went on to play in two more DeMille pictures REAP THE WILD WIND and UNCONQUERED this time performing leading roles.There is an excellent supporting cast of character actors namely Lynne Overman Akim Tamiroff Walter Hampden Lon Chaney Jr Robert Ryan and Rod Cameron who went on to star in Republic Pictures westerns.POLICE is not yet on video although most other DeMille films are but it can be seen once in a while on AMC Classic Movies on TV.Great DeMille entertainment.".

DeMille started filming Northwest Mounted Police Joel McCrea was Texas Ranger Dusty Rivers a cowboy name if there ever was one but after a few scenes McCrea dropped out and Gary Cooper got to do his second of four DeMille features.It was both DeMille and Cooper's first film in technicolor and when DeMille went in for technicolor we mean bright hues of every part of the rainbow. But back then color itself was a novelty so people liked seeing it. Northwest Mounted Police also won an Oscar for best editing. Taking home the prize was Anne Bauchens who edited every single DeMille film from back into the middle silent era. DeMille had it written into his contract at Paramount that he would not do a film unless Ms. Bauchens was available to be editor. He had many of the same folks on his various films but only Ms. Bauchens rated that kind of treatment.Michael Medved has Northwest Mounted Police listed among the fifty worst films of all time. It's not great but it ain't as bad as all that. The Victorian DeMille type dialog is the main reason but it is no more present here than in any of his other sound films.Northwest Mounted Police takes place in the mid 1880s and concerns the famous 2nd Louis Riel Rebellion and the Duck Lake massacre of Royal Canadian Mounted Police in that conflict. Grafted on to that is the story of a Texas Ranger played by Gary Cooper who comes up to Canada with a warrant for one of Riel's confederates who killed a man in his state. Of course Cooper gets himself mixed up in the politics of the area and also considerably mixed up with Maddeleine Carroll much to the displeasure of her sweetheart Preston Foster as stalwart a Mountie as you'll ever find this side of Nelson Eddy. That's a standard DeMille plot device two men in heat over the heroine.In some considerable heat himself is Robert Preston who is Carroll's brother also a Mountie. He's got it bad for Paulette Goddard a Meti who's got it real bad for Preston. In fact her little scheme concerning Preston is what drives the action of the film in the second half.DeMille was never an actor's director or a writer's director. But he knew how to fill the screen and keep the action going. That he does in Northwest Mounted Police.".

There is a great deal to enjoy if one puts aside ones modern sophistication.  I particularly enjoyed the way the mounties were portrayed as a dedicated and disciplined police force loyal to the Crown and doing a worthwhile job in very difficult circumstances.  Gary Cooper's Texas Ranger helped to highlight the qualities of the Mounties and provided interest and excitement.Crowd scenes and action scenes are well done.  The stunt towards the end involving Gary Cooper's character tumbling from his falling horse is breathtaking and the quick cut to a back projection immediately after is very effective it is a scene that can match anything in today's films. Characters have interesting scenes and the humour is dealt with a sure touch.  The film has all the signs of a good director.I didn't expect to enjoy this film but I did and I look forward to finding more from the same period.".

Masterfully he arrays them in a position of caring about the wild young beautiful couple and their beauty is cinematic greatness perfectly filmed and choreographed. Paulette Goddard from her very entrance is breath taking and her beauty is perfectly enveloped with de Mille's cameras. Incredible astounding and unsurpassed to this day.The spectacle of de Mille has never been surpassed and neither has his directing of characters. As in UNION PACIFIC it is the minor characters such as Overman and Tamiroff who take this up to the top notch. The comic relief here is one that we also see leading up to a Shakespearean style duel.The characters and the story keep you riveted.

	schema:headline " The lengths I'll go to in order to feed my addiction or bad films....";
	schema:reviewBody "North West Mounted Police is the 48th film that I have watched that was featured in Harry Medved's brilliant book The Fifty Worst Movies of All Timeand I just recently bought the last two so I soon will have reviews for all of them. While I must admit that his list of 50 is flawed a small number actually are not that bad considering he wrote this book when he was 17 and it came out BEFORE he age of VCRs it is amazingand an exceptionally good readone of the best nonfiction books I have ever read. While it's out of print you can get used copies reasonably priced on the internet any bad movie buff worth their salt MUST have a copy.So is this movie THAT bad? No...but it is bad and I think the respectable score of 6.5 and the generally positive reviews are a bit inexplicable. It seems that in general Cecil B. De Mille's films are thought of rather highly. After all they often have HUGE scope sets lovely Technicolor when most films of the day are black  white and it's obvious his budgets were astronomical. However I also think that a movie really doesn't need any of these things to be a good film. What is most important is what De Mille's films usually lackedgood dialog realistic characters and good acting. It seems to me that this director really had no knack for human interactions on film unless they were BIGGER than life! And that is why I cannot recommend the film. Sure it gets a few points for the sets and lovely look of the film but the rest....yuck! If I had to put my finger on what is worst about this particular film I'd bluntly say Paulette Goddard. While several others chew the scenery a bit such as Akim Tamiroff she is absolutely laughably bad as 'the fiery halfbreed'!!! While she was SUPPOSED to be part European and part NativeAmerican she sounded like some 4 yearold trying to imitate Chico Marx or Charro....on drugs! Her accent was ludicrous and her acting hammy and awful. Now some blame can clearly be placed on Goddard who probably can attribute most of her roles to the fact she was married to Charlie Chaplin but isn't it the director's job to notice this and coach the actor if they are missing the role this completely?! And the writing they gave her and the others to a lesser extent was just dumb and almost comic booklike not a GOOD comic book but a bad one by the way.It's also odd how with a magnetic personality like Gary Cooper that he's practically lost in the film. Yes he's there but he has no charisma and little chance to act. He's frankly too good for this materialas are Robert Preston and Preston Foster. Again I blame De Mille for this.The bottom line is that although Harry Medved was mistaken in my opinion for including the film I could see exactly why he did and don't think his selection was that far offbase. And I know this will ruffle a few feathers but I also don't think this is De Mille's worst film. For dialog alone his 1950s version of The Ten Commandments is godawful and could lead many to convert to atheismeven though it's considered a classic and has a HUGE budget as well. I can hear Anne Baxter from this film now uttering the hilariously overdone line ...oooh Moses.....Moooooses!!!!! like a cow in heat or Edward G. Robinson bellowing ...he took us into the desert to die like dogs!!!! for the 48th time in the film! Why is De Mille so adored? His dialog acting and stories are often terribleand VERY sacrilegious. Try watching Sign of the Cross and then try to convince me I am wrong about the sacrilegious comment as it included scenes of bestiality lesbianism and the like in a Biblical epic! Or how about the Claudette Colbert version of Cleopatra where you get to see Ms. Colbert's breastsnot exactly stuff to show your Sunday school class and yes I know Cleopatra is not a Biblical epic.Watch at your own risk....Oh and De Mille DID do a few very good films...and many bad ones.".

The chief villain is Jacques Corbeau George Bancroft whose wildcat half breed daughter Paulette Goddard is in love with Mountie Ronnie Logan Robert Preston. Gary Cooper toplines as the Texas Ranger sent north to bring Corbeau to justice sparring with dedicated Sergeant Jim Brett Preston Foster over the lovely April Logan Madeleine Carroll sister of Ronnie. This makes it sound like a real snoozefest and while it's not quite that bad it certainly isn't very captivating. Supporting players like George E.

	schema:reviewBody "You don't expect subtlety or underacting in a movie made by Cecil B. DeMille and you don't get it here. There are several stories blended together around the idea of Cooper a Texas Ranger come to the Canadian north woods to capture a miscreant murderer the half breed Corbeau.This Corbeau is a nasty guy. He and the other half breeds are trying to stir up the Blackfeet and the Cree against the Royal Canadian Mounted Police intending to declare independence and kill everybody who doesn't like their new country. Cooper is swept up in the intrigues. Robert Preston is a Mountie who falls for the devoted but treacherous half breed woman Louvette played by Paulette Goddard in the goanywhere accent she used when she played foreign spitfires. She was such an attractive and sexy young woman it's a shame she didn't get better parts.There is a dull romantic triangle involving Sergeant Preston Foster and another woman he worships Madeleine Carroll and there are several shoot outs between half breeds and the RCMP. The half breeds have got their hands on a Gatling gun which gives them a kind of edge. I didn't like the fact that there were two actors in supporting roles whose names I always mix up  Robert Preston and Preston Foster. But I was on the side of the Northwest Mounted Police at every moment. One scene  an aborted patrol  shows us some skilled extras in formation that make John Ford's cavalrymen look like amateurs.

There's no real mistaking the evil doers because they're all ugly or comic or both. The Francis Ford role is taken by Lynne Overman as Todd McDuff a supposed Scotsman who lays it on a little thick. But he's one of the more likable sidekicks in the genre so let McDuff lay on.It IS colorful especially considering that that is no outdoor scene in it. It's all shot on a sound stage. Still you have never seen so many crimson tunics. I think by this time they had stopped using dried scaled insects to produce the color.".

There are several stories blended together around the idea of Cooper a Texas Ranger come to the Canadian north woods to capture a miscreant murderer the half breed Corbeau.This Corbeau is a nasty guy. He and the other half breeds are trying to stir up the Blackfeet and the Cree against the Royal Canadian Mounted Police intending to declare independence and kill everybody who doesn't like their new country. Cooper is swept up in the intrigues. Robert Preston is a Mountie who falls for the devoted but treacherous half breed woman Louvette played by Paulette Goddard in the goanywhere accent she used when she played foreign spitfires. She was such an attractive and sexy young woman it's a shame she didn't get better parts.There is a dull romantic triangle involving Sergeant Preston Foster and another woman he worships Madeleine Carroll and there are several shoot outs between half breeds and the RCMP. The half breeds have got their hands on a Gatling gun which gives them a kind of edge. I didn't like the fact that there were two actors in supporting roles whose names I always mix up  Robert Preston and Preston Foster. But I was on the side of the Northwest Mounted Police at every moment. One scene  an aborted patrol  shows us some skilled extras in formation that make John Ford's cavalrymen look like amateurs.

They let him come west in 1913 and make the first film in Hollywood The Squaw Man. De Mille was pretty much incompetent but his films were nevertheless often successful. The Westerner is arguably one of the funniest westerns ever made. Coop and Brennan were superb because the film was set up for them. De Mille tried to cut Northwest Mounted's script for Cooper but Coop's lines didn't always fit in the square peg mounted police spectacle. That left Coop squirming to get the right grimace wince or gulp when the script just couldn't make room for it. The movie was close to good but not quite. I just saw it on a downloaded DVD.

	schema:reviewBody "The magic the heart of Say Anything is that it dares to be normal. You remember the 80 teen romantic comedy genre. It was a nice idea that became an epidemic but once and awhile there was a gem like Some Kind of Wonderful. But here is the major difference the lack of cliche the lack of formula the lack of cute dialogue and saying things without any words. Instead it is said with a look a touch a smile and a tear falling down a face. It allows these talented young actors to act!John Cusack plays Lloyd and it is the fact that Lloyd dares to be normal that explains why the film works. Lloyd is just a regular guy who dares to just call the beautiful class brain Diane Ione Skye after they graduate. It is the genuine niceness and persistence of Lloyd's phone call that is responsible for her caving and saying yes. And it goes from there. What is a friendship a respect for each other grows into friends with potential and then goes even farther. Writerdirector Cameron Crowe is famous for not pushing it and he perfected that style here. He doesn't try to make John and Ione look and feel hot he lets them continue to play young adults who would by all rights still be awkward nervous testing the waters of life love and trust.In a brilliant parallel we learn of Diane's relationship with her father Jim John Mahoney which she has always been sure of even when she needed to chose between her parents after their divorce. The subtle and detailed scenes between Diane and Jim are important to the twists in the story when Diane grows to trust someone other than her father and finds deceit with something she had faith in. Jim is not your typical teen movie father. He's real and normal as well. His car is not backed into a house he is not thrown into a great body of water and he is not a typical ogre. He is allowed to be a three dimensional character a driving force and an obstacle in the teen romance. Jim runs a nursing home and wants the best for Diane. He holds their relationship very dear as it is all a part of Diane being the best she can be. That desire will end up being a double edged sword as Diane's growing preoccupation with Lloyd the summer before she is set to go to England threatens his plans for her. And although Jim seems to respect how Lloyd treats his daughter and him he is bothered by Lloyd's lack of drive that the only thing that drives Lloyd is the then almost unheard of sport of kickboxing and Diane.When the story comes to important moments that changes Jim Diane and Lloyd's world this is when the story shines. This is when Lloyd's rambling and desperation to redefine his life due to his despair is a welcome change from the overbearing or over brooding of most teen flick heroes. This is when Diane's confusion and discovery is so wonderfully done with little dialogue. This is when Jim feeling his world is spiraling out of his control grows quiet and the power of unshowy direction from Crowe says all we need to see.The supporting characters as well are gems who are true supporting characters. Joan Cusack appeared uncredited as Lloyd's single mother sister who once a blast is now uptight but is still a supportive guardian for Lloyd. Lloyd's girl friends D.C. and Corey are like salt and pepper for Lloyd. Corey played by Lili Taylor is terminally depressed. She previously had attempted suicide due to fellow classmate Joe playing with her heart like a yoyo and is always being the voice of negativity for Lloyd always telling him what will go wrong what can't happen what should happen and how he is different from Joe. D.C. is practically dwarfed by Corey never being allowed to talk and never being able to steer Lloyd in a much more sane direction which Lloyd usually discovers on his own anyhow. All of the supporting characters of friends former classmates and residents at Jim's nursing home are important none are cardboard cutout cliches. They all have dimension depth feeling and we can understand their motivation what drives them with carefully crafted scenes and dialogue.When the ending comes it is the subtle way they foreshadow the future instead of the standard frantic pacing most romantic comedies have when it comes to a conclusion. That in itself pretty much sums up the beauty of the film.It is pure genius this film is pure genius.".

I'm so used to seeing the man take the assertive and mature role while courting a woman of limited financial or intellectual means...but in this film it's the girl that's got her future together and the guy who's more than willing to concentrate his attention on making her happy.  And Lloyd Dobler isn't just a shiftless man with no future.  He's an eternal optimist who lives in the present and recognizes admires and compliments the qualities in Diane that go beyond her amazing intellect.  She becomes his daretobegreat situation and his absolute love and devotion to her is anything but unmanly.  The force of it is palatable and immensely erotic without being reduced to cheap teenage lust.  The sight of Lloyd in the shadows defiantly blasting out the truth of their love through the boombox is a scene which would have seemed awkward and goofy in any other movie but this one.  It's easy to understand why even the critics of the time gave Say Anything two enthusiastic thumbs up.  This is one of the few films that really captures the feeling of love.".

Lloyd Dobler is the wellliked underachiever with good character. Lloyd's lowpressure friends accept Diane at a party and she at last gets to let her hair down. This launches a romance that Diane's father disdains.Always quick to shower her with praise encouragements and gifts Diane's father has visions of her earthshattering success. On her part Diane is getting a little selfconscious over her father's incessant chatter about what HE wants her to be.Lloyd's attentions to Diane grow inconvenient to her father perhaps less for his romantic interest but worse he's diverting her from her greatness. Simultaneously Lloyd has no outward indicators of achievement. He lacks direction and can't really say what his next moves are. Diane's father's agitation grows when investigators from the IRS launch a criminal investigation of him. The acting in this film is so believable you feel like you are in the movie yourself. John Mahoney the fathermakes this role look so easy and his face conveys every emotion so clearly. John Cusack nails this role as the anxioustoplease smitten teen with a sincere heart. His dialog sounds very natural. Ione Skye is lucky. Not many female rolls for teenage girls are as juicy as this one no nudity no ax murderers and no entering into talent competitions. Additional endorsement I danced with a naval officer from a nuclear sub to the main theme of this film and he immediately asked me if I had seen this film.

And poor John was only like 90 pounds I was hoping Ione would have run to him to let him put that 1000 pound stereo down! It was the 80's there was nothing smaller. D This is a great movie.

Sadly because it stars the incomparable John Cusack the only reason for still watching this giving a typically rich performance alternating nervy confidence with masked vulnerability.  He plays Lloyd Dobler an averageish high school student who is about to graduate.  He lives with his single mother sister Constance and her young son while his parents are with the American army in Germany.He is besotted with Diane Court an apparently beautiful brainbox whose astonishing academic success has been achieved at the cost of peer contact. She lives with her father James who runs a lucrative old folks home and who comes under investigation from the IRS for mismanaging and defrauding his clients' money.  Diane is awarded a prestigious scholarship in England but becomes derailed by her relationship with LLoyd who for all his aimlessness offers her an emotional security she never had with her acrimoniously divorced parents.  She is seemingly obliged to decide between Lloyd and a glittering career until shock revelations about her father force things to a head.There is nothing offensively wrong with SAY ANYTHING.  There is vague pleasure to be had in spotting future minor celebrities Eric Stoltz Jeremy Piven Lili Taylor.  Writerdirector Crowe tries to incorporate a few formal devices into a generally naturalistic framework such as the pseudoGreek chorus of Lloyd's three girlfriends counterpointed with his latenight advice session from his male friends.The film is also mildly subversive.  The scene seems set for a reactionary tract about broken homes  Lloyd's parents are absent Diane's are divorced. It might be suggested that the fears and aimlessness felt by the young in the movie arise from a lack of direction offered by the parents.  The parents are the culpable ones here in Diane's case horrifically unexpectedly so.  Lloyd is a thoroughly decent and dependable as a surrogate father as a kickboxing coach.  Diane is finally able to make a decision after the burden of parental pressure is lifted.  It is seen as right to abandon the tainted tradition of the past.This is figured in the wonderful rolereversal ending.  All the way as Hollywood convention decrees it seems as if Lloyd as male hero is going to be Diane's teacher despite her brains  he shows her how to fit in with her peers how to achieve independence from her father how to drive etc. But at the end he goes to England with her she is allowed fulfil her career he is the usually femalecoded hangeron.  An 80s film about leaving America for Europe suggests an antiJamesian quest for freedom from corruption uncertainty etc.  Happily the film ends on unbalance and doubt.ANYTHING's problems are twofold contrivance and lack of humour.  There is an air of phoniness about the whole thing from the tried and tired 80s high school movie rituals to the gropings for emotion using subPhil Collins music as signifiers for emotion is really tacky and distancing.  The whole film as my wife pointed out is shot in a flat TVmovie style which focuses the now embarrassing 80s detritus.The lack of humour is the fatal flaw for a supposed comedy  anything that could be satirised is turned into melodrama the fratboy slapstick has been done better elsewhere the determination to take these characters ohsoseriously lessens any attempt to see their angst as faintly ridiculous.  Which leaves verbal comedy.  As the title suggest there is a running thematic motif concerning communication truth concealment the ability to formulate emotion in words.  You can't say anything it must be the right thing.  But too much talk and too little visual distance results in a very dull film.  It IS interesting that middleclass white boys wanted to be black so early as 1989.  Of course there isn't a single black character in the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Few movies can boast more apropos titles than Say Anything. It serves as both title and a summary. The characters have such charming and open communication lines with one another. Most notably was the relationship between Diane and her father. A child of divorce Diane was forced to choose with which parent she wanted to live. She chose her father and this led them to build an amazingly close and unique bond. They talk about anything and everything with little to no hesitation and feel nothing but relief and acceptance after they share the information.Lloyd has a similar bond with his female friends. They are brutally honest yet lovingly supportive a beautiful combination that makes every on screen conversation a joy to behold. They two groups have plenty of hearty discussions as Lloyd and Diane progress from near strangers to teenage love birds. Lloyd who initiates the contact with Diane uses a remarkably simple approach to winning her hearthe asks her out and then spends time with her. All he needed was the courage to pursue what he wanted. No one else had the guts to ask out the beautiful and mysterious Diane. Lloyd gained her affection with the simple act of effort.That's the most fascinating thing about Lloydhe is clearly an underachiever but this seems due almost entirely to lack of desire rather than talent or skill. In the entire film he cares about only two things Diane and Kickboxing the sport of the future he claims. He pursues those two passions with prodigious vigor and eventually reaches laudable success with both. Desire is the key for Lloyd.In congruence with the charming bonds in the movie is the theme of love or more specifically the question is love enough? The relationship between Lloyd and Diane seems to suggest that the answer is yes. Although Diane and her father hit a massive speed bump that threatens their relationship despite the obvious love that they have for each other. Perhaps love is enough as long as no one completely screws it up.SPOILER ALERT I must briefly talk about the ending. Diane and Lloyd are on a plane to continue their life together in Europe. This is clearly going to be a tricky situation with Lloyd looking for work while Diane is in school. Any number of issues could potentially jeopardize their relationship.Shortly after the plane takes off Lloyd comforts Diane who fears flying. Lloyd tells her that they just need to wait for the 'ding' because once that sounds they will know that everything is going to be okay. They anxiously anticipate the sound and the screen cuts to black just at the 'ding' is heard. I understand the metaphor and it's a good one. I was merely disappointed that we were not given a chance to view Lloyd and Diane in their new life together. This new atmosphere could have created endless conflict and watchable circumstances. Regardless the movie was excellent and very much worth a watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie has been labeled as a teen movie and even though I like teen movies like She's All That I feel calling Say Anything... a teen movie is an insult. Yeah it was a movie aimed at teens but this movie was much deeper than a teen movie. In most teen movies the main couple has a fight makes up and kiss right before the credits start to roll. However in this movie the couple Lloyd and Diane actually break up and they both emotionally almost break down. You see ALL the aspects of their relationship The initiation the big first date the sex and all the other BS that they have to fight through before they really start to be a couple. That's the great thing about this movie the depth. The thing I did notice about this movie is that it suckers its viewers. You THINK that you are seeing the average guy getting the girl of his dreams but in all actuality Lloyd isn't an average guy. He kickboxes he is very loyal and dedicated to the people he cares about Diane his sister's kid Corey he is very selfless. He drove that guy around the city of Seattle all night just to drive him home safely. He visited Diane's father in jail even though he knew the dad hated him. Lloyd was a really good guy a great guy but he didn't believe it and Cameron Crowe wrote the Lloyd character so that we wouldn't get that right away and John Cusack executed the part so well. Cusack is awesome. Enough said about that. Another commenter said that they didn't enjoy the movie because of its lack of humor. Hello? This movie was supposed to be serious. It's a romantic comedy with more emphasis on the romance element. Case in point The boombox serenade with In Your Eyes by Peter Gabriel NOT PHIL COLLINS. That scene was the most brilliant thing I've seen in movies. I tip my glass to Cameron Crowe for coming up with that. A great thing about watching this movie on DVD is that you can still see the 80's quality video which shows that this movie is timeless seeing that all of the people I lent my copy to related to this movie or REALLY enjoyed. This a great movie to watch with a girl BEFORE you get into a serious relationship There is a lot more things I could say about this movie but I am tired of typing. Anyway this movie is awesome. If you haven't seen this movie see it immediately. If you have see it againFINAL RATINGS 143 stars out of 10".

With Say Anything I was able to identify with everything in the movie characters and all.The plot for Say Anything is fairly standard but its the details and nuances that make the movie one of the greatest of all time.  The script has such a freshness and honesty that its impossible to brush it aside as a typical romantic teen comedy. Instead it gives you truly believable characters going through very believable situations. Some of the most important points of the movie were some of the most honest and overlooked parts.  Like when Loyd and Diane make love for the very first timefor each of them as well  loyd begins shaking and though he tries to deny he is and then says its because he is happy that you see one of the reasons the movie is so great.  The breakup seen in the middle of the movie is so heart breaking that you almost want to reach out to loyd to try and help him and all of this movie and all are done with a script I wish most teen movies would have.  Its intelligent funny honest and precisely written with all the characters being threedemensional even down to bits parts.  And the famous scene where loyd stands in front of his car and holds up his boom box with your eyes blasting out of it is one of the most memorable and great scenes of any movie. . . ever.John Cusak who is one of the most underrated actors of all time plays Loyd Dobbler with such  delicacy that you would not be surprised if he was just playing himself. Ione Skye is perfectly convincing as a girl who is as intelligent as she is beautifuland she is very much both who doesnt realize how beautiful she really is. The honesty with which both of these actors played and poured themselves into the roles are admirable. And if you really want to find out some more about this movie listen to the commentary by cusak skye and cameron crowe and you will find even more depth than you ever thought to this movie.  It gets a 1010  and is most definately in my top 10 of all time.".

They should have made a sequel where they continue their relationship for a couple of months before the girl realizes what a loser this dork is and dumps him for an intelligent ambitious guy she meets at university.Then Cusack's character could have wandered around Europe for awhile being a big baby and then joining the Army.

	schema:headline " Enter Cameron Crowe";
	schema:reviewBody "I love all of Cameron Crowe's movies. He's a master screenwriter that injects heart and smarts in the traditional romcom and crafts characters that anyone can relate to. When you go see a traditional romantic comedy the target audience is usually women. Say Anything has Lloyd Dobler. Besides being the nice guy girls like he's an honest strong willed dreamer. He's cool but not in the typical tall dark and handsome cool but in the outsider marches to his own beat cool. He's very nontraditional for the genre and an example of why Crowe triumphs in his films.Diane Court is also atypical. She's the good looking brain who is not really popular at school as is traditionally found in teen rom coms. She's also torn between what she wants and what her father wants. Her father's questionable dealings with a nursing home he runs also creates a serious situation for Diane. She deals with her decisions post high school her father and her love for Lloyd. That Crowe creates such complex conflicts for Diane in 100 minutes is nothing short of brilliant direction and screen writing.This was Cameron Crowe's directorial debut and was a very promising one. It's still my favorite film of his if for no other reason than John Cusack delivers some of the beautifully written dialogue so well. But it IS so much more. Say Anything came at the end of the 80s. Teenagers grew up with the characters in John Hughes films dealing with those high school problems. I love those films and love how Say Anything provided the wonderful afterthought to those films. Life after high school dealing with our parents vs. our own desires and coming into our own as adults. Say Anything is often cited as a teen romantic comedy often mentioned in the same breath of many high school romcoms. Yet the graduation and party are just a small tiny bit of the film. Crowe's characters are deeper than that. The story dialogue and acting helped jumpstart Cameron Crowe's career yet is still my favorite of his films.".

The rest of the performers do not do much out of the ordinary but Weaver manages to bring a sense of credibility to her part although she is too often topless. The partial nudity involving her is excessive for the film's story but otherwise she is great to have on screen and her attractiveness does not hurt. There is not much of a directing vision to the material the story is only halfgood and there are probably a few other minor problems to be found. Sigourney Weaver certainly enlivens the material however and the film is not bad to start with.

Admittedly his first starring role was in Zulu where he played the upperclass Lieutenant Bromhead but I have never thought he was the best thing about that film. Here he plays a highranking establishment figure but never seems completely convincing in the role even though Bulbeck a workingclass trade union official raised to the peerage is a coopted member of the British establishment rather than one born to the purple.Sigourney Weaver however is better as the heroine. She was along with the likes of Meryl Streep Kim Basinger Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer one of the bright new generation of Hollywood actresses who came to prominence in the late seventies and eighties and gave some great performances in films like Alien Gorillas in the Mist and Working Girl. Here she captures the various often conflicting aspects of Lauren's personality her intelligence her outgoing nature and a hint of an underlying mercenary ruthlessness which nevertheless coexists with a genuine capacity for love.For most of its length the film is a psychological romantic drama like a romantic comedy without the jokes and as such it works reasonably well. Towards the end however it morphs into a political thriller as Lauren discovers that she has become embroiled in a conspiracy by opponents of the Middle East peace process to assassinate Bulbeck and as a thriller it does not work well at all failing to generate any real tension.

From the reviews this is a movie people either love or hate but I think the elements balance each other out and the end result lands it in the middle of the film quality spectrum. Sigourney Weaver comes across totally convincingly as a Mid East scholar who becomes an escort by night to make ends meet anyone who is a fan of hers will probably appreciate her many nude scenes!. Michael Caine also gives a good performance as an English lord trying to broker a secret Middle East peace deal. Where this film falters is in the script which is too talky and it seems to take a long time for the story to get going. The last twenty minutes is well filmed and exciting but there is a lot of plodding to go through before the good part arrives. Fans of Caine andor Weaver will probably love it for everyone else not really a bad film but not really great either.".

I wanted to know if Paul Theroux had written all that awful stilted clichd dialogue I actually laughed involuntarily at a couple of exchanges or was it some sort of set up? Was the screenplay for Half Moon Street a literary mugging of the acclaimed authors' work he has his enemies you know or was the original story Dr Slaughter just as unbelievable unsubtle and irritating as the film? I was puzzled by something else too. I knew the dialogue was bad but why did Sigourney Weaver's part seem so much more wooden than Michael Caine's? Were her lines being tampered with while she was having her hair done? Was Sir Michael somehow involved in the whole intrigue or is he such a fine screen actor that he is able to rise above bad writing and deliver a reasonably believable performance in the most adverse of circumstances? I felt a pang of sympathy for Sigourney. She certainly had had a tough job on her hands not only having to spout forth such hackneyed drivel but also having to give depth to a thoroughly unappealing and onedimensional character. I started to formulate a theory that perhaps Jackie Collins was somehow involved in rewriting the part of this supposed independent and intelligent women so hamfisted was it but who had hired her? Who had it in for Sigourney so badly? As I neared the counter to pay for my copy of Dr Slaughter I began to realise that I was falling prey to the kind of halfbaked conspiracy theories that often pass for the plots of films like Half Moon Street. What's more it started to dawn on me that perhaps I had been lured into watching it by the prospect of seeing the beautiful Sigourney in various often gratuitous states of undress these included a shower scene and a scene where she pulls on a tight white cotton singlet were the producers cynically cashing in on the whole AlienRipley thing?. I was starting to feel exploited and vaguely sullied pretty much like Sigourney Weaver must have felt. The DVD had been free but upon discovering that the book was not I made my excuses and left.I can't advise anyone whether or not to watch this film I suppose it really depends on how valuable your time is. It's not an erotic film though if that's what you're expecting  psychological depth is conspicuous by its absence. If you're a Sigourney fan then I think you'll be so disappointed by her wooden performance that her charisma and sheer physical allure won't compensate. The film is dated if nothing else was amiss with Half Moon Street then the soundtrack would kill it singlehandedly the plot is confused and boring and the characters lack depth.".

Sigourney Weaver is a highly respected researcher with a lowpaying job but instead of getting an extra roommate or applying for another research position she gets in touch with an agency and becomes a highclass call girl. Since a lot of her clients are dignitaries and a lot of them know each other she also furthers her legitimate career with her contacts.While Sigourney Weaver might not be the first actress who comes to mind that you would cast as a prostitute her cool detached attitude works for the character. During her first appointment she gets all dolled up only to look at herself in the mirror realize she's not being herself and scrub her makeup off. She shows up in a skirtsuit glasses and no makeup. She doesn't use a fake name and actually tells all her clients who she is and where she works during the daytime. It's a very unusual story since all the other hooker movies you'll watch will feature a completely different character in the lead. If this sort of interpretation appeals to you you might like Half Moon Street.Also while there are quite a few topless scenes there are no sex scenes. It doesn't glamorize prostitution but it also doesn't really portray it accurately. Sigourney is never in any danger or afraid that she might be and she never alludes to being abused or degraded by her clients. She says to Michael Caine one of her regulars that she likes casual sex so she doesn't mind her night job. It's a bit of an offensive statement since that's never the reason women resort to prostitution. Still if you like political conspiracy movies with a bit of sex thrown in give Half Moon Street a try and see what you think.".

At first you think she's honest and pragmatic about it. She's bored with her job she needs the money she turns tricks for an escort agency. That I could have respected if that's the word I want.Instead she treats us to an endlessly snarly hackneyed pseudo feminist attitude which is painful to watch. She eschews makeup and nice clothes her wits are enough to dazzle clients and spouts commonplace moral drivel to her employers and all her dates as if to say 'Look I'm still intelligent educated and I'm a liberated woman too not an object.' It's not prostitution if you want to do it you see. Men will respect you in the morning. Seriously? You're still turning tricks for money dear. Men still pay to use your body. You won't understand my complaint if you are a man or if you are a modernday feminist all the latter understand is 'You don't criticize women. Ever.' And they think that's enough to make them good feminists. But I was annoyed and bored to half to death.And in the end in spite of all her intelligence education smartasawhip comebacks ...

However having made a string or westerns in succession John Wayne was eager to broaden his horizons and undertake a new project the project was to be a contemporary detective drama titled 'McQ'.McQ is set in Seattle and follows Lon McQ Duke in his pursuit of the gangsters whom murdered his friend and colleague Stan Boyle. As the quest intensifies McQ uncovers the motive behind his friends killing and uncovers corruption that stems right to the top of the police hierarchy.While the movie was slammed by critics and some anti Wayne elements its impossible to deny that John Wayne is well cast in this movie as a tough cop who is something of an outsider in a world of changing values. The Duke gives a fine performance with some good supporting players most notably Eddie Albert Al Lettieri Colleen Dewhurst and Diana Muldaur There are some wellstaged action scenes including two highspeed car chases and an exciting climatic shootout. One notable if somewhat improbable action scene involves two lorries playing a largescale version of dodgems with McQ's car that would have been very akin to a scene from a James Bond movie.The movie delves into several interesting areas including corruption family breakdowns and the shadowy underworld of drugs one brilliantly directed and acted scene involves McQ exchanging drugs for vital information about an imminent drugs heist this scene illustrates just how complex the drug underworld actually is and the chemistry between McQ and Myra is very evident.The overall tone of the movie is notably grim and gritty and while the movie would have benefited from a larger budget tighter direction and greater character development nevertheless McQ was an undeniable hit at the box office and is a worthy entry into John Wayne's impressive portfolio.".

	schema:headline " I feel kind of silly acting like an avenging angel all that time";
	schema:reviewBody "Whenever I watch McQ two things always stand out to me. First John Wayne always gets criticized for copying Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry with both of his cop films McQ and Brannigan. And it's always commonly said that the Duke was too old to play a cop. But I've always disagreed with that line of thinking. Remember Dean Martin had his Matt Helm series going on at Columbia in the late 60's and Frank Sinatra had his Tony Rome series over at Fox at the same time. Later on Robert Mitchum would play Chandler's Philip Marlowe in two films. All those guys were definitely in the Duke's age bracket and I think they were what Duke had on his mind when he decided to make a detective movie not Eastwood.The second thing I've always noticed is what no one has mentioned here so far and I'm a bit surprised nobody has mentioned it that even if you count films like The Long Voyage Home and The Cowboys McQ may very well be the most depressing movie John Wayne ever made. Think about it at the end of the film Lon McQ's best friend and partner William Bryant is revealed to be a drug dealer in league with many other crooked city officials the friend's wife Diana Muldaur is revealed to have been in the scheme with him McQ's wife Julie Adams has gone on the women's lib movement and divorced him and married another man his daughter Kim Sanford would rather hang out with her friends then spend time with her father McQ's socalled friends Kosterman Eddie Albert and J.C. Jim Watkins have been using their personal friendship to spy on him with the intent of arresting him for the drug ring's crimes.In other words everyone and everything in this film is a complete and total S.O.B.  except for Lon McQ. He stands alone against the corruption and moral relevancy in his colleagues and friends all around him. The straight and narrow way is usually hard and Lon McQ certainly has his share of troubles both professional and personal throughout the film.The two scenes in this film that really stand out to me are first and foremost the Duke's encounter with druggie lowlife Colleen Dewhurst who he is trying to get some information from. The Duke is his usual professional self but Colleen Dewhurst really shines here. Had this been anything but a Batjac film she would probably have gotten a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her performance here she's really great. And once again Duke proves what a generous actor he was. John Ford taught him on the set of Stagecoach that good supporting performances make the star look even better and it was a lesson he took to heart. All of his costars throughout his long career always said that he never once counted minutes or worried about being upstaged by his costars. Maureen O'Hara said in her autobiography that his view was always that if you wanted steal a scene from him go ahead and try to do it and if you succeeded more power to you. Here he underplays his scenes with Dewhurst magnificently allowing her to deliver the acting goods.The second scene occurs when Wayne confronts Diana Muldaur in her car as she is about to drive out of town to meet her lover Clu Gulager and skip town. Muldaur is driving the car and Wayne is sitting in the passenger's seat. When he confronts her about her and her husband's involvement in the drug ring and finds the drugs hidden in a suitcase in the back seat of her car she becomes angry and goes into a completely postmodern morally relativistic speech trying to justify her actions. The Duke's facial expressions during her angry diatribe are worth millions. The hurt pain frustration disappointment and anguish in that closeup are the stuff aspiring actors would kill to have. Just for comparison as people seem to love to compare the Duke's cop movies to Eastwood's though as I said I don't know why there is no way in the world Eastwood at that point in his career could have played that scene anywhere nearly as effectively as Duke. Once again the folks who say the Duke couldn't act are proved wrong by a country mile.As I said before I think that this is probably the most depressing movie in the Duke's filmography. I remember the first time I watched this and I don't ever remember feeling so down after watching a Duke movie. Interestingly enough I mentioned Frank Sinatra earlier in this review he also ran into a similar problem earlier in his career. In 1967 he made Tony Rome a lighthearted Rat Pack detective romp that was a hit for him. He followed it up the next year with The Detective a serious drama dealing with political corruption in the New York City Police Department. Like the Duke's film here the serious film flopped so Sinatra went back to playing Tony Rome again in Lady in Cement. Well the Duke must have taken his cue from Sinatra because the very next year he starred in Brannigan another detective movie with a much more lighthearted tongueincheek tone.Once again I have to give credit to the Duke for trying something this different this late in his career he really hadn't done anything like this since Big Jim McLain in 1952. Unfortunately I think the story was just too much of a downer for his fans to accept. Thankfully he learned his lesson here and next year come out with Brannigan which took itself far less seriously then McQ.".

	onyx:emotionText "Whenever I watch McQ two things always stand out to me. First John Wayne always gets criticized for copying Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry with both of his cop films McQ and Brannigan. And it's always commonly said that the Duke was too old to play a cop. But I've always disagreed with that line of thinking. Remember Dean Martin had his Matt Helm series going on at Columbia in the late 60's and Frank Sinatra had his Tony Rome series over at Fox at the same time. Later on Robert Mitchum would play Chandler's Philip Marlowe in two films. All those guys were definitely in the Duke's age bracket and I think they were what Duke had on his mind when he decided to make a detective movie not Eastwood.The second thing I've always noticed is what no one has mentioned here so far and I'm a bit surprised nobody has mentioned it that even if you count films like The Long Voyage Home and The Cowboys McQ may very well be the most depressing movie John Wayne ever made. Think about it at the end of the film Lon McQ's best friend and partner William Bryant is revealed to be a drug dealer in league with many other crooked city officials the friend's wife Diana Muldaur is revealed to have been in the scheme with him McQ's wife Julie Adams has gone on the women's lib movement and divorced him and married another man his daughter Kim Sanford would rather hang out with her friends then spend time with her father McQ's socalled friends Kosterman Eddie Albert and J.C. Jim Watkins have been using their personal friendship to spy on him with the intent of arresting him for the drug ring's crimes.In other words everyone and everything in this film is a complete and total S.O.B.  except for Lon McQ. He stands alone against the corruption and moral relevancy in his colleagues and friends all around him. The straight and narrow way is usually hard and Lon McQ certainly has his share of troubles both professional and personal throughout the film.The two scenes in this film that really stand out to me are first and foremost the Duke's encounter with druggie lowlife Colleen Dewhurst who he is trying to get some information from. The Duke is his usual professional self but Colleen Dewhurst really shines here. Had this been anything but a Batjac film she would probably have gotten a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her performance here she's really great. And once again Duke proves what a generous actor he was. John Ford taught him on the set of Stagecoach that good supporting performances make the star look even better and it was a lesson he took to heart.

Just turning 50 myself I remember the John Wayne movies of my youth and Wayne was always tops on my list. McQ was Classic Wayne in a new era. The 70s were a time when men were starting to become different in the movies. Not like the men of my youth. Wayne kept that macho image going. In another post a comment was made the Wayne used big weapons to foil the bad guys long before Rambo did. That is exactly right. It is great to sit and watch an action movie with so many great starts of the past Wayne Eddie Albert Diana Muldaur Colleen Dewhurst Clu Gulager and a young Roger E. Mosley. Another thing that is of interest is these so called movie experts that watch movies and don't understand one thing about the movie they comment one. McQ's car was a Trans Am not an AMC Hornet. It was referred to at a Green Hornet in reference to the TV show The Green Hornet. It was the nickname of his car not the made or model of the car. His Trans Am was the same color as the Green Hornet's car. This is a good John Wayne movie. Good music good car chases good story line. It is a good movie to sit and watch on an rainy afternoon. Enjoy it for what it is. A nice chance to relive some moments from your youth and see the Duke in action. Enjoy yourself and have fun. That was the purpose of the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always felt that John Wayne did his two police films McQ and Brannigan for a combination of reasons. Some of his last westerns before these like The Train Robbers and Cahill were really not up to standard and didn't get the reception at the box office Wayne films could usually expect. I also think those rugged western locations were becoming a problem healthwise. And of course Wayne was bowing to the public's new taste in heroes.In McQ Wayne is investigating the death of his partner the way Humphrey Bogart investigated the shooting death of Jerome Cowan in the Maltese Falcon. He has to go private to do it he actually resigns from the Seattle PD and gets a private license courtesy of a friend David Huddleston. The investigation leads him to some surprising and not welcome conclusions.John Wayne is always the great symbol of law and order and at first glance you would think this might not be a role for him investigating crooked cops. But when you think about it in films like Tall in the Saddle and Rio Lobo he dealt with crooked sheriffs in the usual Wayne manner. In fact the whole point of Rio Lobo is Wayne putting his whole life on hold to find a couple of guys who betrayed him and their country during the Civil War. So McQ is definitely in line with both of those films.In the supporting cast my favorite is Al Lettieri the drug kingpin of Seattle. Lettieri's death a few years after this film was a great loss to cinema. During the first half of the Seventies ever since playing Virgil Sollozzo in The Godfather Lettieri created some really outstanding villains and Manny Santiago here is one of them.The ending will surprise you and its more Maltese Falcon than you would think.".

Occasionally the Duke's reasoning abilities seemed a bit superhumansuch as how did he know what he knew when the film was about to end??!! Also unlike Dirty Harry and Wayne's next film BRANNIGAN there are no great lines from the film such as you feelin' lucky punk. Also the story itself is just okay.As for the good there are some wonderful action scenesones that a 60something Wayne couldn't have really done if his life had depended on it! And the final confrontation was really exciting and about what you'd hope for in the film.By the way while I only see this as a slightly better than average timepasser his next film BRANNIGAN is a much better film. While not exactly a sequel he plays a very similar role but the writing locale and acting is just a whole lot betterand aside from THE SHOOTIST is probably the best film of the final decade of Wayne's career.".

Several cops are murdered by another cop who happens to be McQ's partner who is then himself murdered. Thrown off the case he proceeds to investigate himself and uncovers a plot of corruption and formerly seized narcotics.The film is quite dated by today's standards as the lone cop formula has all but been beaten into the ground. So to enjoy this film one must realize it is in fact from 1974 when cop flicks were as typical as teen comedies are now. Also despite having many similarities to 'Bullitt' and 'Dirty Harry' this is still an enjoyable action movie in its own right. It is not a classic since the story is a lot less inventive as the aforementioned films but it is pretty cool to see John Wayne as a cop  he is no less tough then when sporting six shooters and riding a horse. Inevitably the film would have prospered more if Wayne was a bit younger but he is still good as the lead pretty much as he always has been in previous roles.Also there are several car chases  all are very different. From the typical driving down the road to down alleyways and even on a beach! Also for you car chase fans this film supposedly contains the first ever cannonroll car stunt on film. So story department aside the film has an edge that is quite fun and enjoyable. 710Rated PG for violence".

It is not a classic since the story is a lot less inventive as the aforementioned films but it is pretty cool to see John Wayne as a cop  he is no less tough then when sporting six shooters and riding a horse. Inevitably the film would have prospered more if Wayne was a bit younger but he is still good as the lead pretty much as he always has been in previous roles.Also there are several car chases  all are very different. From the typical driving down the road to down alleyways and even on a beach! Also for you car chase fans this film supposedly contains the first ever cannonroll car stunt on film. So story department aside the film has an edge that is quite fun and enjoyable. 710Rated PG for violence";

John Wayne was very good as a nearretirement cop but this movie definitely has a 1970's feel. From the cool and groovy instrumental soundtrack to the chase scenes this is a film that just isn't made anymore. The Seattle locale was used very effectively and was different from what most moviegoers had been used to seeing. Of course now with Canada taking over a lot of location shooting it doesn't look that foreign today. Seattle looked quite a bit different 30 years ago but just excellent location shooting! If you like this genre and you like the Duke this is a mustsee!".

I thought the basic message of this film was that everybody has a price not at all unusual a theme for a 70's film. It was nice to see John Wayne in such a contemporary themed film. Of course he would of been great as Dirty Harry but I'm glad Wayne met the modern times with films like this and Brannigan. I LOVED the chases and lingo here!! If I had to choose my favorite film between McQ and Brannigan I would say Brannigan by a very very slim margin because I feel it has aged a bit better because there's more humor in Brannigan than McQ. However that doesn't make this film any less worthy of a entertaining view by the fan of John Wayne or the casual film viewer.  out of a possible  stars!".

	schema:reviewBody "This is just not typical Wayne. Not like the westerns of which he had critical acclaim. To take into account that Wayne already had a body full of 'cancer' when he was making this film. In example being that just two movies barely a year and a half later he had to have oxygen administered to him on the set of that last movie that he acted in 'The Shootist'. That was do to the fact that on the set of that old western picture that was shot in about 1948' out in a desert area where there had been previous nuclear testing performed. The location managers happened to put the production company on that site to shoot the movie it wasn't Wayne being stupid or his fault it was where they were set up to work...everyone else from that movie was gone long ago Wayne was one of the last to go. Considering all the 'weight' on top of him I really enjoyed the story and the action and I am utterly impressed at the caliber of performance that Wayne brought to this picture!! Also I wanted to mention my respect for Lawrence Roman and John Sturges the writer and the director who were the other part in making this what it was. The back drop of Seattle was especially interesting to me being born in the northwest originally. It seemed a different setting for Wayne altogether. Astheticlly pleasing.Also an impressive aspect for me in this is John Wayne has a deep commanding voice of course and yet offers sympathy and sensitivity for the other characters at times. On the other hand he also didn't take crap from those around him looking to give it to him.I guess thats a real balancing act that kind of makes him sensible too I would think.Inasmuch I reverted back to my childhood days with the partly cloudy skies of Washington The state as I watched 'Lon' Wayne move around the city from place to place tracking the trail of 'antagonist' Manny Santiago lettieri. Pretty fun at the point that Lon is in the Men's room with Santiago pounding him for all he's got and bloodying the city's cornerstone criminal. Lon would return to his bachelor landing pad out at the dock his trusty boat. An attempted car theft and after a loud commanding shout Lon drops the fleeing felon with a single 'solid' aimed gunshot! POW!! Awesome Wayne stuff. Watching him take the witness's statement with the recorder was classic seventies persona kind of nostalgia. I recommend this feature to any truly discriminating Wayne fan that has not seen it. It was a departure from his other major roles. I think even though as it has been said Mr. Morrison always played John Wayne in everything that he ever did. I once heard a man from Hawaii say It doesn't matter what the movie on the marque was if John Wayne is in it I'm gonna go see it. Lets face it...it was never his 'range of character' that people went to see anyway.Just good Ol' John Wayne. For me this movie is right around the caliber of 'BULLITT' McQueen Wayne comes through with 'Cowboy' style.".

	schema:headline " Real great fun to watch John Wayne plays 'Dirty Harry'!";
	schema:reviewBody "I recently watched the reruns of two action movies McQ  Brannigan both starring John Wayne on cable TV. I had watched both of them in the theatres during the mid 70's or so.As a young boy I have always enjoyed watching John Wayne in so many westerns Stagecoach Rio Bravo True Grit...  in so many war movies Green Berets Sands of Iwo Jima The Longest Day....I believe that John Wayne was almost in his late 60'searly 70's when he starred in the above two movies. I also believe that these were the only two movies in which he had played a streetwise nononsense cop. That's 'Dirty Harry' style! In the first movie McQ he was Police DetectiveLieutenant Lon McQ in Seattle. He investigated the death of his partner  along the way uncovered some corrupt elements in his police department with shady connections to the mob. The signature mobster in the movie Manny Santiago was played by Al Lettieri.In the second movie Brannigan he was Police DetectiveLieutenant Jim Brannigan in Chicago. He was sent to London to bring back an American mobster on the run Ben Larkin played by John Vernon  along the way he got entangled with the conservative workstyle of Scotland Yard.Despite his age John Wayne was really remarkable in both roles. Having seen him in so many westerns  war movies it was refreshing to see him acting in contemporary settings. The hotpursuit action sequences car chases  shootouts were really good considering that era. In McQ the car chase along the beach with sea gulls fluttering away for cover was magnificantly choreographed. In Brannigan the car chase segment ending at the Tower Bridge was great too. There was even a largescale brawl at a London pub...reminiscent of John Wayne's innumerable westerns. The storyline in both movies was quite intriguing. In McQ he even got to show off his physical prowess with an unlicensed submachine gun. That was cool! The dialogue in both movies was witty too.In Brannigan one could see how big  tall John Wayne was when he was in London among the crowd. He really stood out like a sore thumb. His opposite was Commander Sir Charles Swann of Scotland Yard played by a very fine British actor Richard Attenborough. John Wayne even got a beautiful sidekick in the movie Detective Sergeant Jennifer Thatcher played by Judy Geeson.In McQ I was very surprised to see John Wayne in an intimate scene involving a junkie informer played by a fine actress Colleen Dewhurst in an understated role. This was something which had never happened in any of his other movies as far as I know! On the whole both movies had a good mix of action drama  comedy coupled with witty dialogue throughout. I have enjoyed very much watching both of them again after so many years.".

He manages some very funny reactions and strolls through seattle with the air of a man to whom this is child's play. The influence of The French Connection is obvious as is the Dirty Harry mould of tough cop but there are little dtails that make things refreshing like the background characters and Lon's character itself who genuinelty seems to be motivated by a desire to do justice not act out his own fantasies. The scenes with Myra and with Diana Muldaur are particularly good and the hatred between McQ and Santiago is teriffic. The beach chase at the end is pure hokum and unlike Dirty Harry a movie which deserves to be seen as more than just a thriller McQ is purely a thriller not trying to change the world but just pass a couple of hours. And why not!".

The influence of The French Connection is obvious as is the Dirty Harry mould of tough cop but there are little dtails that make things refreshing like the background characters and Lon's character itself who genuinelty seems to be motivated by a desire to do justice not act out his own fantasies. The scenes with Myra and with Diana Muldaur are particularly good and the hatred between McQ and Santiago is teriffic. The beach chase at the end is pure hokum and unlike Dirty Harry a movie which deserves to be seen as more than just a thriller McQ is purely a thriller not trying to change the world but just pass a couple of hours. And why not!";

	schema:reviewBody "My opinion of John Sturges' McQ has evolved over the years. I saw it thirty years ago on NBC with only a few bullet holes and mild curse words eliminated and thought it was a flabby but relatively decent little cops and robbers flick. It had the additional enjoyment of being filmed in part in Seattle an exotic city some 280 miles from my home Spokane.John Wayne was something of a cartoon to me when I was a teenager. I didn't understand or appreciate his body of work and that he was a unique performerto paraphrase his words not an actor but a reactor. His screen persona was simple and subtle very human yet heroic. I didn't see any of this McQ was just John Wayne putting on a business suit as the reviewer in Time said Seems like putting Cary Grant in bib overalls strapping on an exotic weapon and sliding behind the wheel of a Trans Am to go kick drugdealer butt. McQ wasn't anything special. Just a cop movie with an old guy playing young.As I got olderand saw McQ uncut on WTBS or KSTWI began to appreciate both the film and its star even more. Yet I knew that the conventional wisdom of McQ was that it was a ridiculous attempt to modernize Wayne's image to cash in on his stardom which it didn't McQ flopped at the box office. I declared McQ to be my official Sinful Pleasure a really bad movie that is truly lovable.Think of a dog so ugly it's cute.I taped a keeper copy of it off Cinemax watched it every year or so. A DVD came a couple of years ago. I realized I never get tired of this movie. It's got lots to complain aboutthe looping of the dialogue is atrocious the geography is laughable the clichs are stacked like cordwood and the thought of all the better things John Sturges did in his career keeps popping into my mind.Yet . . .Wayne is at his most comfortable maybe his best work since In Harm's Way. The crime drama itself plays out nicely with clues being offered out at just the right pace Seattle and the Olympic Penninsula are beautifully sunwashed and crisplooking and Wayne's costars give real weight to the movieColleen Dewhurst Eddie Albert Diana Muldaur and David Huddleston to name a few. There are a few overthetop scenes that stretch credulity his confiscation of a MAC10 machine pistol from a gun dealer and talking Ebonics to Roger E. Mosley come to mind but our affection for Wayne and his professionalism allow him to tame the gamier moments. You actually can believe his call for help to Seattle patrolmen when his car is demolished by a couple of semis Get some foam on this thing. I'm up to my butt in gas! His embarrassment when asking for money from exwife Julie Adams and her moneybags husband is one of the best moments in the movie. And of course his being seduced by Dewhurst at first is so offputting that you may want to make a Mystery Science Theater 3000 comment at the screen.But if you're anywhere near adulthood realize this Middle aged people Wayne's character is in his fifties and so is Dewhurst's have sex. Wayne is the gentleman here. He's being approached by Dewhurst and he doesn't want his saying no to be hurtful or condescending. If you watch the scene more than once I believe you will see it as a sweet and decent moment and not some sort of dirty joke about old folks.This brings us back to the evolution of my opinion of McQ. First it was an okay shootemup then a sinful indulgence and now a set of good performances that lift up an otherwise pedestrian crime drama. It's easy to brand a movie a sinful pleasure because you can trash it while enjoying it. Sort of a cheap shot cowardice comes to mind. McQ is no longer a sin for me to enjoy. It's a pretty good movie with really good people.I recommend it warts jive and all.".

This man was the most underrated director of the Italian horrorcult industry and I haven't yet seen a single film of his that I didn't enjoy. Margheriti was an extremely talented and visionary filmmaker but during the aforementioned period he simply answered to the audiences' demands and made numerous of straightforward and adrenalinrushing exploitation movies for the American pulp video market. Some of them were imitations of popular American boxoffice hits and others were merely just cheap excuses to show a whole lot of explosions shootouts and car chases. Commando Leopard along with its predecessor Code Name Wild Geese definitely belongs in the in the second category the plot line is very thin and the whole background to the Guerilla warfare remains rather vague but there is miniature set blasting and collateral damage aplenty! In a not specifically mentioned Latin American of course country the rebellious guerrilla leader Carrasco along with friends and a couple of hired mercenaries are courageously battling against the corrupt dictator Homoza. Their sabotage operations cause a lot of death and destruction amongst the innocent populace much against the conviction of the noble Father Julio who helps hiding Carrasco's troops but the resistance is devoted to continue their battle. The rebels come to discover however that the problem isn't so much President Homoza but his cruel and sadistic military adviser Colonel Silveira. As stated above Commando Leopard is primarily a showcasing parade of nifty and wellcrafter miniature set explosions. Margheriti consecutively blows up a dam a convoy bridge an airplane a freight train and an entire oil refinery. All these action naturally cause a lot of damage and casualties. Now correct me if I'm wrong but don't guerrilla rebels usually battle for the lives and prosperity of the people? Here the resistance kills them and bring the nation in an even weaker economic position. The dictatorship of President Homoza isn't even properly enlightened or illustrated but we're ought to assume that Carrasco is a genuine Ch Guevara. Script logic and depth aren't the film's biggest trumps obviously but this is all about spectacle and thrills! And acting performances too. The legendary Klaus Kinski is once again tremendous as the cruel sadist and downright evil Colonel Silveira. He's the type of guy who blows up an aircraft with 180 children on board just to make a statement!".

It's shot in 2.351 widescreen and every so often you get an artfully composed shot a low angle hero pose image which are far more common to big budget post1990 action movies! or a visceral overtheshoulder camera angle on the gun play. The photography is nothing spectacular as a whole but it does give the film an intermittent visual slickness that sets it apart from the bland coverage common to 1980's Bmovie cinematography. Second legendary actor Klaus Kinski is in the movie. Third Commando Leopard is quite ambitious with at least 3 largescale destructionexplosion scenes.

Although not a direct sequel the two films share many of the same cast members from the earlier picture including Lewis Collins Klaus Kinski and Luciano Pigozzi in different roles Well I've got to say straight away that the ostensible extra budget really shows in the special effects department in this with some absolutely superb explosive sequences involving Margheriti's trademark miniature work most notably during the opening sequence wherein a dam is detonated and even more spectacularly later on when a passenger aircraft is blown up as it comes in to land....awesome stuff!Regretfully I must also say that the action scenes such as those mentioned are sadly far too infrequent with the 'filling' in between them proving to be somewhat less than engaging in comparison.The performances are all fine with Kinski especially on typically snide and evil top form. Also of note is the soundtrack by the legendary Ennio Morricone which really lifts the action sequences up yet another notch.Overall then whilst this may certainly represent one of if not the pinnacle of Margheriti's work visually and possibly budgetary for me at least this is most certainly not the directors best effort in the genre.

Bruno Mattei is a close contender and no I am not joking but Margheriti takes the cake for best explosionfilmer in Italian cinema.The airplane explosion at the airport about halfway through is reason enough to track down this movie.  It looks completely awesome!  Equally cool is a massive oil refinerytrain explosion later in the film not recycled footage from THE LAST HUNTER either!  Also notable are a couple helicopter explosions and a huge dam getting busted.The plot is negligible and the acting and photography pretty routine but the great cast and action sequences make up for that.  Klaus Kinski is underused as usual but appears to be having a lot of fun firing blanks from his M16 and mowing down dozens of extras.  The Morricone? musical score is pretty light and wellused for the most part working well with the action scenes.  However Margheriti undermines the ending of the film with a completely awful song In The War which plays over the ending credits. This is pretty similar to the endings of a lot of his films from the time period though it doesn't end with a freezeframe oddly enough.If you're a serious action buff you shouldn't go without this movie!".

Quality scale miniature sets are used in abundance but generally to good effect whilst the personnel is also much the same as the predecessor with Lehmann Kinski and Collins re joining Thomas Danneberg and veteran Alan Collins aka Luciano Pigozzi whilst American expat Mike Monty and British expat John Steiner join the franchise for their first appearances. Kinski does arrogant badare better than anyone and this is a masterclass of his lessismore approach though it's debatable whether his bored exterior is acting or genuine contempt. As with the others there's a fair amount of pathos on display mourning those lost and lamenting the sacrifices and collateral damage made in the name of chequebook war  all of which is unnecessary and pure guff. But if you like it when stuff explodes catches fire or just enjoy massive machine gun recoil and spent cartridges flying in all directions whilst the hero nonchalantly mows down his incompetent opponents then Kommando Leopard will be very adequate  though brainless escapism.".

Kinski does arrogant badare better than anyone and this is a masterclass of his lessismore approach though it's debatable whether his bored exterior is acting or genuine contempt. As with the others there's a fair amount of pathos on display mourning those lost and lamenting the sacrifices and collateral damage made in the name of chequebook war  all of which is unnecessary and pure guff. But if you like it when stuff explodes catches fire or just enjoy massive machine gun recoil and spent cartridges flying in all directions whilst the hero nonchalantly mows down his incompetent opponents then Kommando Leopard will be very adequate  though brainless escapism.";

The soundtrack with Billie Holyday and David Bowie among others is classy. Unfortunately this wonderful film is not available on DVD or BluRay in Brazil.

This is one of the few films in which almost every character is portrayed in detail. Among them is the Suzi Amis character. She is portrayed as a bit of a libertine a part that she plays with style and flair. The grandchildren however steal the film.

	schema:headline " Joined IMDb because of this movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "So I have been an avid IMDb fan since let's say 1998 when I was in middle school. I wasn't the first to view the site and based on the date not here from the beginning. I have roughly 2000 starclick reviews on netflix but never joined here... and never really felt a need to join.I joined tonight after almost 13 years of viewing this site because of the reviews I saw here and what I think is missing from those reviews.I am not a movie snob and respect Independent films to foreign films to old films to actually admitting to liking Norbit Like Mike and Blue Crush. No one's opinion means anything against your own judgment but I hope my opinion makes you want to see this film.Often we see movies where directors cast multiple children. Many times people underestimate that a director has the desire to use this as a way to direct children on a higher level than say a Spy Kids or Sky High. They want to create a movie for all levels to understand at any stage in life.First this movie takes place in Sagaponack NY. if you read the news this zip code has become the wealthiest zip code in the country and is smack in the middle of the Hamptons. You never really hear of it as a Hampton town because there are no stores only one post office attached to one Deli. This movie is one of the few media examples that documents what the Hampton's once were a playground for artists and free spirits that had 'made it' and wanted a retreat. In the 22 years since this film was released we see not only a change in our culture but a change in how we spend and show the money we have. Today the Hamptons is a playground for the wealthy. While artists are still there it is not to the level it was when real estate wasn't 'the wealthiest zip code in the country.' In the landscape of this film you can see how much we've changed.Furthermore people claim that the adult characters are stereotypes and really characters that don't come alive like some great films can manage to do. I disagree. I think that the film shows characters that can be understood on all levels whether the person watching is the age of the children or the age of the adults. They are simple enough for children to understand what their purpose and identity is and complex enough sexually maturely etc. for adults to see the things that kids will only understand over time. The best example I cam possibly think of is by the same director Cocoon I used to watch this as a child with my whole family. The first time I saw it was 1995 our first year living in Sagaponack. As you can now tell I have a strong bias for this film but I hope my review proves my opinion is beyond bias. Rocket Gibraltar represents so much to me. Viewing it as a child i loved the innocence of the children's quest to provide the Grandfather's seemingly simple last wish. As I got older I understood how the reality of the adult realworld sometimes forbids us from listening clearly to our own family's desires and even forbids us to listening to the innocence and straightforwardness of a child. As a kid I also loved Kevin Spacey's character as being 'out there' and sarcastic Suzy Amis' character for being sexual in a way I knew was taboo but not why Bill Pullman's character because I knew as a young male what being a sports washup would be like and of course Burt's character for being that Grandfather that was soooo bad a that none of his own kids could ever empathize with the life that he had lived.I am not getting into depth with the children's performances because I will let you find the own child within you to realize how they each play their own part and each represent not only a small part of you but on an exaggerated level each can be linked to one of your own friends growing up.As I got older I realized things each and every time I watched the film but I never forget how the movie represented a different mentality and state of being with each level of maturity I was a viewer.The story itself is very strong. Conflict is present. It is not in a truly original way in which each and every character we've seen time and time again. But while they all are recycled players they are placed within a landscape of a story that is truly original and bold in what it was able to pull off. I really believe this movie is trapped in time. It couldn't be made now for so many reasons.Regardless of my ramblings just go check this one out for yourself. Try to be the kid I was the pubescent young man the highschooler the college kid and the man I was when I watched this film. If you do that you really will see that it deserves much higher than a 6.4.".

	onyx:emotionText "So I have been an avid IMDb fan since let's say 1998 when I was in middle school. I wasn't the first to view the site and based on the date not here from the beginning. I have roughly 2000 starclick reviews on netflix but never joined here... and never really felt a need to join.I joined tonight after almost 13 years of viewing this site because of the reviews I saw here and what I think is missing from those reviews.I am not a movie snob and respect Independent films to foreign films to old films to actually admitting to liking Norbit Like Mike and Blue Crush. No one's opinion means anything against your own judgment but I hope my opinion makes you want to see this film.Often we see movies where directors cast multiple children. Many times people underestimate that a director has the desire to use this as a way to direct children on a higher level than say a Spy Kids or Sky High. They want to create a movie for all levels to understand at any stage in life.First this movie takes place in Sagaponack NY. if you read the news this zip code has become the wealthiest zip code in the country and is smack in the middle of the Hamptons. You never really hear of it as a Hampton town because there are no stores only one post office attached to one Deli. This movie is one of the few media examples that documents what the Hampton's once were a playground for artists and free spirits that had 'made it' and wanted a retreat. In the 22 years since this film was released we see not only a change in our culture but a change in how we spend and show the money we have. Today the Hamptons is a playground for the wealthy. While artists are still there it is not to the level it was when real estate wasn't 'the wealthiest zip code in the country.'

	schema:reviewBody "This movie has more than one of the last movies of Burt Lancaster and the screen debut of Macaulay Culkin. It also contains the screen debuts of Angela Goethals and Sara Rue. It was the third of these kids mentioned that got me more interested in seeing it and the fact that no video chain is selling rental copies anymore which got me to buy a copy. Angela Goethals grew up to be quite a babe and LESS THAN PERFECT turned me into a fan of Sara Rue whereas before I simply recognized her throughout the 1990's from the shortlived NBC Sitcom GRAND and somehow I have a feeling that Emily Poe is related to the original playwright Amos Poe. But I digressLevi RockwellLancaster a writer teacher and standup comedian blacklisted during the McCarthyera is celebrating his 77th Birthday at his house in Sagaponack Long Island with his children their spouses and grandchildren. The family consists mainly of writers as well as an aging baseball playerBill Pullman a washedup comedianKevin Spacey and a promiscuous auntSuzy Amis. That promiscuous aunt is actually kind of cute but the kids are the most important part of the movie next to Lancaster's character. It's clear that Grandpa Rockwell has very little time left on this earth and confides in his grandchildren that he only wants one present  a boat that he can use for a viking funeral when he dies. And while the adults seem partially wrapped up in their own lives while arranging the birthday party for Grandpa Rockwell the kids are determined to fulfill his wish.While the movie takes place in Sagaponack it's actually filmed in and around Westhampton Beach. FYI Sagaponack Long Island is a real town that's much further east than Westhampton Beach. It's the last town along Montauk Highway before you cross the SouthamptonEasthampton Township line. But if you can forgive Neil Simon for using segments of Long Island to pass as the mythical Twin Oaks Ohio in 'THE OUTOFTOWNERS1970 you should have no problem with this little geographical error.After surviving a heart attack we find Levi's personal physician Dr. Dean BonackerGeorge Martin had a crush on Levi's late wife. Some may find it less of a story if it doesn't lead to a fistfight or an overdramatic argument. I also noticed in one scene Sara Rue occasionally put her arm around Macaulay Culkin. Hmm. I wonder if she had a crush on him back then. Anyway the movie is supersappy and sentimental but it does contain one carchase and some lines that'll bring a few chuckles mainly from the kids. If you hate yuppies you may find this movie hard to live with but you'd be missing out on an interesting tale.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think someone was a big fan of Beau Geste to have written Rocket Gibraltar. If you'll remember Beau Geste the two surviving Geste brothers give their gallant brother Beau a Viking funeral just like they talked about when they were kids. According to a recent biography of Burt Lancaster this was to be his On Golden Pond or The Shootist but it did not win the critical reception that those other two films got. In time though it found its audience and I'm part of that audience. Burt was 75 when he made this film and he was playing a part of a man who was going into his 77 birthday and his family has come out to Westhampton Beach out in Suffolk County to celebrate his birthday.Burt has three daughters and a son and has led an interesting life. He was a writer of sorts who survived the McCarthyblacklist era and has brought the kids up with certain values. The kids have gone out on their own however and while none of them is a disgrace they're far from what he idealized them to be. His wife had died several years earlier.The daughters are Suzy Amis Patricia Clarkson and Frances Conroy and the son is John Glover. Amis is unmarried and truth be told she's one of loose morals. The other daughters are married to Kevin Spacey and Bill Pullman a hack comedian and a washed up ballplayer. It's in the grandkids that Burt sees some hope and maybe salvation for his ideals. He likes them all but his favorite is MacCauley Culkin years before his Home Alone films. He tells them that his ideal would be a Viking funeral after all the thought of his cadaver being worm food is nothing for a real man to want.Of course the kids set out to do just that and they do it in a winning manner. These kids truly connected with their grandfather the love really comes through in the scenes with each other and with Lancaster.Rocket Gibraltar is funny and sad and bittersweet all at once. I'd give it a look there are worse ways to go out.".

The acting plus the music and direction made this a film that is worth seeingeven if the story itself was a bit dopey towards the end. No...it got a LOT dopey.Lancaster plays the patriarch of the family. He's obviously older and nearing death when he invites all his kids and grandkids to come and celebrate his birthday. During most of the film not a lot happensjust lots of nice subdued little vignettes. I liked this and Lancaster's laid back performance. Unfortunately late in the film it got dopey and seemed like a combination of a Disney film and a remake of the Kirk Douglas classic The Vikings....if directed by Dr. Kevorkian!! I mean it really really got weird when all the grandkids found dead grandpa and decided to honor his last request probably a joke and give him a Viking funeral!! It's done in such a way that it's like the Spielberg or Disneytype film where the kids know best and the parents begrudgingly agree when all is said and done. However common sense says you don't barbecue grandpa on the beach!! Remind me now to go swimming at Westhampton Beach Long Island!".

Of course Hollywood has to spice things up past the point of normalcy but you can see bits and pieces of your family in there and if they included it in a movie it must be fairly common. Neurotic depressed gay and lesbian just about every flavor of individual can appear in our families and when everyone gets together the conversation and interaction can be worth filming. It is always nice to see Patricia Clarkson in a movie  bravo to your success. Go O.P. Walker A new movie called Eulogy 2004 with Ray Romano carries a very similar plot and to see one is to see them both.".

Kevin Spacey and Suzy Amis together again before their turn in The Usual Suspects... Macauley Culkin in a performance that reminds us why we adored him in the first place... cameos by Frazier's David Hyde Pierce as the head caterer and NYPD Blue's James McDaniel as the sheriff... a sleeper or not in my case that you really should try to catch.My only issues Bill Pullman's subplot seemed a bit superfluous except as an additional feeling of mystical wellbeing and closure  and the character was very onedimensional... also... at the end I couldn't help but think would I trust the CPR of an eightyearold?".

He's the legendary Burt Lancaster a grizzled widower who invites his brood and their many grandchildren for one seeming last summer fling at his ocean front cottage. The adults do nothing but argue and coddle the father while the children which includes Macauley Culkin plan a surprise for their granddaddy's upcoming birthday. The middle generation of this family which includes Patricia Clarkson John Glover and Kevin Spacey are selfish and too involved in their own cold lives to really see what's going on around them and when Lanchaster tells his grandchildren of his dream of a Viking's funeral they take an abandoned boat and prepare the best birthday present a grizzled old man could want other than maybe a visit down memory lane with a VHS tape of Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth in You Were Never Lovelier. Formulatic family drama with more than a touch of On Golden Pond thrown in Rocket Gibralter seemed so much better when I first saw it in the movie theatre and while still enjoyable I found it rather one dimensional for the middle generation none of whom I really could identify with or even like. The film tends to move slowly at times but when Lanchaster sits with his grandchildren spinning stories with them particularly the adorable Culkin it glows. It also has amazingly beautiful sunsets to look at and a haunting musical score as well. The ending while sometimes unbelievable is very touching and if you are a first time viewer of this film you may want to keep a few hankies with you. I know on my first viewing of this 25 years ago I was very angry at myself that I didn't have them because I desperately needed them.".

His upcoming birthday is the occasion for a family reunion. We watch as the clan descends to the patriarch's home in Long Island. The adults are all selfabsorbed in their own little dramas. The eight grandchildren take the occasion for reacquainting themselves with Levi. In turn the grandfather tells them his views on dying and how he would love to be buried at sea which he loves more than anything in the world. The film last sequence is amazing as we see the children take charge of the situation.Burt Lancaster is fine. It seems he must have known his own end was near as we watch him looking mistily toward a family that love him but are somehow distant. The children especially a sweet Macauley Culkin are delightful to watch because being so young they still know of malice and other evils they will learn later on.The film is sad and uplifting at the same time. We in turn feel grateful Levi the great writer has been given his last wishes.".

I'd love to be set adrift and burned into nothingness!After the extremely embarrassing pee in the ocean scene nothing could have been worse than.. wait for it...The kids pretending to be in a rock band and we are forced to watch them play air guitar to a P.A. system that they set up? Rented? Concealed? I turned the movie off at that point.The strawberry blonde hottie should have jumped Levi's her father's bones one day possibly in the very same hammock and gave him the longawaited heart attack and then taken boughs in front of the rest of the family At least that would have been funny.I gave Rocket Gibraltar six stars anyway.

	schema:reviewBody "WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERSWhat's it about French auteur Patrice Leconte's films? They're essentially talkfests. Yet whether he's delving into the life of a reclusive peeping tom enjoying games of wit at court at Versailles or celebrating a middleaged man's sensual obsession with getting haircuts from women Leconte turns simple stories into unforgettable films.In Intimate Strangers Leconte reunites with actress Sandrine Bonnaire and works from a script by Jrme Tonnerre who penned the exquisite love story Un coeur en hiver 1992.Most filmmakers would have saved the twist about Anna Bonnaire an attractive woman finding out the man she believed was a shrink actually is a tax lawyer William Faber Fabrice Luchini. But not Leconte. He gives it to us early and uses then that tidbit to make this a mesmerizing film. As Anna returns to William to unload her problems Bonnaire and Luchini slowly build a thoroughly absorbing intimacy.Anna reminded me of an older version of Alice the young woman strangely fascinated by her peeper in Leconte's brilliant Monsieur Hire 1989. So I suppose it's fitting that Bonnaire played both women. Just as odd Mr. Hire captivated Alice Anna finds William intriguing.Leconte and Tonnerre also toss in a goodly amount of humor. William seeks counsel about Anna from the very man she mistook him for  Dr. Monnier Michel Duchaussoy who looks like a stouter John Huston and William also remains tangled with his ex Jeanne Anne Brochet who hasn't quite gotten over the breakup despite finding a new lover. Leconte's genius is that he constantly keeps us guessing. Everything may not be quite as it seems in this film. Is someone being conned? We get snippets about Anna from others including her husband Marc Gilbert Melki but they might not be truthful either. Love is an incurable sickness Marc tells William. That's the crux of this story. William would never tell Anna how enraptured he is by her but she's too smart not to know this and subtly toys with him. When we first see Anna she's a drably dressed a bit nervy. As she visits more often her confidence grows her dresses more revealing. In one lovely moment Leconte tantalizes us with a sly look at her cleavage. Meanwhile William who lives and works in the apartment where he was born and now runs his dad's business also changes less obviously but more importantly. He breaks out in rare spontaneity and removes his tie.This is crafty witty sophisticated storytelling using the vagaries of marriage to create a superbly written psychological drama with deft touches of humor. Leconte revels in subtleties. Nothing's overwrought about his film. There's no sex but Bonnaire and Luchini make their relationship sexy and deeply romantic. Contrast this with the American film The Door in the Floor which also dealt with marital woes. It was labored and lacked focus humor and emotional heft in Intimate Strangers Leconte makes William and Anna's scenes more gripping than many suspense yarns.As I wrote in my review of Monsieur Hire I don't know whether only the French are capable of making such movies. But I am glad they do. Because Intimate Strangers is one of those films that made me ecstatic to be a cineaste.".

Leconte's genius is that he constantly keeps us guessing. Everything may not be quite as it seems in this film. Is someone being conned? We get snippets about Anna from others including her husband Marc Gilbert Melki but they might not be truthful either. Love is an incurable sickness Marc tells William. That's the crux of this story. William would never tell Anna how enraptured he is by her but she's too smart not to know this and subtly toys with him. When we first see Anna she's a drably dressed a bit nervy. As she visits more often her confidence grows her dresses more revealing. In one lovely moment Leconte tantalizes us with a sly look at her cleavage. Meanwhile William who lives and works in the apartment where he was born and now runs his dad's business also changes less obviously but more importantly. He breaks out in rare spontaneity and removes his tie.This is crafty witty sophisticated storytelling using the vagaries of marriage to create a superbly written psychological drama with deft touches of humor. Leconte revels in subtleties. Nothing's overwrought about his film. There's no sex but Bonnaire and Luchini make their relationship sexy and deeply romantic. Contrast this with the American film The Door in the Floor which also dealt with marital woes. It was labored and lacked focus humor and emotional heft in Intimate Strangers Leconte makes William and Anna's scenes more gripping than many suspense yarns.As I wrote in my review of Monsieur Hire I don't know whether only the French are capable of making such movies. But I am glad they do. Because Intimate Strangers is one of those films that made me ecstatic to be a cineaste.";

The most wonderful insight of this film though is that paying taxes and dealing with deep disturbing psychological issues have similar concerns  what do you declare and what do you try desperately to hide?

They have nothing in common but they are made for each other.The film has a strong screenplay and is supported by the two leading actors the scenes are almost always between them. The two characters are very deep the intensity of their words and of their expression doesn't make you feel that the picture misses something. Because everything it's here. The film is able to picture a situation of everyday life without developing a foreseen love story... Will the two live a real love relationship?

I had no idea what this movie was about  in fact had never heard of it but anything had to be better than Napoleon Dynamite. What a pleasant surprise. Even though I missed the very beginning of the film I figured out that Anna had a reversal problem and was visiting the wrong professional. This movie explores a relationship of the mind only hinting at the sexual. How refreshing!This movie was entrancing. I fell in love with all of the characters. Who could not fall in love with Anna? How many times has a stranger walked into your life and you've found yourself captivated? Once  maybe twice? Perhaps I can ask that question since I met my husband due to circumstances that allowed our paths to cross and any change in the smallest decision would have meant we would never have met and within three days we were planning a wedding. That was 20 years ago.So no wonder I love this movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "I think Patrice Leconte is one of the more reliably interesting directors working today. His films have intelligent characters who can usually be counted on to examine their lives and talk about what they are doing and feeling. Intimate Strangers is unfortunately one of his weaker films which means that it is still worth seeing but it may not leave much of an impression with you like some of his other films such as Ridicule.The problem is that for most of the film only one of the characters Anna Sandrine Bonnaire is doing much examining. The other main character William Fabrice Luchini is all wound up in a ball of repression. He doesn't seem able to get in touch with his feelings much less be able to express them. After about two thirds of the way through the movie this character flaw starts to wear the viewer down.Possible SpoilersAnna is a prospective psychiatric patient who inadvertently goes into the wrong office and ends up unknowingly confessing to a tax accountant. The tax accountant William who blinks and stares in amazement at Anna as she tells him her troubles remains for the most part silentespecially about who he really is and what his profession is.This sounds amusing and in part it is but the problem is that as William is written he is too much of one note. He's repressed and unable to express himself even when it becomes obvious to him and us that he has grown fond of Anna.In theme the movie reminds me of another French film of a few years ago Un coeur en hiver by Claude Sautet. That was a much better film I think because it explored the conflict inner and outer of a repressed man who is being pursued by an attractive woman Emmanuelle Beart in his case. It was a much sadder and more disturbing film than Intimate Strangers but I think that is what makes it a better film. Unlike Sautet Leconte can't seem to make up his mind whether to make his film an exploration of loneliness or a whimsical farce on repression. And in the end it becomes neither.But it would be unfair to leave the impression that the film is not worth seeing. First there is the acting. Fabrice Luchini does a wonderful job of portraying William's ever changing states of sorrow sweetness and concernand often portraying the different states only with his eyes. And Sandrine Bonnaire is as she has always been in anything I have ever seen her in fascinating to watch. She portrays intelligence mixed with an air of danger better than just about any other actress I can think of. There is a real joy watching these two actors play off one another and to try to figure out what is going on underneath the artiface of behavior.And second the supporting characters are very well drawn. Some are funny like the real psychiatrist down the hall from William's office who appears to be as much a mercenary as he does a healer. And William's secretary who is just as good at showing what she is feeling by her facial expression as William is good at hiding what he is feeling. And other characterslike William's exloverare intriguing. She obviously knows William and we suspect that part of what irritates us about him after watching him for about an hour is what has driven her away after what appears to have been years of association. Late in the movie she ends up expressing the exasperation that many of us in the audience are feeling when she says Either dump her or hump her. Shockingly well put I thought. If you like French films go see it.".

And in the end it becomes neither.But it would be unfair to leave the impression that the film is not worth seeing. First there is the acting. Fabrice Luchini does a wonderful job of portraying William's ever changing states of sorrow sweetness and concernand often portraying the different states only with his eyes. And Sandrine Bonnaire is as she has always been in anything I have ever seen her in fascinating to watch. She portrays intelligence mixed with an air of danger better than just about any other actress I can think of. There is a real joy watching these two actors play off one another and to try to figure out what is going on underneath the artiface of behavior.And second the supporting characters are very well drawn. Some are funny like the real psychiatrist down the hall from William's office who appears to be as much a mercenary as he does a healer. And William's secretary who is just as good at showing what she is feeling by her facial expression as William is good at hiding what he is feeling. And other characterslike William's exloverare intriguing. She obviously knows William and we suspect that part of what irritates us about him after watching him for about an hour is what has driven her away after what appears to have been years of association. Late in the movie she ends up expressing the exasperation that many of us in the audience are feeling when she says Either dump her or hump her. Shockingly well put I thought. If you like French films go see it.";

He's not unhappy his practice is flourishing but inspired he's not either.Almost falling into his officepad is Anna Delambre the sharp and beguiling actress Sandrine Bonnaire.  Anna has an ADD history with spatial disorientation deficit so she messes up a simple direction to the therapist's office where she's scheduled for an initial appointment. Instead of the shrink's domain she enters Faber's den and unaware of her mistake begins telling a tale of marital discord to the initially unaware counsel who thinks he has a new law client.It doesn't take long for Faber to realize there's a mistake but he's become intrigued by her and so he schedules a second therapy consultation.  Faber is sorting through perhaps without full insight his feelings about the recent breakup with his livein girlfriend Jeanne Anne Bouchet.  Anne is hooked up with a stereotyped muscle man meaning a harmless jerk but the two still spend time together including off the cuff sex.  Bouchet is sympathetically real and touching in a quiet way as a smart woman who may not be as sure of what she wants as she claims.William and Anne continue meeting regularly at his office even after the latter discovers her mistake.  Initial anger melts away and a platonic but increasingly intertwined relationship develops to the consternation and barely concealed exasperation of Faber's matronly secretary Madame Mulon Mulon beautifully acted by Helene Surgere was Faber's dad's secretary and she came with the office.  Technophiles will get a kick out of watching her work with a twentieth century electric document production device.The dark side is Anna's lying to her supposedly impotent hubby about her simmering affair which the guy assumes with the aid of a private investigator is Faber.  Anna is trying to get her no longer enrapturedwithher spouse back without first considering if that's really the best thing for her.Slightly plain at the beginning of Intimate Strangers Anna morphs into a striking lady as she becomes more confident about handling her life's issues.Veteran director and acclaimed French auteur Patrice Leconte has made the most of a film that largely centers on intense conversations in small places.

But because of a little talky concierge and dimly lit somewhat eerie corridors she lands in William Faber's office Fabrice Lucchini who is a financial adviser. Expect the unexpected at least for a short time. Rather than telling her that he's not the right man to talk to he listens to her very carefully and sets up a second appointment with her. The following week he reveals her the truth but agrees to see her as many times as she wants to. Anna accepts his offer and these two idiosyncratic characters strike up an ambiguous relationship which will partly unveil their respective personalities at least for William.Confidences Trop Intimes is the successor of a peak in Patrice Leconte's eclectic filmography l'Homme Du Train 2002 and if it doesn't exactly match the greatness of this film it nonetheless remains a true winner which encompasses everything that makes Patrice Leconte a worthwhile filmmaker. First with this original starting point a woman who was badly directed in a building winds up in an office belonging to a character who is a total stranger to her. But as doctor Monnier says there isn't a big difference between a shrink and a financial adviser they have to define and solve their customers' problems. The difference is that to a financial adviser's his problems are bare while to an analyst's they're hidden.Ambiguity is one of the key words to describe the relationships between William and Anna. Is Anna really in bad terms with her eccentric husband stout Gilbert Melki? Doesn't she try to manipulate her partner? Isn't she a little crazy? They're exciting questions that call upon the viewer's imagination. As for William one realizes that the sort of therapy that links the two characters is mainly destined to him. He's probably THE main character of the whole film. At first he seems strong but bit by bit he proves that he's a fragile character who yearns to change his life. His unexpected meeting with Anna gives him this opportunity and makes him elated for a while see the delightful sequence when he dances to in the Midnight Hour by Wilson Pickett. But then his real personality appears he's a rather vulnerable man who has trouble with women and perhaps that's why his wedding with his former wife Anne Brochet went unravel. Besides she tells him that he didn't make the first move to meet her.Leconte is well served by his duo of actors and it's a real surprise to discover and appreciate Fabrice Lucchini in an introverted man whereas he is usually typecast in extrovert roles. Sandrine Bonnaire makes an ideal partner. One should also hail the filmmaker for having discerningly chosen the scenery of this idiosyncratic in camera. Dimly lit corridors and rooms are deftly incorporated to the plot and give a sultry sensation to the ambiguous relationship between William and Anne a strong point that was tapped fifteen years ago in Monsieur Hire 1989 when Michel Blanc was alone in his cramped flat. Sandrine Bonnaire was then her partner. So when the camera goes out into the open air the interest depletes a little in spite of good moments. While I'm writing about this shortcoming I could also regret a misunderstanding too quickly solved the second time when William and Anna meet again he tells her that he's not the right person and mention a too much cozy end.But overall when you have a strongly built story which has a lot of space for surprises and the development of its characters and a lot of food for thought you can skip without problems conspicuous faults and leave the projection with a big smile on your face. Once again Leconte filled me with joy. Recommended to his aficionados.NB the film was turned into a play three years later.".

	schema:reviewBody "Intimate Strangers is a very well done cinema. In keeping with the title it is a strange and intimate film. Sandrine Bonnaire plays Anna. She is very seductive and encounters a tax attorney who is mistaken for the psychoanalyst William whose practice is next door. Fabrice Luchini plays the tax attorney who is strangely silent during his encounter with this distraught woman. In fact he is very interested in listening to her personal and sometimes lurid story. The actual psychiatrist Dr. Monnier is played well by Michel Duchaussoy. Indeed Duchaussoy becomes the temporary analyst for Luchini's character. This film is now on DVD. It is one of the best foreign films I have seen. The concept belongs to the writer. The humor is beyond description. Don't let this one slip by. It is a must for serious movie viewers.".

This confrontation doesn't come to anything and neither does the one or two others that occur between the tax attorney and the husband.Apparently a deeply troubled person can confide to a tax attorney and get just as much help as they would if they went to a qualified psychologist at least if we are to judge from this film.Finally we learn that the somewhat prim and proper tax attorney is in love with Anna but again it comes to nothing. He never tells her he is in love with her and no intimacy or anything even remotely romantic or sexual ever occurs between the two of them.They break off their therapytype sessions for awhile but by the end of the film they have resumed them.".

Here it's Eric Rohmer meets Woody Allen as psychotherapy provides the excuse if not the actualities for a relationship between people who really just need to talk with someone to make a connection whether it's romantic or platonic. Subtle shifts in context change theirs and our expectations of each encounter as we learn about the other people who may be in their lives. The sterile blas commentary by the shrink provides an amusingly ironic counterpart as the two main characters move each other beyond a more stereotypically professional relationship. While American English is used awkwardly in the subtitles it probably has the best use of Wilson Pickett's In the Midnight Hour in a French film a la a grownup Risky Business. This is the second movie of the summer after Last Life in the Universe Ruang rak noi nid mahasan where change in an offkilter romance is indicated by the use of an ashtray though cutesier here.

The wonder of this quiet but emotionally taught essay in love and understanding is whether the story reveals itself in the experience of watching rather than in its outcome.

Get it at Amazon.This is the most nuanced of Patrice Leconte's films that I have seen. Everything is carefully constructed at a measured pace with just enough revelation as we go along but no more so that we can follow the plot's development easily. The film is cut as close as a barber's shave and is as neat as a pin.Anna Sandrine Bonnaire who is a bit of a tease finds herself in what she thinks is a shrink's office. There's a magazine on the desk whose title is partially obscured so that only the word analyst appears to her eyes thereby confirming her expectations. Behind the desk however is William Faber Fabrice Luchini who is a tax accountant and perhaps the last man in the building who could conceivable help Anna with her marital problem. He is after all something of recluse. He doesn't drive. He usually eats alone in his apartment which apparently is the same place as his office watching TV in one scene it's Humphrey Bogart as Phillip Marlowe with French subtitles. He is only marginally experienced in the ways of human relationships and knows little about psychoanalysis. The analyst magazine on his desk was on economic analysis. She flips a zippo cigarette lighter lights a cigarette like someone new to smoking and begins to tell a somewhat astonished Faber about the intimate details of her married life mainly that her husband won't touch her anymore.I previously saw Bonnaire in La Ceremonie 1995 directed by Claude Chabrol in which she played a mean hateful housemaid and she was very good there. Here she is playful almost childish at times as she reveals her life to this stranger.This is the first time I have seen Luchini who is very properly Parisian in his carefully knotted tie worn even while preparing his solitary meal. His acting style is markedly laid back. He carries an almost continual look of surprise on his faceastonishment almostwith his eyes made big and round and his demeanor controlled and taciturn.Because Anna is so direct and begins talking about herself almost immediately and because Faber is a most polite man who will not interrupt her it is several minutes before he has the opportunity to advise her that she really wants the office down the hall where the psychoanalyst Dr. Monnier holds forth. By then he is intrigued with her and smitten and is slow very slow to advise her of her error.Also because Anna likes to talk about herself like a teenager and because William Faber is a practiced listener there is a certain simpatico that automatically develops.One can see where this is heading. She talks he listens. She performs so to speak he appreciates. Faber is the kind of man as his ex points out who never makes the first move. This is good for Anna because it allows her to become comfortable with him before she has to respond.The complications begin with the appearance of Anna's husband who first makes an unusual sexual demand of the very proper tax accountant and then when that is refused treats Faber to a most upsetting motel scene through a window across the way. Yes it's a little contrived as is the movie's premise. But I like the way Leconte didn't let us see the scene and only revealed later what Faber had seen.Near the end of the film we see Faber for the first time sans necktie which we can guess signals a change in the man. The film ends in a most artistic way with a shot from above as Anna lies stretched out on a classic analyst's couch in a cute frock with her ankles crossed and Faber... Well we see the credits roll down the screen and we can imagine what will eventually happen.My favorite Leconte film is Ridicule 1996. I also liked his La Fille sur la pont 1999. If you haven't seen his work you are in for a treat. He is witty in a sly way especially here in Confidence trop intimes and can be strikingly original. Like all good directors he never loses track of the audience and the needs of the audience. His films are carefully cut so that we always know what is going on but without any heavyhandedness.See this for Patrice Leconte one of France's most talented film makers.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love this film! It's a very warm human story. While characters are having some serious life struggles the film has no drama in it at all. It's very lighthearted and yet it makes you think about what we want more than anything else in life..Turns out that our strongest desire is just to be listened to and it also turns out that the person who listens doesn't have to be a therapist..The accountant who voluntarily takes on a role of a therapist does a much better job with his female patient than a real therapist would do in that situation because his responses to her story are natural and genuine and what a surprise ! this turns out to be very helpful to the patient! A total absence of drama and intellectual analysis of main characters' human struggles is what makes this story so compelling and the film so enjoyable to watch. For us the US viewers who live in the masculine culture of ideals as opposed to earthly humanity this film is especially refreshing because it gets us in touch with our basic emotional needs that are often invalidated in our culture. A lighthearted nature of this film doesn't make its message any less profound. I don't know about the impression that the film gave others who watched it because frankly I didn't read other reviews but it left me feeling more whole as a human being because it helped me discover that what we need most of all is to create a connection with other human beings where we and they could be who we truly are.".

Overall however Batt's script allows the characters to evolve via a skilfully constructed plot which employs levels of drama and emotion largely absent from much of Hammer's output at the time alongside the usual elements of horror and suspense.Director Terence Fisher rises to the occasion with remarkable dexterity orchestrating setpieces which have been compared to Hitchcock in some quarters especially the opening sequence in which a petty thief Harold Goodwin breaks into the wrong house and has a truly hairraising confrontation with its volatile owner leading to a memorable 'reveal' and the traumatic moment in the back garden of Carlson's boarding house when she's forced to deal with a corpse one of Frankenstein's castoffs ejected from its makeshift grave by a burst water pipe. Freddie Jones adds pathos to the proceedings as the helpless victim of Frankenstein's latest experiment his brain transplanted into another man's body against his will traumatizing his incredulous wife Maxine Audley who refuses to accept his new identity a scenario echoed by a similar plot line in John Woo's FACEOFF in 1997.

Don't ever ask me to pick a 'best' or even favorite in this series because I instantly love every episode I can get my dirty little hands on  And this fifth chapter is a true highlight as it has our Baron Frankenstein more and more evolving into a ruthless cold villain. He blackmails a young couple forcing them to assist him with his diabolical experiments only he sees it as simple scientific evolution. Along with his new accomplices Baron F. kidnaps a fellow mad scientist out of the asylum because he knows the skills to perform a flawless brain transplant. Unfortunately Frankenstein's mad raving colleague has been drugged so much he now is a complete vegetable. Ingenious as he is evil Victor transplants a few brains and commits a few murders to finally have the things the way he wants. After 4 prequels numberless others adaptations and several novels Hammer Productions and classA director Terence Fisher in particular still manages to present the Frankenstein films as original and innovative horror adventures. It's remarkable how Cushing and Fisher completely shifted the initial horror from Frankenstein's monster to Baron Frankenstein himself! In this film the creature is a pathetic 'victim' while it's Cushing who's the criminal mastermind. Needless to say that Cushing is absolutely powerful in his loyal role of the Baron. He's actually so good in preaching his medical ambitions that you often sympathize with him even though you witness with your own eyes he's bad to the bone! Cushing receives excellent feedback from the young actor Simon Ward and the exquisite Veronica Carlson. 'Frankenstein must be Destroyed' is an intriguing horror film for some other reason as well. Fisher inserts a healthy dose of Romanticism in this episode plus it's also one of the first Hammer films that feature the sexual content and undertones they'll use more and more in their 70's films. Hammer's popularity tempered a bit during the late 60's early 70's and they tried to make up for this by showing more ravishing meat Carlson's cleavage and sexual insinuations. In short Frankenstein must be destroyed is essential horror viewing! It has loads of tension and exciting sequences the film is professionally made wellacted and it features a fair amount of bloodshed.".

	schema:headline " Excellent variation on the classic story";
	schema:reviewBody "Frankenstein must be Destroyed is one of the best of the hammer horror series and that is saying something as the studio has produced a lot of horror highlights. Peter Cushing stars as Baron Frankenstein the mad doctor whom everyone and their dog will recognise instantly from the classic novel. This film is an interesting variation on the classic story and it sees Baron Frankenstein involving himself in the practice of brain transplant surgery. The film doesn't have anything to do with the classic novel it doesn't make reference to it at any time and it's only notable similarity to that from which it is based is the character of Baron Frankenstein. Saying that it doesn't really matter as this film stands on it's own from the original story. The character of Frankenstein has been changed a lot from the one that we all know and love. The original Frankenstein was an overambitious scientist that got in over his head and later found redemption. The one here however is pure evil. He has no remorse for any of what he has done and he treats murder only as an obstacle that is in his way. He is cold calculating and overall not a nice man. The story really takes off when Frankenstein blackmails Karl a young scientist into helping him perform the first brain transplant. The two kidnap Dr Brandt a fellow madscientist who has gone insane and is being held in a mental asylum. A lot of the film's horror is drawn from the character of Frankenstein who is expertly portrayed by Peter Cushing.Peter Cushing is a great actor and is more than up there on the illustrious list of horror legends. He's not as pronounced as fellow legend Vincent Price or as malevolent as fellow legend Christopher Lee but Peter Cushing has a niche all of his own. His persona is extremely creepy especially in this film. He's not evil like you would imagine evil to be he has a much more intelligent more calculating presence and that is far more scary than any man in a monster suit. Peter Cushing's screen presence is in his authority he isn't a big and strong man but he's not the sort of person that you would want to upset because you just KNOW that something bad will happen to anyone who does. The acting in Frankenstein Must be Destroyed is surprisingly good actually from Hammer films you don't tend to expect great acting but this one delivers. Simon Ward stars almost! opposite Peter Cushing as the young scientist blackmailed by Frankenstein. He's definitely second fiddle to the awesome Peter Cushing but he performs admirably. Freddie Jones is the real star besides Cushing although no Boris Karloff his performance as the man turned into a monster is perfectly tragic. Veronica Carlson is the lady of the film and she does just fine and some credit must go to Thorley Walters too the man that plays the hazardously idiotic police inspector.The ending of the movie is great and draws parallels with that of the original novel in that it's exciting flameridden and everyone gets their comeuppance. Credit must go to Terrence Fisher he has directed a number of Frankenstein and Dracula films and following up on a classic novel and doing it well is no easy feat. Frankenstein Must be Destroyed is a horror highlight and a must for fans of the genre.".

Peter Cushing's screen presence is in his authority he isn't a big and strong man but he's not the sort of person that you would want to upset because you just KNOW that something bad will happen to anyone who does. The acting in Frankenstein Must be Destroyed is surprisingly good actually from Hammer films you don't tend to expect great acting but this one delivers. Simon Ward stars almost! opposite Peter Cushing as the young scientist blackmailed by Frankenstein. He's definitely second fiddle to the awesome Peter Cushing but he performs admirably. Freddie Jones is the real star besides Cushing although no Boris Karloff his performance as the man turned into a monster is perfectly tragic. Veronica Carlson is the lady of the film and she does just fine and some credit must go to Thorley Walters too the man that plays the hazardously idiotic police inspector.The ending of the movie is great and draws parallels with that of the original novel in that it's exciting flameridden and everyone gets their comeuppance. Credit must go to Terrence Fisher he has directed a number of Frankenstein and Dracula films and following up on a classic novel and doing it well is no easy feat. Frankenstein Must be Destroyed is a horror highlight and a must for fans of the genre.";

Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed is Peter Cushing's penultimate outing as Frankenstein and it's a very strong one.I do have to agree with those saying that the rape scene wasn't all that necessary it is clear that Frankenstein is depraved but the film did go a bit too far adding that in and did seem in bad taste. The climax is very exciting and suspenseful but ends a little too hastily and parts of the second half are a little padded. Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed as with most Hammer horrors is visually accomplished love the sumptuous Gothic quality of the costume and set design it's a very colourful film to look at and the film is photographed beautifully and atmospherically. Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed is hauntingly scored with the music really complimenting the atmosphere well and even enhances it while also not overpowering.The script is witty nuanced and tense with no signs of irrelevant froth or juvenile misplaced humour while the story has never a dull momenteven with the odd bit of padding in the second half and is always compelling giving off a really suspenseful creepy and occasionally violent atmosphere. Two scenes really stood out the buried body bursting out of the earth is unsettlingly scary and there is a scene between Freddie Jones's character and his wife that genuinely brought tears to the eye. Terence Fisher's direction is taut and unflinching. The acting is very fine all round with top honours going to a chillingly incisive Peter Cushing as a more evil Frankenstein this time round an alluring and heartfelt Veronica Carlsonthe gowns she wears here suited her and especially a hauntingly powerful Freddie Jones. All in all a very strong penultimate Hammer Frankenstein outing for Cushing and the third best of the series after Curse and Revenge. 810 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "This film can't really be talked about without spoilers regarding a certain infamous scene that happens about 45 minutes into the running time. However this review contains no spoilers regarding the plot itself.The 5th in Hammer's run of Frankenstein films starring Cushing Frankenstein Must be Destroyed takes a few liberties with its central character turning him from a vaguely amoral yet still likable enough dandydoctor sort of like Jon Pertwee without the gurning into a complete bastard who it'd be impossible to like at all. And yet it still works.Peter Cushing is the reason to watch this film. To be honest the plot itself isn't one of the best of the series for the most part seemingly rehashing the basic premise of the superior Revenge of Frankenstein with Frankenstein back to conventional brain swapping working with a foppish aide in various cellars and a monster with an identity crisis. There are several plot strands working at once and not all of them really work a duo of police inspectors investigate proceedings for the first hour or so decide to go and find the Baron and then are seemingly forgotten never appearing again and the monster stuff seems to have been chucked in as an afterthought.However the development of the actual core character is far more interesting and one doesn't really mind the plot taking a back seat. One thing that becomes increasingly clear when watching these Hammer Frankenstein films is that they do actually have clear progression for the character of Frankenstein himself which surprised me quite a bit. From being a young cold scientist through to a slightly nicer though still rather unethical sort and finally settling down to become nicer still by the time of this film he's completely gone and lost his humanity. The real monster of this film is Frankenstein himself colder more cunning more manipulative and nastier than ever before. He no longer smiles he sneers. He seems to hate everybody using people as puppets for as long as they are useful to him  compare his relationship with his assistant here to that he shared with Thorley Walters in Created Woman. Though he's killed before never has it seemed as offhand and easy for him as it does here with several stabbings and decapitations being put down to his handiwork. And then of course there's the infamous rape scene.In the sort of scene which I would never have expected Peter Cushing to be a part of Frankenstein spies on Anna the girlfriend if I remember rightly of his unwilling assistant Karl as she stands in her bedroom in her nightie and then continues to walk in lock the door and yes rape her. Though the camera cuts away before the actual act itself there's enough physical contact and such to know what the end result would have been. It's the most harrowing scene Cushing's ever had to perform and the long stretch of time he spends just staring at Anna cranks up the tension more than any other Hammer horror has ever managed to do. Incidentally this scene was added to the film as a complete afterthought when shooting had almost finished as it was considered by the distributors that the film as it was didn't have enough sex in it. Quite why a rape scene was judged as an acceptable addition I don't know rather than say a random spot of nudity or an appearance by a randy courting couple but the inclusion of it though making for uncomfortable viewing really does advance the character of Frankenstein himself and shows how depraved he has become and how much emotion he now lacks. Peter Cushing and Veronica Carlson understandably didn't want to do it at all. If I may nick a quote from Veronica Carlson in The Peter Cushing Companion  Peter didn't want to do it. He took me to dinner one evening to discuss it but it didn't make the scene any easier. I couldn't refuse to do it. Terence Fisher the director was very understanding but it was totally humiliating. Every alternative was more vulgar than the last... Terry just said 'Cut that's it' and turned away. Peter and I just stayed there and held on to each other. This does explain why after this scene Anna doesn't seem to act any differently around Frankenstein compared to before the rape as most subsequent scenes were filmed earlier on. I suppose the validity of the scene's inclusion depends upon each individual viewer. Ironically the scene was cut from American prints.Though the film is incredibly dark there is some vague delight to be had at actor spotting. For your Doctor Who fans there's George Pravda who appeared in three stories best remembered as Spandrell in The Deadly Assassin and the chap who played Dr. Warlock from Pyramids of Mars. Then there's also Windsor It Ain't Half Hot Mum Davies as a policeman and Thorley Walters as the chief inspector with Geoffrey Bayldon as his wonderfully cynical aide. The latter partnership provides the only comedy to be had in the whole feature and it's a shame that they have no bearing on the story at all.There's not much more I can say about this film really. It's a very good story and I've left most of it for you to discover. Beware however that it's not a rosycheeked bit of so bad it's good fun and may actually disturb and even frighten you to some extent. It should definitely be near the top of any Peter Cushing fans' list of films to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "This fifth entry in the Hammer Frankenstein' series sees Baron Frankenstein Peter Cushing blackmailing a young doctor Karl Simon Ward and his fiance Anna Veronica Carlson into helping him kidnap the mentally incapacitated Dr. Brandt George Pravda and perform the first ever successful brain transplantation.It is always difficult to make a fair and accurate assessment of a Hammer horror production particularly one with the superlative quality of this particular work. Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed' is something of a change in pace for the series as Frankenstein himself appears to have fallen into madness rather than practicing misunderstood and unethical medicine as in the previous instalments. His methods are still unethical that cannot be debated but there is a noticeable emphasis this time around on the Baron's work being for his own advancement rather than for the benefit of man. Although the typical selfpromoting dialogue from Frankenstein would indicate that he is attempting the surgery for the benefit of mankind there is an undoubted distinction between the Frankenstein of this movie and the ones of the past. This new direction for the character is coupled with a monstrous personality that continually dictates that nobody matters as long as the Baron gets what he desires. Frankenstein is willing to go to any lengths necessary in order to accomplish his goal and his pure focus towards his goal only wanes a mere couple of times. The Baron's deterioration into lunacy is exceedingly well portrayed during a particularly violent but short rape sequence. The intensity on Cushing's face adds to the believability of the scene and the image is so powerful that it could linger in the viewers mind and give the movie a new raw and brutal edge. Peter Cushing is able to adapt his style of acting to fit the new persona of the Baron and offers a remarkably visceral performance rather than the calculated performances of the past. As with almost every movie that Cushing participated in his onscreen presence is powerful and commanding and this alerts the viewer to the necessity of paying attention to his character.The film follows the archetypal pattern for Hammer horrors. The film starts off powerfully with two predominantly memorable sequences the most sensational of which is the entrance of the diabolical Baron when he terrifies a petty thief. From there the film moves towards the mechanics of the Baron's actions and his resolution to accomplish all that he seeks out to undertake. It is during this midsection' of the film that everything slows down while the emphasis is no longer on scares or action. However through some very proficient direction from Terence Fisher the pacing and structure of this movie almost makes Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed' preeminent when compared to other movies of the era. Without a shadow of a doubt Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed' should be held in the highest echelon of excellence within the Hammer family if only for its superb composition alone. The movie ends with an exhilarating climax yet the viewer could feel cheated by the abrupt nature in which the film ends. The hasty ending is one of the few faults in this movie but in retrospect serves the series well as it does leave certain questions unanswered. The other faults with the movie are so intermittent that although they are noticeable they rarely detract from the viewing experience. Having said that there are a couple of scenes which seem to be unnecessarily prolonged which temporarily obstruct the otherwise smooth flowing feel that the movie has. These scenes represent the very few moments where a viewer could temporarily lose their concentration on the movie. However even considering the prolonged nature of the scenes in question one cannot fault the pacing of the movie as Terence Fisher's direction shows impressive capability and he makes these scenes fit into the movie almost seamlessly. Even with the sporadic lapses in quality Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed' is fundamental viewing for any serious horror movie fan. This is a movie based around great performances stunning visuals a haunting and atmospheric soundtrack as well as quintessential Hammerstyle horror. My rating for Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed'  810.".

	schema:reviewBody "A tragic story of fiendish moral complexity the direction of Terence Fisher at the peak of his powers exemplary Gothic atmosphere and a splendid ensemble of performers anchored by the great Peter Cushing in his most powerful turn as Frankenstein raise this movie to the pinnacle of Hammer horror.The doctor's god complex drives the plot this is a man who believes utterly in his infallibility who practices murder and blackmail without blinking an eye. Into his clutches fall the two innocents played by Simon Ward and Veronica Carlson. But how innocent are they? And how innocent can they remain? This is a story of precipitous moral descent utterly bleak softened only by familiar genre trappings that reassure us this is merely a horror movie merely an entertainment.There is much discussion among fans about the rape scene. Supposedly producer James Carerras came up with the scene late in production with a glib comment about the movie needing more sex and both actors objected to what they considered a gratuitous and distasteful scene. But whether he made the glib comment or not I think Carerras's instincts were on target. The sexual trauma suffered by Carlson goes a long way to explaining why she impulsively stabs the harmless monster later that act of violence seals her moral downfall and Frankenstein's subsequent act of stabbing her reiterates his previous sexual penetration of her and marks his own moral nadir. He cannot sink lower.Director Terence Fisher delivers flawless atmosphere and pacing. I'll comment on only one sequence the eruption of the water main behind Carlson's house which is carried out with Hitchcockian gusto from the grotesque humor of the nosy helpful neighbor at the back gate to the nightmarish image of a bedraggled miserable Carlson stiffly gesturing to let Frankenstein know where the body is. It's unforgettable.Aristotle said that great art evokes terror and pity. The terror here is obvious the pathos is generated by Carlson but also by Freddie Jones as the monster. His fate is tragic but he too is far from innocent. Some complain that this is a Frankenstein movie without a monster but when Frankenstein himself is a fiend the monster must become the tragic hero. In this brilliant reversal of an ofttold tale there can be only one outcome Frankenstein must be destroyed.".

This is a story of precipitous moral descent utterly bleak softened only by familiar genre trappings that reassure us this is merely a horror movie merely an entertainment.There is much discussion among fans about the rape scene. Supposedly producer James Carerras came up with the scene late in production with a glib comment about the movie needing more sex and both actors objected to what they considered a gratuitous and distasteful scene. But whether he made the glib comment or not I think Carerras's instincts were on target. The sexual trauma suffered by Carlson goes a long way to explaining why she impulsively stabs the harmless monster later that act of violence seals her moral downfall and Frankenstein's subsequent act of stabbing her reiterates his previous sexual penetration of her and marks his own moral nadir. He cannot sink lower.Director Terence Fisher delivers flawless atmosphere and pacing. I'll comment on only one sequence the eruption of the water main behind Carlson's house which is carried out with Hitchcockian gusto from the grotesque humor of the nosy helpful neighbor at the back gate to the nightmarish image of a bedraggled miserable Carlson stiffly gesturing to let Frankenstein know where the body is. It's unforgettable.Aristotle said that great art evokes terror and pity. The terror here is obvious the pathos is generated by Carlson but also by Freddie Jones as the monster. His fate is tragic but he too is far from innocent. Some complain that this is a Frankenstein movie without a monster but when Frankenstein himself is a fiend the monster must become the tragic hero. In this brilliant reversal of an ofttold tale there can be only one outcome Frankenstein must be destroyed.";

There are a couple of minor problems with this film namely the tackedon rape scene unnecessary and the subplot involving detective Thorley Walters and his sidekick Geoffrey Bayldon which goes nowhere and seems to have been added in to pad out the running time.

Veronica Carlson Dracula Has Risen From The Grave and Simon Ward fit very well in their roles as the young couple blackmailed by Frankenstein and Freddie Jones also delivers a very good performance. The score and photography are once again very good and deliver the typical Hammer atmosphere. Fans of Hammer films and Horror in general certainly shouldn't miss Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed.

THE PLOT Baron Frankenstein is a fugitive who goes by a different name but is intent on continuing his gruesome work. He ultimately blackmails a young couple in assisting him. They steal a patient from the local insane asylum and successfully transplant his brain into another body curing his madness.The film is highlighted by Veronica Carlson who looks a lot like Ursula Andress but possibly even more beautiful if you can imagine that.FINAL ANALYSIS Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed is one of the best Frankenstein flicks I've seen. It's creative labyrinthian and full of pizazz. Being a sequel the film retains the essential elements of the original story but is a natural progression. The REAL monster in this picture is Baron Frankenstein himself he's no longer a basically good person obsessed with creating life from corpses. His obsession has defiled him to the point of enmity hate arrogance violence rape and murder.Another great Frankenstein film from this same period is the Italian Lady Frankenstein released in 1971 which starred Rosalba Neri AKA Sara Bey as the Baron's daughter who overtakes his work after his death.

	schema:reviewBody "FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED  Terence FisherFULL REVIEW  Likely plot SpoilersThe last in Hammer Studios' entries for their Frankenstein franchise makes for rather good viewing although it stops a few paces behind classic status mainly because of Hammer's insistence on cheap shock value.Here Baron Viktor Frankenstein Peter Cushing in another assured performance on the run after his grotesque experiments are detected by the law as depicted in a fairly explosive opening sequence takes up room in a boarding house under an alias. Catching his landlady and her doctor beau in the act of pilfering cocaine for her ailing mother Frankenstein blackmails them into doing his bidding. Besides robbing warehouses for surgical equipment and in the process murdering a watchman the young lover is forced to help Frankenstein make off with asylum inmate Brant. Brant once a brilliant scientist himself doing work that parallels the Baron's is now insane and recalls nothing of his life. Frankenstein who needs information from Brant on preservation of the human brain transplants Brant's brain to another body after the fatigued Brant suffers a lifethreatening heart attack. He then sets out to cure Brant's insanity by vivisection. These scenes are really gripping even if not particularly gory because of Cushing's commanding air and some very convincing sound effects used to denote the grotesque surgical procedures.Frankenstein's experiment succeeds and Brant's brain is successfully transplanted to another body. But after some macabre incidents when Brant goes to his wife she is too repulsed by his grotesque aspect and he vows revenge upon Frankenstein setting the stage for a literally fiery climax in which he consigns his godless creator to flames. This one is unique in being one of the few Frankenstein films that do not depict his creation as a murderous shambling zombie. The transplanted Brant played by Freddie Jones delivers an eloquent and emotional performance.Technically this is the best shot of all the Hammer films I've seen to date with stunning use of colors and shadow. The film stumbles a bit with pointless depictions of Frankenstein's cruelty and a disgusting rape scene supposedly added because 'Hammer studio head Sir James Carreras thought the film lacked sex'.

	onyx:emotionText "FRANKENSTEIN MUST BE DESTROYED  Terence FisherFULL REVIEW  Likely plot SpoilersThe last in Hammer Studios' entries for their Frankenstein franchise makes for rather good viewing although it stops a few paces behind classic status mainly because of Hammer's insistence on cheap shock value.Here Baron Viktor Frankenstein Peter Cushing in another assured performance on the run after his grotesque experiments are detected by the law as depicted in a fairly explosive opening sequence takes up room in a boarding house under an alias. Catching his landlady and her doctor beau in the act of pilfering cocaine for her ailing mother Frankenstein blackmails them into doing his bidding. Besides robbing warehouses for surgical equipment and in the process murdering a watchman the young lover is forced to help Frankenstein make off with asylum inmate Brant. Brant once a brilliant scientist himself doing work that parallels the Baron's is now insane and recalls nothing of his life. Frankenstein who needs information from Brant on preservation of the human brain transplants Brant's brain to another body after the fatigued Brant suffers a lifethreatening heart attack. He then sets out to cure Brant's insanity by vivisection. These scenes are really gripping even if not particularly gory because of Cushing's commanding air and some very convincing sound effects used to denote the grotesque surgical procedures.Frankenstein's experiment succeeds and Brant's brain is successfully transplanted to another body. But after some macabre incidents when Brant goes to his wife she is too repulsed by his grotesque aspect and he vows revenge upon Frankenstein setting the stage for a literally fiery climax in which he consigns his godless creator to flames. This one is unique in being one of the few Frankenstein films that do not depict his creation as a murderous shambling zombie. The transplanted Brant played by Freddie Jones delivers an eloquent and emotional performance.Technically this is the best shot of all the Hammer films I've seen to date with stunning use of colors and shadow. The film stumbles a bit with pointless depictions of Frankenstein's cruelty and a disgusting rape scene supposedly added because 'Hammer studio head Sir James Carreras thought the film lacked sex'. Also almost all performances other than that of Cushing and Jones are very hohum. But these two performances aided by Fisher's energetic direction are sufficient to take this film a good many notches above the norm.";

	schema:reviewBody "Now that's more like it! After the two preceding rather lacklustre films this is a magnificent return to form for the Hammer Frankenstein series. After being a fairly decent man in The Evil of Frankenstein and Frankenstein Created Woman Baron Frankenstein played by Peter Cushing for the fifth of six times is once again the amoral abusive and downright evil bastard of the first two films. For that reason I see it as being a return to the series' first and better continuity. Cushing delivers one of the best performances in this film as the lead of an extremely strong cast including Simon Ward Veronica Carlson Freddie Jones George Pravda Thorley Walters Geoffrey Bayldon Peter Copley Maxine Audley Windsor Davies and Frank Middlemass. This is the best cast of any Hammer film that I've seen and if not for the absence of Christopher Lee I'd call it the perfect cast. Outside of its stellar cast the script is wonderful. This is one of the most frightening Hammer films that I've seen.The only major problem that I had with the film was the rape scene. Rape scenes are always disturbing to watch or read but at least most of the time they are actually necessary to the plot. That certainly wasn't the case here as it wasn't included in the script and was included at the insistence of the executives in order to increase the film's appeal to American distributors by adding more sexual content. They certainly could have found a better way to do this than with an incongruous rape scene. It really is the epitome of tastelessness. The scene was filmed over the objections of Cushing Carlson and the director Terence Fisher. Always a perfect gentleman Cushing actually apologised to Veronica Carlson for the scene. As it wasn't in the script the rape isn't mentioned later in the film by either Frankenstein or Anna.My only other criticism of the film is that its Monster doesn't pose a threat until 80 minutes into its 100 minute runtime though after that he is second only to the original as the most effective. The longest of the Hammer films that I've seen it suffered from a little padding after the hour mark. Several scenes could have been trimmed a bit without much difference being made to the plot. In spite of this I'd still give it a perfect scene if not for the rape scene.".

There is nothing I hate more than an actor playing up to all the stereotypes to make themselves seem intoxicated. Smoking marijuana may not make you the smartest person around but you can still function. With the writing it seems like they were trying to make built in catchphrases by repeating the same lines at several points. It's not like they were randomly spoken they fit every time. I just don't see them getting to be as big as say Your mom goes to college. But who thought that that would catch on? Irreguardless I'm sorry regardless it is a decent movie. A good example of why a movie should go direct to DVD. It's likable just not a blockbuster hit. It's good marketing not to waste money advertising it. The people that are going to see it know about it and are going to rent it or buy it either way. It's complex.".

Tasteless humour a clutter of bad clichs an awfully low budget and it shows mediocre acting and terrible character structure.

Maybe you will even get a lot of inside jokes. I could really relate with the white guy since I have seen Shawshank redemption a trillion times and yet never seen the rape seen.

It guides your mind  every dialogue ends up with you and the guys from the movie not understanding anything at all you feel exactly the same way this people feel and they got where they got in the end of the movie without understanding nothing at all. Maybe you will even get a lot of inside jokes. I could really relate with the white guy since I have seen Shawshank redemption a trillion times and yet never seen the rape seen.

Arnaud Desplechin uses Robert Altman's impressionistic approach to filmmaking taking multiple characters plots lines then adding Altman's playfulness with cinematic technique to dazzle the viewer with a rich mix of ideas and allusions. Watching you just don't want it to end.The actors hereas in Altmantake center stage. Catherine Deneuve is the reluctant matriarch of some pretty messedup siblings. We aren't ever clued in on the exact details of the rifts and jealousies. We just recognize them from our own family experiences. During an introduction to the cast of characters at the beginning of the film the death of a young infant early in the family's history suggests that interpersonal problems will result but it can't be the sole reason for the pathologies represented. As in life it's never a simple thing to find the reason for conflict unhappiness or even joy. We simply have to accept it and make the best of the situations before us. And this film is a wonderful demonstration of making the best of a real mess.There's not a weak link in the cast. And as the bizarre begin to assemble for a very strange Christmas homecoming the delight we feel for being onlookers instead of participants is palpable in the audience.I should warn that this is not a film in the tradition of Home Alone or A Christmas Story. You may wait a long time for the Baby Jesus to arrive here as the children on the screen do. It's more a film about family life and the peculiar kind of fulfillment we get from the strife that results. As with the ghost wolf in this family's basement we're haunted by the familiar and the strange it's both fearful and thrilling to see. And that's a very admirable accomplishment for Arnaud Desplechin.".

You may wait a long time for the Baby Jesus to arrive here as the children on the screen do. It's more a film about family life and the peculiar kind of fulfillment we get from the strife that results. As with the ghost wolf in this family's basement we're haunted by the familiar and the strange it's both fearful and thrilling to see. And that's a very admirable accomplishment for Arnaud Desplechin.";

	schema:reviewBody "When I watched director Arnaud Desplechin's Kings and queen I was most impressed by the richness of its contents. A Christmas tale is also rich in contents but in a different way. Rather than multiple plot lines the story evolves around a simple family reunion at Christmas. As the film unfolds what starts as a blur comprising a group of strangers to the audience gradually develops outlines and shapes until at the end what has been revealed in relationships and human nature is no less complex than in Kings and queen. Instrumental to this marvellous cinematic experience is an ensemble of topnotch actors with topnotch performances. Catherine Deneuve plays Junon the pivotal point of this ordinary dysfunctional no oxymoron intended family a woman who years ago lost his 6yearold son Joseph to a rare genetic ailment. After several decades she now falls victim to the same disease and has less than six months to live unless she gets a bone marrow transplant from a family member. One of the purposes of the reunion is to find such a donor. It turns out that only two are compatible. Junon however faces her predicament with calm stoicism and isn't even sure if she wants the treatment. JeanPaul Roussillon won a Caesar for Best Supporting by playing Abel her supportive and understanding husband. He is also a firm rock and a safe harbour for family members four children their spouses and offspring who are emotionally troubled. The two older children Elizabeth and Henri had hated each other since childhood partly because neither was compatible with Joseph to provide bone marrow transplant to save their dying brother. Their respective characters also flamed the antagonism. Elizabeth played by Anne Consigny is serious and multitalented. Henri played by Mathieu Amalric is the black sheep of the family always obnoxious a drifter and a womanizer. But it turns out that Henri is one of the only two compatible family members for the transplant. The other is Elizabeth's teenage son Paul played by Emile Berling an introvert sensitive young man and a schizophrenia patient. Abel and Junon's other two surviving children are boys. Laurent Capelluto plays Simon taciturn reasonably well liked but undistinguished and still single. While Junon likes Henri least not surprisingly the apple of her eyes is the youngest son Ivan played by Melvil Poupaud handsome funfilled happily married to beautiful wife Sylvia with two lively little boys played by Thomas Obled and Clement Obled. Sylvia played by Chiara Mastroianni then stumbles across a little secret that the two brothers had both been in love with her and agreed between themselves that Ivan was to go ahead. While this does not change anything Sylvia will now always wonder why is it that her life had to be decided for her and how it would have been if she were allow to make a free choice. Her relationship with Simon takes a subtle change. Contributing to the complex world of emotions and nuances is Henri's latest girlfriend Faunia played by Emmanuelle Devos. As she is Jewish she has never intended to spend Christmas with the family. But while initially reluctant she ends up spending two days there before leaving on Christmas Eve to join her own folks. What's more Faunia's open and honest personality brings a measure of healthy impact to his troubled family particularly Junon. Completing the ensemble is Elizabeth's husband Claude Hippolyte Girardot and another guest an elderly lady who is an old family friend Francois Bertin. From the above summary it can be easily surmised how immense the dramatic opportunities could be. This potential is fully realized by an excellent director and an impeccable cast. The only other thing I would add is that the entire tone of this film is cheerful emotional moments notwithstanding.".

The first few scenes of the movie with its flashbacks and quick cuts seem disjointed at first but it does really quickly pull you into the family situation. And when the family does finally arrive altogether at the Vuillard house you almost feel as if you're one of the guests. All the actors are wonderful but I must say that Amalric who almost always plays this type of character in Despleshin films Kings and Queen My Sex Life etc. is terrific in this film. He's much more likable here. And Emmanuelle Devos has such presence in this movie that she steals pretty much every scene she's in. The rest of the cast Deneuve Rousillion and Cosigny are all terrific.I love how the script deals with so many subjects not only of the family history and Junon's need for a donor but also touches on everything from mathematics to philosophy to literature to all types of music religion and all geared towards how all these things enhance and does not consume the life of the family. It was very refreshing to see this family although messed up in so many ways to live free of convention children curse everyone's smoking andor drinking telling each other what they really feel and think andor not feel and think. I also liked that the house felt like a house that people actually lived in.".

His film is also sometimes a big melodrama folded around a cancer story not unlike a more serious yet sometimes lighter version of The Royal Tenenbaums and centered so firmly around the family during that crazy but lovingdespiteeverything time of Christmas you'd swear Desplechin watched the first hour of Fanny  Alexander too many times to count.At the same time A Christmas Tale in very much a French film is attitude and approach to narrative and occasionally nearing that dreaded Pword pretentious in being 2 12 hours of incidents and confrontations and little details and twists. A lot happens with the Vuillard family over a few days but in it uncovers a whole can of worms involving a banished son Mathieu Amalric who thankfully is maybe the centerpiece of the ensemble in terms of being the black sheep like Anne Hathaway in Rachel Getting Married a depressed daughter Anne Consigny who despite being effective in a onenote performance is also so shrill and cold as a character it's hard to feel anything for her at all despite her plight of losing her older brother as a child and a cousin who has loved his cousin's wife ever since he got him Ivan the youngest Vuillard brother to hook up with her so many years ago. Meanwhile the mother Catherine Deneuve who may not exactly be a great actress but is the greatest living female French star which carries a lot of weight as a true beauty has cancer possibly terminal unless a donor comes forward.So there's a lot here to work with  maybe perhaps arguably too much though it's almost a credit to the director that I can't say exactly what little things for example like the Christmas Eve sex scene are deliberately paced but for good reason and he laces everything with a curious jazz score throughout sometimes to great effect and sometimes not. But at the least it's wonderful to see so many good actors in one place particularly Amalric who is quickly becoming a truly fantastic talent with a lot of range in the work I've seen him in one day he's a subdued intelligence man in Munich next he's paralyzed except for one eyeblinking in Diving Bell and even a 007 villain and here goes further in a scene stealing performance one such scene is his toast at the Christmas dinner a scene actually shocking and hilarious and sad all in a thirtysecond split.He and Deneuve and the underrated JeanPaul Roussillon as the husband of Junon almost make me want to rate the movie higher. But alas it is what it is a very strong take on a familiar subject  crazy and light and dark and tragic and unnerving times with a family at Christmas  and standing it on its head while also the things I mention above. Did I mention it's French? 7.510".

To me it never did and was an overlong borefest throughout with very short takes leading to other very short takes that never got my interest for any.Never saw any family act the harsh way toward each other that this one did or talk to each other so carelessly without more mayhem being caused by it than this one did or showed less love and care for each family member than this one did even with the mother dying!Why was this kind of labored film supposed to be the right one to show at Christmas? Maybe Labor Day instead? I sure labored through it unwillingly and it was sooooo long. And I love French films! See Cache For the Love of Others or Amelie instead for great French films and not this piece of pretty junk.";

It was not merely selfindulgent or pretentious it was a vacuum. A soulsucking vacuum. This film has no saving grace no enjoyable character nothing funny and nothing sad. It isn't smart enough to be drama and there's no moment that's in the slightest bit farcical. The most intriguing thing about this movie is how it has managed to get mostly glowing and positive reviews. I was tricked by those reviews but you don't have to be gentle reader.

This film by Arnaud Desplech was a terrible disappointment. After having enjoyed his Kings and Queens and this film left me completely bored and frustrated to the point where I actually left before the movie ended. The movie wandered around its central storyline involving Catherine Deneuve's illness getting sidetracked by every peripheral storyline and supporting character that appeared on screen. The movie also gave us too little character development to understand why the different characters disliked each other so much this was a story of family dysfunction so that the dearth of coherent narrative became even more critical. Finally the soundtrack which ranged from hip hop to Bach to Mendelhson's Midsummer Night's Dream was at odds with the emotional temperature of the movie and further obscured any emotion the viewer should have been feeling at the time. The photography the director often began scenes with a mainly dark screen where our only sight is through a small opening making feel as if we are watching through a peephole that then expands was also pretentious and inscrutable.".

Father Vuillard suggests that his children go to search him because he has an inclination to drink and gets easily into fights. Since Ivan's wife does not want to go his former lover Elizabeth goes. Driven by a woman's infallible instinct she finds Simon immediately in one of those rare bars that are open at that time in Paris the owner and the guests being mainly Muslims for whom there is no reason to close up during the Christian holidays. And now there comes one of the most wonderful scenes between man and woman in the history of movies He has already piccol as the French say is pretty intoxicated when Elizabeth sits to him at the bar. Simon is just going to order another beer with sidekick probably Wodka and Elisabeth says first Do you not think you had already enough for today?  He answers This is none of your business. There she responds Well I am feeling in the same mood as you do and therefore drink the same as you drink. So there are sitting until almost 4 o' clock in the morning in the little bar and are drinking beer and Wodka having wonderful discussions because soon they are on the same level and on top of all they are even going to get reconciled letting passing revue what went wrong in their common past and we hear out of Simon's and soon also out of Elisabeth's mouth some of the most astonishing confessions that they would probably never have been able to utter in any other environment there is a joke in French between s'enivrer  getting drunk and environment.In Douglas Sirk's Written on the wind there is a similar scene between Robert Stack and Lauren Bacall. Robert escapes a family ceremony and goes boozing in his favorite restaurant Lauren follows him. But unlike the scene in Desplechin's movie the confrontation between the two marks only the definite end in their mutual understanding. Rainer Werner Fassbinder in a bookfragment on Sirk's work wrote Robert starts again to drink. Now it shows that Lauren Bacall has no solutions for her husband. Instead of going to booze together with him instead of trying to understand some bits of his grief she gets more and more pure and causes one more and more to throw up translated by the present author from R.W. Fassbinder Filme Befreien Den Kopf. Frankfurt am Main 1984 p. 16.Another wonderful example of womenpower happens between Faunia Emmanuelle Devos and Henry Mathieu Amalric who plays her lover. Henry being a drinker lets himself provoke to analyze the miserable situation of their dysfunctional family in an extremely theatric way attacking directly the husband of one of his sisters who sits besides him. After he is knocked down by this husband and lies on the soil Faunia seems to be amused by not startled at all about this situation. When he gets on his feet again he throws her his carkeys on the table and says that she has come in the wrong moment to meet his family and that he wants her to scram. But she sets up one of her absolutely disarming smiles shoots him with a short but highly intellectual comment and asks him if this would not be nice of him to bring her now a coffee. Henry's face looks like a tank was driven over it.Arnaud Desplechin's movies are as far away from everything that is produced by or imitated from Hollywood as they can be. They are symphonies of style where the rhythm seems to tell the different interwoven stories rather than they are connected by an inner succession. This film consists practically exclusively of a superallstar cast of the most famous still living French actors. A true highlight.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Christmas Tale has been booked as an extremely unconventional holiday film from most major reviewers. This is a selling pointthe film is a true examination of the holidays that offers no traditional entry and exit. It's the direct contrast of Four Christmases and at least one reviewer pondered If only American Christmas films could be like this one... Certainly A Christmas Tale is unconventional using Wes Andersonlike bookmark introductions as an omniscient narrator dictates the various children's upbringing. Scenes suddenly cut off in the middle or change. Things are never really explained. Two characters have a major feud between them but the origins are never quite described.This lack of knowledge and unpredictability gives A Christmas Tale an almost luminous ambiance. The film doesn't really move forward so much as float. Characters selfconsciously talk about their own trappings in a theatrical way or muse about an event the audience was never privy too. It feels like the viewer is spying on this family not in a Hitchcockian sense but more as a privileged member. And although all of these distinctive attributes distinguish the film from more generic fare it doesn't honestly add much. There is little emotional investment in the characters or their struggles even though so much of the film depends on a sympathetic audience. The happy moments or the sad ones seem to do little to really effect anyone because such little is known about these people. The film feels airy and faint but it only lessens the impact.One wonders why this approach was chosen. Perhaps to get the audience to feel instead of think. It doesn't seem like A Christmas Tale really wants to offer something different as primed by others. Instead the filmmakers simply want to tell a story that transports the audience to France. They want the viewer to invest in these characters struggles and feel for them. But the film is loaded with such sudden and copious amounts of joy and the usual suspects a scruffy but loving husband a stern but fair mother the black sheep who doesn't understand the loving husband who doesn't complain the adolescent child who is trying to find his place... the list goes on. But what's the significance? Where's the punch? What's the so what?It's difficult to recommend this film even though the rating may not seem terrible. Worth watching is difficult to categorize in this place because the film feels like a continuation of this director's style but I know very little about his prior works. Check it out but don't expect much and you may be pleasantly surprised.".

Absolutely neurotic daughter who made her family banish her brother but never seems to wonder if maybe she messed up her own son's education. Obnoxious banned brother who enjoys to be able to save her mother to regain power over his sister and his mother. Obnoxious but so relevant sometimes. The youngest one and the cousin are less mental it's true. Except for the fact that younger they decided between them and the obnoxious brother who should have the girl who would become the youngest one's wife. And the father who just does nothing but watching his family fighting without reacting. I am really not sure we could find a family so dysfunctioning. There is obviously real worse families but they just fall apart and don't stick together. This one is actually functioning by dysfunctioning. Anyway all this obnoxiousness is jubilation material if you enjoy irreverence and boldness. And is played by a wonderful Catherine Deneuve and a never disappointing except in James Bond Mathieu Amalric. Emmanuelle Devos makes a short apparition which is of her usual talent too.

But time goes on a third son Ivan Poupaud is born and now they are all grownups then the matriarch Junon Denueve discovers that she suffers from the same disease the only compatible donors are Henri and Elizabeth's son Paul Berling hence this Christmas a family reunion is endowed with a more grave determinant especially for the black sheep in the family Henri after a 6year banishment due to an unspecified riff with Elizabeth his return with his new Jewish girlfriend Faunia Devos will undoubtedly thrust the tension with Elizabeth's family and have an impact on Junon's final resolve to her impending treatment.Screen time is almost equally allotted to the allstar cast with their own stories intermingle in a short span of the timeline although the main stream focuses on Henri and Junon's reconciliation but it is not a beatific movie to bury the hatchet and embrace a pristine future every family has its distinctive script written with plenitude of relatable interactions notably the mutual attraction between Ivan's wife Sylvia played by Chiara Mastroianni Denueve's real life daughter with Marcello Mastroianni and Ivan's cousin Simon Capelluto clicks wonderfully in the latter part of the film it is very French as well for moralistic puritans and prudes it is a sheer crevice in their convictions which will prompt harsh opprobrium. One trait of superfluity is the chunk of monologues colloquies with staccato coherence loose ends are all over the place we can never decipher the real motivations and reasons behind certain behaviors which adhere to a particular terrain of mores also the peephole shots introduces each chapter gives the film a stage structure and the occasional talktothecamera shtick often comes out of nowhere they may variegate the viewers' recipiency but are inconsistent in the plot development and engender some distractions hinder the appreciation. Amalric and Mastroianni are my pick among the ensemble he is a true thespian with utter devotion while she bears her father's resemblance and an arresting existence whenever she is on screen. Devos is enjoyable as an unobtrusive intruder reminds me to watch an Angela Basset film Denueve is as distant as always graceful but stereotyped Poupaud is too damn good looking for his shyness and benevolence and Consigny is perpetually frowned and distressed enclosed in her own little world one might feel too depressed to invest in her. In conclusion it is not your average Christmas flick but a less chic showpiece about kindred liaisons than Assayas' SUMMER HOURS 2008 810.".

The penultimate scene is as dark as any I have seen in all of cinema.The writing and directing is tight and intelligent even by today's standards.  In several instances Sjostrom skillfully sets the audience up to suspect one thing and then pulls out a surprise.

Also when the present soulcollector arrives with his horse and carriage is a beautiful but also a scary scene. David Holm recognizes this soulcollector as a drinkingfriend from earlier life.  It is now his turn to take over. Just like Scrooge in Dickens story A christmas tale David is shown what his life and doings has led to for the people around him.The film is about the danger of abusing drugs in this case alcohol.

	schema:headline " They say this carriage is no ordinary cart . . . What a colossal understatement!";
	schema:reviewBody "Victor Sjstrm's Krkarlen plunges the viewer into life's lower depths for much of its running time with grim scenes of alcoholic degradation family violence and suicidal despair but the most memorable passages involve the mythic image of Death itself. Here Death is embodied as a ghostly horsedrawn carriage driven by a miserable sinner who was the last person to die on the previous New Year's Eve. For one year the wretch must collect the souls of the newly departed and after twelve months of this horrible servitude the driver's own soul is finally released when the last person to die on December 31st becomes the new driver.The scenes involving this carriage the film was known as The Phantom Carriage or The Phantom Chariot in Englishspeaking countries are eerie and mesmerizing utilizing doubleexposure cinematography that was quite sophisticated for its time and still effective when seen today. Most strikingly the carriage travels to the floor of the ocean to collect the soul of a person who drowned. As fascinating as these scenes are however the bulk of the film is concerned with the downward spiral of David Holm played by the director himself in an understated portrayal of a man who has given up on the possibility of living a decent life. In flashbacks we see Holm enjoying a pleasant day at the beach with his wife children and brother and he appears to be a perfectly ordinary guy. Abruptly without segue or explanation we then see Holm as an alcoholic wreck in trouble with the law and alienated from his family. Ordinarily this leap from Before to After might feel like a storytelling deficiency but in this case the filmmakers trust us to fill in the familiar sordid details on our own. It's suggested that Holm has been led astray by his convivial friend Georges the drinking companion who first relates the tale of the Phantom Carriage but whatever the cause of his downfall Holm appears to be a lost cause a meanspirited drunk who takes perverse pleasure in inflicting pain on his family and in refusing to reform.While David Holm is our central figure the story's true catalyst is a young Salvation Army nurse who takes a sympathetic interest in his case and doggedly believes in him despite his hateful behavior. When the nurse herself is dying indirectly due to her ministrations on Holm's behalf she demands to see him and thus inadvertently sets in motion a chain of events that will result in his recovery.At times this film resembles Dickens' tale of Scrooge in its use of ghostly visitors who inspire a flawed man to take stock of his life suffer over his misbehavior and reform. I was also reminded of Sjstrm's 1917 drama Terje Vigen in which a man returns from jail to find his house empty and his family gone a sequence echoed here. The director reiterates a standard theme of Scandinavian folklore found earlier in his BergEjvind och hans hustru a.k.a. The Outlaw and His Wife 1918 that no man can outrun his fate. This time however it could be argued that David Holm actually succeeds in evading his seemingly inevitable fate for he's given an unexpected second chance to make amends.Viewers expecting a a supernatural tale will appreciate the sequences featuring the Phantom Carriage of the title but may not be prepared for this film's painful examination of a troubled man's alcoholic downfall. But those with a taste for intense and powerful silent drama will appreciate Krkarlen in its entirety. It stands with the best serious cinema of its era and is certainly one of Sjstrm's most accomplished works.".

	schema:reviewBody "Victor Sjostrom's silent film masterpiece The Phantom Carriage has recently been released on DVD with a new soundtrack recorded by KTL. The duo comprising American guitarist Stephen O'Malley and Austrian laptop artist Peter Rehberg has conjured an extraordinary collection of sounds to accompany and accentuate the original film footage from 1921. An ominous banging sound introduces each Act and a medley of drones guitar chords and feedback ebbs and flows as the grim drama unfolds.As impressive as the new soundtrack is the film remains the real star with its timeless rendering of a dark and dystopian fairy tale. According to this tale the last person to die before the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve is condemned to spend a year behind the reins of the eponymous phantom carriage collecting the souls of the dead. This is the fate of the antihero of the film David Holm who is moved to painful scrutiny of his life following his untimely death and subsequent encounter with the driver of the carriage.This film is often referred to as a horror film and although this is a fitting label the real horror here resides not in the supernatural elements but rather in the depiction of human suffering at the hands of others. Sjostrom gives a remarkable performance as the drunken spiteful and menacing Holm in life and the wretched frightened Holm looking back from the land of the dead and shrinking from his past deeds.Striking imagery abounds throughout The Phantom Carriage and more than compensates for the inevitably limited dialogue. The illomened onset of midnight is powerfully illustrated through the image of a clockface hovering alone in the darkening night sky like a second moon. Equally impressively the dead are depicted through pioneering semitransparent imagery and the scenes of the phantom carriage riding over land and sea remain chilling to watch.Sjostrom's film deserves its place as one of the most esteemed silent films of all time and the new soundtrack by KTL is a superb accentuation of its themes. This is a mustsee.".

However it appears that Victor Sjoestrom's masterpiece based on the 1912 novel THY SOUL SHALL BEAR WITNESS by the Noble Prize winner Selma Lagerlof finds its most profound gist in that. THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE made almost 90 years ago is a milestone in Swedish cinema and a notable film that has overwhelmed eminent people of the 20th century including Ingmar Bergman. But I usually ask myself a question especially before the meditative time of November what is it that makes such films stand out as masterpieces. Is it the direction the cinematography special effects narrative structure or perhaps something less common in an ordinary discussion...? Having watched the restored version with its newly commissioned soundtrack by KTL I had a feeling that I was watching something unique. Of course I had heard before how significant it was for the cinema but that did not play a decisive role in my experience. I was mesmerized whilst my own subjective viewing and found this silent pearl captivating. Yes Sjostrom's film touched me tremendously with its innovative structure of flashbacks although there are flashbacks within flashbacks I did not get confused with its powerful cinematography by Julius Jaenzon with its flawless direction by the master of Swedish cinema who plays the lead as well. The images that are in this film are really hard to forget hard to skip. The viewer is as if taken to its world experiences what the characters get through absorbs oneself to a great extend with what one sees in this silent masterpiece. Everything seems to be balanced and crafted so well including the movements of the camera the extensive use of special effects double exposures in the visualization of the ghost characters who walk in three dimensions the tension and the performances of the great Swedish cast of the time.It is truly hard to skip the mesmerizing symbolic even ICONIC moments of the movie when the driver of the 'strict master' Death arrives at various spots including the sea intense visual experience the room of a rich suicide the streets as well as the graveyard where David Victor Sjostrom is to substitute his pal Georges Tore Svennberg on that memorable New Year's Eve. The visual feast finds its climax at the moment when David having visited the dying Edit Astrid Holm the member of the Fralsningsarmen Salvation Army arrives finally at his home and sees the drama of his wife and children the drama caused by his monsterlike behavior. The visual moment worth high consideration is when David comes back to his home obscene and drunk is closed in the kitchen by his wife who is afraid of tuberculosis infection and he brutally takes the axe and breaks through the door. The whole drama becomes visually and mentally so powerful that tears are running on the cheeks of a more delicate viewer. However the greatest maturity of the film is its content so vividly derived from Selma Lagerlof's novel and so creatively executed in this picture...There is everything that human heart can experience love disappointment courage sympathy fear bad influence fights suffering loneliness sorrow wretchedness despair but finally the glory of reconciliation and tears of joy. There are truly different psychological dimensions or more to say mental journeys that the director with the masterful power of the source novel invites us to experience. There are elements of gloom the elements of intensive mysticism there is a redeeming power of prayer for other people the plot of Edit and the gist of penance. While the film seems to touch the very heart of Christianity at certain moments it also appears to evoke thought provoking feelings about what in fact is the most important value in life.The bitter experience of the leading character makes us shocked at first but...in time indifferent to his feelings. He becomes a villain in our eyes. Although the character of Georges proves to us the consequences of bad influence we don't see David as a victim sort of but as a single human being responsible for himself. We as viewers at certain moment stop feeling empathy with the character but rather concentrate on other people good people and cry with them. But at the right moment we seem to realize his plea to God his fruitful tears of penance we seem to forgive him as his wife Hilga Borgstrom does forgive him. The human heart appears to shout out from its depths Genuine redemptive tears! What a drama! What a psychological feast! What a movie that evokes such feelings! That is the profoundity of THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE and though that aspect may be considered difficult to capture for some viewers I think it is an absolute necessity while analyzing this film. Although the movie has become a source of inspiration for many eminent people of cinema I think that not all of them understood its gist in the right manner. Enthusiastically speaking it is another silent film that proves the masterful nature of the early cinema and a film that may be seen from different angles. Nevertheless there is also a danger that we condense its meaning to a sheer scary movie and look through the terrifying moments ignoring the rest. That would be nothing but an unforgivable conjecture. THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE is a story of a joyful gift of another chance to become mature a redemptive chance. Masterpiece 1010".

	schema:headline " The soul's long hard journey into night and the mechanisms that produce god";
	schema:reviewBody "Had I known this was going to turn out as deeply awesome as it did I would have perhaps saved it for a time of need. I'm always looking for spiritual visions that permit a journey inwards but they are so few in the grand scheme that I'm grateful for each and every one. I try to cherish them because they let me watch from the heart. It's why I keep myself from finishing off the rest of Tarkovsky's films  I want to know that there's always a drink of fresh water at hand when I'm parching.I came to this like most people I presume for its reputation as a horror film where the reaper gets out to harvest souls. I collect these as well but for different reasons and was expecting here something more or less expressionist. As with most silents however it's not really horror by our contemporary sense horror in these films comes from more directly abstract notions guilt humiliation spiritual damnation and it's usually with the intent to distill a life lesson. They may seem outdated now but only because we presume to know these things and so reckon that no further guidance is necessary  while we selfsufficient modern humans in perfect control of our destinies continue to live our lives in random iterations.Here death itself. The journey of the soul in the world inside the soul. Like earlier texts of this journey Dante's Inferno or the Egyptian Book of the Dead it is advisable imperative even that we read beyond the feverish vision of the beyond. That we read between the collective dream the author has dreamed up as meant to await us and contemplate on why we dreamed in the first place.The man who dies last on New Year's Eve  at the cusp of new life and so at the start of a new cosmic round  becomes Death's driver for the coming year this is the premise. He ferries the vehicle  and us as passengers  where the journey inwards or across can begin. Our man contemplates the chain of events that brought him lying dead before the carriage of death.The opening chapters in the Book of the Dead that propel the process of rebirth and which pertain very much here are thus named The chapter of making Osiris S. possess a memory in the Underworld and next the chapter of giving Osiris S. a heart in the Underworld.The man remembers he had a perfectly good life and family but blew it up like so many we know of. He goes into prison and comes out reborn again with realization of what his deeds brought him. But he has to start again like every new life he has to build his again from nothing. Instead he drags himself through this next life in a limbo of guilt and seething hatred. It is this unswathing of the spirit across different worlds that matters and the dissolution in each one granting passage in the next. How strong karmas resonate from one existence to the other powering the cart. Death's driver is granting the visions after all.There is a woman in all of this a nurse for the Salvation Army. From her end she is looking to hear from god. We see from both ends her trying to save who she considers a mandate from god and on the other side the man who is wrestling personal demons. If god doesn't speak through him then he never spoke at all. In a beautiful scene she spends the night mending his torn soul when he wakes up furious at the kindness he tears it up again for spite.More great cinema about the karmas metaphysically weaving together the participants having failed to mend him the woman literally contracts his illness. And when the man violently attacks with an axe a locked door his wife on the other side falls to die.The man finally wakes up from death though having prayed and thus lay himself prostrate before a higher force. This is likely a part that modern viewers will find hard to swallow. But this is the thing it is not literal death in these texts never was. The underworld the soul must travel through to be reborn on the other side is always inside why it's so often called a 'descent' and so the power to make a full transit by learning again lifevalue through the different levels always rests with the soul. What the man learns at the moment of prayer is the humility that shatters ego. Of course he is forgiven. One of the final chapters in that ancient Egyptian text reads chapter of causing a man to come back upon his house on earth. Notice that the dead man is no longer symbolically referred and so protected by the name of the god Osiris having passed the horrible tribulations now the deity is embodied inside.So god does speak after all through this man but it speaks to her who was looking to apprehend him and so no doubt will hear his voice in the miracle. From our perspective seeing deeper into these lives our perspective itself dislocated from bodies and wandering with the spirits we know there was no god the miraculous transformation on the visible level was only the last step in a painful arduous process of healing the heart. It's a powerful notion worth two or three Seals Bergman.So it's really only us who can mend ourselves. It's a lesson make no mistake but a lesson worth keeping. Simply said it sounds trite  most anything does if the words are not right. The man was told after all no doubt he understood in some capacity but it meant nothing. Which is why it's important to journey from the heart.Something to meditate upon.".

The film was made when movies were very young but as with many of those pictures by Lang Murnau Wiene and even Stiller they remain very modern both in language and story. In those days the best movies were made in Europe Griffith seems ridiculous compared to this.The film was made in heaven by a true genius Victor Sjstrm.

He not only directed the movie he played one of the main characters and built the backgrounds when needed.

Both are masterpieces and if you see these movies you will recognize Sjstrms mark. Some say he left Hollywood disappointed after having seen Stiller been treated bad by Hollywood's industry. Legend or not he did leave.Ingmar Bergman gave Sjstrm a tender and loving exit part a beautiful homage in his legendary Wild Strawberries from 1957. Sjstrm played old professor of medicine Isaac Borg traveling through Sweden and at the same time through the memories of his life.

We don't yet know who David Holm is or why this nurse wishes to see him but her only dying wish is to speak with him just one more time. On the other side of the town nestled comfortably amongst the gravestones of the local cemetery Holm Victor Sjstrm who also directed and two of his drunken associates merrily await the coming of the New Year.

The story is told in 'A Christmas Carol' kind of way in which the death himself confronts the deceased with his past present and what could have been. It's of course a story that concentrates on morals and it does this very well. The message comes across as very powerful and effective. This is of course also definitely due to the effective directing from the father of Swedish cinema Victor Sjstrm.The story is based on the novel by other Swedish author Selma Lagerlf. The story is adapted by Victor Sjstrm himself who perhaps should had taken out a few more elements to let the story and movie flow better. It perhaps takes a bit too long before the movie starts to take form and the story gets clear but when the movie does take form and pace it becomes a really wonderful one.The movie does not only have a great story it also is a good looking one. The movie uses some early and effective effects and uses some different color filters to create the right mood and to indicate what it past present and 'future'.Sjstrm did not only wrote and directed this movie he also plays the main character. Of course the acting in the movie is overthetop at times by todays standards but not as bad as in for instance early German movies was the case. And after all this movie is more about its story and morals than it is about the acting so it really doesn't matter much or distracts.A really great and effective underrated silentmovie classic from Sweden.910httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

From its iconography of the grim reaper it's Christmas Carolesque tale of repentance to echoes of Jack Nicholson chopping down the door in The Shining. If The Phantom Carriage is known for anything it's for being Ingmar Bergman's source of inspiration for what his films would later muse upon. He would later recruit director and star Victor Sjostrom to lead on of his most acclaimed films Wild Strawberries. Of course we already know how profound these concepts are nearly 100 years later and their importance is still imbedded in the film. It's fascinating to watch inventive techniques of translucence portrayed on screen too though admittedly the prior year's Caligari is more impressive. Its real problem is undisciplined structure and its resulting poor pacing but these are archaic issues of silent cinema that required a few years of trial and error. Nevertheless the atmosphere is palpable the ideas are timeless and it oozes with passion from Sjostrom if not as nightmare worthy as the next year's Nosferatu.810".

	schema:reviewBody "Krkarlen 1921 a classic film with cult status amongst the silent movies directed by Victor Sjstrm who also plays the male main role is based on a story by Swedish novelist Selma Lagerlf. The film tells the story of brutal drinker David Holm who beats up his wife neglects his children seduces his brother to drinking and is blind for the love of nurse Edit Astrid Holm. David sits toward the end of the year together with his boozing buddies in the citypark and tells the story of the Phantom Chariot Krkarlen Who dies in the New Year's Eve night as the last one before dawn has to serve one year long as driver of Death and release the dying souls from their bodies. But David gets into a fight with his buddies suffers a hemorrhage and sinks dead on the soil. Meanwhile the Phantom Carriage is approaching. The driver is nobody else than David's late friend Georges who seduced him into alcohol and died one year before. Since David refuses to get on the carriage Georges forces him. Together they drive to the stations where people live who suffered from David. They visit the nurse Edit whose love to David he was unable to recognize and whom he infected with tuberculosis so that she is dying now. But her unconditioned love to David will save his soul. Fulfilled with her spirit they get to David's wife and children. David is able to prevent his wife from killing herself and her children because she does not see a way out of the misery in which David has thrown her. They also visit David's brother who has committed a murder after having been seduced into drinking by David. David asks Georges to go back into his body because he finally sees that his way was wrong. Since it was Georges who had seduced him once into drinking David's wish is granted he gets a second chance and Georges has to be one more year the driver of the Phantom Carriage in order to pay for his own sins. This movie belongs probably to the strongest and most impressive films ever made. Deplorably it is still not available on international DVD.".

Plus the special effect of the Phantom Carriage is pretty convincing and technically speaking this is a wellcrafted film. On the other hand it's an amazingly dated and preachy filmmore like something you'd expect to be shown in Sunday School instead of in an honest to goodness theater. Plus some of the story elements just don't make sense. Instead of coming off as dedicated or good the dying Salvation Army worker seems like a sapa very sad and confusing sap. Why is she in love with this man? Am I missing something?So my recommendation is that if you are insanely in love with silents like me then by all means watch it.

	schema:reviewBody "The Phantom Carriage known as Krkarlen or The Wagoner in Sweden opens with a young woman dying in a convent on New Year's Eve in remote Sweden. Meanwhile David Holm the man she repeatedly asks to be sent to her bedside is getting drunk in a cemetery he dies that evening and is plunged into an odyssey in which he is taken by a phantom carriage. The carriage is driven by his former friend who was in accordance with folkore forced to drive the grim reaper's carriage for the entire year due to having been the last person on earth to die before the dawn of the new year.Though lauded by most all who have seen it The Phantom Carriage is surprisingly lessknown than one may think it would be especially considering it was the film that influenced Ingmar Bergman to become a filmmaker. In Sweden it is deservedly heralded as a national classic. It is a seasonal film in that it takes place on the New Year's Eve holiday a pivotal theme for the film. In many ways it operates as something of a macabre relative to Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol possessing similar levels of rumination on death despair and the human condition. It is a considerably darker story however and has more in common with the horror and fantasy genres than A Christmas Carol.A great deal of the praise for the film has centered on its cinematography which is absolutely deserved. It's beautifully photographed from the sepiatoned interior scenes to the icy blue outdoor sequences the chilly Swedish countryside is captured hauntingly and the shifting colors indicating the multiple time frames is effective. The special effects though simplistic have also been a major point of interest as it is one of the earliest films to feature such sophisticated use of doubleexposure that is still impressive and visually compelling to this day. Visual elements aside the film is also just narratively sophisticated and weaves an intricate and thematically rich plot in spite of its silent format.Overall The Phantom Carriage is one of silent cinema's greats. It's visually stunning and loaded with compelling and haunting images but it's also sophisticated merely in terms of storytelling. A great somewhat more sinister pairing with A Christmas Carol fitting for a cold night in late December. 1010.".

The film is heavy on the melodrama but in its story of human relationships and depiction of the human condition it hasn't really aged all that much. Still the slim narrative comes second to the extraordinarily spooky visuals as this is a film all about the cinematography. Creepy tinting bombastic music and above all the wonderful double exposure effects of the ghostly carriage and its occupants are what you take away from this and they're wonderfully spooky in the best Halloween tradition.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's easy to see where the great Swedish director Ingamar Bergman got his sense of humor in this film that informs in many ways his future work. Bergman was more than clear about Victor Seastrom's influence and The Phantom Carriage illustrates this with its stark death and redemption theme from the outset. On New Year's Eve Edit an urban missionary worker lies dying from consumption. She makes a request to see a notorious drunkard David Holm  Seastrom  one more time but he refuses to honor her request. He opts instead to remain with his drunken pals and tell the story of The Phantom Carriage that impresses the last person to die in the year to go around to pick up the dead. When Holm rebuffs the entreaty of Edit's coworker his bottle buddies beat him to death and much to his grief he gets the job of the collector's assistant.The Phantom Carriage is one dark Christmas Carol. Filled with vices and virtue to the extreme it is a relentless treatise on pain suffering and salvation with Seastrom's brutish unrepentant Holm blinded by drink and cynicism stewing in his own juices most of the way . Director Seastrom lays the dissipation on with a thick humorless brush with no let up and the gloom of this cautionary tale becomes monstrously oppressive and with it comes a repetitive monotony. The impact on such Bergman's classics as The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries Sjostom actually played the lead is more than evident throughout but so is the overwhelming stoicism that slows The Phantom Carriage to a crawl much of the time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Not many people watch the old silent films these days but for those that actually take the time to do so sometimes I think those people carry a 'respect for the elderly' approach when assessing them. In other words they give the film a certain degree of deference simply because the film is old. After watching The Phantom Carriage and seeing its lofty rating currently 8.110 I think that is likely the case here. Having said that going in I was fully prepared to like or more probably love The Phantom Carriage. I enjoy horror films in general and I have no qualms watching silentold films many are among my favorites. However the films have to 'work'  or more simply  make sense and this one just sadly does not. Spoilers followThe plot largely centers around a ne'erdowell David Holm and the Salvation Army worker Edit who tries to help and redeem him. However Edit shows an abnormal affection for and interest in David despite only meeting him once or twice. Now for one there is no viable explanation for why Edit the Salvation Army worker should care SO MUCH for the miserable David even to the point of proclaiming her love for this man that she knows literally nothing about other than he is a contemptible misanthrope of the highest order. Hardly the stuff for inspiring undying love. So there is a real problem with that plot element that is never satisfactorily resolved or explained. Second David's redemption comes about rather quickly after witnessing his general barbarity for a good 90 minutes. Time and again he is shown to be an unfeeling brute even to the point of carelessly endangering the lives of his own children. And then in a flash he is a new man. It's an incredibly quick turnaround for the cad that David was. Dickens handled this material much better in his A Christmas Carol a story that The Phantom Carriage borrows heavily from but never successfully duplicates.Other reviewers have mentioned the story structure itself is somewhat jumbled. I agree and it does not help the film. There are flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks and it becomes a bit of a chore to keep track of it. These flashbacks are not announced mind you you just have to sort of suddenly realize the scene you are watching is a flashback. This may have been different and revolutionary in 1921 so sure it can be acknowledged but does that mean it is worthy of fawning acclaim?The cinematography is superb for the time. The oftmentioned double exposures used for the phantom carriage scenes are certainly noteworthy and for that the film should be recognized as breaking new ground. But a classic or 'alltime great?' It is most certainly not. The issues outlined above keep it from attaining such a status. And although there were some inspired shots in the film for really effective harrowing scenes one must look no further than the next year's 'Nosferatu'  the vampire in that film truly was a chilling sight to see and is easily more memorable than anything in 'The Phantom Carriage.' Or for just an allaround great film from 1921 Chaplin's 'The Kid' is infinitely more entertaining. 'The Phantom Carriage' is plodding tedious and flawed by comparison.610. Sometimes a film is.....just a film and not much more. There's a reason why The Kid has 80k votes and The Phantom Carriage has only 7k. One is a masterpiece and one is not. You guess which is which.".

Dr. Frail buys a cabin on the top of a hill and he sees the smalltime thief Rune wounded and chased by a mob that wants to hang him. Dr. Frail helps and heals Rune but in return he demands that the young man becomes his bond servant. The alcoholic healer and preacher George Grubb tells to the locals that Dr. Frail who is an excellent gambler and gunfighter is a devil and has a mysterious past but nobody gives attention to his words. Soon the stagecoach is robbed by thieves that kill the passengers but the coachman survives and three days later he reaches Skull Creek. He tells that the horses had speed down the hill with a young woman inside the stagecoach. The men organize a pursuit and the rude Frenchy Plante finds the Swedish Elizabeth Mahler burnt and blind.

	schema:reviewBody "Warner Bros. THE HANGING TREE 1959 is something of an unsung classic western. But over the years cultists have been drawn to it and it just gets better and better with each viewing! A sleeper of 1959 nobody thought it would turn out as good as it did. Based on a story by Dorothy Johnson it was fashioned into a splendid screenplay by Wendell Mayes and Halsted Welles. Gary Cooper headed a fine cast which consisted of Karl Malden the strikingly beautiful Maria Schell George C.Scott in his first picture and newcomer Ben Piazza resembling a young Victor Mature. Produced by Cooper's own company Baroda Productions named after the street where he was raised it was solidly directed by the ever underrated Delmer Daves and as usual with Daves' outdoor pictures richly photographed in Technicolor this time by ace cinematographer Ted McCord Treasure Of The Sierra MadreJohnny Belinda. The lavish Art Direction by Daniel B.Cathcart was superb with a whole mining town built on locations near Yakima Washington which would double for the mining fields of 1880's Montana.The story revolves around Dr. Joe Frail Cooper who arrives in the rough mining town of Skull Creek to set up practice. Since the area is bereft of any sort of law enforcement the only deterrent to lawbreakers is symbolised at the town's entrance by the presence of a great ugly and ghostly looking tree complete with a hanging noose Every new mining camp's got to have its hanging tree  makes folks feel respectable a new entrant declares. The enigmatic doctor is a man with a hidden past! Stories abound about him years before setting fire to a house with a man and a woman inside The woman was my wife and the man was my brother  and I have no right to forget. But in Skull Creek things are not working out so good for him in the new life he is attempting to carve out for himself. Firstly he falls in love with a beautiful Swiss immigrant Elizabeth Mahler Schell when she becomes his patient after being temporarily blinded by the sun. Then he falls foul of an unscrupulous and licentious town wastrel Karl Malden giving an excellent performance. The picture ends with an exciting but bloody shootout and Frail being frogmarched by the townspeople to the hanging tree just before Elizabeth arrives and offers the mob her newly acquired riches of gold and even her goldmine to stop the lynching. Know what? She wants to buy her man! If she wants him that bad let her have him.Adding immeasurably to the picture is Max Steiner's extraordinary score! It boasts a wonderful central theme for Doc Frail! Heard in different guises throughout the film it becomes a ravishing love theme and is touchingly rendered in the scene where Frail removes the bandages from the eyes of the blinded Elizabeth. Later when she stands on a cliff edge and opens her eyes regaining her sight for the first time Steiner's arresting theme makes it a remarkable sparkling moment! The great composer also provided some exciting action cues such as those for the townspeople pursuing a sluice robber and also for a stagecoach holdup. A song by Mack David and Jerry Livingstone was sung over the opening and closing credits by Marty Robbins and was nominated for an Oscar. Steiner cleverly interpolated the song into his score and is heard to best effect in the final scene when Frail is being dragged to the infamous hanging tree.THE HANGING TREE is a splendid drama in an unusual and atmospheric western setting. Eclipsing his Will Kane in High Noon Cooper gives one of his very best and most likable performances in what would be his final appearance in a western. A genre he made all his own! It would also be his third last film!A FINAL AFTERTHOUGHT  IS THERE ANY ONE OUT THERE THAT MIGHT KNOW THE REASON WHY WARNER HOME VIDEO HAVE NOT RELEASED THIS FINE MOVIE ON DVD??".

	schema:reviewBody "Little known this Western gem has not attracted the attention or appreciation it deserves. Gary Cooper's Doc Frail is to me the most interesting of his Western heroes much more complex than the Will Kane of High Noon. He is a man of sharp contrast kind but domineering compassionate but unyielding a healer but a killer strong but at the same time frail. He draws people towards him only to keep them at a distance when they get too close because of a tragic incident in his past one he can neither forget nor allow to ever happen again. He is a vagabond moving from gold camp to gold camp to set up his services as a doctor without hope of ever settling down. Into his life come two key figures bound to change it. One is Rune a young thief whom he rescues from the hanging tree and they are bonded together. The other is Elizabeth a young woman from Switzerland who has come with her father to find a new life in the gold camps. After a stagecoach accident Doc Frail must cure her both body and spirit and she loves him for it a love he cannot accept. He would send her back to her country she stubbornly refuses and eventually partners in a gold claim with Frenchy played by the marvelous Karl Malden a man with lust in his heart for both gold and women. The emphasis on character lifts this film above the realm of the ordinary. Add to that a memorable title song sung by Marty Robbins an appealing music score by Max Steiner a nononsense script based on a story by Dorothy Johnson and on location filming in the mountains outside of Yakima Washington and what you have is one really fine Western.".

It stars Gary Cooper Maria Schell Karl Malden Ben Piazza and George C. Scott. A Technicolor production film was shot on location at the Oak Creek Wildlife Area Yakima Washington with Ted D. McCord on cinematography duties and Max Steiner scores the music.The Gold Trail Montana 1878. Joseph Frail Cooper Doctor Gambler and Gunslinger arrives in the Gold mining town of Skull Creek looking to settle down and make a living. However his past haunts him and after medically aiding Rune Piazza and Elizabeth Mahler Schell subsequently changing their lives Frail finds this town and its people are less than enamoured with his presence.Slow but compelling The Hanging Tree has a unique feel to it on account of its interesting location setting the Gold Rush backdrop and the multi stranded characters that form the story. Not given much support at the box office on its release it's a film that has gained a cult following over the years and it's now often referred to as an intelligent Western. The performances are smart from a very good cast and the story manages to steer away from conventional Western movie pitfalls. But what marks it out as a must see for Western fans is the work of Daves and Malden who stepped in while the director was hospitalised with ulcers where the expansive scenery is utilised for both authentic impact on the narrative and also for the emotional conditioning of the characters.Personally I think it falls some way short of the great intelligent and psychological Westerns crafted by Boetticher and Mann. Yes there are complexities to the characters but the script doesn't quite dig deep enough into them which is particularly galling as regards Cooper's portrayal of Frail an appropriate name given Coop's ailing health at the time. It's credit to Cooper that he still manages to bring the viewer into his pained world helping to make the impact of the finale far better than it had any right to be if taken as written on the page. But it still rounds out as a thoroughly absorbing picture one that's beautifully shot and scored with gusto by Steiner. Lovely hummable title song from Marty Robbins as well. 710".

Others commenters here have already summarized the story well and this is one of the very best and detailmemorable of the western genre esp. when one discounts the epic westerns and certainly one of Cooper's best. Costar Karl Malden is excellent as always and this is the time I recall noticing George C. Scott on film in a small but scenery chewing role. I've not seen this film in at least 1015 years sad to say but I hope to again. MAKE A DVD OF THIS FILM!!!".

Others commenters here have already summarized the story well and this is one of the very best and detailmemorable of the western genre esp. when one discounts the epic westerns and certainly one of Cooper's best. Costar Karl Malden is excellent as always and this is the time I recall noticing George C. Scott on film in a small but scenery chewing role. I've not seen this film in at least 1015 years sad to say but I hope to again. MAKE A DVD OF THIS FILM!!!";

The jealousy and anger of people waiting and wanting to take Doc's life for his past and mostly the fortune. Frenchy Plante is played by Karl Malden. He is a fortune hunter with a drinking problem. Karl was one of two directors who made this film. Delmar Daves was in charge of the beginning and middle. Karl did the finishing work. By that time Mulden had 20 movies under his belt.George C. Scott is Dr. George Grubb a Bible toting Scripture spouting fiend. He is not a particularly nice person. He targets Doc Frail and goes after him. This is Scott's first credited role and he carries it off very well.Jerry Livingston does the title theme. The Hanging Tree. It was sung in the movie by one of my favorites Marty Robbins. He also made it popular to the public through radio and records. Now I have a CD of The Best of Marty Robbins that I have introduced to my grandson. I want him and our other grandkids to know about something besides today's music.Just for some aside information The only cast member of this movie still living is Karl Malden. He turned 94 in March of 2006. Wow what a life he's had!".

	schema:reviewBody "In 1873 in the Gold Trail Montana the mysterious and controller Dr. Joseph Frail Gary Cooper arrives in the small town of Skull Creek with miners in a gold rush. Dr. Frail buys a cabin on the top of a hill and he sees the smalltime thief Rune Ben Piazza wounded and chased by a mob that wants to hang him. Dr. Frail helps and heals Rune but in return he demands that the young man becomes his bond servant. The alcoholic healer and preacher George Grubb George C. Scott tells to the locals that Dr. Frail who is an excellent gambler and gunfighter is a devil but nobody gives attention to his words.Sooner the stagecoach is robbed by thieves that kill the passengers but the coachman survives and three days later he reaches Skull Creek. He tells that the horses had speed down the hill with a young woman inside the stagecoach. The men organize a pursuit and the rude Frenchy Plante Karl Malden finds the Swedish Elizabeth Mahler Maria Schell burnt and blind. Dr. Frail and Rune take care of her and they learn that Elizabeth and her father who was killed in the heist had come to America to settle down.When Elizabeth is healed she falls in an unrequited love with Dr. Frail and she decides to stay in Skull Creek to seek gold with Rune. They form a partnership with Frenchy and Dr. Frail secretly helps them to begin their business with The Lucky Lady Mine. When Elizabeth learns that Dr. Frail is helping her she is disappointed but she promises to pay her debt with him someday. During a heavy rain a tree falls down and the trio of partners finds a fortune in gold underground. Frenchy drinks with the locals and when he is drunk he takes an attitude that will affect the lives of the locals and Skull Creek mostly of Dr. Frail Elizabeth and Rune.The Hanging Tree is an unconventional and great western with a dramatic story supported by complex characters in a small town in the gold rush and not in shootout and other usual themes in this type of film. The lead characters are intriguing with Gary Cooper performing a bitter character with a hidden past but also a good and fair man. Rune is also a good man that had robbed only due to his needy situation. Maria Schell performs a sweet and welleducated woman capable to greet everybody and also tough in a negotiation. Karl Malden is fantastic as usual and the scum Frenchy Plante is one of the most despicable characters I have ever seen. Virginia Gregg has a minor but effective performance and her character Edna Flaunce is an example of how sickening and nauseating a human being can be.This is the first time that I see this film recently released on DVD by a small Brazilian distributor and it was a magnificent surprise for me since I am not a fan of the conventional Western genre. My vote is eight.Title Brazil A rvore dos Enforcados The Hanging Tree".

	schema:reviewBody "Unless one wants to count They Came To Cordura as a western which also came out in 1959 The Hanging Tree was Gary Cooper's farewell to the western genre which he did so much to popularize. Although in his career Cooper played a variety of roles he is probably most identified with the western. Certainly that second Oscar for High Noon cemented that identity.Cooper is a doctorgunfightergambler a rather interesting combination of professions. But he needs all of them to survive in the gold mining camp where he's set up practice. It's a temporary home for the camp is a temporary town. Unless a mother lode is found when the stream is panned out the miners move on. The miners are an interesting lot the usual men with needs the usual women who satisfy them for a price and some married folk with some puritan like wives. Oh and there's a crazy religious fanatic walking around played by George C. Scott.Cooper gets a pair of interesting patients who he takes more than a proprietary interest in. One is a young man who was shot robbing a sluice box played by Ben Piazza. Cooper patches him up and will not reveal who he is to the camp if he acts as servant to him. If The Hanging Tree had been made a decade later one of those services no doubt would have been sex.The threat is real for Piazza with no law of any kind the miners make their own law and enforce it with liberal use of an old gnarled oak called The Hanging Tree. One apparently is mandatory these camps. These guys aren't the Paint Your Wagon type miners.Karl Malden does an excellent job playing one of those miners with some real needs. And he thinks he's got it made when he finds a sunburned and blind Maria Schell who survived a stagecoach holdup that killed her father. But she likes the strange and brooding doctor who saves her. She can't get close to Cooper however because of some things in his past.The Hanging Tree was the first time that George C. Scott and Karl Malden worked together. Eleven years later they would team up for Scott's career role in the title role of Patton. Both Scott and Ben Piazza made their American film debuts in The Hanging Tree.Karl Swenson and Virginia Gregg run the local mercantile. Swenson is one of the few in the town who befriends Cooper but Gregg is the self appointed leader of the town morals committee. If Maria Schell wants to live in sin with Cooper she ought to be with the other working girls at the saloon.The Hanging Tree is photographed beautifully on location in Washington State serving as gold rush Montana of the 1870s. And the title song sung by Marty Robbins was Oscar nominated for Best Song but lost to High Hopes that year. Robbins had a hit record out of it as did Frankie Laine.Delmar Daves a most underrated director does a fine job with his cast and story. This is a must for Gary Cooper fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most comments  I'd say all posted so far  agree that this is a great movie. A classic western sometimes even beyond that.But they also ask why is it not so well remembered not a member of the usually quoted giants even without a DVD release.Maybe there are small reasons that can be ignored when you love the movie see its qualities and that's an easy task but for someone more cold these small imperfections can be a reason to vote for High Noon The Big Country Rio Bravo Cimmaron ...Yellow Ribbon Searchers or ...Liberty Valance.Doctor Frail. The secrets that main characters keep are very usual in westerns. So many mysterious gunfighters rode through screens. This can be solved either by revealing the secret or keeping it hidden till the end when the hero dies or more frequently rides away as a mysterious stranger he was from the start. But doctor Frail's secret is not so well hidden because several people know him and know at least something from his past  yet for some reason the authors decided to give us information a teaspoon every twenty minutes. And at the end it is not a complete secret anymore but we still have to imagine some pieces of the puzzle.Frenchy vs Frail. From the beginning we realize that Frenchy knew doctor Frail and has mixed feelings. He is very curious when he understands that some people can tell more about Frail  is it just curiosity for gossips or is it a kind of repulsion that some less educated people show towards the intellectuals why is he so arrogant as if he thinks he is better than us. We never get an answer what in fact Frenchy objects doctor Frail.Grubb. He is a preacher as so many others almost a clich in westerns and we can see they aren't extinct today as well. But there is something happening between Frail and Grubb they know each other from before and we can see that this is not only a faith vs science conflict also Grubb isn't only after the money that he could earn by his treatment if Frail hadn't appeared  this confrontation seems a lot deeper probably they both know more about each other than they  or the authors  are ready to tell us. But Grubb soon vanishes and reappears only at the end of the movie.End. Yes the drunk herd could be expected to change its mind when offered a goldmine but what about Grubb? He wasn't after gold he had personal conflict with Frail he managed to lead the whole village to hang Frail. Wouldn't at least he stay uncorrupted and full of rage and revenge trying to stop the others before finishing the task? Edna and Tom. Rather important characters but simply don't appear near the end in the situation where they could have done a lot. It reminds me on the movies where some of the actors died before the end of shooting so his role had to be removed from the rest of the movie. Especially we miss Tom after Edna's attacking Elizabeth in the store.These are not big flaws but maybe enough to bother people who like secrets completely revealed or completely unrevealed and plot led to a logical end. Happyend of course but this demand has been fulfilled. And all my objections are just attempt to find reasons why this otherwise great movie hasn't achieved a cult status. It has one in my heart though.".

We never get an answer what in fact Frenchy objects doctor Frail.Grubb. He is a preacher as so many others almost a clich in westerns and we can see they aren't extinct today as well. But there is something happening between Frail and Grubb they know each other from before and we can see that this is not only a faith vs science conflict also Grubb isn't only after the money that he could earn by his treatment if Frail hadn't appeared  this confrontation seems a lot deeper probably they both know more about each other than they  or the authors  are ready to tell us. But Grubb soon vanishes and reappears only at the end of the movie.End. Yes the drunk herd could be expected to change its mind when offered a goldmine but what about Grubb? He wasn't after gold he had personal conflict with Frail he managed to lead the whole village to hang Frail. Wouldn't at least he stay uncorrupted and full of rage and revenge trying to stop the others before finishing the task? Edna and Tom. Rather important characters but simply don't appear near the end in the situation where they could have done a lot. It reminds me on the movies where some of the actors died before the end of shooting so his role had to be removed from the rest of the movie. Especially we miss Tom after Edna's attacking Elizabeth in the store.These are not big flaws but maybe enough to bother people who like secrets completely revealed or completely unrevealed and plot led to a logical end. Happyend of course but this demand has been fulfilled. And all my objections are just attempt to find reasons why this otherwise great movie hasn't achieved a cult status. It has one in my heart though.";

	schema:reviewBody "Gary Cooper had starring roles in three more movies after The Hanging Tree but none showcasing his talents better than this western. While not given a producer's credit for the movie this movie was the first under Cooper's new production company Baroda. Just as with Along Came Jones the only movie Cooper officially produced The Hanging Tree has great talent in front of and behind the camera starting with the screenplay writers. The only person now alive who can tell how much of a production role Cooper had is Karl Malden whom IMDb identifies as an uncredited fillin director as well as costar.Whatever production role Cooper had this movie looks like it was a real tough location shoot filming on steep trails and having to create a mining camp set in an isolated national forest. This movie has one interesting distinction concerning the character of Society Red one of the miners. Possible Spoiler John Dierkes who played the part and formerly worked for the U.S. Treasury department has the last full line of dialog in the in the move Frenchy said it the mine was worth a million. Dierkes 6'6 and over 7' tall with the stovepipe hat he was wearing has the best lines in the movie at the very end. It is not often that a supporting actor gets to a chance to end a movie as Dierkes did this time.The Hanging Tree is a story about people who for whatever reason are on the edges of society and trying to make a go of it. The only things this movie needs as of this writing are a wide screen restoration and a DVD release in the United States.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Gold Trail Montana 1873. A tall man in black rides through a magnificent landscape and a wonderful mood sets in. In this film Cooper is a good doctor who helps a thief and a blinded girl. But he seems to carry a terrible burden that also makes him secretive and quick to use his physical power and burst into acts of violence. Gossip travels fast and makes people suspicious and easily judging which soon erupts to trouble. Karl Malden as a scoundrel gold miner and George C. Scott in his small but haunting film debut role as a fake religious healer try to make most of the tedious situation.This is an amazing western with the most handsome natural scenery I've seen in any western from the fifties. The people are almost constantly set against the sky mountains woods and rivers making the movie an incredibly beautiful watching experience. The powerful photography of the nature and the settlers among it should really be seen on a big screen but makes quite an impression on TV screen too. This landscape is the America people came to look for the place to hold and take advantage of but never fully won over. The doctor calls the town an anthill that wind can blow away and from his hut high on the hill above the town the people and the place are really seen like that. But what happens when a little success can lead to abuse and total madness? The film seems to say Look what we have got here and what we are doing with it. A strong ecological message seems to hang behind all the feelings and deeds of the human drama. And those feelings and deeds aren't too tame either but tend to charge the story with strong emotional power.The film is loaded with intense acting and direction. The scenes are set on perfect locations for this kind of production. The film just seems to get better by every new viewing. This western speaks volumes about acts of civilization and use of freedom by setting somewhat civilized but still restless human nature in the middle of the earth's nature and occasionally against it . Definitely forth to see!".

Gary Cooper has never been been better as Doc Frail formerly Doc Temple before a personal tragedy emotionally isolates him from humanity. He rescues and treats Rune Ben Piazza a sensitive young fugitive trapped by circumstance then blackmails Rune into becoming his indentured servant. Rune shares the center of the narrative with Doc Frail becoming his conscience. According to Wikipedia runes are attributed with the power to bring that which is dead to life and certainly Doc Frail's affection for Rune begins his return to his humanity. However when Doc Frail treats Elizabeth the survivor of a stagecoach robbery he must tap into even more humanity to treat her trauma. This frightens Doc Frail and he unfortunately becomes a subsidiary character in the last quarter of the narrative. Fortunately Ben Piazza as Rune and Maria Schell as Elizabeth are both equally excellent and their characters are compelling enough to make up for the relative absence of Cooper. The only false note in the performances is Virginia Gregg who is a bit too brittle as a meddling townswoman.Superb music superb photography superb acting and direction and a better than average story. What more can one ask of a movie? While not quite up to the excellent standards of JUBAL and 310 TO YUMA THE HANGING TREE is definitely a keeper. I give it an 8.".

	schema:reviewBody "No need to recap the sprawling plot.For a western the movie is generously produced. The Washington state locations are scenic as heck and a great backdrop to the rushing crowds and boisterous miners. In fact the gold camp recreation is one of the most realistic I've seen. Then too the production has one of the most underrated directors of westerns of the period Delmer Daves whose list includes such classics as 310 to Yuma 1957 Jubal 1956and the generally overlooked Cowboy 1958. All of these are tightly written and efficiently directed little gems.But I have to say that despite the firstrate production values and a firstrate cast this more epic sized western doesn't achieve the impact of Daves' smaller movies. The problem is a loose script and a dawdling camera that stretches out the dramatics and the movie's length to a sometimes tedious degree. I'm guessing that Warner Bros. wanted a production equal to Gary Cooper's iconic standing. I suspect they were also promoting newcomer Schell's career and thus much time is split between her Cooper and the always reliable Malden. All perform well but add up to bits and pieces that don't fit together very well while padding the screen time unnecessarily.I wish Scott's truly fearsome religious zealot had gotten a bigger role. He might have made the movie memorable so strong is his spotty presence. Something I don't usually notice in films is the movie score. But here the music is blended nicely into the screenplay without overdoing it. Perhaps revealingly this is Daves' final western. From here he went on to teenage fare such as the blockbuster A Summer Place 1959 that despite its teen angst of the day is not without notable compensations. Anyway this film's a scenic delight at the same time the narrative unfortunately is not which adds up to a very mixed result.".

In many ways it foreshadows Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller.Dr. John Frail makes his way to a mining town intent on putting his past behind him. Less than amiable and quick with his fists he keeps his distance from all including those he saves. Things get complicated however when a Elizabeth Mahler Maria Schell a Swiss immigrant finds herself badly injured and stranded under his care. Once well she is determined to strike it rich mining and takes on the iniquitous Frenchy Plante Karl Malden as a partner. When they hit pay dirt new problems arise however and chaos builds to a fever pitch.Tree's erratic pace develops its storyline slowly as the laconic Frail warms up to no one and his murky past remains a mystery. Malden's Frenchy is an energized villain however who displays his ignorance like a badge of honor and along with covillains George C. Scott and John Dierkes provide enough mischief to break Frail out of his indifferent torpor.Malden's performance borders on over the top but he still walks away with the acting honors. Cooper 's cynical man of principle remains the film's moral center and few do it better. Maria Schell also registers well holding her own in scenes with both men. Director Delmer Davies and cinematographer Dan McCord do an excellent job of establishing atmosphere and creating a mood utilizing the townspeople and its mindset as a key component allowing the film to be both a rousing entertainment as well as a parable.".

I will not spoil your viewing enjoyment by giving details of the movie's story but I will comment on the movie's cinematography and the actors' performances.The Hanging Tree 1959 is Gary Cooper's best western and a much better movie than High Noon period. It also the vehicle for one of Gary Cooper's finest performances ever. Sadly it is also one of last movies he ever made. Filmed in glorious Technicolor the scenery near Yakima Washington is spectacular and the camera work excellent. Under the deft hand of renowned director Delmer Daves assisted by Karl Malden who stepped in for Daves' during his illness near the end of filming the actors provide an intense character study of greed exploitation moral corruption redemption and love  set in the old west of the late 19th century. Other cast members giving outstanding performances are the beautiful Maria Schell a drunken fortune hunter Karl Malden along with relative newcomers George C Scott in one of his more sinister roles and a very young Ben Piazza. In fact the entire cast gave excellent performances.The movie's title song written by Jerry Livingston music and Mack David lyrics and sung by Marty Robbins was nominated for an Academy Award losing to High Hopes from A Hole In The Head. It is that type of catchy tune that once you hear it you will be whistling singing and humming it forevermore. The song The Hanging Tree was far more popular and received greater airplay than the Oscar winner High Hopes and also outsold the winner by over ten thousand to one.For some unknown reason Warner Bros. has not released this terrific movie on DVD. I have an old original Warner Home Video VHS copy from which I made a digitized DVD copy for my own use. This movie is one of those classics that is just begging to be restored and released on disc. I'd love to see a good restored DVD copy of The Hanging Tree before I die.It does appear from time to time on Turner Classics Movies TCM television network. If you haven't seen it I highly recommend this movie to you because once you have seen it you will never forget it.Rating 1010".

One of these scenes for which viewers might like have a difference of opinion features a hilarious situation wherein the tailor father starts to trouble his flamboyant son while he was busy making love to a lady who also happens to be his father's regular customer. Apart from this troubled episode of things not being well for fatherson duo director Martin Sulik has shown an equally distressed relationship between a carefree young lass and her authoritarian mother. He provides additional lighter moments by showing the irrelevant confrontation between the film's leading man and the cuckolded husband of his lover. The Garden also attempts to include some important philosophical lessons for viewers' intellectual pleasure but fails miserably as Martin Sulik carries out an absolutely bad job of choosing inappropriate actors to portray two great philosophers Jean Jacques Rousseau and Ludwig Wittgenstein. This is probably the reason why philosophical sentences concerning these two great men would not be retained by viewers for a very long time. Lastly the division of this film into various chapters also does no good at all as it merely adds up to a boring tale moving at a slow pace.".

Marlene Dietrich  Charles Boyer are a superb screen couple.

The supporting cast is excellent Basil Rathbone in a sympathetic role as a Count who loves the desert Joseph Schildkraut as a friendly talkative guide all the Arabic he  others speak in the film is pure gibberish Lucile Watson as a gentle Mother Superior Alan Marshal as an honorable young French officer Tilly Losch as a dangerous dancer Henry Brandon as a comic porter John Carradine as the mysterious Sand Diviner and magnificent Sir C. Aubrey Smith as a wise old priest.Movie mavens will recognize Helen Jerome Eddy as a nun Marcia Mae Jones  Bonita Granville peeking over the nun's shoulder as convent girls gaunt Nigel De Brulier as a monastery lector and Ferdinand Gottschalk as a hotel clerk all uncredited.Color films of the 1930's are both rare  lovely to look at and this movie is no exception  the cinematography is as colorful as the desert itself. THE GARDEN OF ALLAH was the first Technicolor film to be shot on location. Yuma Arizona gave the film makers all the sand dunes they could desire but contaminated drinking water  135 degree heat soon had the company in revolt.

	schema:reviewBody "This is I believe only the second movie to be made in the gloriously new threestrip Technicolor process and it must be said that cinematographer Howard Greene and Selznick's always reliable crew of art directors turned in a stunning performance. At a time when color was not well understood by most technicians these guys pulled off a virtuoso turn. The thing looks fabulous from end to end lovely desert shots under all kinds of lighting conditions and a generally underplayed and painterly use of color.Then there is the music one of Max Steiner's most magical scores although unfortunately renters of the video will not quite be able to appreciate it as it deserves to be. Max wrote nearly two hours of music for what turned out to be a 79 minute picture a good deal of it was lost and Selznick's sound engineers had a tendency to mix it under in such a way that its distinctiveness is much muted. This problem is exacerbated in the usually reliable Anchor Bay's VHS issue they went overboard with the noise reduction filters and the result in many places is a blurry mush that does scant justice to Steiner's often piquant scoring. Later In the DVD this has been largely rectified. Some of the best passages were left on the cutting room floor altogether... All of this visual and audible loveliness has been lavished on a story of truly astonishing triviality which is a pity as the Robert Hichens novel had rather more depth. Count Antioni for instance is a converted Muslim in the book but 1936 Hollywood would not tolerate that. Would they today I wonder? Marlene Dietrich has to be the only woman on earth who would wander about the uncharted depths of the Sahara in high heels and a Travis Banton silk confection of a gown the most horrendous sandstorms fail to displace a single hair of her coiffure. Charles Boyer strives manfully with awful dialogue and almost brings it off. Second tier characters like Joseph Schildkraut and the ever stalwart C. Aubrey Smith fare better and Basil Rathbone is always good to see. Tilly Losch's hoochie koochie dance in the Arab dive is positively embarrassing. The whole thing was definitely a miscalculation on Selznick's part and he lost a bundle. Nevertheless it is well worth a look if you are a student of early color. Film music aficionados will have to take my word for it on the superb qualities of the score the existing movie barely hints at them. This music cries out for a good new recording like the many others that are coming out these days of classic picture scores.".

	schema:reviewBody "Audiences back in 1936 must have been stunned at what they were watching a fullfledged beautiful fulllength Technicolor film. I can't say for sure but this might have been the first one 3strip. At any rate it still looks beautiful over 70 years later on DVD. In fact just how good it looks is amazing.Kudos for that have to go out to Director Richard Boleslowski Director Of Photography Virgil Miller Selznick International Pictures and for the DVD  MGM Home Entertainment. All of them combined to give us one of the bestlooking films of the classicera age.I thought the story was soso excellent in the first half stagnant in the second. It gave a nice message in the end even though a lot of people might not have been happy with it. I can't say more without spoiling things.Marlene Dietrich never looked better I don't believe and certainly never played such a softhearted character Domini Enfilden. Heartthrob Charles Boyer was the male star and Domini's object of affection but some of the minor characters were the most interesting to me. People like Joseph Schildkraut as Batouch John Carradine as The Sand Diviner The most memorable to me at least was the dancer Irena played by Tilly Losch. Wow there is a face and a dance you won't soon forget! I've never seen anything like it in the thousands of films I've viewed. Just seeing her do her thing was worth the price of the DVD. Looking at her IMDb resume she was only in four movies but they were all wellknown films.Basil Rathbone the actor who really became famous for playing Sherlock Holmes also is in here as is C. Aubrey Smith another famous British actor of his day. Schildkraut by the way will be recognized by classic film buffs as the man who played the arrogant sales clerk in the big hit The Shop Around The Corner with Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan.The beautiful direction photography and color and Tilly's dance are the things I'll remember best about this movie which is a lot of good and notsogood things all rolled into one. Had the last half hour been better  although I admire the ending  I would have rated it even higher. It's definitely one film collectors want to add to their collection.".

But it's gweat twash and in all fairness muchloved weepies like An Affair To Remember have got nothing on this picture. The fabulousness that's definitions 1  2 in Webster's of the plot the emphatic performances the overblown dialogue and the sheer absurd audacity of full silver service and dressing for dinner in a tent in the middle of the Sahara these are the very things for which you watch such a film. After all if life was never like this anywhere at any time it sure should have been.The user who suggested the right mood is necessary is absolutely correct and it helps to remember the perspective of audiences of the time who while the Depression dragged on desired escapism that bore no resemblance to their real lives. We certainly have our escapist fare today and believe me Spiderman The Matrix and The Fast and the Furious are going to look at least as ridiculous  if not more so  after a halfcentury if not before. So please let's not have any more carping about implausibility.The aspects that have garnered the most criticism are some of the very elements that make it so much fun but you must abandon your jaded cynicism and surrender yourself to the experience. I'd never recommend this film to everyone I know but of those to whom I have done  people I knew could appreciate it  not one has gotten all the way through it without choking back a tear or two if not outright bawling like a baby.One thing everyone does seem to agree on is the ravishingly beautiful look of this picture and they're ohsoright about that. The DVD from Anchor Bay is particularly stunning  there are scenes that look like they were shot yesterday  so if you decide to see the film try to get your hands on a copy of that release.Incidentally this was not the first Technicolor picture in the threestrip process as opposed to the twostrip which goes back to 1922 shot on location as one comment said. That honor most likely belongs to Trail Of the Lonesome Pine which was shot and released a few months earlier.".

He just rides in from the desert and spoils everything! As others have noted John Gilbert was slated to star with Dietrich. I can't help but think he would have been wonderful. The role of worldweary Boris would have suited the great Gilbert quite well. And after the success of Queen Christina with Garbo his career might have gotten back on track.I can't think of any other 30s film Dietrich did in color.

Aubrey Smith and Joseph Schildkraut star in this David O. Selznick Technicolor production. The story concerns a religious woman Domini who is in mourning for her father and visits the convent where she lived as a child. The Mother Superior encourages her to go out and live as she was her father's caretaker and didn't get out into the world.She meets Boris Androvsky and he seems even more unfamiliar with the world than she. What she doesn't know is that he was a Trappist monk and has left the order. The two fall in love and marry. However someone eventually recognizes him and his secret is revealed.I have to say I feel sorry for any exTrappist monk running into gorgeous Marlene Dietrich especially under a desert sky. The atmosphere of this film is very moody the color beautiful and the photography sensational. Filmed in California and Arizona it looks for all the world like an exotic desert setting.Even with all this and a young handsome Charles Boyer the film comes off as melodramatic and slight. Partly I blame the overlydramatic music but let's face it the script isn't very good.Marlene Dietrich is very good and underplays her role Boyer's role is really impossible. He's confused and miserable through most of it. He was an excellent actor and pulls it off though. Rathbone doesn't have a big role nor does Schildkraut but they were two of the best character actors around.The Garden of Allah is definitely worth seeing  it's wonderful to look at and when you see the Cyndi Lauper video of Time after Time this is the film she was watching in the beginning of the song.".

	schema:headline " Surreal Tale of Two People in Search of Peace and Happiness";
	schema:reviewBody "Gorgeous Techicolor production telling the unusual tale of the romance between a woman of strong religious faith and a Trappist monk who has left his monastery breaking his vows. The film opens at a convent in Europe where a former student prays  a lonely beauty in black named Domini Marlene Dietrich. She is advised by the Mother Superior to go to the desert and find herself and lose her grief over her father who has recently died. In the train car on the way into the Sahara she sits opposite a very very troubled man Charles Boyer  our former monk. She's soon at a hotel near a palmtreed oasis where she again sees our mysterious troubled man as he is stumped over what to do when confronted by a very seductive dancing girl. Domini becomes friends with him though knows nothing of his past  romance soon to follow.This film is sentimental melodramatic and different in a way almost surreal and even a bit campy  I found it to be quite fun and entertaining. The photography in this is really interesting  it is full of extreme facial closeups and beautiful color shots of caravans of horses crossing the desert silhouetted figures against a sunset sky. Marlene Dietrich gives a nicely done though restrained performance here and looks gorgeous. Charles Boyer  not usually one of my favorites  is actually pretty good in this I think the part sort of suits him and he looks quite young and handsome too. Basil Rathbone is fine here except given very little to do. Another great orchestral score by Max Steiner helps keep the drama rolling  all in all a very enjoyable film.".

Dietrich's costumes are out of this world. As Riva notes in her book Dietrich managed to steal Paramount's Travis Banton and have him design some of the most divine gowns such as the chiffon beige dress  cape.I heartily agree with the other reviewers who rave about the Technicolor. It really is hard to believe the film was done in 1936  the color is fantastic.In short if you watch The Garden of Allah with a lenient attitude and embrace its silliness you can't help but enjoy it.".

The cast is excellent and Marlene Dietrich is a big plus and of course she is so alluring and I just loved her in this flick. Basil Rathbone is also perfect in this movie. I couldn't get over the scenery and the sets... The hotel the palm trees the desert it's all there... the legionnaires also bring a Beau Geste feeling to the film.

	schema:headline " Riveting Visually and Skillful Artistically";
	schema:reviewBody "Sunshine all the time makes a desert. an Arab proverb.A viewpoint that great visuals and skillful performances are enough to turn even a dull screenplay into an entertaining motion picture seems too much simplified. However in some instances such perspective occurs to make sense. Seldom may it occur as relevant as in THE GARDEN OF ALLAH directed by Richard Boleslawski and produced by David O. Selznick. The strengths of the movie do not lie in clever storyline but in amazing camera and lighting work as well as performances. As one of the first three strip Technicolor films after BECKY SHARP and long before THE WIZARD OF OZ the colors of THE GARDEN OF ALLAH have much to boast of. In many of its scenes attempted at purely visual experience the aesthetic impressions are in no way dated. Clarence Slifer collaborating with other artistically innovative people does a wonderful job. Just to note the effective use of red one of the most beloved colors in the period of color experimentation symbolizing the land of fire and desire where the protagonists' destinies meet the shots of the desert as backdrop with persons and caravans in silhouettes as well as the interiors. The elaborate visuals are particularly memorable in a little scene of Domina and Father Roubier when he tries to warn her against the man she loves. Consider the particular detail as she leaves the sacristy. Besides the cinematographic pearls of location shots and camera work what strongly contributes to the memorable impressions are costumes by Jeannette Couget and music by Max Steiner in particular the use of Schubert's Ave Maria and the atmospheric song No One But God and I Know What is in My Heart. But let me now develop perhaps the most striking feature of the film  performances which I am not going to divide into main roles and supporting characters since this is one of the movies of the 1930s which cannot be treated as 'a vehicle' for Marlene Dietrich solely. Single individuals deserve unique praise for making the hardly believable content still communicative.Marlene Dietrich freed from the guidance of her tutor Josef Von Sternberg portrays a character whose mind and dreams are occupied by the search for happiness for finding herself. As a young beautiful actress with subtle presence on the screen and girlish movements she is nothing but outstanding. The effect of her screen presence is of course multiplied by the use of colors and a number of costumes she wears. Ms Dietrich reminds me a lot of her earlier role also away from Sternberg in THE SONG OF SONGS. However she is not Garbo who proved to be 'a queen on her own' preferring to be left alone to go on with her lines and cooperation with the camera. Dietrich was more generous with her costars. Consequently Ms Dietrich cannot be considered fully without her leading men. And one is truly captivating. That is... Charles Boyer. Although his character lacks logical sense of his motifs and may be less communicative with audiences he proves unbelievable acting skills. His performance is filled with extravaganza rebellious attitude selfimposed almost blasphemous ignorance of the hard past neurotic struggle for materializing his inner desires. It is all a great insight into the tormented almost tortured character who does not seek refuge in loneliness but in the arms of a woman. Having experienced the extreme silence and hermitlike life as a Trappist monk his tortured soul strives for passions to fulfill them and the fire of lust to extinguish it. While Ms Dietrich's scene is the memorable finale after she received the harsh test she prayed for his moment is the speech scene when teary eyes and sweaty forehead manifest the most inner struggles. Although it does not necessarily work so logically the moment is worth seeing thanks to his compelling performance. Even the liqueur would not taste that good... Although Boyer worked with the various female stars of the time including Garbo and Bette Davis there is a strong chemistry between him and Marlene Dietrich. Their scenes are sweet fussy and overly sensitive but worth seeing. The finale is also something of a genius collaboration of the leading protagonists. Joy tears smile evoke.Joseph Schildkraut has particularly witty and charming moments as Batouch a sort of character no one will be after but everyone will like. C. Aubrey Smith with his specific strength and rhetoric in his performances crafts the role of Father memorably. I particularly sympathized with his sweet dog that seems to perceive sometimes more than humans do. Basil Rathbone carries the restrain and appeal as Count Andreoni. Apart from them there are two of the cast who though given just a minimum time on the screen and yet appear to be truly memorable John Carradine as a seer who in a haunting moment foretells Domina's future and Tilly Losch as a dancer who in her Salomelike lustful crush provides the movie with one of the most erotic sequences ever found in motion picture. And finally who contributes to the entertainment and mood are great extras who speak gibberish in the backdrop.But who is in the lead? No one so much as the title garden of Allah itself with its endless attraction and cleanliness of catharsis with its oases of fresh water and the heat of vast loneliness where you can hear the whisper of your inner self the desert.All is touched by the search of happiness that the protagonists struggle to find. The desert seems to be a perfect place for that target and yet...do they find it? The unforgettable finale seems to answer this question where the religious and the secular where purity and desire reach the heights of their mutual though fairy tale collaboration. But if you seek something thought provoking search for it elsewhere...enjoy the visuals and performances offered by THE GARDEN OF ALLAH.".

	schema:reviewBody "He's not recalled today like his two contemporaries Somerset Maugham or James Hilton. He is Robert Hitchens and in his time roughly from 1900 to 1947 or so his books were frequently best sellers. Only one is recalled today  and it is not THE GARDEN OF ALLAH. His fictionalization of Oscar Wilde's career  THE GREEN CARNATION  is still republished occasionally. But SNAKEBITE AFTER THE TRIAL BELLA DONNA and THE PARADINE CASE are rarely read all four were made into films and the last was a failed Hitchcock movie. He did have his own share of controversy. In 1923 the prosecution and Judge in the notorious British homicide trial of Edith Thompson and Frederick Byswater noted the imaginative Mrs. Thompson liked to discuss the books she read and mentioned Hitchens. Mr. Justice Shearman said Hitchens wrote filthy books. Coming from such a source that actually is a complement.Hitchens liked the desert as a setting of his tales. BELLA DONNA was set in Egypt in part dealing with an archaeologist. So his novels are pretty much time capsules to us reminding us of earlier viewpoints about the globe and what to find there.Today when we think of the world of North Africa and the Islamic countries I suspect we think of xenophobic antiWestern antiAmerican and antiJewish peoples or of suicide bombers or of fanatics. Of course this is a gross simplification of the mass of these people. But similarly stereotypes ruled the view of Islamic lands in the 19th and early 20th Century. On the one hand was a look at the beauties of the desert and a sense of it's timelessness and it's mysticism. This was mingled with a view that Islam was a kind of poor cousin for want of a better term to Christianity worshiping God but being somewhat more superstitious although in fiction the superstition was usually correct in the ironies of the story. But on the other hand North Africa and the Middle East were seen as hot and sexy uninhibited areas. In novels like Andre Gide's THE IMMORALIST you went to North Africa to escape the hypocrisy of European society similarly Evelyn Waugh would send Sebastian to North Africa in BRIDESHEAD REVISITED to drink himself to death with his lover.Keeping all this in mind helps understand the misfire called THE GARDEN OF ALLAH. David Selznick produced it to use the new Technicolor style of film  and to give the film it's due Richard Boleslawski's movie is a beautiful one to look at. Further he brought in Marlene Dietrich who had already done a desert romance with Joseph Von Sternberg in 1930  MOROCCO Charles Boyer Basil Rathbone Joseph Schildkraut C. Audrey Smith Alan Marshall and John Carridine for his cast. With all their hard work though and the beauty of the film itself it remains a failure.The problem is the hokeyness of the story to us today. Hitchens sets up the lovers Dietrich and Boyer  their only film together by the way on parallel courses. She was brought up in a Catholic school run by nuns in France and her father a rich man has died leaving her his fortune. She has had a secluded life so far in the convent and caring for her father and she yearns to see the world and find love. Boyer has been a Trappist monk who earns the money for his monastery by being the sole possessor of the recipe for the manufacture of the monastery's liqueur. But at the start of the film he has fled the monastery and is traveling on the same train as she is. They both leave at a city thirty miles south of the monastery.At a fight in a nightspot both are at Boyer rescues Dietrich. Soon they are seen together pretty frequently and fall in love. He tries to leave but can't. Instead he proposes marriage and she accepts. The local priest Aubrey Smith does not know why but can't trust Boyer. A premonition by a seer Carridine that is told to Dietrich and Rathbone makes the latter equally wary about the marriage. But Dietrich is all for it. They go on their honeymoon accompanied by their servants including Schildkraut. The keep staying in the desert apparently content until the accidental arrival of Marshall begins undoing the entire situation Marshall a French army officer met Boyer at the monastery and knows his story.SPOILER AHEAD When the matter reaches a boil Dietrich and Boyer reluctantly return things to normal...or as near normal as possible. They tearfully part as Boyer returns to the Trappist life and Dietrich hopes that in a better world they will be united forever.Somehow today we wouldn't swallow this too thoroughly. The monk might decide to drop his duty to the God he swore allegiance to because he does want to be a regular man. The woman who needs love would likewise urge him to do so and the hell with the world. Instead we have this 1936 solution  and while the actors make the best of their talents bringing it to a boil it sits badly. Also Marlene is a woman of vast sex appeal. While Selznick dressed her quite well here and the color helped too she does nothing sexy in the film. Dancer Tilly Losch is sexier. Joan Fontaine would have been better in the part ten years later. For all the passions of the story her performance is dull  and the movie hard to accept.".

For a producer renowned for elevated the level of adult entertainment in the 1930's it's shocking to see him select a script designed to appeal to the 3yearold romantic in all of us. Not even the powerhouse leads can save this sandblown mess Boyer's customary sincerity and craft is subverted by the preponderance of prettyboy glamour shots that rival even those of Dietrich and by the script's demands that he engage in silentfilm face acting which was wildly inappropriate in the mid30's albeit even for characters experiencing spiritual crises. However the manful and professional way in which he handles these indignities is quite admirable. And Marlene's contempt for the proceedings fairly radiates from her porcelain mask of a face which is no mean feat! all the diaphonous gowns in the world can't disguise her phonedin performance. She reportedly hated the sweltering location filming causing her to fix her hair with bottles of hairspray improbably turning it into a rigid helmet in the desert winds! In all fairness to her though this must have been a difficult film for her for she was in the midst of grieving for John Gilbert who was to have taken the Boyer role. Bottom line savor the glorious original Technicolor shots and chuckle at the tacky dramatics.".

How a film could be so breathtakingly beautiful to behold and be so insipidly dull is beyond me. Also how Marlene if she was trying to expand her range and not play a sexpot got stuck with such an old fashioned story is beyond me.The Garden Of Allah one of the very first films in modern technicolor was a novel set at the turn of the last century by Robert Hitchens who then collaborated on a play adaption with Mary Anderson that ran for 241 performances in 191112. It then got two silent screen adaptions. The story is about a monk who runs away from the monastery out in French Tunisia to see some of what he's missed in the world. He runs into a similarly sheltered woman who was unmarried and spent her prime years caring for a sick parent. She's traveling now in the desert and the two meet on a train.The woman is of course Marlene and the runaway monk is Charles Boyer. I'm not sure what was in David O. Selznick's mind in filming this story. Someone like Ingrid Bergman might have made it palatable for the audience. But you can bet that the moviegoing public of 1936 when they plunked their money down for a ticket they expected to see Marlene as a modern day Salome rather than a saint with that title. The public still remembered Rudolph Valentino and you can bet that it was some desert romance and seduction that they were expecting.As for the monks you have to remember that they are self supporting in their monasteries and this particular one bottles a special wine of which Boyer happens to be the one with the secret. The monastery will have to rethink it's economics if Boyer leaves. The monks are a sincerely pious group but from the head man Charles Waldron on down they've a right to be a little concerned with some self interest.Anyway a whole lot of religious platitudes get said here by a pair of leads that really are not suited for the parts. Most especially Marlene Dietrich. I would watch this film with an eye for the special color desert cinematography and forget the plot.".

	schema:reviewBody "Although he wrote many later novels including The Paradine Case which was also filmed by Selznick Robert Smythe Hichens 1864 1950 never equaled the success of his early The Garden of Allah which sold a staggering 800000 copies in its initial hardcover editions. A wellwritten book with much accurate closelyobserved detail too much in fact for modern tastes it offers not only a grandly romantic story of love and mystery set against a fascinatingly unusual yet breathtakingly picturesque background but meticulously describes the inner rewards and setbacks of an idealized heroine's selfimposed search for peace love and fulfillment. As for the title it is explained by Count Anteoni The Arabs have a saying The desert is the garden of Allah.The novel was filmed three times Helen Ware and Thomas Santschi starred in a 1917 version while Alice Terry and Ivan Petrovich were the leads of an MGMRex Ingram film screenplay by Willis Goldbeck  Selznick's assistant on this one ten years later.Green and Rosson were handed an Honorary Award by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for their color cinematography. The Garden of Allah was the world's 5th threestrip Technicolor feature. Negative cost 1447760. Locations in the Mojave Desert near Yuma Arizona.The film was originally to star Merle Oberon and Gilbert Roland. Fortunately Selznick was astute enough to grab Dietrich and Boyer for the leads instead when they suddenly became available by both walking out on Paramount's Hotel Imperial in protest over the firing of director Ernst Lubitsch. COMMENT Unlike the 1927 version which took considerable liberties with both plot and characterization this is a remarkably faithful transcription of the original novel. Admittedly a few incidents and characters have been compressed and one minor player Domini's maid Suzanne omitted altogether but with one or two exceptions all the changes  slight as they are  represent distinct dramatic improvements. Not only are atmosphere and suspense heightened but the exotic romance of the book is perfectly captured.The players are collectively nothing short of superb. Dietrich is brilliantly cast. It's a role calling not only for glamour and allure but one requiring the actress to express a quality of urgent desperate seeking. Dietrich's exotic appeal goes without question but her most fascinating and interesting roles are usually those in which she herself is actively seeking something Dishonored The Scarlet Empress A Foreign Affair Witness for the Prosecution Judgement at Nuremberg rather than being sought Blonde Venus Song of Songs Stage Fright Rancho Notorious. Her face especially her eyes and the accented timbre of her voice convey urgency energy drive  even ruthlessness  extremely well. Domini Enfilden is not only an embodiment of all these qualities but she has a romantic restlessness which Marlene portrays with totally convincing sympathy. It's impossible to imagine any other star in this part. If ever there was a role that seemed completely made to order for Dietrich this is it.Charles Boyer was also never more perfectly served  although he did have a few other roles the equal of Boris Androvsky in romantic intensity particularly in Mayerling his very next film and Hold Back the Dawn. Boyer would have made an ideal Hamlet. As a romantic character he is often at the mercy of events. He struggles to extricate himself sometimes succeeding History Is Made At Night often not Algiers All This and Heaven Too. Anxiety restlessness despair  these are Boyer's stockintrade. Most of the support players are not quite so impressively catered for though Basil Rathbone and Joseph Schildkraut judiciously match their respective characters to those in the book. C. Aubrey Smith Alan Marshal and Lucile Watson are also ideally cast. John Carradine however is so completely unrecognizable  even his voice is different  it's hard to believe it's really him!If it were possible to overshadow the richness of these excellent performances with a wealth of striking production values producer Selznick and his accomplished technicians certainly give it a rousing try. Director Boleslawski forsaking the sterile tableau approach he employed in Clive of India has directed every scene with admirable deftness and style. He is aided  indeed bested  by superlative Technicolor photography of the film's ravishing sets costumes and locations.Max Steiner contributed a movingly atmospheric delightfully captivating score.All in all a beautifully produced grandly exotic yet totally engrossing romance. One of my favorite films of the 1930s. Fortunately available on DVD from MetroGoldwynMayer in a really excellent print.".

Her face especially her eyes and the accented timbre of her voice convey urgency energy drive  even ruthlessness  extremely well. Domini Enfilden is not only an embodiment of all these qualities but she has a romantic restlessness which Marlene portrays with totally convincing sympathy. It's impossible to imagine any other star in this part. If ever there was a role that seemed completely made to order for Dietrich this is it.Charles Boyer was also never more perfectly served  although he did have a few other roles the equal of Boris Androvsky in romantic intensity particularly in Mayerling his very next film and Hold Back the Dawn. Boyer would have made an ideal Hamlet. As a romantic character he is often at the mercy of events. He struggles to extricate himself sometimes succeeding History Is Made At Night often not Algiers All This and Heaven Too. Anxiety restlessness despair  these are Boyer's stockintrade. Most of the support players are not quite so impressively catered for though Basil Rathbone and Joseph Schildkraut judiciously match their respective characters to those in the book. C. Aubrey Smith Alan Marshal and Lucile Watson are also ideally cast. John Carradine however is so completely unrecognizable  even his voice is different  it's hard to believe it's really him!If it were possible to overshadow the richness of these excellent performances with a wealth of striking production values producer Selznick and his accomplished technicians certainly give it a rousing try. Director Boleslawski forsaking the sterile tableau approach he employed in Clive of India has directed every scene with admirable deftness and style. He is aided  indeed bested  by superlative Technicolor photography of the film's ravishing sets costumes and locations.Max Steiner contributed a movingly atmospheric delightfully captivating score.All in all a beautifully produced grandly exotic yet totally engrossing romance. One of my favorite films of the 1930s. Fortunately available on DVD from MetroGoldwynMayer in a really excellent print.";

With lovely locations in Mexico this was Fox's first western in the then new process of Cinemascope and Stereophonic sound and boasted a top notch cast in Gary Cooper Susan Hayward and Richard Widmark.From a fine screenplay by Frank Fenton  Cooper and Widmark together with Cameron Mitchell and Victor Manuel Mendoza are four adventurers contracted by Leah Fuller Hayward to go back with her into the wilds of Mexico to rescue her husband Hugh Marlowe who is lying trapped and injured in a gold mine. They journey to the mine and perform the rescue but on their way back they are pursued by Apaches a brilliant chase sequence and must ward them off in a well staged attack on a hazardous cliffface trail.A good adventure yarn if a tad slow in parts but the widescreen picture looks great and the small cast are excellent. Cooper as Hooker is at his laconic best Hayward is as gorgeous as ever Mitchell in a good part as a temperamental and impatient young gun Mendoza as the likable and amiable Mexican companion and Widmark shines as Fiske the droll and garrulous gambler who cuts for highest card to see who goes and who stays behind.Beautifully photographed in Cinemascope and colour by Milton Krasner it is all excitingly handled by Hathaway. The picture also has an excellent score by the ubiquitous Bernard Herrmann. This was the only real western Herrmann ever tackled if you discount Burt Lancaster's early frontier epic The Kentuckian 1955 and some obscure episodes of TV's The Virginian in the sixties. Herrmann scored the film rather as a conventional adventure story and avoided the usual clichd style of writing associated with westerns except perhaps the theme for Hooker Cooper where the composer hints at a cowboy tune with its wonderful long loping Americana tinged melody. But the score is mainly an intense and strident work full of suspense and foreboding. The main theme first heard over the credits is a brilliant defiant statement for full orchestra and is played in different guises throughout the movie. Particularly clever is the ominous figure on the octave flute which points up the unseen but ever watching Apaches. There is no love theme as such but tender music in the composer's gentlest manner underscores the Hayward character. All the stops are pulled out for the brilliant climactic music cue for the chase sequence where the Apaches are in hot pursuit of the interlopers. It is a sensational swirling and thundering piece calling for some virtuoso playing from the magnificent Fox orchestra which they zealously deliver.Garden Of Evil is available in a small Fox western box set along with two other western classics  the wonderful Rawhide 1951 and Henry King's The Gunfighter 1950. Enjoy!".

'Garden of Evil' has a great story great actors and a fabulous scenery. Not even Anthony Mann achieved this perfection of blending scenery and story. The story is about three men Cooper Widmark and Mitchell which are on a steam ship that breaks down and has to be fixed on the coast of Mexico at a time where there was no Panama Canal and they had to pass through Cape Horn so the Pacific Coast was kind of unreachable and mysterious. There while they have to wait they are hired by Susan Hayward to free her husband stuck on a gold mine on a territory full of Apaches. They all desire the gold and also the woman and she uses her power of seduction to command them. When they get to the place which is called Garden of Evil and realize that they might not come out alive each one makes a choice about higher or lower values. There is an impressive fight between Mitchell and Cooper where Mitchell is repeatedly thrown into the fire. Rita Moreno in a small part where she only has a chance to sing half of two songs is breathtakingly beautiful. Susan Hayward is excellent Hathaway was able to bring out the best in her as he did in 'Rawhide'. One of the best lines is when Cooper says to Hayward referring to her husband that what counts is what one does and not what he speaks. This film should be on any list of the all time best westerns.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am giving a 7 for the cast and production. I have no problems with the performances of the six leads and only wish Rita Moreno had been given more than a few scenes she did well as the singer in a cantina. But this might have been an 8 or 9 as a film western with a bit better care in the script. Don't get me wrong  the story is not the most difficult to accept. Three men Gary Cooper as Hooker Richard Widmark as Fiske and Cameron Mitchell as Daly are stuck in a Mexican sea town while their ship is being repaired. All are headed for the California Gold Fields so the year is 1849  50 or so. While drinking together in a cantina where Moreno is dancing  it is owned by her boyfriend Victor Manuel Mendoza here as Madariaga they are all approached by Susan Hayward as Leah Fuller to assist her in rescuing her husband Hugh Marlowe as John Fuller who is an engineer exploring a gold mind. There was a partial cavein and he is trapped under the beams of wood. She is willing to pay any man who assists her 2000.00 for his help. After some discussion Cooper Widmark Mitchell and Madariaga agree to do it. They are aware of one catch  the location of Marlowe and the mind is deep within Apache territory.The story continues as they follow Hayward to reach Marlowe constantly aware of the Apache danger they are traveling during a holiday that tribe celebrates by hunting white men and they are aware of problems among themselves. While each has been willing to take a chance on the mission for the 2000.00 fee at least two of the mercenaries Mitchell and Madariaga see it as an opportunity to possibly get rich on that gold mine. Cooper and Widmark may think of it too but both are smarter  the Apache danger is more important to consider than some possible wealth. Also both men are attracted to Hayward although both are equally wary of her motives. It looks at first like she deeply loves her husband but she isn't really behaving like she does.Personality conflicts develop. Mendoza tries to leave a trail for his friends to follow along the route but Hayward and Cooper keep destroying his sign posts. Mitchell makes a play for Hayward and is forced to confront Cooper. Some ugly points about Mitchell's past he's a bounty hunter with a dubious modus operandi come out but he is put into his place. Widmark watches  a cynical man of the world and card player. Yet he and Cooper manage to create a kind of friendly relationship although Cooper wonders if he is the kind of man who could fully meet the dangers of this trek in hostile territory.They reach the mine and find Marlowe alive  and get him out. But they find him a bitter man  he feels Hayward hoped to find him dead so she could keep the mind. It is obvious that Hayward's behavior towards him in rescuing him was not due to lingering love but to a sense of guilt that he got himself into this mess trying to prove himself to her. But whatever the reason the six find themselves suddenly facing the problems of returning to the Mexican town they left 100 miles or so away facing a now visible and deadly Apache threat and hampered by an injured Marlowe.On the surface the story is interesting enough but too many points are left dangling. Cooper's Hooker is a Texas lawman which is why he knows about Mitchell but Widmark knows of Cooper he can't quite place him and we wonder if Cooper has left Texas for some similar black mark against him. Widmark's cynicism or wisdom is done well  but how he'd get that way is never explained. The complications of the Hayward  Marlowe marriage are given to us in one scene in their cabin when the others are out and we really needed something to fill in the background. Still the performances are good  uniformly well done. I note particularly and probably few would think of it Victor Mendoza. Mexico has had one of the best movie producing industries in the world for decades that is only belatedly getting the attention it deserves in the U.S. It is more than simply a transplanted Luis Bunuel making films there or Cantiflas' social comedies. Mendoza's character of Madariaga is as complex as Cooper's Hooker Widmarck's Fiske Mitchell's Daly or Hayward and Marlowe's twisted Fullers. He is the jealous boyfriend of Moreno and when he tosses a rival out of his cantina he comes over to the three gringos and explains to them why he noticed their interest in Rita too. He is an opportunist setting up personal signs leading to the mine but he is willing to keep his word regarding rescuing Marlowe. His final moments are memorable too yelling defiance at his unseen Apache tormentors. Fact is he was a fine actor and while never an Oscar winner or nominee won several equivalent Mexican awards in his career see his thread on this board.GARDEN OF EVIL is a good western and worth watching. Just a bit more fine tuning and it would have been a great western.".

After some discussion Cooper Widmark Mitchell and Madariaga agree to do it. They are aware of one catch  the location of Marlowe and the mind is deep within Apache territory.The story continues as they follow Hayward to reach Marlowe constantly aware of the Apache danger they are traveling during a holiday that tribe celebrates by hunting white men and they are aware of problems among themselves. While each has been willing to take a chance on the mission for the 2000.00 fee at least two of the mercenaries Mitchell and Madariaga see it as an opportunity to possibly get rich on that gold mine. Cooper and Widmark may think of it too but both are smarter  the Apache danger is more important to consider than some possible wealth. Also both men are attracted to Hayward although both are equally wary of her motives. It looks at first like she deeply loves her husband but she isn't really behaving like she does.Personality conflicts develop. Mendoza tries to leave a trail for his friends to follow along the route but Hayward and Cooper keep destroying his sign posts. Mitchell makes a play for Hayward and is forced to confront Cooper. Some ugly points about Mitchell's past he's a bounty hunter with a dubious modus operandi come out but he is put into his place. Widmark watches  a cynical man of the world and card player. Yet he and Cooper manage to create a kind of friendly relationship although Cooper wonders if he is the kind of man who could fully meet the dangers of this trek in hostile territory.They reach the mine and find Marlowe alive  and get him out. But they find him a bitter man  he feels Hayward hoped to find him dead so she could keep the mind. It is obvious that Hayward's behavior towards him in rescuing him was not due to lingering love but to a sense of guilt that he got himself into this mess trying to prove himself to her. But whatever the reason the six find themselves suddenly facing the problems of returning to the Mexican town they left 100 miles or so away facing a now visible and deadly Apache threat and hampered by an injured Marlowe.On the surface the story is interesting enough but too many points are left dangling. Cooper's Hooker is a Texas lawman which is why he knows about Mitchell but Widmark knows of Cooper he can't quite place him and we wonder if Cooper has left Texas for some similar black mark against him. Widmark's cynicism or wisdom is done well  but how he'd get that way is never explained. The complications of the Hayward  Marlowe marriage are given to us in one scene in their cabin when the others are out and we really needed something to fill in the background. Still the performances are good  uniformly well done. I note particularly and probably few would think of it Victor Mendoza. Mexico has had one of the best movie producing industries in the world for decades that is only belatedly getting the attention it deserves in the U.S. It is more than simply a transplanted Luis Bunuel making films there or Cantiflas' social comedies. Mendoza's character of Madariaga is as complex as Cooper's Hooker Widmarck's Fiske Mitchell's Daly or Hayward and Marlowe's twisted Fullers. He is the jealous boyfriend of Moreno and when he tosses a rival out of his cantina he comes over to the three gringos and explains to them why he noticed their interest in Rita too. He is an opportunist setting up personal signs leading to the mine but he is willing to keep his word regarding rescuing Marlowe. His final moments are memorable too yelling defiance at his unseen Apache tormentors. Fact is he was a fine actor and while never an Oscar winner or nominee won several equivalent Mexican awards in his career see his thread on this board.GARDEN OF EVIL is a good western and worth watching. Just a bit more fine tuning and it would have been a great western.";

This movie is not one which plays often on the TV I cannot recall having seen it in the last 30 years. The film and cast are excellent. Perhaps the film's flaw is the fact that it is not very well know as compared to some of the nonsense served up by John Wayne. Gary Cooper has made some really great films and this is certainly one of them. Susan Hayward is always a delight for the eyes and the Mexican scenery is most imposing. The one image which remains strongest in the mind about this movie is how when and where the Indians single out which members of the rescue party are to be killed one by one. I hope the industry which provides us with new DVD's every Tuesday will finally wake up and put this fine piece of work out on the shelf for sale where it belongs.".

	schema:headline " Great cast and scenery can't save a film with a lousy script";
	schema:reviewBody "No one will doubt that Garden of Evil has a great cast. Gary Cooper Susan Hayward Richard Widmark and Cameron Mitchell are leads Hugh Marlowe and Victor Mendoza are in supporting roles and Rita Morena has something a little more than a cameo. But a cast is only as good as their performances. And their performances depend a great deal on the script they have with which to work. This film fails miserably mostly because of a terrible script. And the acting is generally subpar for most of the cast  and very bad by Gary Cooper.The DVD I watched had a bonus with it on the making of this film. It is referred to as a morality tale about greed good and evil. But the script is so terrible that it ruins everything about the story. A couple of other reviewers saw the same thing. The writers tried to make the Cooper and Widmark roles philosophical. Ergo the terse flat replies especially by Cooper. They come across as wisecracks or putdowns. Then Widmark's character waxes poetic frequently about any situation. Again to what point or avail? Susan Hayward's Leah Fuller is driven to find help to rescue a man caught in a cavein. Well is it her husband or isn't it? He doesn't call her honey or darling but You a person who came back. She doesn't call him darling or honey or husband. We don't ever know if they are man and wife until he's killed by Indians and they bury him on the trail. Leah takes her wedding ring off and presses it into the dirt over his grave.Is she driven by love gold or what? The screenplay raises many questions in the minds of the audience and it never answers most of them. Hayward is OK in her role even if we never learn exactly what her aims may be. Mitchell overacts and Widmark's Fiske is a very talkative role that seems to be philosophical but doesn't make sense much of the time. We never know why Marlowe doesn't seem to have affection for Leah. Was he driven by her to look for gold? Did she marry him so that he would find a gold mine for her or was it for love? Or both? The most disappointing and frustrating role to me is Cooper's Hooker. Toward the end we find out that he formerly was a sheriff. But now he's a fortune hunter along with the rest heading West on a steamship for the gold fields of California. His lines are so poor I can't believe he would take this part in a movie. They seem to affect his whole character and he is wooden throughout the film. Cooper was 53 when this movie was made and he died seven years later of prostate cancer. I thought he may have been ill in this film because he seemed very old and never is there a closeup of his face. Yet he made a few very good films after this one.Then there are the Indians. Did Apaches range as far south as the jungles of southern Mexico? When Hooker and Fiske shoot the Indians pursuing them on the cliff trail they must have been terrible shots  or they shot the horses. I think every Indian that fell over the cliff screamedThe only reason this movie gets even five stars from me is for the scenery. This is one of the first films shot in Cinemascope which was the invention of Fox Films. I remember reading or hearing a commentary recently about one of the top directors who didn't like the wide panorama format of Cinemascope. But this clearly was a movie for that. And its sweeping panoramas and vistas shot in the mountains and jungles of southern Mexico are beautiful to behold. It's just too bad that Fox wasn't as interested in having a movie with a very good screenplay as it was in filming as many movies as it could in its new format.In this case the format is the only reason to see this movie. Unless one wants to see a top cast in a poor movie with a terrible script and some weak to very bad performances. If viewers are interested in seeing a Western about gold and greed I recommend a couple of excellent films. Mackenna's Gold of 1969 has a top notch cast with Gregory Peck Omar Sharif Telly Savalas Keenan Wynn Lee J. Cobb Raymond Massey and Julie Newmar. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre of 1948 won three Oscars and starred Humphrey Bogart Walter Huston Tim Holt and Bruce Bennett.".

The Fox Western Classics DVD version of Garden of Evil reminded me in terms of picture quality of the first time I saw Garden of Evil on a theater screen when it was originally released in 1954.The movie itself is a fascinating story of greed fear honor love and lust. The on location scenery in Southern Mexico is spectacular as seen on the DVD I referred to. The last 31 minutes of the movie in my opinion are the best. Those 31 minutes feature the 6 principle characters in the movie trying to save their lives by fleeing from the apaches who are following them and trying to kill them. Some of the six don't make it and are killed by the Apaches. To see who survives and why be sure to see the movie. P.S.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't think anyone would argue that this is one of the better Westerns ever made. The story has Susan Hayward's husband trapped in a gold mine in a hinterland of Mexico inhabited by Apaches. She finds four men at loose ends in a seaside cantina  the strong and silent Gary Cooper the cynical gambler Richard Widmark the hypomanic and libidinous Cameron Mitchell and the proud and competent Victor Mendoza who is a Mexican you can tell because he wears a big floppy sombrero and speaks only Spanish. Hayward hires these four guys to ride with her through dangerous country rescue her husband and return with the couple to town. Hayward was a decent actress in the right part but as a lowdown gold digger in Terra Incognita she doesn't cut it. Her grooming is impeccable as if Sidney Guilaroff were hiding behind one of the cactus.The film didn't cost much to make though the principles were all boxoffice boffo at the time. I guess that's where most of the money went to salaries and to the film's technology. It's in glorious Cinemascope the movies' answer to television and the Michoacan locations are glorious. Bernard Hermann contributed the only musical score he ever wrote for a Western.Nothing  nada  seems to have been left over to construct a coherent narrative. Nobody's motives are especially clear. Worse than that sometimes they're incomprehensible. Try to figure out what the relationship between Susan Hayward and her husband Hugh Marlowe are. Does he love her? Does she love him? Do they hate each other? It isn't that such ambivalent attitudes aren't found in real life. They're the stuff of it. It's just that the writers seemed to have no idea what they were trying to get across.And it's the same with the other characters. Richard Widmark's role for instance is written at the beginning almost as a familiar stereotype the untrusting and untrustworthy man of fortune who may either sacrifice his life for a dame in distress or strike like a rattlesnake  but he turns out to be just another one of the good guys. The Apaches are given a motive for their banzai attacks but what a motive it is! They don't mind two loners digging away in a mine but SIX people trigger the charge of the light brigade.The dialog is reflects the overall conception of character listless and done as if by numbers. If the earth was made of gold I guess people would kill just for a handful of dirt Cooper philosophizes. What does that mean? None of that takes away from the visual imagery. Man volcanic rocks and all it is a splendidly scenic place where certain types might be happy to roll around naked in the black ash. Nice job there.I can't help mentioning the audio commentary on the DVD. It's all about Bernard Hermann's score and it's both instructive and amusing though the four contributors didn't intend it to be funny. Hermann's biographer is heard along with a film historian and two film composers and they sit around bitching about how in today's industry the composer is ground under the heels of the director and those to whom they contemptuously refer as sound designers. They all laud Hermann one of those filmic composers who unlike Henry Mancini and some others had never written tunes into their musical scores. You won't hear Laura Moon River or Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darlin'. Instead Hermann included diverse themes or leitmotifs for the settings and characters sometimes only a few notes. As one commentator puts it it's as if a Hermann score consisted of endless repetitions of Jeepers Creepers without ever getting to Where'd you get those eyes?".

Hermann's biographer is heard along with a film historian and two film composers and they sit around bitching about how in today's industry the composer is ground under the heels of the director and those to whom they contemptuously refer as sound designers. They all laud Hermann one of those filmic composers who unlike Henry Mancini and some others had never written tunes into their musical scores. You won't hear Laura Moon River or Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darlin'. Instead Hermann included diverse themes or leitmotifs for the settings and characters sometimes only a few notes. As one commentator puts it it's as if a Hermann score consisted of endless repetitions of Jeepers Creepers without ever getting to Where'd you get those eyes?";

	schema:headline " Tense morality play. Greed is the great evil.";
	schema:reviewBody "The Garden of Evil is a sharply focused morality play with a clear message greed is the ultimate evil in the world. And each of us must reject it or be consumed by it. If the earth was made of gold men would die for a handful of it'.The premise of the film is simple enough. On their way around South America to the California gold fields three American men are stranded in a Mexican seaport while their ship waits repairs. An American woman Leah Fuller hires them to rescue her husband John who is trapped in a gold mine located deep in Indian Territory. All the ingredients for an action packed western are here. The men will fight over the woman steal millions in gold and kill lots of Indians along the way. It's the 1950s so we have no moral dilemma over the rights of Native Americans.And if the plot wasn't easy enough each character is predictable as well or so we think.The film is replete with metaphors. Leah is a metaphor. She is stunningly beautiful and knows it. Ordinary women would wear baggy shirts and trousers in the rugged wild. But she wears a figure revealing blouse and full skirt. Her manner shows contempt. Instead of speaking directly she walks away from men then stops tosses her hair as she turns and looks down her nose at them to speak. Her body language is clear. She hates men because they all want her. They make fools of themselves over her. She uses her beauty to manipulate men. Her husband even says so to her face later in the film. I think she hates herself for what she is.Fiske is a professional gambler and practiced coward. He actually plays two characters himself and an almost detached master of ceremonies. He continually narrates and comments on events to Hooker and the others. He doesn't want Leah but says the others especially Hooker do her bidding. Fiske doesn't care about anything not even his own life. He even says so when Luke Daly draws a gun on him. Fiske will never do anything for anyone but himself. So he says.Luke Daly is a crude intimidating gunslinger. He can best any man and have any woman. So he thinks.Almost as a cinematic afterthought Vicente Madariaga  joins the group. Neither brave nor heroic he is almost cartoonish. Speaking only Spanish he doesn't relate to the Americans. He is just there' and I'm not sure why. Perhaps a movie filmed in Mexico during the 1950s needs a token stereotypical Mexican in its cast. Like the Indians in this film Vicente is more of a prop than a character. Since this film reflects our national bigotry of the period we don't pity him any more than we do the Indians lurking in the hills. Today this aspect of the film makes me uncomfortable.All the characters are superficial except Hooker. Tall quiet and aloof he is above everything and everyone. He always knows and does the right thing. Fiske even tells him again and again you always know everything'. His blunt perception of life is summed up when Leah tells him that the Indians believe evil spirits inhabit the mountains. She asks if he believes in evil spirits. Hooker replies I believe in Indians'.Interestingly Hooker is virtually the same character Benjamin Trane that Cooper plays in his next film Vera Cruz. It too takes place in Mexico and the plot centers around a large quantity of gold. It's a good film formula.The trip to the gold mine is fraught with metaphors of the danger ahead. The mountain trail is long and narrow with sharp deadly drop offs. Along the way a tin plate falls from a saddlebag and ricochets noisily off the rocks as it plummets to the canyon floor reminding them all of what awaits if they slip up on their way. At one point where the trail has given way each horse and rider must jump a gap to the far side another sign that going and coming back will not be easy.So far each cast member behaves as expected. After making camp one night Daly gets drunk and makes a play for Leah. We already know he will fail badly. Then Hooker humiliates him further in the resultant fistfight. He is shamed so badly we almost feel sorry for him. To his credit Hooker consoles Daly afterward rather than chastising him. Interestingly off camera Cameron Mitchell Daly got drunk one night and made a real pass at Susan Hayward. She had to fight him off. Life imitates art.Now the true characters start to emerge. Leah doesn't hate all men she just hasn't met the right one yet. Daly is not really a tough guy. And we start to doubt Fiske's assertion that he isn't interested in Leah. And Hooker is Hooker.POSSIBLE SPOILERArriving at the mine the group finds John Fuller still alive. He has to be in order to give purpose to the film. He hates his wife for making him love her so much. His being trapped in the mineshaft is an obvious metaphor for his marriage to Leah. As spokesman for all the men she has manipulated and destroyed over the years he will remind her she is cold and heartless until the day he dies.And at this point we know John Fuller indeed has to die. But only after remaining alive long enough for Leah to prove she would come back for him. The entire point of her rescuing him is to redeem herself. But as long as John Fuller is alive Leah can't have Hooker. Besides we know Hooker is too honorable to steal another man's wife so it's just a matter of time before the Indians kill Fuller and eliminate the barrier between Hooker and Leah.As one astute commentator already noted we never actually see the Indians. They are always just out of view shadowy figures who pick off the cowboys one by one. They are not even the real enemy. The real enemy stalking the group is their own greed. The Indians just represent the price they pay for it physical and spiritual death. Quite symbolically the Indians only start to stir after the group gets to the mine and the gold.Now the film's real moral emerges and at this point I am particularly impressed with the director's next move. To emphasize the differences among the cast members and to tell us their individual fates he reveals their true colors almost simultaneously. Hooker wants to rig up a horse drawn litter to carry Fuller when the party tries to escape at nightfall. But he's not doing it for Fuller. He's not even doing it for Leah. He's doing it for himself for his own honor. Saving Fuller means he can never have Leah even though he clearly wants her. Hooker has faced his greed the desire for another man's wife and turned it down. He will live. We knew he would.Fiske shows his humanity when he tells Leah outright that he cares about her and wants to stay behind to play decoy to the Indians while she and the others escape. True to her character up to this point she bluntly says she doesn't care about him at all.Meanwhile Daly and Vicente show no interest in saving Fuller or anyone else. Their greed blinds them. They get drunk where'd they keep finding all the booze? and load their saddlebags with stolen gold. This will slow them down literally and spiritually. They will die.Finally Leah pretends to show some compassion. She tells Hooker to lead her husband and the others out of the mountains back to safety while she stays behind and provides the decoy for the Indians by stoking a campfire all night. Fiske immediately sees through her. He tells Hooker this is nothing more than pretense because Leah knows Hooker will not leave her to die. When Hooker knocks Leah unconscious and puts her on a horse to go with them it is another metaphor. Hooker is stronger than Leah which is what she has always wanted in a man. Leah and Hooker are going to have each other.The only thing left is for them to ride off into the sunset together. But in order for that to happen they must survive the trek back through the mountains defeat the Indians and most important lose the other cast members.Now everything comes to a head. Fuller knows he's lost Leah. Rather than face that fact he opts to save his dignity the only way he can by sacrificing himself on behalf of the group. His being on a litter slows them down so he gets Daly to help him get up on his horse so he can ride off before Hooker stops him. Since Daly is the most despicable character in the bunch he commits the most despicable act and sends Fuller to his death. In short order the group finds Fuller's mutilated dead body staked out by the Indians. He's lost his life but saved his soul.Having served his purpose as the villain Daly is quickly dispatched by the Indians. And Vicente does a protracted death dance as the again unseen Indians shoot arrow after arrow into him from all sides.Now only Hooker Leah and Fiske remain. They head back along the mountain trail but the Indians finally catch up. The only way out is for one of them to stay behind and fend off the Indians while the other two escape. We already know how it will turn out but for honor's sake Hooker and Fiske have to make it a fair contest so they cut cards. Fiske wins which means he loses. Hooker loses which means he wins. Fiske will stay hold off the Indians and die. Hooker gets Leah.There are tearful goodbyes. Leah finally acknowledges Fiske. She hugs him. We know she doesn't love him but she is giving a dying man who has saved her life his due. Hooker and Leah ride off. End of Story.Not quite. Once out of danger Hooker tells Leah that Fiske cheated him. Hooker should have stayed back and died. He tells her that Fiske was a better man than he was and that he needs to tell Fiske so. At this point Hooker and Leah have not actually committed to each other. Perhaps Hooker just wants to give Leah one last chance to reject him because he doesn't tell her to wait for him. Instead he just says Maybe I'll see you sometime' and heads back to where Fiske is fighting the Indians.Hooker finds that Fiske who couldn't hit the side of a barn with a rifle' has left the hillside littered with dead Indians. He's mortally wounded but stays alive long enough to acknowledge his own honor and Hooker's as well. He tells Hooker to take Leah and go build a life with her. By doing so he has given the ultimate permission for them to be together. And for the last time he says You know everything. You always know everything.' Fiske dies but his soul is saved.Hooker has now done right by everyone. He heads back up the trail and catches up with Leah at the top of the mountain. In the film's last metaphor we see the two horses and riders in silhouette. Leah hesitates at first but then pauses and turns back to meet Hooker. They have made the commitment to each other. Then they literally ride off together into the sunset.".

He's lost his life but saved his soul.Having served his purpose as the villain Daly is quickly dispatched by the Indians. And Vicente does a protracted death dance as the again unseen Indians shoot arrow after arrow into him from all sides.Now only Hooker Leah and Fiske remain. They head back along the mountain trail but the Indians finally catch up. The only way out is for one of them to stay behind and fend off the Indians while the other two escape. We already know how it will turn out but for honor's sake Hooker and Fiske have to make it a fair contest so they cut cards. Fiske wins which means he loses. Hooker loses which means he wins. Fiske will stay hold off the Indians and die. Hooker gets Leah.There are tearful goodbyes. Leah finally acknowledges Fiske. She hugs him. We know she doesn't love him but she is giving a dying man who has saved her life his due. Hooker and Leah ride off. End of Story.Not quite. Once out of danger Hooker tells Leah that Fiske cheated him. Hooker should have stayed back and died. He tells her that Fiske was a better man than he was and that he needs to tell Fiske so. At this point Hooker and Leah have not actually committed to each other. Perhaps Hooker just wants to give Leah one last chance to reject him because he doesn't tell her to wait for him. Instead he just says Maybe I'll see you sometime' and heads back to where Fiske is fighting the Indians.Hooker finds that Fiske who couldn't hit the side of a barn with a rifle' has left the hillside littered with dead Indians. He's mortally wounded but stays alive long enough to acknowledge his own honor and Hooker's as well. He tells Hooker to take Leah and go build a life with her. By doing so he has given the ultimate permission for them to be together. And for the last time he says You know everything. You always know everything.' Fiske dies but his soul is saved.Hooker has now done right by everyone. He heads back up the trail and catches up with Leah at the top of the mountain. In the film's last metaphor we see the two horses and riders in silhouette. Leah hesitates at first but then pauses and turns back to meet Hooker. They have made the commitment to each other. Then they literally ride off together into the sunset.";
