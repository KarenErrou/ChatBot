Why it was not included in AFI's 100 movies of all time I'll never understand. Why Big chunks did make AFI's 100 best movie quotes is beyond explanation. Thank God I went to the Bahamas in 1988. Thank God I got a horrible sunburn and had to stay inside watching TV. Thank the lord the hotel had HBO.

One female wrestler throws her opponent mistakenly on to her small nerd of a boyfriend sitting front of crowd next to an obese woman with a raucous laugh which is one hoot itself. A rich family send their unmannerly daughter to this Stewardess School where the father gets her biker boyfriend this new spit shine bike. He's taken. He's entrance into the Stewardess School is a classic. Her I'll miss you to him ends with him belching then pulling a donut before shooting off back down the hallway and steps on his new prized possession. There are so many cheap laughs in this infectious b comedy. The plot here has anyone joining and put through a rigorous ten week program where at the end they're demoted to the worst airline Trimboli airlines where they're ulterior motives at hand here. On this airline there so happens to be an undercover officer surveying this show and when revealed right at the end you'll be engaged in hearty chuckles. Most is so funny too like at the start where he lets one go in an elevator a one liner prompting this or like when he asks a couple of girls if they wanna play hide the salami or when he mistakes a girl's smile off campus as an invitation where Mr better looking approaches and we can't forget his chesshire cat grin when he mistakes the showers as communal ones where our naked Sandrahl Bergman Murphy's Law literally tosses him out. And like all these type movies our students beat obstacles and come out good. Judy Landers almost resembling a particular scene in Doin Time is great if you're overweight and require a physical. Just send her in first. Also when at the welcoming meeting she tends to her kinky tricks again lip licking behind bending smooching bra fondling. See how she causes the director of the school to mispronounce his lines. So many funny moments so many funny mentions this is a truly overlooked b comedy that runs consistently all the way through. Don't be one of the overlooking party. You'll thank me in the morning.".

What they don't count on is that this particular school has lowered its standards to such a degree that all of their fellow students are predominantly losers as well. And this creates all kinds of problems for everyone trying to graduate. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this specific movie was essentially a recycled version of Police Academy with a few minor tweaks added in order to portray a slightly different setting. There isn't anything really new or original here. Yet having said all of that there are still small bits and pieces of humor here and there that might entertain a viewer on a rainy day. If nothing else it has a few attractive actresses like Mary Cadorette as Kelly Johnson Judy Landers Sugar Dubois and Julia Montgomery Pimmy Polk to brighten an otherwise lackluster film.

The production is in many ways extremely simple on par with TV programs for very young children. No attempt at all has been made to camouflage the strings that move the puppets while they could easily have been made of fine transparent nylon they are in fact plain black thread that stands out against the background. The puppets themselves while individually designed have a single fixed facial expression and look exactly like the scruffy plush toys they are and the Canalligator looks as if it is made of painted cardboard which it probably is. One gets the impression that this reflects a conscious decision by the film makers to dispense with any attempt at illusion rather than ineptitude. Especially as there are a few competently done and rather pretty optical effects in the humanly acted scenes showing that the film wasn't made entirely on a shoestring. The plot matches the production being a rather simplistic story about love courage kindness and freedom from prejudice  among rats and to some extent also alligators and men. A story fit for small children with a moral that it takes no subtlety to comprehend. Yet there is something likable about the film something that can appeal to adults as well. Perhaps I admire the stubbornness and courage it must have taken to produce and market a film like this or maybe I like to occasionally see simple storytelling without a multimillion dollar budget squandered on special effects and exotic locations. Perhaps I just sympathise with the idea that there is a place for films that aren't cool and hip and controversial and spectacular but just nice in a very modest and subdued way. In any case I'm glad and somewhat surprised that utterly unlikely films like this can be made in our time and day.".

Besides them this is a film however that consists almost exclusively of real people. The movie runs for 90 minutes and has actually quite a handful known actors in its cast for example Ben Stiller's dad or also Golden Globe nominees. You can check the cast list yourself to see who is on board. The writers and director are probably not too wellknown but they still did an okay job I guess. If you manage to embrace the fantasy aspect and don't take it too seriously then you may be in for a rewarding watch. I personally quite liked the rat characters and this maybe made a difference for the positive side in my opinion. I also liked that the film was not scared of making crucial decisions like a character's death. One weakness was perhaps that the film tried to be too emotional and too mindprovoking with its message but it's all good. I still think this can be a film especially for younger not too young audiences that can teach them an important lesson and entertain them too the most important thing. I know I was entertained and it's also not a problem that the film is really all about the rats overall and that the other human characters no matter if friend or foe don't get that much screen time.

Thus the entire series was dropped.After this Rathbone and Bruce continued doing Sherlock Holmes on the BBC as a series of radio productions. this included Mary Gordon who always played Mrs. Hudson With the success of the BBC radio serial Universal pictures in 1942 picked up Rathbone and Bruce to play Holmes and Watson. However because it was still during WWII Universal decided to set their Holmes in what was modern times. Universal did this for extremely practical reasons which had nothing to do with artistic interpretation. This was done as a cost cutting feature as the same sets and supporting actors as any keen eye would notice were then used in other films and vice versa. The other films usually featuring Bela Lugosi Lon Chaney Jr. or Boris Karloff Such a cost cutting feature would not have been possible had Universal set the films in Victorian London.Thus The Voice of Terror although the third time for the team of Rathbone and Bruce was the first film in the Sherlock Holmes series for Universal pictures.It is a grave misunderstanding to confuse the two series the first by 20th Century Fox and the second by Universal. The first were made in the 30s in prewar Hollywood with much larger budgets. The second were made during the war with the rationing and most understandable budget problems that accompanied such pictures of the day.Which brings us to the subject of the Voice of Terror. It happens to be my favorite of the Universal Sherlock Holmes movies despite it's short comings. Rathbone is still at the top of his game and doesn't have the bored to death with Holmes appearance he had by the time of his last Holmes film Dressed to Kill. Despite reusing the train crash from The Invisible Man the film has the tension and mystery intended to give audiences who still saw the Nazis as a real nightmare instead of the pantomime joke they have become today.Full of British patriotism and the stalwart attitude the British still display when their home is attacked as the recent London attacks prove. Thus the Voice of Terror is not really as much archaic hokum as the modern casual viewer might assume. Instead the same attitudes in display today remind us that the more times change even with Voice of Terror the more they remain the same.Thus enjoy The Voice of Terror even though it is only VERY LOOSELY based on the Conan Doyle great detective. The film is still a lot of fun and people forever when thinking of Holmes and Watson cannot fail to evoke the mental memory of Rathbone and Bruce.Worth the Watch.".

This one the first of the 20th Century FOX modern stories is based on HIS LAST BOW. But it has an interesting modern source to the tale as well as a secondary source from a nonConan Doyle writer.The original Conan Doyle story is chronologically the last one in the canon of 56 short stories and four novels by Sir Arthur. HIS LAST BOW was written in 1917 and was supposed to be a memoir of Holmes final espionage service for the British Government in wrecking the espionage work of one Heinrich Von Bork the Kaiser's most brilliant agent in England. There are references in it to zeppelins and other wartime machines and events including the involvement of Irish  American allies to the Kaiser against the hated British. Suffice it to say that it has what is the classic ending in terms of dialog for Holmes and Watson. This is the There's an east wind Watson.... dialog which actually ends this story. I am glad at least for this much that the screenplay writers knew enough to use this wonderful dialog to conclude the movie. To bring it up to date 1939  40 the story includes reference to the antics of one of the most aggravating people the British people faced between 1939 and 1945 Mr. William Joyce a.k.a. Lord Haw Haw. There are elements of Joyce in the character of Meade Thomas Gomez and the basic story in the film about the radio broadcasts. Joyce was an Irish American he was born in New York City who moved to England in the 1920s. He was a very intelligent man who felt he was ignored by too many inferior people and harbored great resentments as a result. This is Meade to a tee. Joyce happened to have a wonderful speaking voice but he looked rather ordinary. He gravitated to Fascist circles soon rising in the British Union of Fascists BUF and becoming a leading speaker and propagandist for Sir Oswald Mosley the wouldbe Fascist dictator of England. Mosley was quite an egomaniac but so was Joyce. After awhile a split developed between the men as Joyce felt that Mosley was depending too much on British democracy which Joyce despised. Joyce increasingly looked with admiration at the Nazi model more so than Mosley was ever willing to look. When the two nations drifted into war Joyce traveled to Germany and offered his services to Josef Goebbels. Goebbels knew a good thing when he could use it so he agreed. Joyce once war began had a German passport that was dated prior to September 1 1939. But he also had a British passport and an American passport. Joyce planned carefully to keep all three  just in case.Soon he began broadcasting in his nasal but pleasing voice as Lord Haw Haw. He was an expert in presenting brutality as an expected future way of life  Osama Bin Laden and Al Quaeda could take good lessons from Joyce's still surviving propaganda recordings. For the first three years of the war the British public had to live through his broadcasts on top of the Blitz by his allies in the Luftwaffe. At the time THE VOICE OF TERROR was made everyone in Britain the United States and the world knew who was the model for that radio voice of doom in the movie.I don't know if Joyce ever saw the film but he probably would have dismissed it as allied propaganda which it was. It might even have flattered him that he was targeted in it. At the time the Axis was winning the war Stalingrad El Alemein and Midway were in the future. But as the war turned against the Axis Joyce found that his role in Nazi circles was not as grand as he had hoped. Had they won against England probably he would have been important as Meade hoped to be in the film but as England and the U.S. and the Soviet Union advanced and were gradually joined by France in 1944 Hitler and Goebbels basically treated Joyce as a paid employee. He took to drink  he could see the war was going badly despite the propaganda he spewed out. When the regime collapsed in ruins in May 1945 Joyce got shot by an Allied soldier and was returned to the British to stand trial for treason.It's an interesting trial if you study the business about the three passports. To this day there is an actually good argument to say Joyce had not committed treason in 1939  45 because the German passport made him a German citizen. But his defense was brushed aside he was found guilty and he was hanged.The third element in the film was the novel THE GREAT IMPERSONATION by E. Phillips Oppenheimer. Set before World War I it describes how a German aristocrat meets his exact double Sir Everard Dominey in Africa and decides to kill him and take his place in British society in order to help German war plans. This is part of the conclusion of the film regarding one of the council.It is a good film because of the performances of Rathbone Bruce Henry Daniell Reginald Denny Evelyn Ankers and best of all Thomas Gomez as the powerhungryparanoid Meade. But it is not among the best of the Sherlock Holmes series. As for Lord Haw Haw it is not the only film that his character popped up in. Trevor Howard plays a character based on him in RUN FOR THE SUN with Richard Widmark.".

Joyce planned carefully to keep all three  just in case.Soon he began broadcasting in his nasal but pleasing voice as Lord Haw Haw. He was an expert in presenting brutality as an expected future way of life  Osama Bin Laden and Al Quaeda could take good lessons from Joyce's still surviving propaganda recordings. For the first three years of the war the British public had to live through his broadcasts on top of the Blitz by his allies in the Luftwaffe. At the time THE VOICE OF TERROR was made everyone in Britain the United States and the world knew who was the model for that radio voice of doom in the movie.I don't know if Joyce ever saw the film but he probably would have dismissed it as allied propaganda which it was. It might even have flattered him that he was targeted in it. At the time the Axis was winning the war Stalingrad El Alemein and Midway were in the future. But as the war turned against the Axis Joyce found that his role in Nazi circles was not as grand as he had hoped. Had they won against England probably he would have been important as Meade hoped to be in the film but as England and the U.S. and the Soviet Union advanced and were gradually joined by France in 1944 Hitler and Goebbels basically treated Joyce as a paid employee. He took to drink  he could see the war was going badly despite the propaganda he spewed out. When the regime collapsed in ruins in May 1945 Joyce got shot by an Allied soldier and was returned to the British to stand trial for treason.It's an interesting trial if you study the business about the three passports. To this day there is an actually good argument to say Joyce had not committed treason in 1939  45 because the German passport made him a German citizen. But his defense was brushed aside he was found guilty and he was hanged.The third element in the film was the novel THE GREAT IMPERSONATION by E. Phillips Oppenheimer. Set before World War I it describes how a German aristocrat meets his exact double Sir Everard Dominey in Africa and decides to kill him and take his place in British society in order to help German war plans. This is part of the conclusion of the film regarding one of the council.It is a good film because of the performances of Rathbone Bruce Henry Daniell Reginald Denny Evelyn Ankers and best of all Thomas Gomez as the powerhungryparanoid Meade. But it is not among the best of the Sherlock Holmes series. As for Lord Haw Haw it is not the only film that his character popped up in. Trevor Howard plays a character based on him in RUN FOR THE SUN with Richard Widmark.";

	schema:reviewBody "Basil Rathbone's third appearance as Arthur Conan Doyle's eccentric sleuth and the first in Universal's series of 12 films in which the master detective is transplanted from Victorian England to the modern era in which the films were made. Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror was not that unusual in that until 20th Century Fox produced The Hound of the Baskervilles in 1939 most previous Holmes films had also placed our hero in contemporary society. It was not until this film however that the contemporary aspects were given such strong emphasis. There's no Moriarty on hand this time as Holmes and Watson played of course by Nigel Bruce join Britain in battling the Nazis. It's all a little awkward but there is some fine atmosphere especially in a scene in which Holmes and Watson visit a seedy pub in search of information. The cast is good with Thomas Gomez as a very effective villain Evelyn Ankers as the proverbial bad girl with a heart of gold and as a diplomat the wickedly suave Henry Daniell who would return to play Professor Moriarty in The Woman in Green. Best of all is Rathbone who is razor sharp despite a very peculiar hairstyle that looks like it belongs in a gladiator flick. The series improved considerably once Roy William Neill took over as director with the second film and later entries that did not emphasize the modern concept like Spider Woman and most particularly The Scarlet Claw are far superior but Voice of Terror is still an entertaining show perfect viewing on a rainy fog shrouded night.".

	schema:reviewBody "When the sinister Voice of Terror taunts England over the radio with news of acts of sabotage against the Allies the Inner Council of British Intelligence has no choice but to turn to England's greatest detective Sherlock Holmes Basil Rathbone. Holmes with help from his criminal underworld connections investigates and uncovers the true identity of the Voice of Terror.After two fine films at Fox and a threeyear gap the Sherlock Holmes series movies to Universal. The change of studios also brings with it the updating of Holmes to the 1940s where he understandably spends the early entries in the series battling Nazis. This change upsets many purists who already have problems with the Rathbone series for its portrayal of Watson as comic relief and its deviations from the books. If you're one of those I doubt anything I can say will alter your opinion. I don't happen to be bothered by the changes. I actually enjoy the movies more because of them.As in his two films at Fox Rathbone here is the perfect Holmes. One of my favorite scenes from any of his Holmes films occurs in this one when Holmes and Watson go to a seedy pub frequented by criminals. One of the criminals a particularly frightening thug Sherlock put away years before approaches the duo and we're led to believe any second now he will try to exact some violent revenge on Holmes. I won't spoil how the scene ends but pay attention to the way Rathbone plays this entire scene. It's wonderful stuff. I would be remiss in doing any kind of review for Voice of Terror without mentioning Rathbone's hairstyle. For some reason they decided to give him a rather sillylooking haircut where the hair on the sides is combed forward. It's hard not to chuckle when you first see it. Thankfully he wears a hat for a lot of the picture.For his part Nigel Bruce is a great sidekick. He has less to do here than some of the other movies but as always he's pleasant and fun to watch. The supporting cast is great with the likes of Henry Daniell Reginald Denny and Thomas Gomez giving solid turns. Special mention goes to Evelyn Ankers who gives one of her most different performances here. She plays the wife of a criminal killed for helping Holmes who then agrees to help the detective herself. Not for the sake of law  order but for the love of country. Her best scene is when she gives a rousing speech to her fellow criminals and lowlifes enlisting them to help Holmes and England.This is a solid start to the Universal Holmes series. Not the best but very entertaining nonetheless. Reading some of the older reviews here is a bit stomachchurning. Jeez you'd think these people WANTED the Nazis to win! They seem so bitter and angry over the film being proEngland during World War II. What's this world coming to when people hate patriotism and nationalism so much they gripe about it more than the Nazis? The fact that most of these reviewers identify themselves as being from England or America makes the whole thing doubly sad.".

The plot takes on a different stance from usual Holmes mysteries and this time sees him working for the British government after a series of mysterious broadcasts from 'the Voice of Terror' baffle the country. Holmes is put in a situation where he's working for someone bigger than himself and it puts something of a damper on the usual mystery plot. Because this film was made at the height of the second world war it's social comments are a little out of date now but you can see how the plot may have been frightening to the people at the time that this was made. Another thing that lets the film down is propaganda. It's obvious why the film is patriotic but it goes over the top sometimes and Rathbone's monologue in a public house is of particular cringeworthy note.

Despite not really liking that one I decided to give this one a stab anyway.  The modern setting seems as much a way of using the films as wartime propaganda rather than as a way of improving the film or anything like that.  For that reason this film struggles simply because all the changes have been made for that reason and hence if they do act as an improvement then it is only by chance.The plot is reasonable but not great.  It is more about getting the Nazis rather than Holmes' taking on any one foe or trying to solve a specific crime.  Rathbone is still good but he looks like a modern fop in his dapper clothes and silly hairdo!  Bruce is good but not used as much as he has been in other films.  The Nazi's have no character and the support cast is not that strong.  Of the film only the conclusion is exciting but even that basically is hinted at heavily all the way through.Overall this has all the stuff that I like about Holmes but the modern setting really hurts it.  Instead of a good plot an existing story is twisted to be set in WW2 and deducting is replaced by propaganda and triumphalism over a foe that is never anything more than a caricature.".

Of the film only the conclusion is exciting but even that basically is hinted at heavily all the way through.Overall this has all the stuff that I like about Holmes but the modern setting really hurts it.  Instead of a good plot an existing story is twisted to be set in WW2 and deducting is replaced by propaganda and triumphalism over a foe that is never anything more than a caricature.";

I have been watching this movie off and on for over 30 years and it has never looked as crystal clear as it does in UCLA's stunning print on the recent DVD. Sound is sharp and clear too with some lines of dialogue understandable to my ears for the very first time. Speaking of dialogue it's quite an indictment of today's IdiotsRUs culture that a cheap Bmovie from 60 years ago sounds like Shakespeare now. For example when Basil Rathbone's Holmes reminds Thomas Gomez that the English believe every life has value the sweaty little Nazi sneers A quaint notion of an even quainter nation. Not bad. The plot purports to be based on Sir Arthur's wonderful endpaper Holmes story His Last Bow but it uses nothing beyond the villain's last name and the great closing lines. In its day the British were outraged at this movie with its suggestion of treachery and treason at the highest levels of government and the country owing its salvation to the noble bravery of a prostitute. Doesn't sound so shocking now does it?".

	schema:reviewBody "The budget was cut drastically when Holmes and Watson moved from Fox to Universal Studios but this isn't as poorly done as I'd expected. Not that this resembles the original Sherlock Holmes in many ways. Rathbone makes a couple of improbably deductions at the beginning but that puts an end to his penetrating insights. After that the story turns into a rather ordinary antiGerman B feature. Instead of Sherlock Holmes it could be Boston Blackie or Charlie Chan. It doesn't look or sound like ConanDoyle's character until the very end when Rathbone recites the last passage from the last story a patriotic analogy of war as weather.Yet it really wasn't bad for a couple of reasons. One is that the story itself involves a very real and important threat to England at the time of shooting an invasion across the channel by German troops. Actually the Germans were nowhere near ready but no one knew that. As a potential martial event the invasion of Great Britain stands somewhat higher in importance than Doctor Tobel's fictional bomb sight in a later episode.Then too Holmes is a bit different. Make Up gave Rathbone a few wisps of hair curling forward over his temple but he didn't yet look like a lithograph of Lord Byron. And Rathbone seems to bring more gusto to the role although it may just be my imagination. He was pretty fagged out by the end of the series. Nigel Bruce as Doctor Watson is far less than the mumbling and disgruntled companion he was to become.And somebody ought to mention the cinematography of Woody Bredell. Maybe it's too dark in some scenes but it's always dramatic. Too bad the budget confined all the scenes to indoor stages. In none of his movies does Holmes get to spend much time outdoors. Even when he's on a cruise ship in the Mediterranean Pursuit to Algiers he's stuck on an indoor stage.The cast are a bunch of stalwarts. They hit their marks speak their lines and do what they're supposed to. The real heavy the mastermind behind the Voice of Terror eluded me. I had picked Henry Daniell. He was to play Moriarty in a later film. Okay so the writers foxed me but I was wrong for good reasons. When has Henry Daniell ever been innocent of anything? He was Lord Wolfingham in The Sea Hawk. He was always a bad guy. Even in his best most ambiguous role the Scots doctor in Val Lewton's The Body Snatchers he was driven by his ego to grave robbing. And that face  that bony but flabby jaw those thin lips that icy voice. Maybe he wasn't the villain here but he SHOULD have been.There's something else too that occurred to me while watching this. I saw it as a child on rerelease or television and I recall vividly the scene in which Holmes is listening to a performance of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony while he fiddles with a chart and watches an oscilloscope. It's of no importance but it was the first time in my life I realized there was more to Beethoven's Fifth than just the familiar opening of the first movement  dadadaDAHHH. The experience almost made my hair stand on end. There might be more to all classical music. So I went on to study composition and theory changed my name for professional reasons to John Williams made millions partnered a parade of pretty girls and have had a satisfying career as a composer. All thanks to this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "After two features produced at Twentieth Century Fox in 1939 Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson moved to Universal Studios in 1942. Like the original Conan Doyle stories the two Fox films were set in the Victorian era but when the master sleuth and his side kick worked at Universal the plots were moved to the thenpresent day which was World War II.

Having been last seen in a pair of 1939 releases The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes for 20th CenturyFox this edition was an easy attempt for a new film series 19421946. Aside from its lead actors now performing their original roles for another studio the Victorian characters of the 1890s have been modernized into the now contemporary locale set during the London blitz of World War II. For this rather drastic change the opening title explains its reasoning for it Sherlock Holmes the immortal character of fiction created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is ageless invincible and unchanging. In solving significant problems of the present day he remains  as ever  the supreme master of deductive reasoning. And there you have it. In true Hollywood fashion Holmes and Watson having moved fifty years into the future from a trip down the Time Tunnel physically showing Holmes Watson and their landlady Mrs. Watson all haven't aged a bit. The only change would be their clothing. Gone are the horse and buggy replaced by automobiles. Gone are the gaslit street lamps replaced by electric lightbulbs. What retains here is Sherlock Holmes masterful reasoning of crime solving that never goes out of style. For this newly formatted series opening the story based on Conan Doyle's His Last Bow starts off with a view of Germany before revealing those listening to a radio broadcast from an Axis enemy mastermind known as The Voice of Terror predicting various acts of sabotage that are to take place in their homeland of England. Sir Ryan Barham Reginald Denny of the British Inner Council calls in ace detective Sherlock Holmes Basil Rathbone and Doctor Watson Nigel Bruce of 221B Baker Street to help stop Nazi saboteurs working in England. During his latest assignment Holmes soon finds his life threatened followed by Gavin Robert Barron stumbling into his apartment to keel over with a knife in his back. His last words before dying is Christopher. Later Holmes and Watson come to Limehouse in a very rough section of town to notify Gavin's girlfriend Kitty Evelyn Ankers of what has just occurred. Holmes acquires further assistance from the young girl whose determined to fight for England and get the one responsible for Gavin's death. Because of her secret meetings with R.F. Meade Thomas Gomez  in movie debut it is uncertain whether Kitty is secretly working for or against this supposed Nazi adding more suspense to the story which is the writer's intention. Also in the supporting cast are Henry Daniell Anthony Lloyd Leyland Hodgeson Captain Roland Shore Montagu Love General Jerome Lawford Olaf Hytten Admiral Fabian Prentiss and Hillary Brooke Jill Grandis a female taxi cab driver. Mary Gordon as Mrs. Hudson appears with no screen credit.Placing Sherlock Holmes in contemporary times is nothing new having been done previously in some earlier screen adaptations notably SHERLOCK HOLMES Fox 1932 where Holmes Clive Brook and Watson Reginald Owen are seen in 1930s Chicago. Universal's view of modernizing Holmes was to take advantage of its dated wartime propaganda theme commonly used in countless other films in the early forties. After a few more similar warrelated themes the writers of this series eventually had it phased out in favor of either original screenplays or those adapted whole or in part from the Conan Doyle stories. Many Holmes fanciers label Rathbone's initial Universal entry to be somewhat on the weak side making its 65 minute presentation to feel a bit longer that it actually is but overall it does have some good points too. Fortunately under Roy William Neil who was to direct all future films in the series some even improving from its predecessor even to a point of reviving Holmes' arch enemy of Professor Moriarty such as THE WOMAN IN GREEN 1945 as played by Henry Daniell the same Daniell who appears in this edition of THE VOICE OF TERROR.Sherlock Holmes is ageless and quite popular proving so to what developed into a 16 film theatrical series that lead to Sherlock Holmes festivals quite commonly broadcast on television on any given weekend from the 1950s to 1980s mainly those Universal editions that open with Holmes and Watson with credits superimposed over their images as the camera follows them walking through the street of uncertainty.

Regardless of how many actors have played Holmes and Watson on screen the best remains for many to be the one and only Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce.

It has its flaws but they by no means keep it from being an enjoyable movie with good characters and plenty of action. Though the credits cite the Arthur Conan Doyle story His Last Bow as the source it is actually an entirely new story with only a handful of minor elements remaining from the original.The choice to move the stories from the original Victorian setting to the then present meant that the new series would never have quite the same feel as the Doyle originals but as some compensation it allowed for Holmes to be portrayed battling enemies that were then foremost in viewers' minds. This story of The Voice of Terror makes full use of anxieties and unpleasant possibilities that must have been only too frequently in the minds of its original viewers. It still succeeds in building tension and interest with its tale of Nazicreated disasters and mocking threats.The story is very interesting although it has a few overly convenient turns and plot holes. It gave Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce a chance to perform the kinds of material that they had already gotten used to doing together. They are helped considerably here by the supporting cast which includes Reginald Denny and Henry Daniell as the most prominent members of the government council that is employing Holmes's services. But it is Thomas Gomez and Evelyn Ankers who really make a difference. Gomez has one of his best character roles as a crafty enemy agent and Ankers does a fine job as a woman of low standing who gets a chance to serve her country.The series would get even better as it went along as Rathbone and Bruce continued to develop their camaraderie and as the production team eased into a familiar formula that could be varied as needed. But this one already got the series off to a solid start with a good movie that is still worth seeing.".

How over 30 of the ratings for this film are 10s is beyond meespecially since Basil Rathbone made several other Holmes movies that were lightyears better than this one. In fact this film and SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE HOUSE OF FEAR are pretty bad movies...saved only because Rathbone was such a 'swell' actor nice 40s word huh?.Why was it so poor compared to the other films? Well first off the best Rathbone Sherlock Holmes films were the first two made by Fox StudiosTHE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES and THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES. None of the Universal versions of the series come close to the quality of these filmsespecially since Holmes and Watson live in the late Victorian London of the original stories. Putting Holmes in the role as a propagandaspewing enemy of Hitler just doesn't seem right! Second the plot is absolutely paper thin and Holmes doesn't do much 'detecting' at allat least not like the Holmes of old. He jumps to lots of conclusions and the movie simply moves too fast to allow for realism in his deductions. Third the film simply isn't fun or interestingand this is what made many of this series so worth seeing. And fourth several times throughout the film Holmes turned towards the camera and began reciting VERY HEAVYHANDED propaganda speeches. And while I love American propaganda films from WWII I can't stand to be preached at and having it all laid on so thick!! So my advice is STILL watch films from the seriesjust save this one and THE HOUSE OF FEAR for your last films to watch. Otherwise you might be tempted to stop before you've seen them all.".

	schema:reviewBody "Usually with these Holmes movies I get caught up in some metanarrative about the nature of the British people and how they redefined themselves during the war. Or perhaps I wonder about how this truly novel idea of having a character that discovers the story has been coopted.But this Holmes project is unusual. It is photographed so dramatically it is a cross between M ironically and Casablanca of the same year in fact Terror and Casablanca were in production at the same time but of course with scant possibility of overlap. The story is typical and everything else except how carefully this was framed and lit. And that leads me to a conundrum. When Citizen Kane came along just the year before among its other narrative inventions was the technique of anticipative framing. That means that each shot is composed not to show what's happening in the shot but primarily to provide a memory to hold when you are in the next shot. It was an amazing invention made more radical because as all the other narrative experiments were visited this anticipative framing adapted to the mode of the moment. In later Welles projects especially the ones we don't fully have the arc of the film wasn't in the story at all  what we normally think of as the story  but in the rhythm of this narrative dance.Kane changed everything and immediately. You can see it here but not everyone could follow the dynamic nature of what they had seen.With that background what we have here is each shot composed in the manner natural to the stage and amplified by the Germans. Ironic. The idea here is to use the frame to illustrate the scene. There are four key sets here. The first is the room of the inner council ceilingless and huge. The radio is bigger than a car. Then you have an underground bar an abandoned warehouse and finally a destroyed remote church. Each reflects some element of the other. Each allows some mystery.In all these the people move in and across in very studied and elaborate motions. It's very German it's what a German would want to do to Kane so its strange that the story is about rooting out German moles in influential places.And it is doubly strange given Holmes' talent. No matter whose adaptation you encounter Holmes is a man who can see what others cannot its almost always sight and who takes the features of that vision to the next step. So if any movie character could use the new vision of Kane it would be Holmes. Nope not here the Nazis win. But it is a beautiful war.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this series for the first time in 1992 when it was on Polish TV but I have come back to it many times with great pleasure since then. THE STRAUSS DYNASTY shows the lives of Johann Strauss father and then his sons the most famous of whom was Johann Strauss son called Schani.The whole story is shown with the focus on family life of the Strausses and their career. Their music the unforgettable waltzes can be appreciated throughout. I especially like the scene in Paris where Johann Strauss presents his new waltz An Der Schonen Blauen Donau. At first no one seems to be keen but later.... Other moments worth considering are the ones showing Schani's journey to Russia.Besides you can find very good cast in this series. The main roles are played by Anthony Higgins famous British actor and Stephen Mc Gann who can be found in many J. Chomsky's films. Among others Alice Krige is excellent in the role of an insane Olga Cherie Lunghi also performs very well as Schani's wife Yetti and an unforgettable John Gielgud. He isn't given much time on screen as old Drechsler but is equally unforgettable as in his great roles. Nevertheless he is excellent as always. John Rhys Davies gives a wonderful performance as prince Gribov these facial gestures the way he speaks consider a funny moment he describes Russia to Schani just before signing the contract concerning Schani's journey. And Lisa Harrow as Mama Strauss is unforgettable. She appropriately presents a woman of strong will ambition and of a good heart. Definitely the acting in this series IS of very high level!There are many other factors that make this film worth watching. Many scenes are touching especially the end when Schani is sitting on his armchair and coming back to important events in his life. He sees his father his brothers his childhood the women he loved. When his memory comes to the current events he closes his eyes and dies. I know that it may seem strange and longish but Marvin J. Chomsky most probably aimed at showing people's belief  when we die we see our lives.But the most important factor that talks for the mini series I think is the music itself. The director makes a perfect use of it entailing it in most of the scenes as a background. The lovers of the waltzes will absolutely love the film. The effect of THE STRAUSS DYNASTY is similar to their music. As a famous orchestra director Riccardo Muti said on the 1st of January 2004 in Vienna The music of Strauss unites the whole world. THIS SERIES DOES A SIMILAR JOB. Do watch it. You will not regret.".

Additionally horrific and expressionistic street scenes feature prominently in many films of this era. The street in this film is quite remarkable. Apparently the action automobiles and all takes place entirely within studio sets giving the filmmakers control over the lighting. And the lighting is great with nighttimelike scenes full of shadows and darkly lit corners. Staircases are also featured prominently as they are in many German pictures of the time.The Street is simply about a man who leaves his wife and humdrum life to seek the excitement of a Parisian street. He spends most of the story chasing after a prostitute thief which eventually leads him to prison and despair. He then returns to his previous life. Siegfried Kracauer in From Carlgari to Hitler A Psychological History of the German Film says the film is about going from rebellion to submissionforetelling the German people's submission to the Nazi regime. The Street is also another of Carl Meyer's instinct films as Kracauer calls them which also includes Backstairs Hintertreppe1921 and most notably The Last Laugh Der Letzte Mann1924. The characters in these films act instinctively which affords their stories to transcend intertitles. As with the other instinct films there are few intertitles in The Street.The lack of many title cards enhances the visual qualities of the picture. Moreover the street itself seems to take on a life of its own. It enters the film by tempting the man with a shadow play on his ceiling. And as fellow commenter hhole mentioned an optometrist's shop sign makes it seem as though the street is watching the man. The Street is impressively photographed and innovative for its expressionistic visuals and embodiment of the street.".

The writer and director is the Austrianborn Karl Grune and it is maybe his most famous work. At 75 minutes it is shorter than many of the other occasionally very long German silent films. The biggest name in the cast is certainly Max Schreck even if he does not play the main character in here. I personally am not too much a fan of the genre but this little movie here had a good moment or two sometimes and it stayed fairly essential because of the small runtime. Nonetheless overall I did not have too much of a great viewing performance and that's why I do not recommend it. Still if that time and genre is something you like you can still check it out as my dislike is mostly subjective here.".

I couldn't disagree more with the reviewer who states it is an example of script by committee. It's a moot point ALL scripts were made by committee in the Golden Days of Hollywood and sometimes other people's input can be invaluable to add spice to a script that would otherwise be lackluster.There is lots of everything a lover of old time musicals would enjoy in this film comedy bits by the Sunshine twins singing Is It True What They Say About Dixie? and the chemistry between The Boys the other butlers of different nationalities who are all in love with Ann beautiful music including the original In The Spirit Of The Moonlight and the classics When You're Away Victor Herbert a rousing number of Russian folk songs including Two Guitars that Deanna sings beautifully in Russian and an English version of None Must Sleep Nessun Dorma. Music to melt you.

	onyx:emotionText "This is my favorite Deanna Durbin movie. She just glows in her role as Ann Carter. Her singing is gorgeous move over Pavarotti! I couldn't disagree more with the reviewer who states it is an example of script by committee. It's a moot point ALL scripts were made by committee in the Golden Days of Hollywood and sometimes other people's input can be invaluable to add spice to a script that would otherwise be lackluster.There is lots of everything a lover of old time musicals would enjoy in this film comedy bits by the Sunshine twins singing Is It True What They Say About Dixie? and the chemistry between The Boys the other butlers of different nationalities who are all in love with Ann beautiful music including the original In The Spirit Of The Moonlight and the classics When You're Away Victor Herbert a rousing number of Russian folk songs including Two Guitars that Deanna sings beautifully in Russian and an English version of None Must Sleep Nessun Dorma. Music to melt you. And very nice chemistry between Deanna and Franchot.If there hadn't been a Judy Garland Deanna Durbin would be much better remembered today and this film is one of her finest vehicles.

It simply isn't important in the realm of the musical. When I think of some major musicals adapted for screen and the Sidneys and Walters with their heavyhanded ways directing them Frank Borzage is so very much better. True I'm not familiar with the director's lighter side but he handled things quite flowingly. I would have to agree that the script sounds like the work of a committee but the songs were Durbin at her best. No she didn't have the magnetism to light up the screen in any way but her voice was excellently suited for the material heard here.Curtis Stotlar".

I've found that to be the case particularly in reading stories which enchanted me when young only to discover that they has lost all their magic. It can even lead to the melancholy awareness that we have lost the youthful innocence which allowed us to be tickled with a feather. Well  I'm happy to say that the opposite happened to me when I watched His Sister's Butler 1943. Not only was all the magic there it seemed even more intense. The film has a wonderful unselfconscious innocence which is completely delightful. It is beautifully made and the fact that it is a fable about the day before yesterday justifies its sweet fairytale tone. It is common to refer to this film as a Deanna Durbin vehicle. And certainly to an extent this is true. Durbin is lovely in the role. One can hardly wait for her to put her beautiful full mezzosoprano on display. All the delays in her doing so are carefully and cleverly integrated into the plot and when she does sing we love it! At least I do But there are so many other great things in this heart warming film.The five Butlers are genuinely funny whether they help Ann shop or propose ask her to become first maid at their respective workplaces!. Pat O'Brien Ann's brother is excellent in his role and Franchot Tone Charles Gerard is an appropriately suave leading man. All of the minor parts are vigorously actedeven the tiny part of Lady Sloughberry stands out played by none other than the marvellous Florence Batesremember her memorable part in Rebecca? . The two brash ladies that try to collar Gerard at the very opening are integral to the plot. They make credible Gerard's unwillingness to give auditionsas is made clear later by O'Brien's character. Camera work is quite skillful. Durbin's entrance is done by a long tracking shot which focuses entirely on her backas she searches for a seat. Another nice tracking shot takes us to the top of the hotel where Gerard has his Penthouse flat. The crosscuts between Durbin and Tone as she sings she thinks to him and he listens he thinks to the radio! are very effective.Yes it ends predictably! But all good fairytales have the Prince and Princess living Happily ever After! And that's the way it should be.Wonderful film.".

She is very beautiful but I think she should have been a chorus girl or a musical specialty. Most movies that I have seen that weren't the greatest still had the leading actress giving a good performance even under the most stupid circumstances.Now that I've expressed my opinion of the star I can restate much of what others have commented on the script.  In this movie I didn't believe anything.  I thought the way Durbin was acting towards her brother was real LOVE not family love.  It was horrible.  I'll see another Deanna Durbin film and hopefully I can find something nicer to say about it.".

	schema:reviewBody "L'Etudiante is a film that centres around the relationship between a student teacher called Valentine Sophie Marceau and an ambitious but unsuccessful musician named Ned Vincent Lindon.Valentine is an exceptionally dedicated student who thinks of nothing but passing her exams which quite unsurprisingly has a big effect on her relationship with Ned. Ned is frequently tormented by this fact and also that his relentless touring does not help the relationship either. The film follows them as they try to overcome these problems and settle into a life together.Like most French films L'Etudiante is quite dialogueheavy. Very little actually happens in the film and most of the scenes are of the main actors talking whether that be in flats cafs restaurants cars beds trains or the streets of Paris. And as is also true about most French films it is the quality of the acting that sees this through. Lindon is highly entertaining as Ned. He portrays perfectly the man with great ambitions but not the ruthlessness needed to fulfil them. His downtoEarthness is the perfect contrast to Marceau's highlystrung Valentine. Marceau gives an excellent performance. We've all known workaholics who put their personal success before everything else. Often we see these people as cold and unemotional but Marceau is the opposite and shows Valentine to be as human as anyone else helping us to understand what is driving her.Again as is also often the case in French films there are a number of constant irritations in the picture. Often especially at the beginning the director seems to just want to look at Marceau. She's very attractive but the constant goddesslike adoration does get a little waring. Fortunately it calms down a bit by the second half of the film. A common gripe at French films is that the dialogue can get a bit precious at times. This is certainly true of L'Etudiante. When I was a student I rarely fell out with people because of their opinions on social anthropology political philosophy or career options. Perhaps Parisian students do. And finally Marceau does spend quite a few scenes au naturale. This is not an unpleasant sight butpersonally I found it to be a little unnecessary.L'Etudiante is a good French film for people who don't watch many French films. It won't change your life but it does provide you with an insight into commercial French cinema and will definitely keep you entertained for a couple of hours.".

It's by far one of the most beautifully photographed films I've seen of any genre. It's also one of the most atmospheric a sense of horror and dread hang over every frame and yet it is a film whose power does not lie entirely in the narrative. It's hidden somewhere pretty much everywhere... in dark corners in secret crypts in fog in shadows... The shots in this film are brilliantly composed. It is a true triumph for director and cinematographer Mario Bava who provides such rich dreamlike technical depth that pardon the clich this film truly does transport viewers somewhere else in time.Even though this movie is best appreciated as an exercise in style and technique the plot line witch who is executed and returns centuries later to get revenge on the descendants of her executioners is also enjoyable. So is Barbara Steele who is ideally cast in a dual role as both the evil witch and the pure heroine. She's an actress who can switch from innocent and ravishing to hideous and horrific with the flick of an eyelash. No wonder she's considered the queen of horror. She deserves to be.".

More a movie of the undead than a vampire flick it reminds the horror aficionado of a Val Lewton film from the 1940's especially The Leopard Man not that The Mask of Satan is about leopards but the mood and atmosphere are similar.The film is about a woman of darkness and her mate who were executed for witchcraft two centuries before the Napoleonic period of European history. The most gruesome feature of the execution involved nailing a mask of Satan to their faces by means of a giant sledgehammer before they were entombed. By accident two hundred years later a doctor and his assistant while journeying through the region by coach on a dark stormy night filled with eerie devilish sounds the doctor removes the mask from Princess Asa Vajda supposed corpse. Now Princess Vajda and her fiendish companion become free to seek their revenge. Their evil is released on the world and must be stopped.This is undoubtedly director Mario Bava best film. The marvelous camera work draws the viewer into the maelstrom of darkness and evil through innovative movements and angles. The shadowy settings where the actors are posed in ominous fashion are unforgettable. One obvious inspiration for Bava was the contemporary British Hammer horror film popular in America especially with the drivein crowd. The arrival of Katia Vajda with what appear to be the dogs of Hell standing like a silhouette of damnation reminds one of a Caspar David Friedrich painting from the German Romantic art movement of the Napoleonic era. One wonders if the director of The Omen Richard Donner patterned his creepy scene in the cemetery with the Rottweilers after this scene in The Mask of Satan.This movie remains a must see for horror fans somewhat of a lost treasure.".

Black Sunday also catapulted Barbara Steele to horror stardom and would make her into the undisputed horror queen of the sixties. Bava based Mask of Satan as the film was originally titled on the short story Vij by the Russian author Gogol which he adapted into a homage to the early Universal horror pictures he loved so much. Barbara Steele is the beautiful 17th century witch princess Asa who is a vampire and her lover Juvato Arturo Dominici are put to death by her vengeful brother. He has iron masks with spikes on the inside placed on both their faces and then sledgehammered home the brutal opening scene. Two hundred years later blood is accidentally spilled on Asa's face and she rises from the dead along with Juvato to wreak revenge on the descendants of those who executed her  including her lookalike Katia also played by Barbara Steele.Beautifully shot in black and white by Bava himself Black Sunday is a perfect showcase of his masterful control of light and shade of colour and movement yes one can play with shades of colour in black and white and playful camera angles it's a feast for the eye. At heart Bava would always remain the cinematographer he always was and in all his films he took an active role in the design of each image by setting up the lighting the optical effects the filters etc. The film abounds in oldfashioned horror atmosphere and in that department it even manages to top the atmosphere of the Universal horror classics it was based on with gnarled tree branches fogbound sets a decaying castle a dark foreboding crypt and much more.Of course Bava's is well known for letting stylistic innovations take precedent over storytelling and most other things involved like acting. Much of the script was reworked during shooting and even in postproduction. Barbara Steele reportedly never even saw a script and got some pages every day of shooting. Variations of the story has been told many times in one way or another and there are more than a few echoes of Murnau's Nosferatu here. Much of the story is too derivative to begin with and has become too formularised in subsequent years to retain much of its original power just as the film's capacity to scare or excite audiences has probably worn out a little over the years. It doesn't really matter because the film was chopped to pieces for over four decades and the habit of Italian filmmakers of postsynchronizing all the voices even for Italian versions made anything in that department a pretty dire affair anyway.What Bava added however was some substantially more explicit violence and gore laced with sexual connotations. The opening scene in which the mask is sledgehammered to Barbara Steele's face still packs quite a wallop not to mention the effect it must have had on audiences back then. Still horror fans can't really afford to miss this quintessential Bava piece but watch it for the splendid cinematography and Bava's unique ways of visual wizardry.Camera Obscura  710".

	schema:reviewBody "La Maschera del DemonioThe Mask of Satan1960 is the film that introduced audiences around the world to the cinema of Mario Bava.  Responsible for being the first horror film to have a formidable evil female villain.  Its about a dead witch who returns from the dead with her lover to terrorize the descendents of their executioners.  Translitional picture that predates the broodish and moody style of Night of the Living Dead1968.  Tim Burton has cited this movie as one of his favorites.After years as Assistent Director and Director of Photography Bava was rewarded with his first full directorial assignment and the results are impressive.  Mario Bava was a talented filmmaker with a love for the fine arts of Europe and Russian literature.  He didn't direct full time until he was in his late 40s.  Mario Bava's influences as a film director were Riccardo Freda and Freda and Fritz Lang.  Nikolai Gogol is a writer that along with Edgar Allen Poe played a major influence on Bava's supernatural tales.One theme that is present in The Mask of Satan1960 is the decay and decline of a once happy and powerful familymore fully explored in Bava's later films of Black Sabbath1963 Whip and the Body1964 Lisa and the Devil1974 and Shock1977.  Deals with the notion of the inescapability of fate that is an important theme in Bava's work.  An example of this motif comes from Barbara Stelle with her lineHere is the Very image of my life. Mario Bava was a fatalistic filmmaker who used imagery to convey his beliefs in destiny or fate.  Part of his fatalistic style comes from him experiences and memories of WW2.Some of the special effects are amazing for a film of this caliber.  Mario Bava was a genius in creating special effects with only his creative soul and imagination.  Makes one wonder what great special effects he could create with a modest budget.  The gore effects although spread out in small pieces are gruesome for 1960.  Proves that great special effects don't necessarily have to be done with mega dollars.The opening scene of the execution of Asa is a stunning combination of atmosphere and violent imagery.  Barbara Stelle along with Christopher Lee Peter Cushing and Vincent Price are some of the greatest icons in 1960s to 1970s horror films.  Many movie makers in horror films were influenced by the opening scene.  Certain parts of the atmospheric opening can be seen as one inspiration for the prologue of Lucio Fulci's L'AldilaThe Beyond1981. A special moment in horror cinema.The Mask of Satan1960 came about as a result of the success of the Curse of Frankenstein1957 and Horror of Dracula1958 in Italy.  Mixes the old fashion horror of Univerisal Studios with the graphic violence of Hammer horror.  The Hammer and Universal horror films are responsible for the birth of horror in Post war Italian cinema.  There are a couple of scenes that are obviously influenced by Horror of Dracula1958.  The fact that Mario Bava did this based on the success of Horror of Dracula1958 must have influenced Terence Fisher to respond to directing DraculaPrince of Darkness1966.The Mask of Satan1960 isn't interested in plot and story as much as atmosphere and painting style visuals.  Mario Bava took the barebones material of the film and turned it into something magnificent.  Mario Bava's direction has the look of a great artist.  Setting up atmosphere dread mood and terror were some of Bava's strengths.  His experiences as a cinematographer really pays dividends in Bava's direction.A significant influence was placed on La Maschera del Demonio by the first Italian horror film of the sound era I Vamipri1956.  A few references are made to I Vampiri1956 especially in the discovery of a dead body near the river bank.  Also the aging effect in Mask of Satan1960 comes from Bava's work on I Vampiri.  Italian filmmaker Riccardo Freda was the major influence behind Bava's films and the main directorial mentor of Mario Bava. The romantic subplot of The Mask of Satan1960 also derieves from I Vampiri1956.Has some of the best set designs in a low budget horror film.  Mario Bava would use some of the set for his late 1960s horror classic Kill Baby Kill1967.  Amazing that Mario Bava could put together grandeur looking art and set designs with so little.  He also contributed to the dazzling cinematography.  Mario Bava used many of the film's motifs and themes for The Whip and the Body1964.La Maschera del DemonioThe Mask of Satan1960 is based loosely on a short story by Gogol called the Viy.  An interesting note on the making of The Mask of Satan1960 is that Bava made changes thoughout production because of uncertainities about the screenplay.  Its one of the best horror films of the last fifty years.  The camera moves with a smooth feel typical of a Mario Bava phtographed feature.  This is an item that many aspiring horror filmmakers should watch in order to see how a great horror film should be done.".

The thin plot involves two incestuous siblings Asa and Javutich Vajda executed for witchcraft in the Balkan kingdom of Moldavia who return from the grave on Walpurgis night two centuries later to reek supernatural vengeance on their descendants.Unfortunately the BW beauty of this movie is compromised somewhat by Bava's awkward direction of actors whose performances range from adequate Andrea Checci as Dr. Kruvaijan and Ivo Garrani as Prince Vajda to inept Barbara Steele as both Princess Katia Vajda and Asa Vajda to awful John Richardson as Dr. Gorobec. The writing is likewise subpar and seems to borrow elements from the vintage American films Mark of the Vampire and The Black Room which Bava may have seen.Plot holes are numerous and obvious. For instance after draining the life from Katia's father how does the vampire form of Dr. Kruvaijan find a readymade coffin and how does he bury himself? How does Katia's brother Constantine survive a fall down a deep pit to come back and destroy Javutich? The schmaltzy piano love theme is distracting beginning immediately after Katia's first meeting with Gorobec. Nevertheless camera poetry abounds. The slowmotion vision of the phantom coach driven by Javutich is a stunner. All of the genuinely unsettling moments are the result of Bava's uncanny use of lighting shadow and perspective not the poor use of artificiallooking wax figures and lens filters to create the effects of aging on Katia's and Asa's face.Austensibly based upon Nikolai Gogol's short story Viy there is only one scene in the film that is recognizable from the source material. The scene in the crypt when Krubaian is alone with and trying to escape from the reanimated Asa parallels the attempts of Gogol's protagonist to escape from a witch who has arisen from her coffin. Barbara Steele's makeup the spike holes left in Asa's face by the mask of Satan is very effective here.".

	schema:reviewBody "La Maschera Del DemonioThe Mask of Satan1960 is the film that introduced audiences around the world to the cinema of Mario Bava.  After years as Assistent Director and Director of Photography Bava was rewarded with his first full directorial assignment and the results are impressive.  He didn't direct full time until he was in his late 40's.  Its interesting to note that two other directors named Lucio Fulci and Terence Fisher didn't get international recognization until their big breaksZombie1979  Curse of Frankenstein1957 when they were in their early to mid 50's.  Its about a dead witch who returns from the dead with her lover to terrorize the descendents of their executioners.  It was done due to the success of Horror of Dracula1958.The opening scene of the execution of Asa is a stunning combination of atmosphere and violent imagery.  The Mask of Satan1960 is based on a short story by Nikolai Gogol.  Gogol is a writer that would play together with Edgar Allen Poe as a major influence in Bava's Supernatural tales.  Its one of the best horror films of the last fifty years.  Asa is resurrected when the blood of a doctor is accidently dropped on her corpsethis is played homage to in Lamberto Bava's Demons 21986.  Tim Burton has cited this movie as one of his favorites.The film was pratically butchered in the states when first released but has since been released on Home Video in uncut formlongest print in existence. This is an item that many aspiring Horror Filmmakers should watch in order to see how a great horror film should be done.  The Mask of Satan1960 isn't interested in plot and story as much as atmosphere and painting style visuals.  Barbara Steele emerges as the first horror queen of the modern era.  Barbara Steele has a macabre beauty that bewitches the viewer and gives her presence.  Barbara Steele along with Christopher Lee Peter Cushing and Vincent Price were some of the greatest icons in 1960's1970's horror films.Barbara Steele does outstanding work as the witch Asa and her descendent Katia.  Mario Bava's direction has the look of a great artist.  Bava also contributes to the great cinematography.  La Maschera Del Demonio is a well made mixture of the Universal Horror features of the 30's40's and the violence of Hammer Horror of the 50's60's.  The fact that Mario Bava did this based on the success of Horror of Dracula1958 must have influenced Terence Fisher to respond by directing DraculaPrince of Darkness1965. One theme that is present in The Mask of Satan1960 is the decay and decline of a once happy and powerful familymore fully explored in Bava's later films of Black Sabbath1963 The Whip  the Body1964 Lisa and the Devil1974 and Shock1977.".

It has creepy black and white photography a creepy story and the radiant Barbra Steele who can probably put this as her best known role. This is for many people the hight of Italian horror of the late 1950's and early 1960's. For me this is a very good but not particularly great film. Sure it looks good and sure its filled with any number of iconic images in the first part of the film the problem for me is that once the film starts to actually deal with revenge the film becomes less interesting then the early entombment. Yea it picks up at the end but the middle part plays out rather by the numbers. I know I'm in the minority on this but I wouldn't call it any real classic. Still its a very good film thats probably been over sold and over hyped by those who love Bava and his work.Worth a look.".

	schema:reviewBody "The sound that you hear is dripping blood. This...is the beginning of Black Sunday !! ...These two very atmospheric and moodsetting sentences are heard when the Black Sunday DVD is put into the player. No need to tell you that a better and more tense opening has yet to be created. This movie is an undeniable masterpiece in its kind. A powerful and terrifying experience that was way ahead of its time back in 1960 and now  almost 45 years later  it still stands for an hour and a half of pure terror devlish fun and sinister fascination. I respect the opinion and dislikes of everyone but not when it comes to this movie...you either admit that Black Sunday is a masterpiece or you're wrong !!I could give you a thousand reasons why this movie should be seen as the most important horror movie ever made but I'll just stick to the most important ones. Black Sunday  or The Mask of Satan as you prefer  is the debut of Italian genius Mario Bava...Well not really his debut but the first full length movie after a series of short films and project he didn't get credit for. In it Bava presents us on a stylish and visually stunning story with an extremely macabre and dark topic. It contains passages of torturement curses witchburning vampirism massacres and resurrection but it's all brought to us in a very artistic fashion. Bava's profesionalism and style reminds me about the true masterpieces from Universal...Maybe also because the whole movie is filmed in beautiful black and white but merely because of the creepy atmosphere and the morbid topics. Black Sunday does contain rather many violent and sadistic scenes but it becomes unwatchable or disgusting. Actually when you look closer at it...it's a fairy tale !! Think about it... evil witch ominous castles dark forests and  on top of it all  a tale of true love at first sight ! Barbara Steele should get as least as much credit and praise though. This stunning beauty can easily considered Queen of Horror if it were only for her performance here. Steele has a double role here  the evil vampiric Prinses Asa and the virgin Katia  and her appearance can only be seen as on of beauty and pureness. Barbara Steele  once spit out by the glory of Hollywood  succeeds in convincing the audience that she stars as both an innocent virgin as well as a demonic ancient witch. The cinematic value attached to her character comes extremely close to Karloff's Frankenstein and Lugosi's Count Dracula. After all Princess Asa was the first true female monster and she has  literally  become immortal.You're not a horror fan if you haven't seen the perfection of Black Sunday...I give this movie a very well deserved rating 10 out of 10.".

The opening scene is a real jawdropper and one of my favorites. We are introduced to Steele's character about to be burned at the stake for being a witch. But before that she must wear the Mask of Satan which is basically like the Iron Maiden. So a couple of hooded executioners hold this mask up to her face while another approaches with the biggest mallet I've ever seen and WHAM! You see the mask with a river of blood flowing out of it. It's one of the most uncanny visuals you are apt to see. That's what Italian horror is all about though. The makeup effects were simply stunning for the time as well. One scene towards the end where Steele is subtly getting older...looks extraordinary. I was astonished to find it was made in 1960. It had a much older feel to it.

His feature debut La maschera del demonio  called Black Sunday in English  has executed witch Asa Vajda Barbara Steele getting resurrected and seeking revenge through her descendant Katia also Steele.Obviously we've seen this kind of story countless times but Bava knows how to make it really cool. The blackandwhite cinematography gives the movie the ultimate Gothic feeling. But more than that Barbara Steele makes the movie what it is. With pale skin jetblack hair and bulging eyes she seems the perfect person to play a witch or the witch's descendant.It's hard to believe that this was adapted from a Gogol novel but it's true. When I think of Nikolai Gogol I usually also think of other famous Russian authors Pushkin Tolstoy Dostoyevsky. Now I can associate Gogol with Barbara Steele and her hot looks!".

This is Bava's first directorial effort after years working as a cinematographer. Mario Bava was an awesome cinematographer and his attention to atmosphere when placing the camera is something that sets him apart from many other directors. Bava captured the essence of Gothic horror including a graveyard a crypt a castle and a spooky forest very well in this film. Bava made the film in a Hammeresque way ala stuffy performances and stuffier costumes mistfilled cemeteries and dustcovered castles. The atmosphere is very heavy and the imagery very dense making the film a true classic Gothic horror. The direction is efficient the performances are good the plot is something like  a witchvampire n her loverwarlock who is put to death by her own brother only to return 200 years later to seek revenge on her descendants. This film was a groundbreaking and extremely bold step in the development of Italian horror and has had a great influence on almost everyone who first saw it from Argento to Tim Burton.".

In which case the witch goes out of her way to try and possess her stunning descendant who looks exactly like her. Although there is a young doctor who is doing his best trying to prevent this evil from fulfilling that goal.After reading and hearing continuous praise for this flick I wasn't going to let this opportunity pass me by when it popped up on TV one night. I'm more so a newcomer to Mario Bava with this being my filth film I've seen of his. But saying that I've been quite impressed with each one I have watched. While a lot of people label this one his most prized piece but strangely enough I still think Kill Baby Kill! is his greatest. But again that's just my opinion. Now the lowbudgeted Black Sunday is Bava's debut in motion pictures and what an influence this enchanting black and white Gothic tale had on future horror projects. This film goes on to show the professional and stylish display that he would go on to make his own. What makes a horror film work seems to find its way into this milestone while also adding some of its own potent touches. Despite what I have put down so far I really wanted to love this one but I just couldn't. It's definitely a great film which I can't deny. But the story I found to rather unspectacular in the latter half of film by not going anywhere particularly. The script seemed to ramble on a bit too much too. But all that said there were more positives that were on my mind than negatives. Bava manages to rally up plenty of atmospheric chills with his great eye for detailed visuals and delicious imagery. Great lighting composition strikes a hauntingly moody chord. The gloomy setting was incredibly eerie and that's because its heighten by its tight music score that is laid on thick with its piercing sound effects. Interwoven into the film is Bava's trademark classy camerawork. On a whole it does build up the creepiness with its air of dread and the suspense is well sustained. The gruesome makeup might be tame nowadays but it doesn't entirely take away the crunch of those scenes. The performances are nothing grand but the glamorous Barbara Steel playing two roles makes up for some broad acting. Arturo Dominici performance as Steel's steely eyed assistant was strikingly unnerving.Simply a crisp and stylish influential horror film from Italy's talented horror maestro.".

It's quite ironic that the Spanish horror icon became mostly notorious for his Wolf Man cycle while actually his best movies have got absolutely nothing to do with lycanthropes or full moons. His werewolf flicks are fun enough but personally I much more enjoyed Inquisition Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll Rojo Sangre and now especially this uniquely demented little exploitation treasure. The Hunchback of the Morgue has got it all mad as hell scientists deformed killers gooey monsters acid baths corpse snatching flesh munching rancid decapitations and gigantic jars filled with entrails. Most remarkable however is that this gross and exploitative horror movie nevertheless manages to insert quite a lot of genuine drama and touching romance! Specifically during the first act the drama is harrowing. Gotho employee in the local hospital's morgue and the laughing stock of the entire village because of the hideous lump on his back is madly in love with the beautiful Ilse basically just because she's the only person who treats him with dignity and kindness. But unfortunately Ilse has terminal tuberculosis and passes away whilst Gotho is being beaten up outside. Gotho goes to Dr. Orla for help but he turns out to be a completely deranged amateur Baron Frankenstein. Orla commands our hunchbacked friend to steal bodies dead and alive ones and feeds them to his creation. This thing literally emerged from a jar of intestines on a desk but quickly grows into an insatiable munching machine. Okay admittedly this may all sound a little confusing and incoherent. It is actually! The Hunchback of the Rue Morgue unceasingly introduces new characters and add new plot lines until the finale and it's practically impossible to give an allcapturing summary of this film. The incoherence of the script isn't the least bit bothering especially because the film is fastpaced and full of gory action the entire time. Gotho hacks off people's heads with axes throws their bodies in acid and even locks them into medieval torture devices! And yet even whilst he's committing the most vilest of murders he manages to gain quite a bit of your sympathy and compassion. It's entirely Paul Naschy's own accomplishment to make his characters  even the most bonkers ones  come across as amiable and heroic. The Hunchback of the Rue Morgue is also a very effective horror film because the atmosphere is continuously morbid and practically all settings and scenery are sinister. Last but not least the film also enjoys a notorious reputation because one of the decapitation scenes was filmed using a real human corpse and because allegedly the ratburnings were real as well.".

Each day he brings her flowers until that the sickly young deceases. He never really believes her death  but one day she sadly dies as he thinks she is just sleeping. The girl eventually ends up at the morgue hospital Feldkirch where she is being ready for burial. Naschy's character flips out at the desecration of the girl's body and kills two autopsy's helpers  starting a murderous spree  being his first victim a student . The police begins to look for him and two Inspectors Manuel De Blas  Antonio Pica are investigating the deeds . This is when the Hunchback meets up with a mad scientist  Albert Dalbes who is helped by his assistant Vic Winner whose girlfriend Maria Pershy rules the girls reformatory . Gotho asks for help the doctor whose work isn't accepted by the general society to relive the body his lover . The megalomaniac scientist accepts in change of Gotho assists him on his experiments bringing to life a strange creature . The doctor Horla  this name is homage to Guy De Maupassant's novel title El Horla is a prestigious scientific  he promises the Hunchback that would reanimate the girl's body if the Hunchback brings him fresh bodyparts from the graveyard and live victims. Gotho kidnaps and kills girls from a nearly reformatory . The doctor uses the parts to create a horrible creature and the experiments are realized in tunnels and caves from Inquisition time. The mad doctor pretends on feed his monster with human beings . But the hunchback will terminate with the sinister plans of the malicious doctor .It's a delirious story about amour fou with multiples literary references  partially based on writings of known writers as Lovecraft  Mauspassant  Burne Jones  Edgar Allan Poe  among others  all of them thrown in . It results to be a strong tale as well as sensible flick with melodramatic elements in which Gotho falls in love with a sickly young and a gorgeous Rosanna Yanni . Very good performance of Naschy as hunchback with below average intelligence who works at the morgue. Naschy deservedly won the prize George Melies the best performance in Fantastic Festival of Paris and other several prizes . Creepy and eerie images as when authentic rats attack Nashy and turned to be very difficult the filmmaking . The picture contains a crazy love story  but also lots of blood and gore as when Gotho stabs and decapitates the men in one of the several scenes of gore in the movie . It's a modern reprise of the stories of various writers as Necronomicon's H.P.Lovecraft  Robert Stevenson's Body snatchers  Mary Shelley's Frankestein and touches of Victor Hugo's Hunchback . Flawed but interesting screenplay by Jacinto Molina who blends diverse themes . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Raul Perez Cubero  furthermore atmospheric score by Carmelo Bernaola . Appropriate sets and production design by Cubero and Galicia who worked in many Spaghetti Western . The picture is professionally directed by Javier Aguirre . Rating  Good  it will appeal to madcults movies and Naschy fans  it's one of the best films .".

	schema:reviewBody "Paul Naschy made a hell of a lot of Spanish horror films many of them were not all that good but there are a few gems among his vast body of work and The Rue Morgue Massacre is certainly one of his better efforts. The film is something like a Spanish version of Hammer Horror the style of it actually reminded me a lot of the final Hammer Frankenstein flick 'Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell' which was released a year later than this film. Most of The Rue Morgue Massacre takes place in underground catacombs and director Javier Aguirre springs his atmosphere from there. The plot is a tale consisting of two main themes social rejection and mad science and we focus on 'Gotho' Paul Naschy  a hunchback with no friends other than a sick young girl. Gotho's life is miserable and it gets more so when his only friend in the world dies. Gotho believes her to be sleeping and this is capitalised on by a mad doctor who promises to wake her if Gotho helps him with experiments which focus on creating new life...The film doesn't feature a great deal of gore but it is a very nasty flick. Most of the action centres around corpses and body parts which helps to give it a nasty atmosphere and this is increased by the dreary set design which almost gives the viewer the impression that the film is taking place in hell. The plot itself runs rather slowly though the film never gets boring as there's always enough going on to keep the audience intrigued. Paul Naschy is a varied actor though sometimes his performances aren't very good. He fits into the role of the hunchback well in this film however and actually manages to generate some sympathy in spite of the fact that his character is a murderer. The most interesting element of the plot is of course the whole thing surrounding the monster that the mad scientist is trying to create. This subplot is fairly well done what we get to see looks interesting though it has to be said that the plot turns out to be disappointing when we finally get to see the monster at the end. However this is still a very interesting effort and I can certainly recommend it.".

FREAKS has the revenge tale morality of its real life freaks covered carrying with them a sense of uneasy understanding and likability.

Whatever it is hardly matters its fitful existence doomed by the hands of its creator. A suitable hodgepodge of every mad doctor film that came before it Hugo's Quasimodo with characteristic elements of over the top dramatics and carnality that signified Naschy's unbridled charm.

	schema:reviewBody "Is The Hunchback of the Morgue the greatest film of Spanish Exploitation icon Paul Naschy? One of the greatest without a doubt and probably my personal favorite as this highly atmospheric creepy and incredibly entertaining Gothic gem unites all qualities that we love about Naschy flicks. Personally I've been a fan of the prolific Spanish Horror deity for years and while most of his films don't usually qualify as 'good' they are usually immensely entertaining. Javier Aguirre's El Jorobado De La Morgue aka. The Hunchback of the Morgue of 1973 was a fantastic surprise to me as this wonderful little film is both entertaining in the typical Naschymanner AND an actually very good film of its own right. One of the great aspects about Naschy flicks is that they usually unite the creepy mood and settings of atmospheric Gothic tales with typical exploitation qualities such as gore and sleaze and out of all his films I've seen this one is the greatest example for that. My admiration for The Hunchback of the Morgue may seem exaggerated to some for a film like this that is doubtlessly not flawless. It is however a rare film that is so successful in creating a rich and genuinely creepy atmosphere the intriguing storyline of a classic Horror tale and typical exploitation qualities from an obviously low budget as this one does.The Hunchback of the Morgue terrifically narrates a traditional Horror story in the delightful form of a Creepy and quite gory Naschyesque Gothic Exploitation flick. In classic Horror tradition the eponymous hunchback Gotho Naschy is a murderous yet tragic pitiable and almost likable character. A man of low intelligence and ugly appearance Gotho who works at the morgue is despised by most people except the beautiful Ilse Mara Elena Arpn. Driven by his immortal love to this terminally ill beauty Gotho responds to kindness with kindness to humiliation with murderous violence. The obsessed scientist Dr. Orla Alberto Dalbes decides to use the hunchback for his sinister goals... No role has ever suited Paul Naschy better than that of the eponymous hunchback Gotho. Naschy seems predestined to play morgue employees and gravediggers  in the runnerup on the list of my favorite Naschyfilms La Orgia De Los Muertos from the same year he plays a deranged gravedigger. The role of Gotho here is in my opinion the greatest he ever played since he is truly deranged yet at the same time pitiable and even likable. Jess Franco flick regular Alberto Dalbs is great in the role of the unscrupulous scientist. The supporting performances are actually also very good for a film of the kind. The ravishing Rosanna Yanni is sexy and lovable in the role of Elke a woman who unlike others treats the hunchback with kindness. The film is terrifically shot in the great setting of a small town in the mountains in the film the name is Feldkirch but I don't think it is meant to be the town of the same name in my home country Austria. Settings like old houses dark alleys castle ruins subterranean crypts and secret passages give the film a great Gothic mood which is increased by a very good cinematography and score. The gore is pretty intense with some truly gruesome scenes. The film isn't actually very sleazy nudity occurs only once briefly by Rosanna Yanni drool. It is undeniable that the plot has holes and sometimes lacks logic  but that has to be expected in a Naschy flick. Overall The Hunchback of the Morgue is in my opinion the Naschy film that has the greatest storyline AND the most intense atmosphere. The mood often resembles the style of other Gothic films such as those by the British Hammer Studios but again with a typically Spanish touch. All things considered The Hunchback of the Morgue is my personal favorite Paul Naschy film and also one of the most outrageously enjoyable Spanish Gothic Horror productions from the early 70s. No true lover of cultcinema should miss it!".

	schema:reviewBody "Paul Naschy plays a hunchback with below average intelligence who works at the morgue. He is in love with a sickly girl who happens to be the only person who is kind to him.Naschy who also wrote the script seems to be inspired by a number of sources. Some have said the central inspiration is Beauty and the Beast given the romance between a deformed man and a beautiful young woman. But more obvious sources seem to be Hunchback of Notre Dame with Quasimodo and Esmeralda and Frankenstein though this time the story o told from the point of view of the mad scientist's assistant.Director Javier Aguirre at this point in his career was known for experimental work but had also worked with Paul Naschy on the slightly betterknown Count Dracula's Great Love 1973 earlier the same year. In fact Hunchback came about in part because of a delay on Great Love due to a car accident. I hope that over the longer run the betterknown film becomes Hunchback because there are some crazy scenes in here.We start with a crafted miniature model of a Bavarian town which you have to give them credit for. The nonmodel village shots are in Vielha e Mijaran Catalonia. And then the makeup. Sure it does not take much to make a hunch. But some of the other nastiness especially the mad scientist's creation are in many ways way ahead of their time.The realism goes above and beyond what we typically see in films of this type. For one thing the corpses are allegedly real and Naschy was allowed to cut into them and use them as they pleased. Exactly how that permission was granted seems like a story in itself. But also the rat sequences. There exists a story that some of the rats are really guinea pigs colored to look like rats but that seems hard to believe  the two are very distinct looking to anyone familiar with both rodents. Regardless having so many rodents crawl on multiple actors in abundance had to be a challenge. Even tame friendly rats would make most people uncomfortable in such huge numbers.For his role as Gotho Naschy won the Georges Melis Best Actor Award for his portrayal from the International Festival of Fantastic and ScienceFiction Cinema of Paris in 1973. According to Mirek Lipinski Naschy at one point shared the stage with both Peter Cushing and Terence Fisher. If only a photo existed of this powerful trio!The Scream! Factory Bluray 2017 has everything we could want really. The film in both Spanish and English audio commentary from Naschy experts and a booklet of valuable information to complement the commentary.".

	schema:reviewBody "Hunchback of the Morgue 1972  12 out of 4A deformed hunchback Paul Naschy is picked on by everyone except for a beautiful woman. When that woman dies the hunchback goes to a scientist in hopes that he can bring her back to life. The doctor says he can but in return he wants the hunchback to do some killing for him. Loosely based on Poe's Murders in the Rue Morgue the film also mixes in elements of Frankenstein and the end result is a rather entertaining movie that works on several levels but the biggest is the fact that the movie is just downright nasty at times and it takes pleasure in it. HUNCHBACK OF THE MORGUE offers Naschy a tasty role and he really delivers.The film works best as long as you don't take it too serious or go into it expecting some sort of art film. I mean the movie is pretty sleazy throughout but things get really crazy during the second half when we get all sorts of strange violence from body parts being cut off to guts pour out and there are even rats eating faces. All of the gore is handled quite well and the overall sleazy nature of it perfect fits the atmosphere of the movie as well as the beautiful set design.As far as Naschy goes he got to play just about every monster possible and this here was certainly his most sympathetic role which is shocking when you consider that this character is a murderer. I thought the actor did a very good job in the role and the sympathetic nature was a major plus. The supporting cast are all fine as well but there's no question that the picture belongs to Naschy.".

	onyx:emotionText "Hunchback of the Morgue 1972  12 out of 4A deformed hunchback Paul Naschy is picked on by everyone except for a beautiful woman. When that woman dies the hunchback goes to a scientist in hopes that he can bring her back to life. The doctor says he can but in return he wants the hunchback to do some killing for him. Loosely based on Poe's Murders in the Rue Morgue the film also mixes in elements of Frankenstein and the end result is a rather entertaining movie that works on several levels but the biggest is the fact that the movie is just downright nasty at times and it takes pleasure in it. HUNCHBACK OF THE MORGUE offers Naschy a tasty role and he really delivers.The film works best as long as you don't take it too serious or go into it expecting some sort of art film. I mean the movie is pretty sleazy throughout but things get really crazy during the second half when we get all sorts of strange violence from body parts being cut off to guts pour out and there are even rats eating faces. All of the gore is handled quite well and the overall sleazy nature of it perfect fits the atmosphere of the movie as well as the beautiful set design.As far as Naschy goes he got to play just about every monster possible and this here was certainly his most sympathetic role which is shocking when you consider that this character is a murderer. I thought the actor did a very good job in the role and the sympathetic nature was a major plus. The supporting cast are all fine as well but there's no question that the picture belongs to Naschy.";

	schema:reviewBody "A superior Spanish shocker which charts the life of a hunchback as he is abused by some and falls in love with others. However being an Xrated horror flick heavy lashings of gore and general grisliness are added into the mix to create unforgettable moments and alleviate from the otherwise routine story. The film's strength lies in the evocative and moving musical score which really helped to set the scene for me and the atmospheric location of the underground cavern which is brimming with Gothic dread and foreboding. Paul Naschy takes the lead role and brings life and sympathy to his antihero a villain who is drawn into his acts either as a last resort or as a result of someone else's evil.What could have been just another brutal monster turns out to be a pathetic but deeply just and noble person moments of Naschy kissing the feet of those he appreciates are at odds to shots of him brutally murdering numerous victims and in the end Naschy's strong acting means that you can't help but like him even if he is a multiple murderer and sadist! The strong Spanish supporting cast includes Alberto Dalbes' fine performance as a deranged and evil scientist genre regular Maria Perschy as a doctor and Rosanna Yanni as a genuinely beautiful love interest  yes even a hunchback can love! Once again this Naschy film's strength is in the numerous plot strands and ideas that it throws into the mix to keep it going nicely. As well as the character study of Gotho the film includes romance and sex and themes of power and its abuse. The horror elements are also varied and interesting. The film begins with a scene of a corpse being bloodily cut up with a knife and doesn't get any easier to take from there! Corpses have their faces eaten apart by rats there's a string of gore murders hijinks involving a severed head graverobbing and a mad scientist and a convenient acid bath into which many characters fall and are lovingly dissolved in detail. One of my favourite aspects is the monster in the cellar which screams and cries with terrible noises really building up the unseen terror. When it finally escapes to go on a rampage the slimy humanoid creature doesn't disappoint in special effects either.The gore is overthetop and extremely explicit even for a Naschy movie. Characters are decapitated and eviscerated guts everywhere strangled dissolved spiked in iron maidens have their faces destroyed with acid and mutilated. However the film's most unpleasantly memorable scene doesn't involve any special effects whatsoever  yes it's an unfaked scene of animal violence! This mondo madness occurs when Gotho discovers rats eating his girlfriend and attacks them with a torch Naschy himself was famously bitten during this ordeal. Cue lots of shots of scampering squealing and burning rats for a rodent lover such as myself these scenes are really quite hard to take and unnecessarily long with it! Thankfully this is the only example of mondo violence in the film  and in Naschy's long career also.Otherwise the actionfight scenes are wellstaged and exciting the acting pretty good all things considered the dubbing not too intrusive the effects good and the atmosphere and suspense strong. Worth checking out for all genre fans and a mustsee film for Naschy followers in particular this more than stands up against the best of his Waldemar Daninsky  werewolf output. Highly recommended.".

Naturally I think he's quite adorable and with Naschy writing the script so does the leading lady regular costar Rosanna Yanni. The real villain of the film is one Dr. Orla homagerip at Jess Franco or Generalissimo Franco? who takes full and horrible advantage of Gotho's hardships Orla excellently portrayed by genreveteran Alberto Dalbes leads Gotho down a truly sickening path involving corpse robbing or corpsecreating and some absolutely ungodly experiments. The film's climax shocked me when I first saw it  I wasn't expecting it to be so frightening. There's a buildup throughout the film as to what the experimentgenerated monster actually looks like and unlike most cases of this device it ultimately pays off in spades. The gore and makeup is fabulous as is the sound effect for the monster it still sends chills down my spine to think of it. The Hunchback of the Morgue is a real benchmark of Spanish Horror and certainly one of Naschy's career.

Still a lot aren't out but The Hunchback Of The Morgue is out there. It's notorious for one reason animal cruelty.Coming from Spain and being featured in many Spanish flicks most of those Eurotrash flicks are badly dubbed or are out on expensive Japanese VHS releases full uncut because that's the trouble with Naschy's flicks. Being famous in Spain just like Lee in the UK or Price in the US Naschy's flicks were mostly cut due the nudity involved in his flicks. Most collectors know Naschy from his portraying of the tragic lycanthrope Count Waldemar. Here Naschy is just a retarded hunchback searching for the girl he loves.Also out as The Rue Morgue Massacres in fact this flick has nothing to do with Poe's story. The release under that title was made by All Seasons VHS label and they just didn't care at all that Rue Morgue had nothing to do with a morgue but was a French street not even mentioned in this flick. He was just a hunchback working at a morgue. He is hated and victim of abuse and insults in his hometown but only one person understands him a sick girl dying of TBC. He visits her every day in the hospital and brings her fresh flowers. One day he arrives when she just has died and he notices that students are trying to remove jewelery from the corpse. In a fury he kills them. The slaughtering is shown in a rather gory way with decapitation and disemboweling scenes. I was rather surprised by the way it was shown. Even intestines are shown. But the most notorious part comes a few moments later when the corpse is being attacked by rats. The rats were the real thing used in this flick but Goto Naschy sets them on fire. And that part made this flick famous for setting rats on fire shown in front of the camera. A thing nowadays is impossible. From there on Goto is provided shelter by a mad doctor who promise him to bring back the girl who died Frankenstein story. From there on a monster is created with the help of corpses and living girls captured by Goto and the use of a secret lab and of course the bubbling acid bath.What's so weird is that most releases do show the rats running around being burned alive but the love scene being cut out.

Cowritten and starring The Boris Karloff of Spain Paul Naschy the film is a wildly overthetop cheesy affair that yet succeeds in its primary intentions to stun and entertain the viewer. In it Naschy plays the title character Wolfgang Gotho a hunchbacked janitor in the morgue of the Feldkirch Hospital in what the viewer must infer is Germany in modern times although the film with very minor revisions could just as easily have been set 200 years ago. Shunned reviled and even stoned by the town's populace Gotho's only joy in life is bringing flowers to Ilse a beautiful young woman in the hospital who is dying of some unspecified lung disease and played by the luscious Maria Elena Arpon. When Ilse ultimately does expire the distraught Gotho steals her body hides it in the subterranean crypts once a torturer's lair during the Inquisition conveniently near the hospital and asks the head man at Feldkirch Dr. Orla Alberto Dalbes for assistance in bringing the dead lovely back to the land of the living. Orla agrees but on one condition that Gotho will help him in his experiments to create artificial life....As I said THOTM really goes out of its way to present itself as some kind of total horror show. The film boasts any number of satisfyingly tacky grossout effects including some slit throats various dismemberments decapitations a nasty ax blow to the stomach as mentioned literally busting a gut! rats rats on fire apparently some animals really WERE harmed in the making of this picture! rats nibbling on corpses acidmelted bodies a gruesome ironmaiden spiking and on and on. The creature that Orla creates at first shown as a large jar of quivering viscera feeding on human heads ultimately morphs into yet another pleasing horror image a humanoid entity that looks like a glob of melted mud! Naschy is quite fine as the simpleminded Gotho even eliciting viewer sympathy for the grotesque character despite his murderous tendencies the early scenes between Gotho and Ilse are actually fairly touching and evendare I say ita bit poetic! Besides the catchy circus music that opens the film composer Carmelo Bernaola has also provided a morbid dirgelike piece that permeates the picture very appropriately and director Javier Aguirre does a better than competent job at creating an atmosphere of decay and unease. On a personal note as an old fan of horror great H.P. Lovecraft I must automatically give extra Brownie points to any film that mentions the Necronomicon as this one so cleverly does. THOTM may be some kind of perfect film to watch with your favorite 12yearold nephew who will surely delight at the loopiness of the plot and the film's many yucky visuals.As for the Mya DVD that I recently viewed this picture on it looks good enough I suppose if a tad dark in sections but sports subtitles for the English Spanish and Italian language options that have been very poorly rendered and in spots amusingly translated. Thus in one scene Elkea beautiful psychologist at a women's prison from which Gotho is abducting some victims and played by Rossana Yanisays to Gotho I'll medicate your wounds. But at least the DVD comes with more extras than you might expect to accompany a film of this nature. Bottom line a highly pleasing horror outing one that I have a um hunch that you'll enjoy although not terribly scary. Indeed the film's single most frightening scene might occur at the very outset the sight of one of Gotho's future victims downing TWO gallonsized glasses of beer in rapid succession. Now THAT'S scary!".

	schema:reviewBody "Die Superbullen  Sie kennen keine Gnade is a German 85minute movie from 2011 so this one has its 5th anniversary this year. This is the third film from a trilogy of big screen releases in which Tom Gerhardt lead actor and writer channels his Hausmeister Krause character really his only shtick for almost 1.5 hours. This trilogy started in the 1990s already. His cowriter is Franz Krause fitting name who has not really a career outside of the Gerhardt universe and the director is Gernot Roll who was also the man in charge behind the camera on Ballermann 6 the second movie from this series. But back to this one here. I must say I am admittedly positively surprised a bit. It is not as crappy from start to finish as were films one and two. There is a somewhat funny scene here and there but there are still several very unfunny scenes such as about the duo unintentionally almost killing a man at the hospital or an accumulation of fart sounds which was when the film hit rockbottom.Because of these scenes my rating is again the same as it was for the two previous films a . I still admit that it's slightly better. Maybe the humor and comedy are just more adequate in terms of what people find funny today and the two older films were accurate for what people found funny in the 1990s but have aged very badly. As for Gernot Roll mentioned him earlier already he is without a doubt one of the defining cinematographers in German film history but he is also one example of a man who is a good cinematographer but apparently a very weak director. Here he worked on films 2 and 3 from a trilogy that without a doubt can be considered a major contender for worst German trilogy of all times. Yes this is still way weaker than Erkan  Stefan for example. I wrote in another review that the comedy and humor Gerhardt uses in his films has a lot of similarities with the Werner Beinhart films but it is just not working for a live action film as it is for an animated film. The story here is about the two becoming cops in search of a disappeared goat that is the mascot of a soccer club and the club has been losing a lot since he disappeared. There are several known names acting in this film. At least German film and television experts will recognize many of the people in here. To end the review on a positive note I thought this film peaked already in the first couple minutes when the makers made fun of one of these abysmal quizzes currently airing on German television. Sadly their work here is really mostly on par in terms of the quality with these shows. I give a major thumbsdown.".

There is a somewhat funny scene here and there but there are still several very unfunny scenes such as about the duo unintentionally almost killing a man at the hospital or an accumulation of fart sounds which was when the film hit rockbottom.Because of these scenes my rating is again the same as it was for the two previous films a . I still admit that it's slightly better. Maybe the humor and comedy are just more adequate in terms of what people find funny today and the two older films were accurate for what people found funny in the 1990s but have aged very badly. As for Gernot Roll mentioned him earlier already he is without a doubt one of the defining cinematographers in German film history but he is also one example of a man who is a good cinematographer but apparently a very weak director. Here he worked on films 2 and 3 from a trilogy that without a doubt can be considered a major contender for worst German trilogy of all times. Yes this is still way weaker than Erkan  Stefan for example. I wrote in another review that the comedy and humor Gerhardt uses in his films has a lot of similarities with the Werner Beinhart films but it is just not working for a live action film as it is for an animated film. The story here is about the two becoming cops in search of a disappeared goat that is the mascot of a soccer club and the club has been losing a lot since he disappeared. There are several known names acting in this film. At least German film and television experts will recognize many of the people in here. To end the review on a positive note I thought this film peaked already in the first couple minutes when the makers made fun of one of these abysmal quizzes currently airing on German television. Sadly their work here is really mostly on par in terms of the quality with these shows. I give a major thumbsdown.";

This time the duo also wrote the entire film if the information here on IMDb is correct. Oh well the two may have talent in hosting and comedy but acting really does not seem to be their biggest strength. Then again their writing is probably even weaker than their acting. The good thing is that the film stays clearly under 90 minutes so you will not be bored for too long. They may be a charismatic duo especially Gottschalk but this cannot save the film from being at least as weak as the first film. Good to see the duo found their real talent not much later in the entertainment industry. In here they dress up as sheiks for the most part but there is more once again. Of course like in the first they are also in drag at some point and I guess if people found this funny then humour was really something different back then. The good thing is it not really offensive or tryhard at any point quite the opposite actually. For the most part I did not feel that they really wanted to make a funny film. There was a certain kind of lackluster attached to it especially from Gottschalk once again. So yeah not a good film and it's a bit embarrassing there are still 2 more films. I guess if people really liked this film enough to warrant these sequels then these TommyMike movies have not aged well at all. Not recommended.".

The movie even cops to this in a conversation between Jenny and Matt Saunders Luke Wilson following his rescue by GGirl from the Statue of Liberty. Jenny curiously asks Matt what was GGirl like. Matt replies She's kind of nutty I think the intent was to have Jenny Thurman be this lonely young woman who has no one in her life isolated by her great physical powers. Thurman does the best she can but her Jenny is a terrifying mood swing in dire need of Prozac. Luke Wilson is way too breezy in the role reversal of boyfriend and superhero girl friend.My Super ExGirlfriend is also a victim of bad timing coming on the tail end of Superman Returns which plays Superhero straight up so to speak. With all its quirks and inconsistent writing I still thought My Super ExGirlfriend was funny and enjoyed the movie. Given that this is an Ivan Reitman movie this could have been a lot better. Reitman starts with a great premise and really squanders it. First off we all love the hero. Here neither Jenny nor GGirl is really all that likable. This is surprising for Uma Thurman who is normally a charismatic and powerful presence. In the beginning her Jenny GGirl is just plain weird. Shocking. Because if there is a woman who can play a Superhero she is Thurmanshe looks great. Only toward the end does her Jenny become more sympathetic instead of caricature. Although My Super Ex is not a straight Superhero story rather a romantic comedy of sorts it does not provide what every Superhero mythology requiresa great super villain. Here we have Professor Bedlam aka Barry Eddie Izzard who really is evil lite. He is no Lex Luthor. No plans for Global domination. Bedlam rather Barry does hold a grudge against GGirl and expectedly it has to do with their shared past. What is bizarre you don't know who you would rather spend time withBedlam or GGirl? Luke Wilson's Matt is just some dude who happens to hook up with the psycho superhero. One of the annoying things he does is that he confides in his repugnant loser friend Vaughn Rainn Wilson doing a bad whacked out impersonation. Wilson sometimes plays it a little too dense and this dilutes his likable charm. This does however work in the comic sex scene with Jenny. Matt while dating Jenny GGirl realizes that he is in love with his coworker Hannah perky Anna Faris. So how does Matt break up with GGirl? Well it's not pretty and for the most part hilarious.Dramatic Superhero movies work. Romantic comedies with chemistry work. What may be inherently difficult are Superhero satires disguised as romantic comedies. Everyone loves the hero. However hero nut job? Maybe not. With all Uma Thurman's talent she is unable to accomplish this convincingly. And she does not get sufficient support from Reitman and Payne. Thurman and Wilson have enough charm and presence to survive their narrative failings. My Super ExGirlfriend is fun and funny. Though given all involved the movie could have been super.".

Sure there were a few funny lines however the weak middle and horrible ending kept it from really breaking out.Director Ivan Reitman has lost his touch. After a successful run in the eighties and early nineties he started making crap like Evolution and Father's Day. I wouldn't say My Super ExGirlfriend is a complete bust but I don't give him credit for any of the quality the movie holds which isn't too much. Don Payne did an awful job with the screenplay. The majority of the jokes were lame and most of the supporting characters were just onenote. He also kept reusing a lot of the same jokes making the thing really tedious at times.A few of the actors were good enough to save the film. Uma Thurman was great as GGirl and she had many funny lines. Luke Wilson was a bit pale and not very interesting. I don't think he makes for an appealing leading man and he's better in supporting roles like in The Family Stone. Anna Faris was just doing her Scary Movie routine and it's getting a little old. She needs a challenge or at least some better scripts. Wanda Sykes is either hit or miss for me. She was great in MonsterInLaw and she was bad in Clerks 2. Here she is just annoying and doesn't bring anything to the movie. Eddie Izzard was alright nothing special. Rainn Wilson was just annoying and not funny. Overall I was disappointed with the movie. It wasn't awful yet it had so much potential and the final result was just so average. Rating 510".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is nothing to write home about but it has a few shiny flourishes. The thing to remember is that this film was aimed at the teen age and college comic book crowd. It wasn't meant to be anything more than that. And when you look at it in that context you find those bright moments that Reitman was trying to give the audience. This isn't adult fare gone bad as it was presented for adults. It's teenage fastfood cinema that's got more production values and gloss than the teensex romps I grew up with Spring Break or One Crazy Summer as examples.Yeah Thurman's character has got issues. But she's supposed to. This is a teenage guy film about a comic book guy's perspective on women. The target audience is probably the biggest item to criticize because if there are enough people immature men who fall into the category of feeling helpless and powerless against women when in a relationship then maybe there's something wrong with society to allow such a population to explode and support this film. Yeah that's kind of high minded and somewhat near leaving the topic of the film itself but I think it's important to contemplate.All in all I didn't mind the film but did find it ridiculous and mildly amusing here and there. Yes a better film could have been made for the adult dating scene and we could argue about whether that should have been greenlit as opposed to what we have and yes it probably would have been a better film. But take this film for what it is a time waster. A film to put on the DVD player as you hit the sleep button on your TV.Watch if only so inclined.".

I kept expecting it to fall apart but it never really did. Sure it doesn't make as much of its awesome premise as it could and chooses to be short when it might have been better to expand the film's universe. But I can't blame it for that. Uma Thurman is great as the bipolar superhero GGirl. And I've discovered after several years of disliking him that Luke Wilson can be absolutely perfect when cast as a schlub. He's given two of the best comic performances of 2006 the other in the pretty much unreleased Idiocracy. I absolutely cracked up at the expressions on his face when he and Thurman first have sex. It's one of the funniest sex scenes ever. My only real complaint is that they make GGirl a bit too much of a psycho like almost unbelievably so. Maybe with some background I could have accepted it better. I can forgive its flaws though because I had a really good time watching it. Underrated for sure.".

Wilson's sidekick was a lame excuse for a man and Wilson had no chemistry with either Uma or his office coworker. The sex scenes weren't sexy and the funny scenes weren't funny. I guess I just expected too much from these actors. None of the characters were really sympathetic so I ended up not caring a flying fig about any of them. The only memorable performances were the kids who played Bedlam and GGirl as teenagers  at least THEY had some chemistry.

I feel sorry for those people who were duped at the box office.At one point I've forgotten exactly when because now it's all just a blur our hero Luke Wilson starts running through traffic I think he was looking for a cab. It was at that point when I gave up realizing I couldn't care whether he found his ride or got run over by a garbage truck.The last time the movie was interesting was when Luke Wilson climbs out of the dumpster hair dryer in hand and first meets the heroine Uma Thurman. That scene ended with the pursesnatching criminal dangling helplessly from the fire escape far far above the departing Luke and Uma. That was the last time the movie was funny and when was that scene? Ten minutes into the flick?Every time the movie tried to become funny it couldn't. Every time the movie approached excitement it fizzled out heading in the opposite direction. When a musical score might have helped squeeze life out of this dullard the sound track stayed empty and silent.The sex scenes were not needed and were beyond lame the damage to sets and props unnecessary and childish. When Uma turns into the crazy exgirlfriend I felt like I was watching The 40 Year Old Virgin Meets Pulp Fiction that's when I realized that there was no turning back because I thoroughly disliked The 40 Year Old Virgin and Pulp Fiction.Luke Wilson's sidekick Rainn Wilson also seen in the dreary The Last Mimzy adds nothing but insult to injury in this awful movie. Rainn Wilson the King of Television Boredom should stay with that equally awful medium. Hey Rainn Wilson! Leave fulllength motion pictures alone! Every time Uma's rival Anna Faris came on screen I expected Jason or Freddy or some fright flick monster to jump out from behind the scenery once you see Anna Faris in Scary Movie that's all you ever see no matter the movie no matter the medium. The character played by Wanda Sykes was just plain awful and was so out of place in this flick.".

That was the last time the movie was funny and when was that scene? Ten minutes into the flick?Every time the movie tried to become funny it couldn't. Every time the movie approached excitement it fizzled out heading in the opposite direction. When a musical score might have helped squeeze life out of this dullard the sound track stayed empty and silent.The sex scenes were not needed and were beyond lame the damage to sets and props unnecessary and childish. When Uma turns into the crazy exgirlfriend I felt like I was watching The 40 Year Old Virgin Meets Pulp Fiction that's when I realized that there was no turning back because I thoroughly disliked The 40 Year Old Virgin and Pulp Fiction.Luke Wilson's sidekick Rainn Wilson also seen in the dreary The Last Mimzy adds nothing but insult to injury in this awful movie. Rainn Wilson the King of Television Boredom should stay with that equally awful medium. Hey Rainn Wilson! Leave fulllength motion pictures alone! Every time Uma's rival Anna Faris came on screen I expected Jason or Freddy or some fright flick monster to jump out from behind the scenery once you see Anna Faris in Scary Movie that's all you ever see no matter the movie no matter the medium. The character played by Wanda Sykes was just plain awful and was so out of place in this flick.";

The bed room scene was over the top and reduced an intimate moment into a farce of biological functions akin to passing gas in public. From the first every other scene was a discussion about how little sex they where getting how long its been since they got some when their next sexual liaison will be and with whom it should be with. On top of that the dialogue and acting was very poor and very forced not felt and they filled their lack of content with sleazy sex scenes. This could have been really funny because the concept is actually interesting but it is poorly executed here. Please do not even think about taking anyone under 16 if you have to go and see it.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit when I went to see this movie I didn't really have high expectations. But even with my low expectations I was totally and utterly disappointed...Basically Luke Wilson is a hot shot who tends to go out with slightly crazy girlfriends. There's slight mention of a girl stalking him but that's pretty much it for that character. Which i don't quite mind cause it would probably be just as underdeveloped as the rest of the movie.So while on a subway Rainn Wilson who i actually liked before this movie convinces him to talk to a hot girl Uma Thurman. This is strange to say the least as everyone can clearly see that Uma Thurman does not belong under the category of hot.Rainn Wilson's performance is also far from hot. Normally I'm all for his acting but even he couldn't salvage this movie. His character was jumpy unrealistic and rather annoying. You could never tell if the writers were trying to make him the comical token closet gay guy or just desperate. It was almost painful.But anyway someone steals her purse as she goes to leave the subway and Luke Wilson being the charming savior he is runs after the robber. Now we all know that Uma Thurman is the superhero or GGirl as they like to call her in the movie. It still baffles me as to what the G stands for but we'll leave that for the message boards to debate.The sex scenes I assume are supposed to be funny but I find myself asking who has sex like that? They nearly throw the bed through the wall because of Uma Thurman's passion let's say. It makes my head hurt but not in the I'm thinking really hard to understand this way.When Uma insults Anna Faris calling her a whore I had no debate with that. Apart from the fact that she can't choose movies properly she can't act and relies souly on the fact that she's blonde and typical.Overall I would've walked out of the theater if i hadn't paid 8.75 to see it. The characters are typical and have absolutely no chemistry especially Uma Thurman. Someone should let her know that just because you move your head a lot doesn't mean you're acting.Also the script and storyline could've used either a lot of work or a match and some lighter fluid. I actually started to feel embarrassed for the actors and their dying careers. Overall if you value your money and your self respect do NOT waste your time with this pathetic attempt at a movie.".

Now we all know that Uma Thurman is the superhero or GGirl as they like to call her in the movie. It still baffles me as to what the G stands for but we'll leave that for the message boards to debate.The sex scenes I assume are supposed to be funny but I find myself asking who has sex like that? They nearly throw the bed through the wall because of Uma Thurman's passion let's say. It makes my head hurt but not in the I'm thinking really hard to understand this way.When Uma insults Anna Faris calling her a whore I had no debate with that. Apart from the fact that she can't choose movies properly she can't act and relies souly on the fact that she's blonde and typical.Overall I would've walked out of the theater if i hadn't paid 8.75 to see it. The characters are typical and have absolutely no chemistry especially Uma Thurman. Someone should let her know that just because you move your head a lot doesn't mean you're acting.Also the script and storyline could've used either a lot of work or a match and some lighter fluid. I actually started to feel embarrassed for the actors and their dying careers. Overall if you value your money and your self respect do NOT waste your time with this pathetic attempt at a movie.";

Sergio Martino fills the screen with beautiful women black glove assassain good music and outstanding murder set pieces.  I wouldn't have like this film if the director had done an Argento copycat.Although the video is said to be uncut it still has the look of a movie with some scenes trimmed.  One example is the first murder.  Another example is the murder of the woman in the woods.  What also gives the impression of a trimmed film are the sudden jump cuts in certain spots during the movie.Suzy Kendall and Tina Aumont are stunning as the main female characters. The murder of Dani is a little shocking because the film teases the viewer with the idea that she will be the main heroine.  Torso1973 seems to be the main blue print for the plot of Prom Night1980another film that deals with a person who kills because of something from the past.  Torso1973 would provide an influence on American slasher flicks including Friday the 13th1980 Friday the 13th Part 21981 Halloween1978 I Know What You Did Last Summer1997 Maniac1980 My Bloody Valentine1981 and Scream 21997.The opening scene is shot with some terrific camera angles.  Torso1973 is one of the top ten giallos of the 1970's.  The combination of sex  violence in Torso1973 is a prime example of the bread and butter of the genre.  The scene where Suzy Kendall has to hide from the murderer is less on suspense and more on tension.The murder scene in the woods is shot with an atmospheric touch. The musical score by the DeAngelis brothers is as good as anything by Goblin.  The make up effects are above average.  My favorite part are the final twenty minutes.the story is well written by Ernesto Gastaldi who is also known for some memorable Italian flicks as The Horrible Dr. HitchcockFreda The Whip and the BodyBava I am Sartana Your Angel of DeathCarnimeo and Sahara Crossvalerii.

	schema:headline " A slashergiallo that is impressively tense and suspenseful";
	schema:reviewBody "Between 1971 and 1973 Sergio Martino directed a series of five astonishingly good horrorthrillers. In fact it could convincingly be argued that in those years Martino was the premier Italian director in this genre. Torso is the final film in this sequence and while it may possibly be the least of the five it still remains an excellent entry in the giallo subgenre. All five of his gialli had different angles that meant that they were not copies of each other. The Case of the Scorpion's Tail was a classicstyle giallo that had a strong mystery element The Strange Vice of Mrs Wardh added a significant layer of eroticism Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key added intense melodrama into the mix along with the plot of Edgar Allan Poe's the Black Cat All the Colors of the Dark combined the giallo with an occult horror story what Torso did was move the genre closer to the slasher film. To do this the movie is stripped of much of the detective mystery strand that typified the genre in the early 70's and instead focuses on the sex violence and tension. Maybe by 1973 the Italian public were growing tired of the plethora of mysterydriven gialli? I can't say but Torso certainly marginalises this and magnifies the salacious content.The story revolves around a group of young college women who are terrorised by an unknown blackgloved killer. The girls themselves are of course gorgeous. Most of them seem to spend quite a lot of time lying around seminaked as well. So from an erotic point of view this is a film that doesn't exactly mess about. In terms of its violence it's probably not as nasty as its reputation suggests although there is the famous hacksaw sequence that is admittedly quite grim albeit not especially graphic. There are several individual stalk and slash scenes the best of which is a sequence in the woods. This part is very atmospheric helped also by the effective music. Its scenes like this one and the saw idea that make this one feel like a precursor to the slasher films that would follow a few years later. But the best thing about Torso is its final third. In this part lead actress Suzy Kendall is trapped in a villa with the killer at work in the same house but unaware of her presence. This extended deadly game of cat and mouse is really expertly handled by Martino and is one of the most suspenseful sequences in the giallo genre. It is ultimately what defines this film.Torso is yet another excellent giallo from Sergio Martino. It comes highly recommended to fans of the genre. Just be aware that it's less concerned with plot mechanics and much more on suspense and vicarious thrills. Because the final third is so claustrophobic and intense it means that the wider mystery is almost forgotten about. But if this doesn't trouble you too much and you are happy with thrills that don't trouble your brain too much then this is a quality ride.".

	schema:headline " Creepy somewhat slowmoving yet still effective giallo";
	schema:reviewBody "I admire this piece of giallo cinema because of its great style and how director Sergio Martino contrasts the gorgeously beautiful Italian countryside with the bloody activities of a mysterious gloved killer. In this film the killer is unique because heshe casts a very unique eerie presence whenever hinted at or briefly shown onscreen usually wearing some sort of ski mask to hide hisher face. I also like the plot revolving around the red and black scarf and how it ties in with the identity of the murderer. The story follows a group of young gorgeous Italian coeds frightened when their friends start dropping like flies at the hands of a brutal slasher who likes to strangle stab and fondle the nude bodies of his victims another sick effective touch which makes the film all the more nasty. Four of the girls flee to a villa in a small scenic village to get away from all the atrocities committed on campus. Of course the killer has followed them there and is set on killing them off one by one. This film is very perverted in ways the killings are all sexually sadistic in nature and the motive basically revolves around the dangerous sexual games played by the beautiful coeds. I can't say more without revealing clues which may give away the killer's identity. Torso is also loaded with female nudity as the film starts right off with a wild orgy going on as the credits roll complete with close up shots of naked breasts. There is also a slight lesbian subplot involving two of the girls although we don't see anything that graphic at all. No male nudity is present which is too bad I was really waiting for one of my fav hot actors John Richardson to take something off but no such luck. Again this movie is creepily effective wellacted and has great photography and even if you do find it slowmoving keep with it as the finale is probably the best part of the film as the heroine has to watch the killer carve up her friends one of the most unnerving sequences I have ever seen captured on film. The music is pretty good for the most part but at times it seems like music better suited to a porno flick. And another thing to mention is the uncut version of this movie doesn't seem to have that much gore at all I just figured it would since such a big deal was made about it being uncut with all the grisly violence finally restored. It still seems like you're watching the Rrated version. Oh well. This is still a fun movie especially for those who love Italian horror.".

The presentation of the skimasked villain is particularly menacing accentuated by wide shots that lend the film a certain sort of tension amidst several wide shots showcasing the land and city there is a sense that the killer could be lurking anywhere in the frames. Throw in some above average acting especially from Kendall a bit of gratuitous nudity some vicious murder scenes and an unexpected ending and you've got a pretty decent thriller here. The slowburn approach that the film takes may require some patience but the atmosphere of the film and its third act really make it shine. Favorite scene?

	schema:reviewBody "Spoilers!There's no point in giving Torso a sensible review. Torso is a hack of a movie produced by famed producer Carlo Ponti only capitalize on the Giallo trend gory lurid Italian thrillers of the 1970s started mainly by the little gem of a movie Bird With The Crystal Plumage directed by Dario Argento. There's so little worth mentioning about Torso the makers of the movie having failed to achieve anything they set out to do. The end result of Torso looks more like a big budget Herschell Gordon Lewis flick with its inept acting story gore nudity etc than a stylish work by Argento or even Luici Fulci. Unlike Argento movies Torso is crass and worthless and is nothing more than cheap and boring producer's end product disguised as a giallo.The film is a complete patchwork of nonsensical scenes strung together with the flimsy excuse to titillate and it fails to do even that. For instance during the opening credits we see a threesome. What does this scene have to do with the rest of the story? We only learn about the meaning of that scene at the very end and if you blink you'll miss the reason. In other words it's completely trivial. The story starts with two murder scenes which ends with three young folks being dead. Their mutual friends 4 beautiful women traumatized and shocked by these gruesome murders decide to go to a secluded villa to drink dance sunbathe in the nude and have lesbian sex!!!!Yep that makes sense!Funny enough if the four babes wanted to go into hiding as inconspicuously as possible from the killer they totally failed as we see the women dressed in next to nothing attract the attention of EVERY men in the village including the village idiot. Of course with everyone in town knowing the girls are at the villa the killer arrives there on the same day! As the girls enjoy their blissful rest at the villa we are treated amongst other things to a hot lesbian scene that's witnessed by the village idiot AND the killer. With so many witnessing what goes on behind closed doors who needs walls? The lesbian sex scene is hilarious. It's obvious the two women were very uncomfortable with the whole thing. Anyway the killer goes after the terrified village idiot and kills him in the most unconvincing way. This scene is long and utterly pointless. So that leaves the four hot babes at the mercy of the psychosexual killer! We should see tons of action with murder mayhem violence more nudity right? NAW!Our heroine played by a too old and bored looking Suzy Kendall wakes up the next morning only to find all her friends butchered! What? You mean we don't see how the three babes were killed? No protracted and gratuitous murder scenes? Eh didn't we pay to see these type of scenes? Why did we get to see the village idiot killed and not the hot babes??? So now our heroine is trapped in this piece of trash...eh is unable to leave the secluded villa with the killer busy sawing the three babes into pieces he's never done that to the other victims. This murderer has no pattern whatsoever. Wait a minute! You mean the killer doesn't know Kendall is the house? Huh? Eventually the killer finally realizes Kendall is in the house and there's a cat  mouse bit and when the conclusion finally arrives it is truly lame and the reason why the murderer is a psychosexual killer is unbelievably inane and laughable! The only good things in this film are first the original title Bodies bare traces of carnal violence. Second some of the music is good. And third all the actors are really beautiful. Unless you really like Eurobabes do not buy the DVD. It's a rental and you'll be glad you rented it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Spoilers!There's no point in giving Torso a sensible review. Torso is a hack of a movie produced by famed producer Carlo Ponti only capitalize on the Giallo trend gory lurid Italian thrillers of the 1970s started mainly by the little gem of a movie Bird With The Crystal Plumage directed by Dario Argento. There's so little worth mentioning about Torso the makers of the movie having failed to achieve anything they set out to do. The end result of Torso looks more like a big budget Herschell Gordon Lewis flick with its inept acting story gore nudity etc than a stylish work by Argento or even Luici Fulci. Unlike Argento movies Torso is crass and worthless and is nothing more than cheap and boring producer's end product disguised as a giallo.The film is a complete patchwork of nonsensical scenes strung together with the flimsy excuse to titillate and it fails to do even that. For instance during the opening credits we see a threesome. What does this scene have to do with the rest of the story? We only learn about the meaning of that scene at the very end and if you blink you'll miss the reason. In other words it's completely trivial. The story starts with two murder scenes which ends with three young folks being dead.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't think I'll ever be able to explain the appeal of Italian slashergiallo films. I often enjoy the hell out of them but it's safe to say that I don't have a prayer in hell of ever getting anyone I know to ever share my sentiments. Their negative reactions often stem from the bad acting laughable writing and slow pacing that plague these works and the scary part is that I have a hard time disagreeing with any of their complaints. Sergio Martino's Torso is definitely a film for which all these negative detractors apply to but I'd be lying if I said it didn't provide its fair share of entertainment.It would be best to classify Torso as a middleoftheroad entry in the popular slashergiallo genre. It is certainly watchable but is not particularly invigorating and pales in comparison to the best works of Dario Argento. While Argento's films were often plagued with more than their fair share of deficiencies when it came to script and pacing the director had a gift for drawing one so deeply into his visual nightmares that any need to apply logic to the proceedings was nonexistent. Films of this genre have to deliver truly startling sequences in order for the viewer to look past their shortcomings. While Torso does contain a few sequences like that the last third's catandmouse game between the heroine and the killer is especially effective its pacing is too slack for it to be truly involving and certain elements of the film are just plain laughable. In particular a flashback sequence to a traumatic childhood event makes for the silliest most ludicrously funny explanation for a serial killer's behaviour that I have ever seen. But as I stated hilarious moments like that can also be contributing factors to my enjoyment of these films. So when all is said and done Torso is worthy viewing for fans of the Italian slasher genre. Enjoy it if you can but do not worry too much if neither you nor anyone else you know understands why.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gorgeous girls and gruesome horror.... that's pretty much all this Carnal Violence has got to offer. But let this just be all I was expecting and hoping to see! Sergio Martino's milestone giallo is a prime example of everything this brilliant Italian horror sub genre represents and everything the fans adore so much. Truly beautiful girls all with exhibitionisttendencies! attending a Roman college are stalked and brutally slain by a killer wearing an eerie mask and a red 'n black scarf. When a second girl is found horribly mutilated the few remaining girls flee to a countryside villa to recover but the malevolent butcher follows them. The plot is pretty much standard there aren't as many twists here as in other gialli and Martino inserts a couple of authentic clichs black gloves broken dolls... but there isn't a boring moment to detect anywhere! This movie is incredibly suspenseful from start to finish and the extremely violent images are somehow illustrated stylishly. Some of the makeup effects are quite staggering and especially the death of Carol in the woods impressed me enormously. The climax in which the last remaining heroine desperately hides for the maniac is amazingly compelling and it makes this movie a must for all giallofans. The score is breathtaking and the acting is far above average as far as I'm concerned. People that keep nagging about the supposedly awful dubbing should either stop watching European horror or learn Italian. The version of Carnal Violence I purchased was entirely dubbed in Spanish but I didn't allow this to bother me for one second. I was too occupied becoming one with the creepy atmosphere and the ravishing eyecandy. Carnal Violence absolutely positively is a GREAT horror gem and it all the more proves that Sergio Martino is a shamefully underrated director. His horror movies are hard to come across but oh so worth it!".

Suzy Kendall returns the the sub genre here playing an os student whose GFs begin turning up horribly mutilated prompting the surviving quartet to seek sanctuary in a sprawling castle atop a hill overlooking the besieged town. Predictably they're not safe for long.John Richardson has a largely frivolous supporting role as the college professor and whilst the majority of the female cast are attractive and frequently disrobed the acting in this film is lamentable. Kendall is a cut above no pun intended the performance standard of her peers and it shows when she's offscreen second lead Aumont  though possessing a profile  doesn't have the chops to carry the film. Some mild chills at the climax but overall it's a tame clichd resolution in which Kendall is virtually a bystander. The components are superficially present but Martino's picture feels too derivative of a onenote slasher film lacking the depth style and sophistication of quality Giallo.".

Predictably they're not safe for long.John Richardson has a largely frivolous supporting role as the college professor and whilst the majority of the female cast are attractive and frequently disrobed the acting in this film is lamentable. Kendall is a cut above no pun intended the performance standard of her peers and it shows when she's offscreen second lead Aumont  though possessing a profile  doesn't have the chops to carry the film. Some mild chills at the climax but overall it's a tame clichd resolution in which Kendall is virtually a bystander. The components are superficially present but Martino's picture feels too derivative of a onenote slasher film lacking the depth style and sophistication of quality Giallo.";

	schema:reviewBody "May be some small spoilersAlthough I believe that horror is each to his own there are a few common characteristics that make a good horror film.  Torso has a few of those elements but only some of the time.  The rest of the piece is an incorrigible soft core porno film yet when I was intrigued with the film I was enamoured with it.  This is one horror flick that had me feeling tense in many parts and for that I have to give it credit.  It is unfortunate that most of the brilliance was bunched into one thrilling 20 or 30 minute scene but better to have 20 or 30 minutes of intriguing terror than 88 minutes of sheer acrimony.  When you use the word acrimony in a review about a horror film then not much else can be said to try and make the film sound better than it really is.  And although I am not saying that I was acrimonious or apathetic for that matter towards this film I am saying that there were many areas that could have been improved upon.  This didn't look like it had a very grandiose budget in fact it looked as though the producers spent parsimoniously when you take into account the lack of certain necessities like lighting but you can have a small budget and still have an effective horror filmsee Texas Chainsaw Massacre for example.Torso begins with the murder of some college students.  Many of the murders in this film are beautiful women and many of the stars are sinfully perfect nubile vixens that seem starved for some licentious saturnalia seeing as all they seem to do is either sunbathe in the nude have lesbian sex flash their assets to the local men and run around like women in the Spanish film When The Screaming Stops.  In short this is a typical Italian 70's style horror film.  In fact for the most part of the early going in the film I was actually quite disappointed with the film's vacuous attempt to entertain us with scantily clad women.  Although nice to look at it did little to enhance the film.  And not only that but the film did seem a slight bit abstruse at times.  There were characters that came and went and sometimes they looked like each other and then other times certain people just disappeared from the film completely.  Perhaps this was done to confuse us and send us looking for the red herring but it just confused and annoyed me more than anything.What is good however is the directing.  The story may have been the weakest link of the film but the direction was quite well done.  Sergio Martino may be an early pioneer to the slasher genre and perhaps Polanski and Carpenter and Craven really did get some of their ideas and inspiration from some of his work.  There are three scenes in the film that really had me singing his praises.  The first starts at a party where everyone seems to be stoned to Palookaville.  One of the girls eschews some sexual advances from two hippies and wanders out into the woods alone dazed confused and in a cataclysmic state of oblivion.  She just seems to be wandering for the sake of wandering.  When she finally realizes how far she has drifted into the woods it is too late.  The killer stalks her and taunts her in some ways. The killer knows he has her and he takes his time before he slices her open. What is so laudable about this sequence is the pacing the camera shots and the music.  Music is an apodictic part of any successful horror film and this is a perfect paradigm as to why.  If you took the stingers and the stalking type of music away from this film it may not have as much credibility as it does.  But as it stands the music adds much atmosphere to the film.Another perfectly done part of the film is the final 20 minutes in the film when our heroine Jane wakes up one morning to find her three friends butchered.  The killer doesn't know that she is in the house and she horrifically watches as he begins to cut the corpses into two pieces.  She is then trapped in the house and he eventually discovers she is in there. What ensues is a tight and tense cat and mouse game that really did leave me with goose pimples.  There are some excellent overhead shots reaction shots and POV shots.  If you look at any Friday the 13th film you can almost see Sean Cunningham and Steve Miner studying Martino's agility and style with the camera.What is not so good however is the killer and why he kills.  If this film would have tightened it up a bit and given the killer a better reason to kill then I think it would have ranked a lot higher than it does in my books.  I am still giving this film a 7 out of 10 but with a more in depth analysis of this killer then the film would have stood out even more.  But all we get is a brief halfassed explanation as to what happened to this guy as a kid and how he developed his complete hatred towards certain people.  The writing certainly could have provided us with more than that.Torso surprised me.  It starts out very circuitously but finally does settle into a well done effective entry into the Italian horror legends.  Fulci and Argento are still kings of the cinema but Martino certainly makes a valiant attempt.  The result is a farrago of shock tension and some small gore.  I would recommend checking this film out.  It is much better than what most of Hollywood asks us to swallow.  And if you can find that then you've won half the battle.  I would like to see the unrated version of this film because this did seem to be chopped and edited to hell.7 out of 10 A little confusing at times but worth the ride.".

Most of them are movies that I either wasn't old enough to see when they first came out never played near where I lived or never had access to. VHS was a bad solution since back then movies ran about 99 per title. But with disc that's all changed. Movies became affordable. In addition to that in recent years several companies have gone back through the vaults and rescued many movies from obscurity some good some bad. One of the driving forces among those has been Arrow Video which I consistently praise and will continue to do so. They never fail to deliver.Such is the case with TORSO a movie long discussed and praised by horror and giallo fans. I'd heard of the film years ago and it was one that developed a certain amount of notoriety in the years following its release. One would think with a title like that and the love of blood in Italian films that the movie would be a gore fest that fans would flock to. What I found was something quite different than I expected.The film opens with credits over a threesome taking place. Why? It doesn't matter until the end of the film. Once the credits finish we find ourselves in an art class at the University of Perugia in Italy. Class breaks and student Jane Suzy Kendall approaches the teacher Franz John Richardson to ask a question before joining her friends in the plaza. Daniela Tina Aumont is approached by Stefano Roberto Bisacco who is obsessed with her but brushes him off.That night two students go parking beneath a nearby bridge. Hearing a noise the young man goes to investigate. When he doesn't return the girl goes searching for him. It isn't long before the film's killer gets hold of her and strangles here with a red and black scarf. It appears he cuts into her as well but the way the shots are filmed we never see the body and we're not quite sure if this is what's happening or if the killer scarred by his past is reliving something that took place before.Hearing of the murder one of the fellow students' rushes away with a few boys on motorcycles. Holed up in an abandoned house with what appears to be a group of freesexfree drugs hippies this was made in 1973 you know she flirts with the two boys and allows them to grope her. Before things go too far she runs off with the boys in pursuit. In the woods they drive past where she's hiding but the movie's killer is there to catch her and she is killed as well.School is canceled as a result of the murders. Franz and Jane make plans to meet the following week and an apparent romance seems in the works. Daniella and friends need a break from the events while they study and her uncle suggest they use a villa away from Perugia. They agree and head off to the retreat in the isolated villa. They're not the only ones who have headed this way as they've been pursued by the killer. What reason could he have for singling out this group of girls? And which ones will survive?All the elements of the classic giallo are on hand here. The killer being an unseen entity face never revealed and in this case masked. The black gloves. The point of view shots from the killer's perspective. And at the heart of it all a mystery as to why the killer is murdering what hisher motivation is. It is the mystery in a giallo that makes them worth watching trying to figure out who the killer is before the final reel.For all its notoriety the film truly didn't have near as much gore in it as I expected to find. Perhaps it's another case of a movie where the viewers were so stunned at the time that they imagined seeing more than was actually there. TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE has the scene of the girl placed in a meat hook that people still claim to have seen popping through her chest though it never happens. PSYCHO fans insist they saw the knife enter Janet Leigh but it never happened. This might be the case here. There is plenty of blood on hand but as for gore I'm struggling to remember much.Director Sergio Martino was a prolific director in Italy and well known for the mark he made on the giallo genre. It's easy to see why while watching this film. His use of cinematography and storytelling are excellent. That's not surprising after having recently watched his film THE CASE OF THE SCORPION'S TAIL also from Arrow Video.Horror fans have had the opportunity to own a copy of this film in the past but those releases are no longer available. Thankfully Arrow Video is offering the chance to own the film to those fans again who may have not done so at the time. Even if you did purchase one of the previous versions you need to pick this one up. Not only are they offering it with a brand new 2K restoration of the film from the original camera negative this release has the movie in 4 different versions from the original Italian to the American to the combined versions.Hang on though this is an Arrow Video release. That means that there are plenty of extras on hand as well. Those include a new audio commentary track by Kat Ellinger the author of ALL THE COLOURS OF SERGIO MARTINO a new interview with cowriterdirector Martino a new interview with actor Luc Merenda a new interview with cowriter Ernesto Gastaldi a new interview with Mikel J. Koven author of LA DOLCE MORTE VERNACULA CINEMA AND THE ITALIAN GIALLO FILM a 2017 Abertoir International Horror Festival QA with Martino the Italian and English theatrical trailers a reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by Adam Rabalais and with the first pressing only an illustrated collector's booklet featuring new writing on the film by Adrian Smith and Howard Hughes.If you love giallo films or horror films then rush out and make sure to add this one to your collection. It is the ultimate version of this film to have on hand. And if you've never seen it make sure to check with that friend who did buy a copy and make a giallo movie night of it. The odds of you enjoying the film are high.".

	schema:reviewBody "When one describes a romance film it is normal to use the classic line 'Boy Meets Girl Boy Loves Girl Boy Loses Girl... It would be easy to use that formula for any love story. But this is no ordinary love story. It's tragic it's surprising and above all it feels so real. It's not a story this cynical teenage film buff will forget anytime soon if ever.Joe Clay the Great Jack Lemmon is a public relations man who doesn't really like his job we see his boredom and frustration in the very first frame of the film when he's trying at the last minute to round up some call girls for a party. We also see how he deals with this by shouting to the bartender Hit me again! multiple times. He soon meets Kirsten Arneson the incredible and incredibly underrated Lee Remick and they detest each other but after a dinner and a walk around Fisherman's Warf where they bare their souls they soon fall in love get married and have a beautiful baby girl. Everything seems perfect. But when Joe's job puts added pressure on him he feels the only way to relieve himself is to get drunk. In one sad and memorable scene he comes home late and because she cannot drink due to breast feeding degrades Kirsten for not being fun anymore. The pain of the things Joe says stings both of them and us as well and before long Kirsten is taking up the bottle herself. Years later Joe really looks at himself and has a moment of clarity They have to sober up for both of them and we the viewers know it can only get worse unless someone does something. But when they both fall off the wagon multiple times and it becomes clear that love will not conquer all Joe is faced with the nightmarish decision to choose between sobriety and his love for Kirsten. While I was watching this film I kept on comparing it to other addiction films like Trainspotting Requiem for a Dream and The Lost Weekend. While they are all great in their own right they can't really compare because the core of Days of Wine and Roses is the love story that quickly turns into a love triangle between Joe Kirsten and booze. It's the love story and the full realization of the characters that makes Days so heartbreaking. Another thing is that we know that Joe and Kirsten are both good people After Joe accidentally mistakes Kirsten for a call girl he is the one who brings a peace offering and tries to make ammends and it is evident to the viewer that during their sobriety they have a powerful love for their young daughter which makes their drunken turns all the more powerful. Blake Edward's direction is spoton This was his first big drama after being recognized for his comedic work but he works wonders and gets brilliantalbeit unsurprisingly brilliantperformances out of Lee and Jack. Edwards also has the magical touch of reeling the viewer in thinking this will be a breezy romantic comedy then slowly revealing the destruction of two lost souls through the bottle. The luscious black and white cinematography was a great choice to make in a time when color was dazzling the audiences for it works as a symbol for the darkness and bleak world of alcoholism. Henry Mancini's music is minimalistic and affecting in the old days of cinema it was easy to overuse the strings for a dramatic scene but the score was perfect and not once overdone. The chemistry between Jack and Lee was genius I couldn't believe they weren't a married couple in real life. Great performances can get you far but a love story loses half its power unless its two stars makes the love believable and these two really did. And the audience can clearly see that the two are in love drunk or sober good times or bad. This makes the last scene all the more heartbreaking. And I can't praise the two lead actors enough. Jack Lemmon like Edwards was known more for his comedic work. Some have complained that he was too overthetop in his performance most notably the infamous greenhouse scene but an actor deserves to be known and praised for his overall work and in the long run Jack deserved an Oscar for this role. Every move he makes he makes believable and gets deep into the head of an alcoholic. He makes Joe a sympathetic character and he really makes you care for him. Jack once said when he was doing Glengarry Glen Ross that You don't have to like a character but it's an actor's job to make you care about him. I don't think there's a person on this site who didn't care about Joe Clay. This is Jack's role of a lifetime. And I'm ashamed to say I had never heard of Lee Remick before this film but now she's one of my favorite actresses. She was a very sharp actress and the camera loved her. Whether she was a smiling young secretary or a lonely drunk you bought the transformation and every moment in between. She had a killing smile but she could break your heart with just a look of her eyes. When the alcohol reveals a vulnerability and a need to be loved she only thinks she can hide Lee is there making the performance believable and utterly heartbreaking. When the last scene comes around and Joe and Kirsten are faced with a lifechanging decision the two actors are so good and so into their roles you can easily forget that they're both acting. The love is still there but it's changed so much. The last shot like the whole film will leave you breathless. One of the greatest films I've ever seen.".

Everyone that is moderately to heavily drunk thinks that they are so clever funny entertaining and so on.  It has a certain surreal aspect.There are several scenes in this film which bring back that feeling to me. When Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick are at their most slaphappy riproaring state of drunkenness and having a great time it gave me this odd sensation  these people are not funny not clever and not entertaining.  This is at least one of the points made in this very well made film.The story is well told and answers the question that many people have about alcoholism and perhaps addiction in general How do things ever get so terribly out of control?.  It happens slowly and it happens for a multitude of reasons.  The reasons that this film deals mostly with include loneliness wanting to please others wanting to do one's job without compromising one's integrity childhood abandonment low selfesteem and just the fact that in the social world everyone drinks.Lemmon and Remick do a fabulous job as your ordinary young couple who get started slowly but surely going down the wrong track.  Charles Bickford as Remick's father has little screen time but makes every moment of it count. Jack Klugman is also very good as Lemmon's Alcoholics Anonymous friend.Some things are wonderfully telegraphed.  Lee Remick has this thing about chocolate addiction potential. There's just a moment when you see a smoldering cigarette in an ashtray and you get the feeling that something bad is going to happen it does.  When Jack Lemmon in a drunken state comes home one evening he impetuously picks some flowers for Lee Remick. The elevator door closes on them cutting off the tops of the flowers. When he arrives home the couple have their first really big fight.  Also I think it is interesting that every time that Lee Remick is watching the television she is watching cartoons  an interesting statement.The cinematography is realistic sometimes downright gritty.  Filming it in black and white helped to enhance this mood especially in the greenhouse and the psychiatric ward scenes.Perhaps the most important point of the story is that addiction be it alcohol or other things can happen to anyone.  Sometimes you just don't realize it until it's too late.The Days of Wine and Roses is a fine message movie that gets its point across without getting preachy or selfrighteous with believable performances by all.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was first a television play performed live and then went on to Hollywood for a slightly glossier production. This is NOT a bad pedigree as shortly before this the TV movie Marty was also brought to Hollywood and became one of the best movies of the 1950s. Both the TV and Hollywood versions are excellentsee either or both if you get the chance.To me this movie is the antithesis of The Lost Weekend. The Lost Weekend was not a very realistic portrayal of alcoholism in many waysparticularly the ending where the lead suddenly just kicks his addiction and everything is hunkydory. Get real! Days of Wine and Roses instead does not pull punches. It refuses to give in to sentimentality and take the typical Hollywood approach to films. There is no happy ending there were surprises and heartbreakmuch like dealing with alcoholism in real life.Because it would spoil it to give too much information I will only briefly discuss the plot. Jack Lemmon is a business man who slowly goes from the two martini lunch to alcoholism. His acting was very convincing and gutwrenching. Equally compelling is his wife Lee Remick who puts on the performance of her life as the longsuffering wife who slowly goes from codependent to alcoholism herself. I've worked in a chemical dependency program and I've got to tell you all the excuses and bargains and excesses in the movie were exactly what my clients had said and done as well. It is obvious the writers were doing their homework as the movie delivers on every level.UPDATE Since this review I was able to see the original teleplaywhich along with a few other teleplays of the era are available through the Criterion Collection. See this in its original form. While not nearly as glossy it still packs a huge dramatic punch!".

Jack Lemmon has always been a personal favorite of mine especially for screwball comedy. But just like Robin Williams Lemmon is capable of turning heads w his dramatic roles.  The Days of Wine and Roses is a showcase of that dramatic talent.  And along with Lee Remick this film's performances exceed all expectations.  The direction and cinematography utilizes the black and white medium to it's fullest extent while the script is earthy human and most of all believable. This is a tour de force in the craft of modern filmmaking.  And an absolutely essential requirement for aficionados of the dramatic genre.  How Remick and Lemmon managed to be past up for the best actoractress Oscar for their phenomenal performances never ceases to amaze me.  Twenty years later their performances are just as fresh relevant and just as powerful. There was no sugarcoated ended.  This film sought to depict alcoholism as the demon it truly is and that sometimes people just don't get well despite all the love and support that's offered to them.If you've never seen it rent it.  Just be sure to rent it in letterbox to maintain the movies original ratio.  A film this beautiful needs to be seen in it's best form.  Take someone you love along with you for the ride.".

Sadly as in all these cases Joe is the last person to see that he  needs help. Doubly sadly he takes someone else with him. Marrying a  bright nondrinking Kirsten Joe introduces her to the pleasures of  social drinking. Reluctant at first after her first few Brandy  Alexanders have made her giggly Kirsten admits that having a drink  made me feel good.  Unhappily their drinking doesn't stop there. Frustrated at work Joe  feels the only way he can relax is to have a coupla blasts in the  evening. Then he is frustrated because his wife is stone cold sober.  Wanting to demonstrate her love for Joe Kirsten joins him in nightly  sessions which find her drinking more and regularly getting drunk. As  Kirsten develops a liking for liquor bottles go missing from the  drinks cupboard   When Joe is demoted and sent out of town Kirsten finds the best way to  ease her loneliness is to drink it away. Drunk in the daytime she sets  fire to their apartment and almost kills herself and her young child.  Joe is fired and the next few years are a series of shortlived jobs  and increasing addiction to drink. It certainly seems to be usual for  Kirsten to be fairly drunk by the time Joe comes home.  At last Joe has his moment of clarity and tries to dry out. The  attempt fails when he and Kirsten fall off the wagon and start getting  very drunk again. Their only hope is to join Alcoholics Anonymous. Joe  can see this but now it is Kirsten who refuses to believe she has a  problem.  Ultimately Joe has to make the nightmare decision to reject his wife  who is now unable to face life without being drunk.  Watching this shattering film is like being trapped in a nightmare  where something horrible is happening and yet you cannot look away. A  sense of doom hangs over this tragic couple who are unaware of the fate  they are walking into. Thankfully the performances and direction are  more than capable of delivering on the promise of this uncompromising  story.".

Together with The Lost Weekend I believe these are the two best movies Hollywood properly and seriously produced about this important subject. The sad story has no final redemption or commercial conclusion and is a must see. The gorgeous Lee Remick and the excellent Jack Lemmon have magnificent performances and deserved their nomination to the Oscar.

Perhaps there's one too many premonitions at the beginning this is a problem Wilder didn't have since his central character was an alcoholic at the start and some may find that the guy from Alcoholics Anonymous near the end is a bit too good to be true.

	schema:headline " Tragic love story destroyed from within";
	schema:reviewBody "The tragedy of this love story is that of unkept commitments. The emotional financial and childrearing commitments of marriage are discarded for a primary relationship with alcohol. And other obligations too such as daughter to father.The character development of Kirsten is well done. We are privileged to skip years at a time seeing her going from having fun with alcohol where most people stay to it consuming her a little at a time with the snapshots spread over years. We see Joe wander unhappily for half a lifetime before finding himself. We see his initial shallow love becoming real and we see it tested. At one time or another both Joe and Kirsten's love is real which makes the ending so powerful.The most heartwrenching scene for me is the confrontation between Joe and Kirsten's father in the greenhouse. After many years of denial we get to see a sample of Kirsten's father's intense emotional pain with the final acceptance that his daughter will never be the same. Even worse his age indicates that this is near the end of his life. Even if Kirstin could turn back it will be too late for her father.After I saw this movie I found myself analyzing what human relationships are about and the expectations that come with those relationships so I could figure out exactly what went wrong. Is the movie just about a partner leaving as with infidelity? It is much worse than that. This is about theft and destruction of identity and purpose choice and control. Dulled by the pleasure and escape Kirstin doesn't even know what is being taken from her. Even though everyone she hurts loses much her loss is even greater.This movie counters the popular belief that alcoholics are just partyers or problem drinkers. This may be where they start but it's not where they end up. Even with the most powerful of reasons to stop drinking the love for their daughter Joe and Kirsten are unable to stop they drink because they are addicted.The portrayal of the AA meeting isn't as good as it could have been. I suppose it may match the world's perception with overtones of a religious tent meeting. Go to one and you'll find that they aren't about swearing off addiction they are about selfacceptance and seeing yourself objectively. Somewhere between the denial that you are not an alcoholic and selfdisappointment  guilt is a realistic view of who you are. By accepting yourself and having the support of peers life's challenges can be met without alcohol. Hope for internal improvement is given to a higher power rather than trying yourself then being disappointed.Having loved an alcoholic at one time I can tell you that the pain portrayed in the film is all real. It is not just that alcoholics can't stop smokers can't but only hurt their families financially.The pain comes in because alcohol causes loss of emotional identity. Alcoholics have no idea who they are anymore. They cannot love they cannot even be very good friends. They push everyone away to love their addiction then become emotionally needy so use those around them emotionally. The worst way to be taken advantage of.Thankfully most people are genetically predisposed to get sick when the alcohol dosage gets to levels that can cause real addiction. Those that can drink may never have opportunity to sustain that dosage long enough to get addicted. But for the rest this movie is a warning of what alcohol has waiting for you  the destruction of any kind of normal life.See When a Man Loves a Woman for a more modern setting for this type of story though it is not as good.".

	schema:reviewBody "POSSIBLE SPOILERS  BEWAREI will not bother repeating what others have said so well about this movie.  The two things that struck me in particular about this movie were 1 the surprisingly graphic references for its time and 2 the amazing similarity of a 39 year old movie to things that went on in my late nineties life. I was surprised that the movie makers were allowed to be as candid as they were back in 1962.  For example Kirstin holding her breasts and telling her husband she can't drink because she is nursing.  But the most astonishing scene was when in a drunken stupor she slips into her father's bed and tries to seduce him!  Nobody talks much about that scene when discussing this movie.  Maybe because it is too painful to fathom the fact that one could lose that much control on alcohol.  Are there any other movies about alcoholism that feature such a scene? I was in a marriage that had basically the same trajectory as the Clay marriage no kids fortunately except that alcohol was not the only partner ahem.  Seeing this movie made me see very clearly that alcohol and people never really change regardless of any advances on behalf of the human race we make on the way. One last thing I believe this was one of the first movies to make use of one of my favorite cinematic devices that in which cartoons are playing on a television in the background of a scene in order to convey the insanity of the situation.  It is put to good use particularly the second time when Joe finds his wife in a seedy motel room and the picture is completely distorted.  12 Monkeys The Twilight Zone and Close Encounters of the Third Kind used this trick but pray tell are there any early early movies".

	schema:headline " Misery Loves Company";
	schema:reviewBody "Days of Wine and Roses was originally a live broadcast original drama from Playhouse 90 and starred Cliff Robertson and Piper Laurie. Both they and the drama got great critical reviews but sad to say they were not considered any kind of box office so when the film version was done Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick were cast instead.I've seen both versions and I'd hate to say which is the better. In terms of casting the part of Joe Clay fits right in with Lemmon's Mr. Average man roles. Imagine his character of C.C. Baxter if instead of taking his doctor's advice and becoming a mensch gave in and turned to drink. That's what you have in Joe Clay.Misery does love company the most miserable drinkers are the solitary ones. Lemmon's job in public relations occasionally calls for him to supply some lady friends for his boss's party. So who could blame him when he mistakes Lee Remick his boss Jack Albertson's new secretary for one of the hired bimbos.Naturally the uptight Ms. Remick resents it at first but she sure does warm up to him and eventually joins him in his boozing. They even marry and have a daughter. The rest of the film is their joint descent into alcoholism and the effort of one who eventually joins Alcoholics Anonymous to help the other who simply won't be helped.Charles Bickford repeats his role from the original Playhouse 90 broadcast and is a stern father figure for Remick who can't see why his own sternness may have helped drive her to Lemmon and booze. Look also for a very good performance by Jack Klugman as the counselor from Alcoholics Anonymous.Remick and Lemmon were both nominated for Best Actress and Actor but lost to Anne Bancroft and Gregory Peck respectively. Days of Wine and Roses did win an Oscar for Best Song with the title tune for the film. Andy Williams sold quite a few vinyl platters in his day with his version and their are good versions of the song by both Frank Sinatra and Tony Martin.Days of Wine and Roses is still a powerful drama about the terrible evil of substance abuse. It hasn't lost anything in 46 years in fact I'm willing to bet we may see a version for the new millenia.".

Trying to come to some kind of agreement in going back to the lives that they once had before booze got in between them Kris just can't bring herself to beat the bottle. Kris not able to come to terms with her alcoholism and Joe not willing to sacrifice his and Debbie's life in placating her go their separate ways. The movie ends with Joe seeing a poor and helpless Kris walk out of his life for good with the local bar sign reflecting sadly and eerily on his apartment window.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jack Lemmon an up and coming Public Relations man and a budding alcoholic meets Lee Remick who doesn't drink but likes chocolate. Jack introduces her to Brandy Alexanders and they soon embark on the downward spiral into alcoholism. Several years and several jobs later Lee nearly burns down their apartment with their young daughter in it. Jack looses another job. Realizing they have lost control they move in with Lee's father Charles Bickford and work in his greenhouse growing and delivering flowers and trees. Soon Jack gains Charles' trust and sneaks 2 pints of liquor into their room. After making short work of the 2 bottles Jack nearly destroys the greenhouse drunkenly looking for the third bottle. Waking up in the mental ward with the DT's Jack meets Jack Klugman who introduces him to AA. After becoming sober and returning to work Lemmon tries to woo Remick to join him in sobriety. At the close of the film we know that Lemmon will remain sober and can only hope that Remick will eventually join him in sobriety. As a Recovering Alcoholic sober over 19 years I can tell you this is a VERY plausible portrayal of the heartbreak that is alcoholism. I try to watch this film at least once a year just so I don't forget what I am. In addition to the wonderful writing and tremendous acting by both Jack and Lee the theme 'The Days of Wine and Roses' by Henry Mancini weaves and haunts the entire film. Don't miss it!".

Several years and several jobs later Lee nearly burns down their apartment with their young daughter in it. Jack looses another job. Realizing they have lost control they move in with Lee's father Charles Bickford and work in his greenhouse growing and delivering flowers and trees. Soon Jack gains Charles' trust and sneaks 2 pints of liquor into their room. After making short work of the 2 bottles Jack nearly destroys the greenhouse drunkenly looking for the third bottle. Waking up in the mental ward with the DT's Jack meets Jack Klugman who introduces him to AA. After becoming sober and returning to work Lemmon tries to woo Remick to join him in sobriety. At the close of the film we know that Lemmon will remain sober and can only hope that Remick will eventually join him in sobriety. As a Recovering Alcoholic sober over 19 years I can tell you this is a VERY plausible portrayal of the heartbreak that is alcoholism. I try to watch this film at least once a year just so I don't forget what I am. In addition to the wonderful writing and tremendous acting by both Jack and Lee the theme 'The Days of Wine and Roses' by Henry Mancini weaves and haunts the entire film. Don't miss it!";

This was a welltold welldirected wellacted film. I watched it on TCM and got a bit of the background of the story from Robert O. I went in with expectations and I was not disappointed. Without going into the plot really watching the transformations of LemmonRemick's characters into alcoholic 'bums' as Lemmon called them was quite powerful. By the end of the movie I was happy for Lemmon's character he goes to AA and has been sober for a year but his wife who he introduced to social drinking has not climbed out of the pit. Lee Remick was great at the end appearing to want to change but not wanting to see how dirty the world really was. It was really pitiful. When she left at the end I felt Lemmon's character's pain bc his eyes sort of had hope that she would get sober but at the same time felt just as strongly that she was lost forever. For a set of actors to be able to convey conflicting emotions wsuch ease in one scene is quite rare these days so while it was painful as a movie viewer it was a joy to watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most of us think of Blake Edwards as a director of comedies. After all his Pink Panther series provided us with some of the funniest movies ever made and his Dudley Moore comedies Micki And Maude and particularly 10 are classics too. But Edwards was also capable of churning out more serious fare. The best of these films was a hit in 1962 but has long since been forgotten.Days Of Wine And Roses begins innocently enough as young public relations director Joe Clay goes on a first date with Kirsten Arnesen. While Kirsten is young and innocent Joe makes his living in postwar corporate America. When my dad first began his sales career during this same time period his best friend warned him he had joined a drinking fraternity. Sure enough Joe introduces Kirsten to social drinking they have lots of fun get married and have a daughter.As the Clay's casual drinking descends into a life of fullblown alcoholic despair both Jack Lemmon as Joe and Lee Remick as Kirsten turn in the best performances of their careers. Joe eventually loses his topnotch sales position then bounces around from job to job before reluctantly going to work in his fatherinlaw's landscaping business. Joe and Kirsten manage sobriety for a while but the lure of readilyavailable alcohol is simply too strong. Joe eventually gets sober through the then fledgling organization Alcoholics Anonymous while Kirsten a teetotaler at the film's outset does not.Simply put this is a film about alcoholism. Not the closet alcoholism portrayed by Ray Milland in The Lost Weekend nor the death wish alcoholism of Nicholas Cage in Leaving Las Vegas. No this is a warningshot about the fine line between social drinking and disease. This may not sound like entertainment per se but consider it a very wellacted and wellwritten monition. While certain timeandplace aspects of Days Of Wine And Roses are dated its message carries as much heft today as it did over a halfcentury ago.Lemmon should have won a Best Actor Oscar if for no other reason than his scene of futile anguish when he breaks into his fatherinlaw's greenhouse one night for a hidden bottle of alcohol. The personal torment he conveys here is a heartbreaking plea for help  to no one in particular save for himself and his creator. As a side note Gregory Peck won that year's Best Actor Oscar for To Kill A Mockingbird. It was one of those congratulatory Oscars where the academy honors a longtime great more for his or her body of work than the specific performance in question. Ironically Lemmon himself would win such an Oscar eleven years later for the lessimpressive Save The Tiger. Screenwriter J.P. Miller adapted Days Of Wine And Roses from his own Playhouse 90 teleplay of 1958. Miller added some new material Jack Lemmon in the title role and voila! A classic was born.One of the enduring ramifications of this picture was the explosion in popularity of Alcoholics Anonymous. Founded in 1935 AA was still in its germinating state when Blake Edwards released Days Of Wine And Roses. The timing couldn't have been better. The end of prohibition in 1933 coupled with the return of the often harddrinking WWII soldiers in 1945 and a new economic and cultural prosperity in America in the 1950s resulted in an outbreak of alcoholism never before witnessed. Many Americans searched for a cure yet coveted anonymity due to the social norms of the day. Because of its relevance and again because of Jack Lemmon's masterful acting accomplishment I believe Days Of Wine And Roses should have won the Best Picture Oscar for 1962  rather than David Lean's beautiful yet long and somewhat draggy Lawrence Of Arabia. As our local newscasts never tire of reminding us alcoholism and drunk driving in particular is still a problem over 50 years after the release of Days Of Wine And Roses. Even if you've seen it before it certainly deserves another look. And that's why it's this month's Buried Treasure.".

	schema:reviewBody "The true essence of addiction is masterfully depicted in Blake Edwards' Days of Wine and Roses a movie starting with a misleading comedic mood reminding of Bill Wilder's Apartment. Indeed Jack Lemmon in another role perfectly fir for him portrays an average Joe whose name is Clay a Public Relations manager. The big corporate world again and the corrupting effect of urban life in the early sixties  Joe perceives his role as one of a 'legitimate pimp' a lucidity shared with Kirsten Arensen the young office secretary tired of playing the same motherly role for her boss who just needs her to be there. Kirsten the beautiful Lee Remick drowns her frustration by benignly nourishing her body with chocolates and her mind with encyclopedia books and contemplating water trying to find parcels of beauty in the world  the film's darker tones are almost imperceptible.Mutual frustration creates mutual attraction and the whole starter of the relationship between Joe and Kirsten is their aversion for their lives. As viewers we are so enchanted by Lemmon and Remick's growing love that we unconsciously overlook that there is something already corrupted not in the love's sincerity but in the medium that drives this sincerity. The first time Joe declares his love he's drunk and Kirsten euphoric after a chocolatebased cocktail drunk for the first time. They do love each other but not in a disinterested way Joe needs Kirsten to express his jolly side and let the entire bad mood get out of his chest. He's natural and she likes that she who used to live with strict parents and couldn't communicate with his father after her mother's death. Kirsten found in Joe the positive pole of a depressing life a true complicity poignantly incarnated by their inspiring toast meaning Together in Heaven in Norwegian words that Joe's too drunk to utter correctly ... premonition?The pivotal part of the film opens when Joe's transferred to another client not to be the pimp delivering girls for yacht parties but a follower whose new associate's drinking habits will disastrously affect his life to the point he will always go back home drunk. One night after finding Kirsten quietly rocking their daughter Debbie to sleep singing a quiet lullaby he cracks up. In a heartbreaking monologue Joe shouts his need for finding Kirsten on the same wavelength. Like her previous boss he needs her to be there. Kirsten's acceptance starts the infernal spiral leading to their downfall. This part crucially mirrors the predispositions of both Joe and Kirsten to alcoholism and the movie is incredibly ahead of its time in the transparent way it tackles the subject.Indeed Kirsten accepts less out of love for Joe than for alcohol her drinking in order to please him is as convenient as his dedication to his job is 'zealous' and this mess inevitably leads to the Kirsten accidentally setting the house on fire and Joe being fired. They become bums boozers and losers with a realistic touch I didn't even found in Leaving Las Vegas where the romantic aspect prevailed despite the tragedy. No romance here only the tragedy of addiction devouring the body and the mind of Joe and Kirsten together ... in hell. And the movie shines in the acting department as both leads literally blew me away. I rank Jack Lemmon's performance as equal to Ray Milland in The Lost Weekend or Ellen Burstyn in Requiem for a Dream. The part where he's looking for the hidden bottle going from joy to confusion to anger to rage and despair such a wide range of emotions in one single scene should have earned him the Oscar in 1962 despite the competitiveness of the year.The movie is a powerful illustration of both addictions' devastating effects and its unsuspected roots. And by powerful I mean intelligent because it showed a subtlety too often ignored that sometimes we enjoy a drug within another habit. When you can't have a coffee without smoking or enjoying something without a 'starter' a substance to accompany you believing these consumptions are indispensable to drive the enjoyment or the pleasure. And this is the sad originality in Joe and Kirsten's relationships they needed each other to shamelessly express the dependence inhabiting their lives. The perversity is that they ended up only loving themselves as drunkards as Joe said they were not a couple but a threesome.This could be highlighted by the painful rehab scenes where Joe shouts for his wife. We wonder if he's missing Kirsten or booze. The movie is audaciously violent and concludes in a mood in total opposition with the start. Joe tries to recover inspired by a powerful desire to provide a good life for Debbie. He's helped by Jack Klugman as Jim Hungerford from the Alcoholic Anonyms a performance I would have appreciated to see nominated along with Charles Bickford as Ellis Kirsten's unfortunate father who witnesses the decline of his little girl.Speaking of Ellis the ending of the film is a clever reminder of one of the questions he asked Joe what would he do if a X Company did something bad and Joe almost implied that he would try to hide it or makes it look good. Ironically this perfectly sums up what addiction is about finding excuses such as enjoying life forgetting the problems etc. while all you need is the strength to admit your dependence and the guts to fight it. Joe is almost cured but Kirsten still can't imagine living without alcohol. She still needs it not to be depressed by the world's ugliness.The fight is not over Kirsten not even for Joe not even for Jim not even for all of us who try to fight our inner demons and say Life is beautiful without the bitter taste of booze in our mouths ".

	schema:headline " A hardhitting film. Lemmon and Edwards are a surprise.";
	schema:reviewBody "For most if not all if his career before Days Of Wine And Roses Jack Lemmon was known for playing comical nervous nelly types And he's still most famous for that characterization.  But he proves in Days Of Wine And Roses how affecting and believable he could be in an unfailingly serious treatment of a sensitive subject how alcoholism can destroy your life and relationships.  The muchpraised almost delirious desperation he shows in the scene in the greenhouse and especially his expression in the haunting final shot are just two examples of the range he shows in this film. Likewise Blake Edwards best known up till that time for directing light comedies like Breakfast at Tiffany's and still best known for the wacky Pink Panther movies was a surprising choice to direct this movie but he handles it with taste and sensitivity and never makes the treatment heavyhanded.  I can't believe I said in a review of Darling Lilli Under my former IMDB screen name of Tommy92 that that was the most serious film he ever directed.  I hadn't seen this movie but knew of it then obviously this one is almost certainly the most serious film he ever handled and he does a great job.  Lee Remick is very good as Lemmon's wife and the fate of her character is heartwrenchingly ironic to watch.  Both she and Lemmon won richly deserved Oscar nominations but unfortunately seem to have gotten lost in the competition Which included Gregory Peck Laurence Harvey Peter O'Toole Anne Bancroft Katharine Hepburn and Bette Davis. In another year surely... Great performances also from Charles Bickford as Remick's father and Jack Klugman who handles potentially preachy dialogue with intelligence and restraint in his role as an Alchoholics Anonymous regular.  Maybe it could've gone even further than it did but had to be held back because of the restrictions of the time it was made in 1962 but it still is just as powerful if perhaps maybe a little less shocking as it was when it first came out.  Important not only in its subject matter but in showing the range of two of the most beloved but perhaps underrated people in movies.".

	onyx:emotionText "For most if not all if his career before Days Of Wine And Roses Jack Lemmon was known for playing comical nervous nelly types And he's still most famous for that characterization.  But he proves in Days Of Wine And Roses how affecting and believable he could be in an unfailingly serious treatment of a sensitive subject how alcoholism can destroy your life and relationships.  The muchpraised almost delirious desperation he shows in the scene in the greenhouse and especially his expression in the haunting final shot are just two examples of the range he shows in this film. Likewise Blake Edwards best known up till that time for directing light comedies like Breakfast at Tiffany's and still best known for the wacky Pink Panther movies was a surprising choice to direct this movie but he handles it with taste and sensitivity and never makes the treatment heavyhanded.  I can't believe I said in a review of Darling Lilli Under my former IMDB screen name of Tommy92 that that was the most serious film he ever directed.  I hadn't seen this movie but knew of it then obviously this one is almost certainly the most serious film he ever handled and he does a great job.  Lee Remick is very good as Lemmon's wife and the fate of her character is heartwrenchingly ironic to watch.  Both she and Lemmon won richly deserved Oscar nominations but unfortunately seem to have gotten lost in the competition Which included Gregory Peck Laurence Harvey Peter O'Toole Anne Bancroft Katharine Hepburn and Bette Davis.

This is unfortunate as this was not only America's longest but its bloodiest Indian war as well. Other films relating to this conflict include Seminole and Naked in the Sun. Due to the sparsity of Seminole War films I will admit a bias for this film despite its ridiculous plot bargain basement Hollywood surplus wardrobe The soldiers are in a mix of fanciful fringed pants and ca. 1898 SpanishAmerican War hats and shirts etc. and anachronistic armamentsthe soldiers are using M1873 Trapdoor carbines the Seminoles the full length M1873 rifleboth sides used flintlock weapons in 1840.  A large chunk of the plot surrounds Cuban gun runners supporting the Warriors.  In truth despite 7 years of naval blockade of the Florida Coast the US Navy never proved the fears of such a trade from Cuba...I could go on and on... True this is nothing more than a transplanted western in the Swamps of Florida although I detect a great deal of Director Walsh's previous Objective Burma in this flick compare the gator pit in the Seminole village with the similar scene in the Japanese held village in Objective Burma  The true star of this one is the scenery as almost alone amongst the few Seminole War films this one takes full advantage of the wildly beautiful Florida Wilderness.  Other comments note the great underwater battle scene but I am spellbound by the cypress swamp and sawgrass settings as well.  You won't learn much about the War from this movie but it does have some basis in fact.  By 1840 the army was relying on small patrols like Cooper's in the film to track down hostile Seminoles for removal to the west.  Thats about as close as it comes to the history books but it is still an exciting action film with an O.K. musical score.".

Then I saw it as an adult and though it was not the great film I remembered it was still very good as an action and adventure sort of western. Since I'm not from the USA I didn't notice some historical mistakes mainly the use of guns and rifles not yet invented by the time of the action I learned about after reading some reviews here I think those are major flaws in a movie.However I think my little knowledge about the Seminole wars in Florida give me the possibility of judging the film just at what it is an adventure film. That established Distant Drums appears to me as a highly entertaining and well done movie as well as a very original film mainly because of where the action is located. Is has great color beautiful photography and incredible open wide sceneries in the Everglades. The plot although kind of standard a bunch of soldiers chased by savage Indians through the swamps is however very well handled by director Roul Walsh and he keeps action going all along without major bumps. The sequence at the Seminole village is most impressive and tense as it is the final underwater knife duel between Captain Wyatt and chief Okala.Gary Cooper Wyatt is very good as the leader of the escaping troop and shows the presence and self confidence a leader should. The rest of the cast brings a good support too mainly Arthur Hunnicutt Coooper's sidekick and Ray Teal one of the troopers and Mari Aldon does a credible work as Cooper's romantic interest. Seminole chief Okala looks mean enough and a proper match for Cooper. Perhaps the less impressive performance is that of Richard Webb kind of dull as a navy officer involved in the mission.In all this a decent actionadventure film most entertaining and worth seeing for those who enjoy the genre.".

Looking at The Films of Gary Cooper book I noticed about three others with same credits in the Fifties of which Distant Drums was the first.The film was shot on actual location in the Everglades I think Gary Cooper must have gotten some taste of what Bogey and Hepburn were enduring doing The African Queen. Too bad the story didn't rate the same as The African Queen.Cooper is an American Army captain on duty with the army of General Zachary Taylor played by Robert Barrat who lives on his own island and doesn't dress in any army uniform. Zach Taylor had a reputation for informality but that was carrying it a bit too far. The only other guy who had his own private island during war was Lt. Commander Quentin McHale and his PT Boat crew.Anyway Barrat gives Cooper a mission and a Navy lieutenant played by Richard Webb to carry it out. To attack an old Spanish fort and go by boat across Lake Okechoobee. An early type of amphibious warfare. The attack goes off as planned and some civilian prisoners are rescued from the renegades using the fort. But the Seminoles are in hot pursuit of Cooper and the whole bunch through most of the film.I can't believe by the way that a director like Raoul Walsh had the army and the Seminoles fighting with repeating rifles and six shooter revolving pistols. Stuff wasn't invented yet.For the early years of the republic Florida under Spanish rule and loose rule at that was a thorn in our side. Pirates like the ones you see here used it as a haven for raiding purposes. But it was also a refuge for runaway slaves. Our southern states wanted Florida acquired to put an end to that. The indigenous tribes to Florida the Seminoles did offer refuge for runaway slaves. So a war there was inevitable especially when southern presidents like Andrew Jackson were in the White House.Maybe one day someone will do a proper film on the early history of Florida but this ain't it.".

	schema:reviewBody "When one thinks of westerns one typically thinks of things like wide open plains scrubland and the cavalry in a wooden fort... here we have swamps jungle and the Indians in a stone fort... this is a Florida Western! The story opens with US Navy Lieutenant Richard Tufts arriving in Florida with a small boat which he has taken overland to Lake Okeechobee. He travels separately and meets up with Capt. Quincy Wyatt who will lead the mission against an old Spanish fort on the opposite side of the lake which is being used by the Seminole Indians. One would have expected this mission to be the main part of the story but it is all over fairly quickly the real story is about how they and some rescued prisoners escape through the alligator infested Everglade swamps with the Seminole chasing after them. Not all of them will make it some will die at the hands of the Seminole others to the alligators! The Florida setting certainly gave this film a different feel to just about every other western I've seen usually the worst natural danger in a western is a rattlesnake but the alligators here were more frightening and there saw a surprising amount of blood shown when one of the men was killed by one. There was a decent amount of action including a knife fight that takes place underwater! The acting is okay but lead Gary Cooper is nowhere near as good as he was in 'High Noon' I guess this is down to the material he had to work with. Love interest Mari Alden looks pretty but her character isn't particularly interesting we learn that she isn't quite the Southern lady she makes out to be but that revelation hardly affects her character. I'm not sure whether this will appeal to fans of conventional westerns I think it is more likely to appeal to fans of adventure stories.".

	schema:reviewBody "This adventure is a good film that has reliable Gary Cooper for star power and he doesn't disappoint in a rousing cavalryIndian yarn that unfolds in the Everglades during the Seminole War. Cooper's men battle gun runners jungle rot dangerous reptiles and savage Indians as the military aims to quell the Seminole menace for good. Most of the film has the soldiers trying to stay one jump ahead of the pursuing Indians while being slowed by hostages including striking Mari Aldon who supplies the romance for Cooper later on. The action lags here and there but the clashes between the soldiers and the Indians pack a wallop especially the final siege and confrontation at Cooper's island refuge at the finish. The camera work is fine and Max Steiner again contributes a nice score. This film is perhaps Cooper's leastknown western adventure but it's a winning feature with a solid cast.".

	schema:reviewBody "Distant Drums is directed by Raoul Walsh and stars Gary Cooper Richard Webb Mari Aldon  Arthur Hunnicutt. Known as a Florida Western the film is set during the Seminole Wars in the 1840s. It's written by Niven Busch and Martin Rackin photographed predominantly on location in the Florida Everglades in Technicolor by Sidney Hickox and Max Steiner scores the music. Plot sees Cooper playing an Army captain who after destroying a fort held by the Seminole Indians retreats with his party into the Everglades where many of natures dangers lurk as the Seminole pursue them.Not one for fans of Cooper Walsh or Busch to get excited about. The story is as conventional as it gets complete with a romantic angle and the dialogue is boorish and lacking imagination. Were it not for the excellently constructed action sequences check out the under water scenes and the lush location photography then this one would be consigned to the please steer away from pile. Busch is the main culprit since his writing is confused as to what it wants to achieve. The Seminole Indians are painted as savages thus giving a one sided feel to a War not often seen in movies yet other Native Americans are handled more sympathetically via the portrayal from Cooper. All in all we learn nothing about the War and the people involved as the film winds up as a jungle like adventure built around a number of set pieces.Cooper is rugged and watchable as an Alligator Dundee type and Hunnicutt as always leaves a favourable impression as the scout. Mari Aldon is pretty but pretty one dimensional while Richard Webb just seems out of place in the perilous locale and therefore unconvincing. But as previously mentioned nobody here is helped by the tepid script. It's believed that this movie features the earliest known use of the Wilhelm Scream sound effect a technique used to vocalise a character being torn to shreds by an alligator. A standard film it is then one that really should have been a fine entry into a sadly untapped in to topic. It's like getting a beautifully wrapped birthday present that when opened reveals nothing but strips of mouldy old newspaper. 510".

It's notable how larger than life Cooper appears to be even on television screen. His characterization which is a combination of a western hero and Tarzan doesn't offer very much range in acting but makes it interesting enough for this kind of adventure flick. Mari Aldon gets dragged through all the dangerous and beautiful scenery without having her makeup smeared and sometimes completely steals my attention from what is going on around her. Her role doesn't have much else to offer either. But I guess by what I just said her role work serves its purpose the way it was intended.Almost everything you expect from a jungle adventure set in Florida is here including alligators snakes and wild cardboard Indians. A great plus are the beautifully shot underwater scenes short but crystal clear crowned by a final duel under surface. This isn't one of the best movies from the director Raoul Walsh but as a classic adventure and action for a more emptyheaded moment it works truly well.".

So when I see folks who are supposed to be fighting the Seminole Indians during the Second Seminole War the one Zachary Taylor participated in I hated seeing folks using revolvers and Springfield rifles that used cartridges as these weapons came along during the Civil War era...about 25 years later. And the uniforms on the men were a motley collection of typesand the most prevalent was a Rough Riders type from about 1898! This was all very sloppy...and the folks making the film simply didn't care. When I add to that the story is only kinda interesting then I am left with a movie that clearly falls into the 'timepasser' category...one that is modestly watchable and entertaining but absolutely nothing more...even WITH Gary Cooper in the lead! Watch it if you must...and at least the nice Florida locations are nice to see.".

Monk hoots for Quincy and says that'll bring him out whereas cutaway scene shows Cooper already emerging from bush 5. Next scene shows Cooper coming out like he's just heard the guide. 6. The eagles are great but instead of the two mentioned the last shot shows a third one coming down for his treat. 7. Cooper and party leave for Taylor's HQ which is northeast of where they left the horses. They arrive at HQ on horses. Where's they get them since they left the original three tied up miles south of there? 8. Monk the old trapper wears a totally incongruous buckskin outfit. Can you imagine that and a coonskin hat in Florida's heat? 9. The uniforms are OK if a little to western. Taylor and the other officers are correctly dressed for the period. Later the brigade soldiers at the end are totally dressed correctly for the period. 10. Rifled muskets are not correct for the period. This is 1840 as stated but the US Army did not start using percussion cap rifled muskets until 1842 and even these then were conversions of existing flintlocks not the nice postCivil war carbines shown which by the way were issued to cavalry not infantry. 11. The revolvers Cooper and everyone else uses are 1870s era Colts with brass cartridges not the earlier era ones with paper cartridges and caps. At least they could have used 1844 model Colts. 12. At the arsenal in the fort they discover European muskets. Well golleee! These are Spanish men! 13. The Seminoles look great even though they did not look like that in 1840. The headdress and paint are correct. 14. Did you ever notice how the Seminoles are always running after the expedition which is walking but never seem to quite catch up? 15. The Spanish plantation owner seems to disappear about halfway through the movie. 16. The swamp grass fire is a little weak. The Seminoles could have easily jumped through the gaps shown. 17. In the gators scene you can see the rope pulling the fake alligator along! 18. After falling into and coming out of walking through the swamp Marie Alden's dress and cloths are not wet at all!In spite of all this it is a great story and wellacted by everyone. The drill the soldiers do is very well done unlike most Hollywood epics.".

	schema:headline " Cooper leads a successful expedition through swamps and everglades";
	schema:reviewBody "Rather cheesy fiction about a combined navyarmy operation in the 1840s 2nd Seminole War. While most missions were to kill or capture Seminoles for resettlement in Oklahoma this expedition's primary target was an old Spanish fort which gunrunners stored their the munitions and other supplies to barter with the Seminolesin exchange for what?. To get there the troopers used a combination of horses canoes and bushwhacking to get from the east coast of Florida to Lake Okeechobee and beyond all the while being exposed to the possibility of attack by Seminoles.The expedition is led by Captain WyattGary Cooper a rather reclusive army officer who lives on a small island in a small lake. Most troopers have to be picked up at the regional headquarters commanded by Zachary Taylor. Wyatt's favorite companion is a backwoodsman called MonkArthur Hunnicut who's always seen with a coonskin cap no matter how hot and humid it is. About midway in the film they reach the fort and manage to surprise the inhabitants killing all. They also discover several hostages in a cell. Of course one is a beautiful sexy unattached young woman who naturally soon takes a shine to Cooper. Now to get back home they have to take a different route because Seminoles are swarming on the route the took to get there. They face very difficult slogging and eventual starvation not to mention occasional Seminoles.The basic plot much reminds me of that of Northwest Passage of a decade before. A group of rangers tramp though a long stretch of difficult wilderness for one objective which is accomplished then have a more difficult time on the return trip including starvation. It's estimated that 80 of the trooper casualties were due to diseases and other nonIndian hazards. For example malaria and yellow fever were real hazards not usually present in New England. Starvation was another hazard which this expedition encountered on the return trip.Mari Aldon plays Judy the gorgeous rescued captive. It's too bad this seems to have been her only significant film role. She had been a ballerina.Another film dealing with the 2nd Seminole War called Seminole was released just 2 years later. It was also shot in color and largely in the Everglades. Although it too has an excess of historical fabrication at least it has some historical basis whereas the present film does not. However the Indians look more authentic in the present film.".

It's the story of American soldiers who attack a fort in the everglades during the Seminole Wars in the 1800's. They are then chased by Indians through swamps for the rest of the movie. The movie delivers every possible action scenario that you could imagine in a setting like that. It's very similar to the first half of the classic film Davy Crockett. Remember when Davy Crockett fights the Indians in the swamp? Well that's what goes down this entire movie. You don't watch a movie like this for its plot. Yes it's old. But it's Gary Cooper at his best. There is plenty of battles including a cool underwater fight scene at the end. What do I mean by that? Well you'll have to watch it and find out. 4 out of 5 action rating".

The laughable introduction of glamor girl Mari Aldon into the plot the stiff acting by some of the support players Webb who also narrates Barratt negate the realism of actual location filming.At best an adequate adventure for Cooper fans.

All some serious heavy dramatic stuff but yet the boys manages to make this movie a perfectly entertaining one with some good slapstick humor and comical situations.The movie at times is a sappy one that goes definitely overthetop but yet for most part the story and its drama works effective. Stan and Ollie taking care of the young daughter of Eddie and their quest for her grandparents is quite heartwarming. Especially since the boys in this movie have an amazingly good chemistry Jackie Lyn Dufton who plays the young girl. Especially Stan Laurel has a good chemistry with her. Dufton refers to Stan and Ollie as her uncle's in this movie and that special feeling is brought amazingly effective and believable to the screen.Yet the movie is also one of their most fun ones despite the dramatic undertone. The slapstick humor is especially topclass and the boys manage once more to get themselves into some silly and hilarious situations.The movie its supporting cast is also good. The movie features lots of different actors in a variety of roles. Of course this movie also has the regular Laurel  Hardy actors in it such as James Finlayson Charlie Hall and Paulette Goddard. But it's the supporting cast as a whole that delivers a good and impressive performance.A delightful and well made comedy that also works effective with its more dramatic moments.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

But most of Pack Up Your Troubles is spent with the boys as veterans looking for the family of their late comrade Don Dillaway on behalf of his daughter little Jackie Lyn Dufton. Best scene in the film is when Stan and Ollie are sent out on what their exasperated sergeant thinks and hopes will be a suicide mission. They're told to get a prisoner. Remember this is 1932 and the story of Sergeant York even without the movie being made was known to one and all. How do Stan and Ollie pull off a Sergeant York? Well it involves a prototype tank the enemy trenches and some barbed wire. You have to see it being done.Laurel's scenes especially with the child have a nice ring of pathos to them. Most of the time he's simply an idiot here he's a lovable idiot. Next best scene in the movie is the little girl reading Stan a bedtime story Goldilocks and the 3 Bears and Laurel falling asleep.Pack Up Your Troubles has an unusually good cast of recognizable character players in roles that we all identify them with. Of course James Finlayson is there as their commanding general. But also there's Charles Middleton as a welfare inspector Billy Gilbert whose daughter blows up a marriage to Grady Sutton when the boys think he's Dillaway's father and Mary Gordon as a delightful old Irish mother babysitting the little girl for Stan and Ollie. Third best scene is the police closing in on them and them trying to escape in a dumb waiter. Only their third sound feature length film and a winner for Laurel And Hardy.".

	schema:headline " Pack Up Your Troubles is quite a funny Laurel  Hardy movie with some sentiment thrown in concerning a little girl";
	schema:reviewBody "It was back in 1991 when I was shopping at Target in Jacksonville FL that I stumbled onto this VHS tape from Video Treasures. It was a Laurel  Hardy movie I hadn't heard of before and while I think I checked out Randy Skretvedt's book Laurel and Hardy The Magic Behind the Movies from the library there beforehand I don't remember reading about the review of this particular movie at the time though I'm sure I read about it after seeing this when I checked the book out again afterward. Anyway when the little girlJacquie Lynwas doing the story of The Three Bears with sleepy Stan's reactions in closeup I remember a relative I was living with laughing heartily at that and while it was funny to me as well I don't remember laughing as loudly. I just watched it again this morning and I found myself laughing not only at that but most of the rest of the picture as Stan  Ollie join the army during World War I make friends with a guy named Eddie Smith and then try to find Eddie's parents after he dies in battle with his daughter I mentioned in tow. Hilarious supporting turns from usual L  H players like James Finlayson and Billy Gilbert as well as Grady Sutton and George Marshall who codirected with Ray McCarey. In Skretvedt's review he mentions a sequence cut from all reissued prints because of its tooviolentforcomedy status Temporary guardian Rychard Cramer abuses his wife and Jacquie then when L  H find outhe sends his goons after them but the boys manage to subdue them with boiling water! He also said a print survives dubbed in French. I'm not in a real hurry to see that one. So on that note I highly recommend Pack Up Your Troubles. P.S. On this videotape I mentioned earlier in the review Stan's daughter Lois put some home movies before the feature showing her on her fourth birthday and fifth birthday parties and then showed her playing with Jacquie either in a sandbox or riding in a toy plane cute seeing them kiss a couple of times there a gift from her Uncle Babe Hardy. She mentioned she hadn't seen her in a while and was looking for her. Well a year later Leonard Maltin  Richard W. Bann updated their book The Little Rascals The Life and Times of Our Gang and revealed in the C section of the Appendixes called The Rest Their Glories and Their Ruin that Jacquie Lyn was givenby her sona copy of this videotape for Christmas saw those movies of her and Lois and contacted her through The Sons of the Desert organization where she found out they only lived a couple of miles away! After Ms. Lyn left pictures after making a couple of Our Gang shortsFree Wheeling and Birthday Bluesher family remained in Los Angeles where she eventually married a banker. I'll explain why she left when reviewing Birthday Blues. Update122614 I've now seen the deleted sequence which was colorized on YouTube. It's not as violent as I was afraid since we don't see Cramer hitting Jacquie. Also that boiling water is from some pots that Stan uses to pour on the bad guys which is quite funny!".

	onyx:emotionText "It was back in 1991 when I was shopping at Target in Jacksonville FL that I stumbled onto this VHS tape from Video Treasures. It was a Laurel  Hardy movie I hadn't heard of before and while I think I checked out Randy Skretvedt's book Laurel and Hardy The Magic Behind the Movies from the library there beforehand I don't remember reading about the review of this particular movie at the time though I'm sure I read about it after seeing this when I checked the book out again afterward. Anyway when the little girlJacquie Lynwas doing the story of The Three Bears with sleepy Stan's reactions in closeup I remember a relative I was living with laughing heartily at that and while it was funny to me as well I don't remember laughing as loudly. I just watched it again this morning and I found myself laughing not only at that but most of the rest of the picture as Stan  Ollie join the army during World War I make friends with a guy named Eddie Smith and then try to find Eddie's parents after he dies in battle with his daughter I mentioned in tow. Hilarious supporting turns from usual L  H players like James Finlayson and Billy Gilbert as well as Grady Sutton and George Marshall who codirected with Ray McCarey. In Skretvedt's review he mentions a sequence cut from all reissued prints because of its tooviolentforcomedy status Temporary guardian Rychard Cramer abuses his wife and Jacquie then when L  H find outhe sends his goons after them but the boys manage to subdue them with boiling water! He also said a print survives dubbed in French. I'm not in a real hurry to see that one. So on that note I highly recommend Pack Up Your Troubles. P.S.

	schema:reviewBody "Pack Up Your Troubles is a much funnier and better made film for Laurel and Hardy. The plot is more solid with a tighter narrative and the comedy has been blended in well. The opening of the film is 1917  the year America entered the First World War. Stan and Ollie are drafted into the army where they befriend a fellow private. Sadly this other soldier is killed in action and Stan and Ollie take it upon themselves to look after the deceased's little daughter. With the war ended they need to avoid the dreaded orphanage as the child's mother shows no interest. Stan and Ollie try to locate the child's grandparents and this is what dominates the majority of Pack Up Your Troubles. The team are on top form and they have great material to work with. Besides the comedy there are moments of drama. Laurel and Hardy handle the more serious material very well. The scene where they realise their soldier friend has died is greeted with no humour or slapstick of any kind. James Finlayson has a brilliant cameo as the army officer whose army quarters are accidentally smelling of litter. Watch his expression as he blows his whistle! Another regular supporting comedian Billy Gilbert makes an appearance as a rather irate future fatherinlaw at a wedding. I enjoyed the way the film ended it was quite moving.".

L and H's rounding up of what looks like half the German front line entirely unintentionally I might add Ollie's onetwo pummelling by Steamboat Smith Stan falling asleep when the little girl tells him a story etc. Think I loved the wedding scene the best though with the boys managing to get their wires crossed yet again. Billy Gilbert has a nice cameo scene here as does Jimmy Fin as an army general whose home gets a bit whiffy thanks to Stan and Ollie! Good fun shows the team were beginning to work out how to make a feature length movie work for them after all those classic shorts.".

It's crazy but it is what it is. LH was shown mostly as shorts in syndication and a few of their feature films but only the ones that were their most juvenile ones even as far as the shorts go. So where do I start? I just laughed at this one from start to finish. Stan looks very stoned or as I'm sure the times dictated dim witted but in modern times he looks drunk or wasted. That in itself is funny. Then I am watching this as a Vet personally and it's hilarious for the recruitment Shanghai'd to the boot camp to the actual war. along the way there is a really really heavy drama trip put on us by a woman that would abandon a cute 3 year old blond girl very sad if you are into the film it may make you cry a little like I did and of course I cried later.Anyway this is Laurel and Hardy in their still young days connecting still as the common people and not as total child buffoons. I like how Ollie stands up to the government to protect the child and she is totally adorable almost as much as Shirley Temple. Watching this has so many scenes in it that are memorable it''s like watching a 2 12 hour film instead of just 1 hour and it's all good. If you never watched this before you should watch it and avoid spoilers because as much as it may fall into line you will be surprised by this one. 10 of 10. God bless Laurel and Hardy and 1930's America.".

Didn't find 'Pack Up Your Troubles' quite one of their very best but it to me still very good and some of the best material is among their funniest.Admittedly the story is pretty thin and is pretty standard and the beginning is a touch slow.Despite that 'Pack Up Your Troubles' is great fun while also having a definite degree of substance never less than very amusing and the best moments such as the ending being classic hilarity. It is never too silly there is a wackiness that never loses its energy and the sly wit is here some of the material may not be new but how it's executed actually doesn't feel too familiar and it doesn't get repetitive. Yet there is also a surprising amount of pathos that is actually genuinely moving and not oversentimental. A lot happens yet it doesn't ever feel rushed or overstuffed.

Following the typical fine messes into which they get themselves one of their compatriots asks them to do him a favor should he die. This leads into what must have been one of the more serious plots that their movies ever had.While the movie is comedy through and through it was a surprise to see Stan and Ollie display a more human side in this movie. I liked seeing them show that wacky though they were their characters had the courage to do the right thing when all hope seemed lost.Of course one could ignore that and simply revel in the antics. And boy are there some funny ones! I hope that people keep watching Laurel and Hardy forever.".

This leads into what must have been one of the more serious plots that their movies ever had.While the movie is comedy through and through it was a surprise to see Stan and Ollie display a more human side in this movie. I liked seeing them show that wacky though they were their characters had the courage to do the right thing when all hope seemed lost.Of course one could ignore that and simply revel in the antics. And boy are there some funny ones! I hope that people keep watching Laurel and Hardy forever.";

	schema:reviewBody "PACK UP YOUR TROUBLES Hal RoachMetroGoldwynMayer 1932 directed by George Marshall and Raymond McCarey marks the second starring feature film from comedy team Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy and one of their finest efforts. Though categorized as a war comedy the film in itself divided into two parts starts off with war related themed material while the second half concentrates more on the team's attempt in locating a little girl's grandparents while civilians after the Armitice.Opening title April 1917  when the scratch of a pen on Capitol Hill caused crowns to rattle. After a brief montage of newspapers going to press with large headlines reading WAR DECLARED Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are seen seated on a park bench reading the latest news. While Ollie declares that flat feet is all that's keeping him from enlisting the two are soon approached by a tough recruiting sergeant Tom Kennedy. Even while their attempts pretending to be unfit for active duty Stan foils up their disqualification finding them in the next scene at the U.S. Army Training Camp. It didn't take Uncle Sam long to whip this raw material into real fighting machine. Causing their shorttempered drill sergeant Frank Brownlee to go out of his mind over their bumbling antics Stan and Ollie create more trouble while on K.P. duty taking foul odor garbage to the general's James Finlayson residence ending up in the brig with a tough cook named Pierre George Marshall after naming him the one who told them to place the trash into the general's home in a sarcastic manner. Eddie Smith Donald Dillaway the boys' best pal receives a letter written by his wife telling him she has left him for another man resulting on Eddie to leave his little daughter Jacquie Lyn in the home of a bickering couple Rychard Cramer and Adele Watson for the time being. Eddie is killed in battle while Stan and Ollie unwittingly becoming war heroes. With the war ending November 11 1918 civilians Stan and Ollie locate Eddie's daughter take her away from the unhappy environment. They make every effort finding her grandparents with the only clue that their last name is Smith thus having them going through every Smith name in the New York City directory. More problems arise as they try getting a 12000 loan from the bank on their lunch wagon and face losing Eddie's child to a mean officer of the Welfare Association Charles Middleton with efforts on taking her to an orphanage.While the final print is somewhat handicapped by some rough cuts resulting to flimsy material it's a wonder whether the original concept of the movie was initially longer longer than the theatrical 68 minute time frame probably explaining after repeated viewing why certain characters especially those part of the Laurel and Hardy stock company of James Finlayson Billy Gilbert or Charlie Hall have only brief bits. There is no plot development nor how Laurel and Hardy got to become such good friends with Eddie Smith. One would assume there's an edited account of first their meeting resulting to their friendship during their Army training segment. His dying in battle leads to the purpose of the story with Stan and Ollie doing a good turn by taking the responsibility for his little girl while spending months trying to locate her grandparents. The tight editing obviously keeps in the necessary scenes for plot development purposes while leaving more room for comedy material. Memorable scenes include Jacquie reciting a bedtime story to Uncle Stanley struggling to keep awake Stan and Ollie's individual attempts locating the many Smiths in the telephone directory arriving at 311 Chester Drive where Stan and Ollie disturb a wedding ceremony addressing the child to be Eddie's baby Eddie being the hapless groom Grady Sutton Stan going to Poughkeepsie to acquire if the Smith Brothers of cough drop fame to be the relatives among others. Fine casting goes to Mary Carr as the baby's nanny Mary Gordon as Mrs. McTavish the baby sitter during the second half of the story and Charles Middleton going with honorable remention as the one with a face mean and scary enough to haunt a house. Jacquie Lynn who sometimes speaks like future child star Shirley Temple gets in her finest moments mimicking Stan and Ollie both in mannerisms and famous line quotes adding much to the fun during their troubles.While the title PACK UP YOUR TROUBLES was used again for a Ritz Brothers comedy for 20th CenturyFox 1939 this is where the similarity ends. Home video prints to the original Laurel and Hardy edition black and white or colorized often eliminate material involving unpleasantness between the bickering couple looking after little Jacquie. Restored prints have turned up on numerous cable channel networks over the years from American Movie Classics 199697 to Turner Classic Movies TCM premiere April 1 2003. Adding a touch of World War nostalgia with background music from that era including the title song Where Do We Go From Here? and so forth PACK UP YOUR TROUBLES is one of those films that seems to get better and funnier after repeated viewings especially for devotees of this most famous of comedy teams of all time Laurel and Hardy.

Being this is a Laurel and Hardy film you can expect plenty of laughs even though the movie is somewhat uneven and really plays like three short subjects put together to make a feature. There are laughs throughout the film but none of them are overly hysterical and in the end the film is somewhat weak but the good performance from the boys and the nice supporting cast makes it worth watching. I think the start of the film is the weakest when the boys are going through basic training as we get the same type of gags that we're use to and that includes them not being able to march and having a prank pulled on them which gets them into trouble with the General James Finlayson. The second half of the film contains the most laughs as Laurel and Hardy must try and find a Smith out of thousands in the phone book. In the most memorable scene the boys interrupt a wedding with the father of the bride played by Billy Gilbert going crazy thinking that his future soninlaw has a kid. Some of the comedy doesn't work and that includes a rather long scene where the little girl starts telling Laurel the story of The Three Bears which he falls asleep on.".

	schema:reviewBody "REVIEW OF THE MGM REGION 1 DVDWith the huge success of The Dirty Dozen a popular theme began to appear in war movies instead of focusing on good cleancut heroes the main characters became misfits thrown into situations which made them heroes whether they wanted to be or not. The story of the Devil's Brigade is a true one about misfits turned into wartime heroes.William Holden plays Lt. Col. Frederick who derives a plan for combining Canadian and American troops into an assault force which will attack the Germans in Norway. Holden is forced to deal with two contingents of troops a proud professional Canadian unit under the command of career soldier Major Crown Cliff Robertson and an American unit comprised of misfits and criminals led by crass Major Bricker Vince Edwards. The men instinctively hate each other and spend their months of training bickering with one another until a huge bar fight forces them join forces against unappreciative lumberjacks. From there the men are no longer fighting each other they are deployed to Italy rather than Norway where they must capture a strategic hilltop from which Nazi artillery pounds the Allied advance.Veteran director McLaglen who seems to always be able to throw together a satisfying film but never really made a classic falls short once again  this time he's trying to make a docudrama but constantly falls back on established stereotypes and familiar situations rather than fresh new material almost as if he's afraid to try something new. That aside this is one very entertaining movie and its' success rests largely on the capability of a huge cast of character actors.Of the three leads Robertson is most convincing. He manages to make Crown an admirable hero with guts and determination. He cares about his men but pushes them to their limits because he knows that when they face the Wehrmacht they will be better off for it. He is calm and collected under pressure whether it is pressure from superior officers attitudes of the men under his command or in the tense heat of battle. Likewise Edwards breathes vibrant life into Bricker. Bricker is a witty officer with a short temper towards misbehavior in his unit and little respect for the dregs he commands. We know he's unhappy with his assignment from the moment we meet him only gradually does his attitude change. Holden is actually the least believable of the three leads. He never seems to be acting with much passion or concern for his character and never comes across as a real living human being. His role as commander is strictly onedimensional and this is probably the lowestgrade role I've seen him in to date. This is where flaws in the script begin to take their toll because most viewers have seen Holden act so much better but that's because he's had much better material to work with.The supporting cast is filled with familiar faces several of which deserve mention because they are so good. One standout is Claude Akins as Rocky Rockman easily the most rebellious of the Americans. He's physically rough profane and won't hesitate to pick a fight with anyone anywhere. But during the aforementioned bar fight he finds himself allied with Peacock Jack Watson a Canadian he holds in highest contempt. Peacock is a staunch stiff NCO who makes discipline and respect his 1 priorities and naturally he and Rockman don't get along until they have to fight alongside each other to gain respect from some angry lumberjacks and realize that maybe they can get along as comrades in arms and maybe even friends. The course of this relationship builds realistically throughout the course of the entire film making one scene during the final battle incredibly moving.McLaglen makes the final major encounters with the Germans the highlights of the film. The first major encounter involves the brigade's probe of a German village in which they manage to capture an entire German battalion without taking a single casualty. This scene is funny and wellexecuted but never comes across as a very convincing  it's simply meant to be a humorous excursion and proves that the men of the Devil's Brigade can operate better than any other American Army unit. The onlocation filming looks great in this sequence though  it was shot in a real village not on a set and the exteriors look fresh in every shot. McLaglen uses a lot of pans and zoomouts to show the progress of his characters too making for some nicely composed sequences.The final mountaintop battle is brilliantly executed from start to finish. Beginning with a perilous sequence of the brigade rappelling up steep cliffs the sequence builds to a bloody handtohand encounter with German infantry. Most of the battle is shot from the grunts' perspective and the camera occasionally rises above the action to show us what progress the men have made  but essentially this isn't an epic battle with a bunch of extras battling it out. McLaglen is interested in telling a human drama from the start and doesn't abandon his characters in favor of scope. Instead he tells the story of the fight as the men see it and does a very good job. When compared to films of today the final battle isn't very graphic but does feature plenty of blood spurts and there is some use of a handheld camera making this a bit more realistic than some other war films of the time period.The Devil's Brigade is a touching human drama but easily fades into the sea of familiar unit pictures. There is nothing to really set this apart from that sea but director McLaglen and the actors work well together making the story riveting and enjoyable. There are ample doses of humor and satisfying amounts of humor action and character drama to make this a recommendable war film.".

	schema:reviewBody "When The Devil's Brigade first came out it got panned by a lot of critics in that it was too similar to The Dirty Dozen. Never mind that it was based on some real figures the consensus was that The Devil's Brigade was a poor imitation of The Dirty Dozen. Personally I think it was a better film.I'm sure that the characters and incidents were given a lot of poetic license but that was to make it entertaining. And entertaining it is. But it's also inspiring especially in the last battle sequence taking that hill by going up the hard way.When Bill Holden was cast as real life Lieutenant Colonel Robert Frederick Mrs. Frederick was interviewed and said while she admired Mr. Holden's talent she thought her husband was more the Gregory Peck type. Nevertheless Holden does a fine job as a man who shoots down Lord Louis Mountbatten's idea of a combined AmericanCanadian special force and then gets command of it. He's also a staff officer who had not seen combat and he was trying to prove something to himself.As good as Holden is the best performance in this film has to be that of Cliff Robertson as Canadian Major Alan Crown. Robertson's an Ulster Irishman in the film and his acting and accent are impeccable. He's got something to prove as well he and many of his Canadians left Europe at Dunkirk. Robertson himself was off his Oscar winning performance in Charly and The Devil's Brigade was a good follow up for him.The Canadians selected for this unit are the pick of the lot while the Americans emptied their stockades of all the refuse. Holden encourages competition among them and a really terrific sequence involving a bar brawl with some obnoxious lumberjacks welds a camaraderie among former feudees.Standing out in the cast are Claude Akins as a particularly rambunctious American recruit and Jack Watson as the Canadian sergeant. They bond particularly close some might even infer some homosexuality here but Watson's death scene and Akins's reactions are particularly poignant.The Devil's Brigade also came out during the Vietnam War and war films were not well received at that time at least until Patton came out. Seen now though The Devil's Brigade is a fine tribute to the Canadians and Americans who made up the First Special Service Force.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Devil's Brigade was indeed made up of Canadian elite and American castoffs at the formation of the first US Special Forces unit and this movie gives us the beginning of their amazing story. Most people are probably unaware that the Canadian army had such an influence on the initial training of this unit.A lot of Americans probably won't like how their countrymen are portrayed at the outset compared to the Canadian handpicked besttrained men in the besttrained army in the world in the word's of the unit's American commander portrayed by Holden. But they should be proud of what they were raised up to become and how they acquitted themselves in battle. It's particularly nice to see the Canadian army portrayed with the respect it richly deserves.There's many amusing scenes in the movie including my favorite the messhall scene with the Canadian handtohand combat instructor from the PPCLI and the oafish American soldier who had been denigrating the Canadians up to that point.A great WWII movie worth watching whenever it's on. The Canadian History channel follows showings with an interview with one of the founding members of this unit who vouches for the general portrayal of events though he said he doesn't recall them marching into the Montana training camp on their arrival as portrayed in the movie. The takeover of the German unit in the town was somewhat fictionalized too and is a composite of several events but that's the movies for you.".

It had some 700 Canadians and 1700 Americans of all ranks distributed throughout three regiments. It was a tough outfit trained to drop by parachute and fight in mountains or on skis.The force had its first taste of mountain fighting in Italy in December 1943 when it helped take a group of Germanheld hills barring the Allied advance on Rome. Two Battalions scaled the sheer face of a 3000 foot peak and drove the enemy form their caves and pillboxes around the summit. Within four days all the neighboring ridges were also cleared. The Force had done superbly in its first action but it had suffered 400 casualties. Canadian losses totaled 27 killed and 64 wounded.Later the same month the Force was sent to fight alongside U.S. troops on the approaches to Cassino. And in February 1944 the unit was committed to the Anzio beachhead which the Allies had established in an attempt to outflank German forces south of Rome.Churchill called the Force's Leader. U.S. Maj. Gen. Robert Frederick the greatest fighting general of all time. The Force itself won the nickname The Devil's Brigade a term apparently inspired by the blackened faces members wore on patrols and in battle. A German officer's diary recorded The black devils are around us every time we come into the line and we never hear them come.The Force ended its fighting days in August 1944 in the largely unopposed invasion of southern France and was disbanded later that year. The Americans were formed into an infantry regiment the Canadians went back to their own army some of them to the 1st Parachute Batallion.".

For the first time ever in an American movie the Canadians had a part in the plot. Finally some inclusion by our neighbour to the south in movies about the extreme efforts of Canadians during world war. The Canadians played just as big a part in the winning of the war as the Americans did the only difference was that Americans had supreme man power. But there is no problem here as the Allies worked together to achieve the ultimate goal of victory.This Devil's Brigade was very much a true outfit. Originally they were used in the Aleutians to defend North America from Japanese invasion 1942 which in fact was never going to actually happen. This 1800 men force a brigade of Canadians and Americans were very well trained and provided a very strong force that got the job done. Not only was a mission to land on the island of Kiska in the Aleutians done to rid the island of Japanese the Japanese were already gone but they went on special missions to destroy hydroelectric stations in Norway and northern Italy to destroy oil fields in Romania and as well as different missions in Italy such as the making and breakout of the Anzio beachhead to the south of Rome.So anyways my point is first of all that this brigade did exist and were a strong military force and second of all that it is nice to see Canadians in an American war movie especially in 1968. Great movie great history.".

While the movie is pretty standard up to this point they make an effort to convey here the difficulty of the assignment. This segment is handled pretty well and is worth the viewing.Overall if you're a war film buff you'd probably enjoy this film.

	schema:headline " War Is Hell This Is Entertainment";
	schema:reviewBody "By 1968 the public was becoming less enchanted with World War II movies as news footage from Vietnam spilled into their living rooms and films like this one paid a price. Reading a contemporaneous review in the New York Times it's hard not to feel the sneering contempt at Andrew V. McLaglen's engaging if light take on a group of American and Canadian commandos. But which has dated more the film or its critics?It's hard to judge The Devil's Brigade fairly when you grew up watching it as I did on television courtesy of Channel 7's 430 Movie in New York City. If you watch a war movie that thrills you as a kid you try your best to overlook its flaws as an adult. Fortunately The Devil's Brigade is still a good film when you realize it is meant to be a piece of entertainment and not a true depiction of war a la Saving Pvt. Ryan.Yes there are weaknesses including the Wehrmacht's employment of Patton tanks and blind and deaf sentries. The only Canadian that sounds like Richard Dawson does here is Michael Myers when he's playing Shrek. As the unit commander Lt. Col. Frederick William Holden seems disengaged from the rest of the film dyspeptic and hung over which he may well have been. Maybe his mind was on that new Peckinpaugh script in his trailerBut what you get here is better than you might expect delivered by McLaglen with a nearexpert blend of mounting tension and comic finesse. We are introduced to a lot of individual soldiers in The Devil's Brigade Canadians and Americans and the film gives ample space to their interesting and divergent story arcs.Good performances abound. Cliff Robertson as Major Crown is the straight arrow Canadian commander who escaped Dunkirk and longs for a second crack at the Germans. If anyone but McLaglen was directing Crown would be a thankless role but McLaglen was in tune with the straight and narrow and gives Robertson the room and tone to play the part well which Robertson does.Other Canadian characters shine too like the gruff but lovable Cpl. Peacock Jack Watson and Jeremy Slate as a selfdefense instructor whose impromptu demonstration at the expense of Claude Akins is a comic highlight. On the American side Akins does a nice job keeping a degree of audience sympathy even as he belittles the Canucks as he calls them setting himself up for Slate's humility lesson while Andrew Prine pulls you in as a troubled and sensitive soldier who wants the chance to prove himself but finds the business of killing hard.The first hour of the film is the best part as the brigade is trained to Frederick's exacting standards while its American and Canadian components learn to deal with each other. It all comes together in a raucous bar fight which is a McLaglen specialty and the film's highlight a rousing celebration of CanadianAmerican togetherness at the expense of a few bigmouthed lumberjacks who pick the wrong time to kid Dawson about his kilt.I know nobody invited the Canadians Akins sneers. But what burns me up is just who the hell invited you?Alas when we get to the war itself we are initially treated to a silly combat sequence involving the capture of an Italian village by a patrol. It all comes too easy and McLaglen's attempt to marry the comedy of the first half with some gritty battle reality is miscalculated. Are we supposed to believe an elite battalion of Germans can be captured by a dozen Devils without anyone firing a shot?There are lots of shots fired at the film's concluding battle at once rousing and heartwrenching especially as McLaglen and scripter William Roberts make use of all the characters we had invested ourselves in by putting them in harm's way and not letting them all out. After the bar fight it is the film's best section especially with William H. Clothier's sterling cinematography making ample use of a bluemountain vista.Maybe I am too prejudiced in favor of movies that thrilled me when I was young. Maybe The Devil's Brigade isn't as good as Lawrence Of Arabia. But it's a solid adventure film that makes me happy I had the good luck to see it when I was a little more naive.".

But which has dated more the film or its critics?It's hard to judge The Devil's Brigade fairly when you grew up watching it as I did on television courtesy of Channel 7's 430 Movie in New York City. If you watch a war movie that thrills you as a kid you try your best to overlook its flaws as an adult. Fortunately The Devil's Brigade is still a good film when you realize it is meant to be a piece of entertainment and not a true depiction of war a la Saving Pvt. Ryan.Yes there are weaknesses including the Wehrmacht's employment of Patton tanks and blind and deaf sentries. The only Canadian that sounds like Richard Dawson does here is Michael Myers when he's playing Shrek. As the unit commander Lt. Col. Frederick William Holden seems disengaged from the rest of the film dyspeptic and hung over which he may well have been. Maybe his mind was on that new Peckinpaugh script in his trailerBut what you get here is better than you might expect delivered by McLaglen with a nearexpert blend of mounting tension and comic finesse. We are introduced to a lot of individual soldiers in The Devil's Brigade Canadians and Americans and the film gives ample space to their interesting and divergent story arcs.Good performances abound. Cliff Robertson as Major Crown is the straight arrow Canadian commander who escaped Dunkirk and longs for a second crack at the Germans. If anyone but McLaglen was directing Crown would be a thankless role but McLaglen was in tune with the straight and narrow and gives Robertson the room and tone to play the part well which Robertson does.Other Canadian characters shine too like the gruff but lovable Cpl. Peacock Jack Watson and Jeremy Slate as a selfdefense instructor whose impromptu demonstration at the expense of Claude Akins is a comic highlight. On the American side Akins does a nice job keeping a degree of audience sympathy even as he belittles the Canucks as he calls them setting himself up for Slate's humility lesson while Andrew Prine pulls you in as a troubled and sensitive soldier who wants the chance to prove himself but finds the business of killing hard.The first hour of the film is the best part as the brigade is trained to Frederick's exacting standards while its American and Canadian components learn to deal with each other. It all comes together in a raucous bar fight which is a McLaglen specialty and the film's highlight a rousing celebration of CanadianAmerican togetherness at the expense of a few bigmouthed lumberjacks who pick the wrong time to kid Dawson about his kilt.I know nobody invited the Canadians Akins sneers. But what burns me up is just who the hell invited you?Alas when we get to the war itself we are initially treated to a silly combat sequence involving the capture of an Italian village by a patrol. It all comes too easy and McLaglen's attempt to marry the comedy of the first half with some gritty battle reality is miscalculated. Are we supposed to believe an elite battalion of Germans can be captured by a dozen Devils without anyone firing a shot?There are lots of shots fired at the film's concluding battle at once rousing and heartwrenching especially as McLaglen and scripter William Roberts make use of all the characters we had invested ourselves in by putting them in harm's way and not letting them all out. After the bar fight it is the film's best section especially with William H. Clothier's sterling cinematography making ample use of a bluemountain vista.Maybe I am too prejudiced in favor of movies that thrilled me when I was young. Maybe The Devil's Brigade isn't as good as Lawrence Of Arabia. But it's a solid adventure film that makes me happy I had the good luck to see it when I was a little more naive.";

	schema:headline " Solid counterpart to The Dirty Dozen";
	schema:reviewBody "The Devil's Brigade was released in 1968 11 months after the hugely successful The Dirty Dozen. Both films have similar plots and were based on reallife WWII units  The Dirty Dozen was loosely based on the Filthy Thirteen and The Devil's Brigade more tightly based on the 1st Special Service Force AKA The Black Devils.Their plots are similar in that they each involve a group of military delinquents being trained for a big mission and then the execution of that mission. They differ in that the 1st Special Service Force was comprised of both American and Canadian soldiers rather than just Americans.Although The Devil's Brigade is based more on fact it's still a very Hollywoodized depiction of events. For instance actual members of the unit objected to the way the film limits the groups warm relations with the locals of Helena Montana the city nearest their training base to a major brouhaha in a saloon.The first half of the film takes place mostly at the dilapidated base near Helena but was shot at a base in Lehi Utah which is a decent substitute since it's only 350 miles due south of Helena.Generally speaking The Devil's Brigade is not as good as The Dirty Dozen but that's only because the latter film is so great plus it came first. Yet it has some aspects that are just as good in their own way and sometimes better. For instance the final mission in The Dirty Dozen involves the unit's raid on an opulent German chteau which  while good  is hardly a typical WWII combat scenario the final mission shown in The Devil's Brigade by contrast involves the brigade's taking of a German stronghold atop a rocky mountain in Northern Italy an excellent battle sequence.Although it's next to impossible to beat Lee Marvin as the commander of the unit in The Dirty Dozen William Holden is very strong in the counterpart role in The Devil's Brigade. However he was too longinthetooth for the part as the real commander of The Black Devils was much younger but that's not a big deal.Despite the above criticisms of the saloon brawl it is a highlight as is the scene in the mess hall where a handtohand combat trainer is introduced. It's an extremely wellstaged sequence.Claude Akins is great as the apelike Pvt. Rockman but his hysterics at the death of his Canadian comrade in battle is overly melodramatic. As if he wasn't prepared for the likely death of a fellow soldier in battle.FINAL SAY If you're in the mood for a late 60s war flick in the mode of The Dirty Dozen The Devil's Brigade is a quality option.The film runs 130 minutes and was shot in Utah  Italy.GRADE B".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the true story of how a group of American misfits were mixed with a first rate Canadian outfit and how the leadership of Col. Frederick molded them into one of World War II's most effective fighting forces. Col. Frederick William Holden is one of the most inspirational officers ever portrayed in film and can serve as a great role model for anyone looking to mature. The film contains more positive American values than any I've seen lately. This is an excellent bigmovie treatment to a story well worth the telling  now on DVD.In 1968 I might have scored this movie slightly lower but not anymore. Back in 1945 and well into the 1970's Hollywood was loaded with real life war hero's  both in front of the camera and behind the scenes. Most pictures reflected positive values and could inspire the young as to how to live their lives.In contrast in 2007 we have a pathetic bunch of airheads and drugheads with no knowledge or contempt for mainstream American values now generating at least 9 movies intended to give aid and comfort to America's enemies in wartime  and trash the memories of those who died in the September 11th terrorist attack.Compare William Holden's inspirational role in Devil's Brigade to onagainoffagain drug abuser Charlie Sheen his name stolen from Bishop Fulton J Sheen dazed and confused on TV  ranting about toy airplanes crashing the World Trade Center. Yeegads!".

Frederick William Holden is one of the most inspirational officers ever portrayed in film and can serve as a great role model for anyone looking to mature. The film contains more positive American values than any I've seen lately. This is an excellent bigmovie treatment to a story well worth the telling  now on DVD.In 1968 I might have scored this movie slightly lower but not anymore. Back in 1945 and well into the 1970's Hollywood was loaded with real life war hero's  both in front of the camera and behind the scenes. Most pictures reflected positive values and could inspire the young as to how to live their lives.In contrast in 2007 we have a pathetic bunch of airheads and drugheads with no knowledge or contempt for mainstream American values now generating at least 9 movies intended to give aid and comfort to America's enemies in wartime  and trash the memories of those who died in the September 11th terrorist attack.Compare William Holden's inspirational role in Devil's Brigade to onagainoffagain drug abuser Charlie Sheen his name stolen from Bishop Fulton J Sheen dazed and confused on TV  ranting about toy airplanes crashing the World Trade Center. Yeegads!";

Perhaps it was a bit ahead of it's time I think  everyone should take a look at it again and have a laugh.As a European I must say that it is ever so refreshing with a movie with such a black humor to it. The fact that everything is over the top makes it not less attractive but brings the socalled authenticity of this story to an extend of fun fun fun. It is beyond real  it is there to amuse you and so it does. This movie is sarcastic even to itself and indeed to the Fay Weldon novel that lies behind it.Roseanne stars in her very best role ever as the ugly and poor Ruth Patchett who reveals herself as a superheroine in the vengeance department. To cast Roseanne in this role is a brilliant idea. She is obviously not afraid of being the most repulsive woman ever seen on video and that only contributes to the laughs as she turns from the bearded lady into a business woman with a hard grip on her own destiny. Roseanne has always been accused of being a bad actress. I am not saying that she is a good one but perhaps the character Ruth has a lot of Roseanne inside her  because her work here is in any way magnificent.Meryl Streep on the other hand is absolutely faboulos. She has tried a few time to enter the world of comedy most notably with the bizarre Death Becones Her but this might be her very best try in the genre. As the pink queen of romance the Barbara Cartland of her generation you might add she sparkles with hysteria and selfconsciousness. Her Mary Fisher does make one of the funniest breakdowns as her Love in the Rinse Cycle fails as well as her relationship with Robert Patchett Ruth's husband. Streep has the elegance that it takes to be  well pink  but she is not afraid of tearing it down and plays the role with much physical courage.Academy Award Winner Linda Hunt as always also makes a great appearance as Ruth's partnerincrime Nurse Hooper. Along with Roseanne and Meryl Streep she benefits from her physical appearance and all three of them changes as women in a very convincing way. For Linda Hunt cookies does the trick and her change from dry bitter and hardworking to giggling business woman is very amusing indeed.Finally I must say that the cinematography and editing of this movie is outstanding as well as the musical contribution e.g. the opening titles and the introduction of Ruth  it sure does follow the general irony of the story in a great way. Along with the extremely wellput dialogue this movie simply is  hilarious.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reading the comments for this film two aspects appear as the concentration to the films perceived flaws. The one is a lack of sympathy for Roseanne's character Ruth. The other is a lack of appreciation for Meryl Streep's performance. Having watched this film many times since it's release I think I can safely dispute this argument.This film certainly I feel has all the markings of a cult favorite. It's dark humor over charged performances as well as the overall look and feel wedges it someplace between Heathers and Ruthless People. More on the nuances that I feel set this film apart from others later but lets first deal with the RoseannStreep problem.Quite frankly I see no problem. Meryl Streep's Mary Fisher is one of the screens funniest inventions. It seems quite clear to me that she enjoyed playing this role because there is no other way such a wonderful performance could have been created. On a number of occasions there are lengthy shots with no change of camera where she drives through a range of hilarious emotions. How she handles a scene involving a dog licking her feet while she awakes is tremendous. I feel it is one of her strongest performances she never turns it off and always delivers it in the correct dosage.The issue with Roseanne's character Ruth is she is seen as manipulative uncaring a monster hell bent on revenge. Ruth like everything else in this picture is a caricature.  This is very much the sort of role we would expect from Roseanne the domestic goddess taking it all a step further. True she does wallow in a mean spirited negativity but it results in a positive outcome for nearly all involved. She takes control of her life and liberates Linda Hunts Nurse Hopper as well as countless women through her Vespa Rose Employment Agency. She returns life to the geriatrics in her care at a nursing home. As a result of Ruth's revenge Mary Fisher at last becomes recognized as the serious writer she wished to from the start. We even know that Begley's Bob Patchett gets his comeuppance and accepts it with grace and humility.There are dozens of touches brought here which make this a movie so enjoyable to watch. Firstly there is the remarkable physical change in many of the characters as the story progresses. Roseanne goes from looking like a reject from a freak show to a rather zaftig Joan Collins.  Linda Hunt and Sylvia Miles likewise transform and Streep goes from a pink frosted confection of a romance novelist to a black turtle necked bespectacled writer with a gift for the post modern metaphor.  A certain tone is set when the establishing shot of Mary Fisher pink palace by the sea reveals her initials M F emblazoned on the massive gate. Streep is given countless occasions to do great business for the camera as in a scene where her complete lack of comprehension in doing laundry leads her to put half a gallon of bleach and several dryer sheets in a washing machine. Best of all she manages to give the finger to the serious critics while on the Sally Jesse Raphale Show.  I honestly don't feel this film is as bad as many would like one to think. If you sit back and let it unfold as I believe it was intended to you will find a clever picture that has just the correct amount of overarched villainy and cynicism as many of our favorite black comedies.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not a fan of Roseanne Barr or whatever she calls herself now but this movie was a definite misfire. While the casting is awfulEd Begley Jr. as anybody but a nebbish is simply wrong and Meryl Streep makes you wonder why she won anything related to an award for her actingthe film's overtones are very strange.On the gender side this movie attempts to make itself into a moralistic feminist play about how women are always mistreated by men. Unfortunately the character of Ruth negates this by being more manipulative than her husband especially in regards to using his second mistress to help frame him for fraud. Also she takes on a very strange attitude towards revenge by attempting to destroy Meryl Streep before going after her husband. While her list notes that her husband is her focus the movie takes an odd turn by seeking out Meryl's character as a moral lesson while destroying her husband. The film can never really rectify why Ruth hates her husband so much that she's going after the woman who supposedly lured him away. The film's ending takes some satisfaction in changing Mary into a more bitter and 'learned' woman but doesn't really offer a real solution. Is Ruth going after her husband through this woman? And if she blames her husband for this why is she going to such great lengths to destroy Mary since her husband is simply the kind of jerk who uses and then leaves women? Shouldn't have Ruth found more common ground with Mary after a while? And if one sees this through a class sensibility Ruth's whole mission becomes pointlessly sadistic. Mary is of a higherclass and is rich to an extent. Ruth is a poor and ugly housewife with limited means. At the end Ruth raises in class while Mary remains the same. Hence Ruth could be seen as using her husband's infidelity as a means to rise above her own station. While Ruth's narrative diatribes about Mary 'learning' about being a wife are meant to be seen as some kind of validation for the troubles of a housewife who has to deal with various troubles to keep a family intact it's hard not to notice that Ruth at the end will not go back to being the very housewife she supports. By rising herself out of revenge she in fact becomes an image of Mary but causes her whole actions throughout the movie to be negated. Her whole character's motivation hinges on being an abused lowerclass housewife who is going to knock down the higherclass woman down for stealing her man and at the end becomes exactly the same successful in her own right. This is hypocrisy at its finest. And the dumping of her own children as some sort of object on their father completes the hypocrisy. The image of a housewife is something to be shown on a pedestal but isn't recommended for a way of living. While this could mirror the life of Roseanne it simply does not fit. How can you support a woman who is supposed to be an everyday woman as the conceit goes fighting for a sense of justice when she turns out to be the same as the woman who stole her man? This whole angle of thinking is what sinks the movie. Are we seeing revenge for Ruth or are we seeing her fight back over the loss of property in the form of a husband which she doesn't want back anyway? And the movie cannot resolve this because then we get into weighty issues about what being a housewife truly is. By marketing itself as some sort of comical Lifetime Movie of the Week the movie supports a position as the housewifemother being some sort of holy figure to be supported and idealized. But with the ending showcasing a housewife 'evolved' into a businesswoman who joins the kids she abandoned as a part of her revenge to the husband she doesn't want back this negates the whole plot. Why didn't she just dump her kids on the husband and forget about them all? The point of the revenge was to assuage her ego which then marks the housewifemotherJesus figure as some sort of prison which one must escape since it was formed by a man. But since without the man this illusion breaks down the movie instead becomes the story of a woman who seeks to better herself after a horrible betrayal and instead dwells in the past for petty revenge hence sinking her moral high ground for absolutely nothing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Roseanne as I've said before is a great actress. In most of her roles she is playing a funny bossy character who we all know and love.  In this role she is none of that.  She plays a more serious role and in the beginning she a bit of a push over.  She stars as Ruth a dowdy overweight mom of two.  Ruth is well aware her husband Bob is sleeping around on her she's even met the woman.  When Ruth embarasses Bob he moves in with his mistress reciting the four things that mean most to him in life.  His house his career his family and his freedom.  He also calls her a devil so she writes the list down to reread and destroy everything that means well to him. Meryl Streep plays the snooty spoiled mistress.  She is a romance novelist named Mary Fisher.  As Ruth says many times in this movie Mary Fisher lives in a beautiful mansion by the sea. Ruth acts much like Santa Clause with her list.  She reads carefully and always checks each thing twice.  First she burns his house then she drops the kids off with him.  She starts her own business to get people to be hired by him.  One of whom sleeps with him on a number of occasions.She finds out he's been cheating his clients so she gets him sent to jail.  All in a day's work.  Not really she meets this amazing woman who helps her along the way.  Hooper really helped her out. If you like a fun romantic or unromantic comedy with revenge on the side I recomend She Devil.".

I truly thought from the previews that it would be hilarious to see the juxtaposition of Meryl Streep's proper and glamorous character with Roseanne's crude and ugly lout.  Boy was I wrong.The first disappointment is that Streep and Roseanne appear in only two scenes together disallowing the possibility of numerous oddcouple moments between the two women.  The second and most glaring disappointment is the unsatisfying story and unbelievable characters.  C'mon Ed Begley Jr. as a philandering ladies' man?  And the underlying lesson I guess I was supposed to learn was that being manipulative and vindictive can gain you fame and fortune and make you a better woman.  I felt that in the final scene where Roseanne is walking down the street toward us the director wanted all of us in the audience to be standing up and applauding this glorious and wonderful woman along with all the great things she had done.  I didn't want to cheer for Roseanne and I resented the implied manipulation of this scene.I would also have to agree with the above review What Was Meryl Streep Thinking??? which pointed out the dreadful houseblowingup incident. Even though it has been over 10 years since I've seen this film that image is still burned into my mind watching Roseanne walk away from a largescreen projection of a videotaped house explosion.Not only did this embarrassingly bad movie considering the cast make Siskel  Ebert's 10 Worst Movies Of The Year list but it is the first title I call to mind whenever I am asked about the worst movies I've ever seen. Recommended only for the most dementedly obsessed Meryl Streep fans.".

I just hope when kids watch this film they do not rely on it as facts for their education. The real story itself was intriguing enough without having to bend the truth. So why did they?Anyway in the film Elizabeth I was madly in love with Thomas Seymour. From historical records Thomas was supposedly the person who made advances on Elizabeth I but was unsuccessful. In the film Edward Seymour was seen as a callous power hungry puppeteer in the royal court. In history he was a successful military man when he battled oppositions at Pinkie Scotland 1547. Edward was also responsible for religious reforms and in relaxing heresy and treason laws. In the film he sent his brother Thomas to the scaffold because of his paranoia over power struggle threats. In history the execution of Thomas by the council in 1549 was a significant blow to Edward and it weakened his power in England. The eventual arrest and execution of Edward in 1552 was conspired by John Dudley Earl of Warwick and Thomas Wriothesley Earl of Southampton to remove Seymour's protectorate power over his nephew King Edward VI. Edward VI died at the age of 15 in 1553. Dudley induced the council to proclaim his daughterinlaw Lady Jane Grey as queen after Edward VI's death. Dudley was executed in 1554 by Mary I for treason.Of course there's no way of knowing precisely what really happened in history. But in rationale a person should not be defamed or condemned as in the case of Edward Seymour based on hearsay idle gossip a romantic novel or a chick flick even if they are dead over a few centuries. In theory anyhow.Anyway I did enjoy this film as pure entertainment. Walter Plunkett's costume design was magnificent and the whole cast was superb. Miklos Rozsa's emotional music score was an incredible soul wrenching delight.Is it worth seeing? Yes definitely! It's entertaining well acted and beautifully produced.".

Jean Simmons and Charles Laughton have the most interesting roles and play them brilliantly particularly Laughton who is once again portraying Henry VIII the shrewd monarch who disposed of the women in his life by putting them to the block.The screenplay is gracefully written and although it is leisurely paced it never lets up interest in examining the relationships between Elizabeth I young Bess and others at court. Historical purists will object to whatever liberties the novel took to tell this story of court intrigue but they will be impressed by the attention paid to historical detail and the meticulous settings and costumes. The score by Miklos Rozsa is not obtrusive and yet it underlines the deep emotions portrayed by Simmons Granger and Laughton. Deborah Kerr has a rather colorless and almost minor role as Catherine Parr and is unable to do much with it although she and Simmons photograph beautifully in color.Easy on the eyes and a very entertaining saga of a bloody chapter in England's history.".

	schema:headline " The most cinema loved Royal Family in English History!";
	schema:reviewBody "How many films have been made about Alfred the Great the only English monarch with the nickname the Great. Only one made in the 1960s I believe. There is to my knowledge no film about William the Conqueror and the Battle of Hastings although there are at least six versions of Shakespeare's MACBETH who was William's contemporary monarch in Scotland!.There is one film about the Normans of William's time  THE WARLORD 1965 with Charleton Heston and Richard Boone. It's a very good film but it never shows William. No films about St. Edward the Confessor Ethelred the Unready William Rufus or Hardecanute remember the Danish Viking ruler of England who whipped the disobedient waves of the Channel. The first major English monarch who is made the subject of a big film is Henry II the role played both times by Peter O'Toole in BECKET and THE LION IN WINTER. Significantly his two roles stem from two major plays of the 1950s and 1960s. His son Richard I the LionHearted appears in THE LION IN WINTER but earlier films included THE CRUSADES ROBIN HOOD IVANHOE KING RICHARD AND THE CRUSADERS and ROBIN AND MARION. Richard is really the first English monarch to appear in more than just a couple of films  but notice even though he is a central figure the films tend to deal with the Third Crusade he helped to lead or the machinations of his brother Prince John or the possibly fictional figure of Robin Earl of Locksley known as Robin Hood. While THE CRUSADES and KING RICHARD AND THE CRUSADERS deal with him and Berengaria his wife and try to build a romantic and chivalric triangle between them and Saladin the actual sexual interests of Richard seem to be closer to the performance of Anthony Hopkins in THE LION IN WINTER. Oddly there is no film about King John and his failure to control his nobles not even a film version of Shakespeare's historic play although a television movie version was made starring Leonard Rossiter as John in the 1980s  but the BBC were filming the entire series of the plays. Nor of the fights led by Simon De Montford against Henry III that led to the creation of the House of Commons. Occasional films pick up on a few monarchs  BRAVEHEART giving a look at Edward I and his witless son Christopher Marlowe's EDWARD II showing what happened to the witless son CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT being Orson Welles's take on Henry IV and Prince Hal but concentrating on Sir John Falstaff and both Olivier and Branagh dealing with HENRY V in two startling great and different interpretations. Then there is another biggie Old Crookback  RICHARD III in Olivier's production set in the 1470s and 1480s or the version by Sir Ian McKellan set in the 1930s or TOWER OF London with Rathbone a distinctive Richard abetted by Karloff and then a version with Vincent Price who was Clarence in TOWER OF London.This brings us to the champs of British Royals in film  the Tudors. Henry VII always pops up in the Richard films he has to  he wins at Bosworth Field. Yet no film specifically about Henry VII has been made. Not so Henry VIII Edward VI Jane Gray and Elizabeth not much for Bloody Mary though. THE PRIVATE LIFE OF HENRY VIII THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY VIII A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS ANNE OF A THOUSAND DAYS THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER at least 3 versions including one called CROSSED SWORDS YOUNG BESS SIX DAY QUEEN ELIZABETH MARY OF Scotland Mary Queen of Scots was Henry VIII's niece MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS THE VIRGIN QUEEN THE SEA HAWK FIRE OVER ENGLAND THE PRIVATE LIVES OF ELIZABETH AND ESSEX  ELIZABETH THE QUEEN Shakespeare IN LOVE. No other British Royal Family has been as chronicled in films as the Tudors. Think of it. Charles I was the center of so much turmoil that he eventually was executed after a trial following a series of Civil Wars he lost to Oliver Cromwell. Only one film about him was made  and a bad one  CROMWELL emphasizing the victor of those wars. But the Tudors generate more interest  there is more skulduggery and treason in their reigns than most and England becomes a great nation and a cultural fountainhead at the end of it all. YOUNG BESS is a small joy  it deals with the forgotten career of Admiral Thomas Seymour uncle of King Edward VI and wouldbe romantic wooer of Princess Elizabeth. He also was the last of Katherine Parr's three husbands Henry VIII being the second. It is the second time that Laughton plays the great monarch and the terrible fury of the man is shown in two shots showing his hand caressing the neck of Elizabeth's doomed mother Anne Boleyn and later caressing the neck of the doomed Catherine Howard in the same way. Most interesting is the casting of Jean Simmons and Steward Granger as Princess Elizabeth and Admiral Tom Seymour. They were married at the time so their scenes together have an extrasomething to them like the Burtons some ten years later. YOUNG BESS is not accurate history but it is good film making. You will view this film with satisfaction.".

	schema:headline " Moving and Fascinating Fictionalized Biography of Elizabeth Ist of England";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a splendidlymounted production by anyone's standards arguably it is the best realization of thepreElizabethan the late Marian period ever realized on film. But despite its modest beginnings as a fictionalized biography of Elizabeth Tudor by popular author Margaret Irwin the screenplay by Jan Lustig and Arthur Wimperis also adds another dramatic dimension to a welltold story. The subject in this workis the dangerous difficult and famous youth of the future Elizabeth Ist of England taking her from childhood to her accession to the throne after the death of her sister Bloody Mary who reigned following the death both of King Henry VII and his frail son and heir Arthur who died at 12 years of age. George Sidney directed this dignified and powerful story and the assembled cast he presented were wellchosen as speakers of the English language Jean Simmons playing the young Elizabeth with unusual intelligence and verve Cecil Kellaway asthe loyal warder who looks after her modest household as a princess out of favor Charles Laughton reveling in his bravura role as the irascible and fascinating Henry VIII Stewart Granger and Guy Rolfe playing the rival brothers who wrestle for control of England's political direction Deborah Kerr as the King's last wife gentle an d lovely Catherine Parr also prominently featured were Kathleen Byron Kay Walsh young Rex Thompson as EdwardElaine Stewart Dawn Addams Ivan Triesault Lumsden Hare Leo G. Carroll Doris Lloyd Norma Varden Alan Napier Robert Arthur and Lester Mathews. The plotline concerns Elizabeth's attempts to survive the shifting fortunes of the English court powerless except for the loyalty of a few noblemen her greatest danger comes from the handsome and ambitious Thomas Seymour Granger the script treats his regard for Elizabeth as political which is not historical by attaching himself to the queen of the late King Henry he becomes so dangerous his unpleasantly Establishment and puritanical brother Edward must move against him. from this loss Elizabeth is fortunate to emerge alive and at last queen of England but this is a moving film that touches on her relative poverty fears learning arguments with her father disappointment when Edward who loves her dies and her last danger in the Seymour's quarrel. The emotionally rich film is superbly served in my estimation by Miklos Rozsa's memorable score. With bright cinematography by Charles Rosher brilliant art direction by Cedric Gibbons and Urie McCleary set decorations by Jack D Moore and Edwin Willis and gorgeous costumes by Walter Punkett the film is very attractive to watch in every scene. Sydney Guilaroff's hairstylings William Tuttle's makeup and Douglas Shearer's sound work are all firstrate as well. The best scene in the film to many minds is the argument aboard a ship between the volatile Henry Tudor and his equally spirited daughter but this is a very good film on the verge of being a great one thanks to director Sidney's solid presentation of every scene of the material. I recommend it highly if not as literal history then as a colorful thoughtful and satisfying entertainment.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is a splendidlymounted production by anyone's standards arguably it is the best realization of thepreElizabethan the late Marian period ever realized on film. But despite its modest beginnings as a fictionalized biography of Elizabeth Tudor by popular author Margaret Irwin the screenplay by Jan Lustig and Arthur Wimperis also adds another dramatic dimension to a welltold story. The subject in this workis the dangerous difficult and famous youth of the future Elizabeth Ist of England taking her from childhood to her accession to the throne after the death of her sister Bloody Mary who reigned following the death both of King Henry VII and his frail son and heir Arthur who died at 12 years of age. George Sidney directed this dignified and powerful story and the assembled cast he presented were wellchosen as speakers of the English language Jean Simmons playing the young Elizabeth with unusual intelligence and verve Cecil Kellaway asthe loyal warder who looks after her modest household as a princess out of favor Charles Laughton reveling in his bravura role as the irascible and fascinating Henry VIII Stewart Granger and Guy Rolfe playing the rival brothers who wrestle for control of England's political direction Deborah Kerr as the King's last wife gentle an d lovely Catherine Parr also prominently featured were Kathleen Byron Kay Walsh young Rex Thompson as EdwardElaine Stewart Dawn Addams Ivan Triesault Lumsden Hare Leo G. Carroll Doris Lloyd Norma Varden Alan Napier Robert Arthur and Lester Mathews. The plotline concerns Elizabeth's attempts to survive the shifting fortunes of the English court powerless except for the loyalty of a few noblemen her greatest danger comes from the handsome and ambitious Thomas Seymour Granger the script treats his regard for Elizabeth as political which is not historical by attaching himself to the queen of the late King Henry he becomes so dangerous his unpleasantly Establishment and puritanical brother Edward must move against him. from this loss Elizabeth is fortunate to emerge alive and at last queen of England but this is a moving film that touches on her relative poverty fears learning arguments with her father disappointment when Edward who loves her dies and her last danger in the Seymour's quarrel. The emotionally rich film is superbly served in my estimation by Miklos Rozsa's memorable score. With bright cinematography by Charles Rosher brilliant art direction by Cedric Gibbons and Urie McCleary set decorations by Jack D Moore and Edwin Willis and gorgeous costumes by Walter Punkett the film is very attractive to watch in every scene. Sydney Guilaroff's hairstylings William Tuttle's makeup and Douglas Shearer's sound work are all firstrate as well. The best scene in the film to many minds is the argument aboard a ship between the volatile Henry Tudor and his equally spirited daughter but this is a very good film on the verge of being a great one thanks to director Sidney's solid presentation of every scene of the material.

Its wellchosen cast performs most satisfactorily under George Sidney's assured direction and the artistic and technical credits are impeccable notably the art direction and the almost absurdly luxurious costuming. This film was nominated in the color categories for those two contributions and most unjustly in my opinion lost out to Twentieth's first CinemaScope blockbuster The Robe in both cases. The prolific Miklos Rozsa provides one of his more sprightly scores deftly enhancing the script's focus on the romantic entanglements of the principals. Still enough attention is paid to the great peril of being close to the apogee of power in England at the time. Throughout a sense of dread pervades the audience's hope that Young Bess might actually survive to realize her dream of a love fulfilled.".

When Henry died they were his guardians and regents of the minor king. But Tom played for bigger stakes than that even trying to ace his brother out and assume total power. He paid with his life and later Rolfe is also executed and it all blows up when Edward VI dies and the Catholic Queen Mary the older sister to both Elizabeth and Edward takes over. Through all of this Young Bess treads through a court minefield.Simmons is remarkable as Young Bess who learns the political and royal arts early on and moves with a cat's caution for her own survival and eventual succession to the throne. The film also offers an early cameo appearance for Charles Laughton to reprise his Oscar winning role of Henry VIII. Even in his last year Henry VIII is a man very much in control until the second he can't fog a mirror. Then the games begin.

Young Bess offers a rare opportunity to see what happens to Edward half of the two twin protagonists in Mark Twain's beloved The Prince And The Pauper. It wasn't happily ever after for Edward as king just a child pawn in a continual struggle for power between rival court factions in the film and in real life.

A good deal of the film is factual where it gets dicey is in the relationship between Thomas Seymour and Bess. Even if the writers wanted to tell the real story it's dubious it would have made it to the screen thanks to the code.Bess is rejected by her father Henry and sent away after her mother Anne Boleyn is beheaded.

Eventually Bess' strong feelings for Thomas become threatening to Catherine who does love Bess and Bess agrees to leave the household. After Catherine's death Thomas wants to marry Bess and writes to her but he has enemies one of whom is his own brother Edward Ned Seymour Guy Rolfe.This is an extremely opulent film very well acted with good chemistry between the leads It is very entertaining.The true story is that we don't really know how Bess felt about Thomas except late in the game she was receptive to the idea of marrying him by then it was too late. In truth Thomas' behavior toward Elizabeth was inappropriate and he may have even sexually abused her while she was a teenager. When he wanted to marry Bess his past behavior toward her was revealed although the interrogators could get nothing out of Bess. This was added to charges of treason and he was beheaded in 1549. Bess known as The Virgin Queen never married though she came close but some historians feel that Seymour put her off sexual relationships.Thomas was pretty sharp he also hedged his bets by making a play for Queen Mary Elizabeth's half sister as well.Recommended.".

Film follows Bess from birth to her falling in love with another woman's husband through Court politics and treachery.Charles Laughton is good if somewhat hammy as King Henry VIII. His deathbed scene takes forever.Deborah Kerr is OK as the rather frail Katharine Parr sixth wife of Henry VIII she looks too healthy and pretty to be ill. Apparently she's afflicted with a dread disease that leaves her looking lovely with perfect makeup not a hair out of place and in soft focus while it kills. Actually Parr died in childbirth after becoming immediately pregnant with Thomas Seymour's child after her marriage while her four year marriage to Henry produced no offspring. This rather puts to bed pardon the saying Henry's affirmation that Henry was virile and sexually active up to his death. But I digress. Stewart Granger's Thomas Seymour is appropriately heroic and apparently gifted with second sight. It's too bad he wasn't gifted with two heads. Simmons is very good in the title role. Her voice has the commanding tones of one accustomed to being obeyed and she convincingly ages from around ten to age 25. She is the best part of the film.Director George Sidney uses a subtle and effective trick to get the viewer on Simmons' side. In her scenes the furniture is immense in one scene she sits in a chair that is twice her size suggesting that Bess is dwarfed by the events taking place around her.The film received well deserved Oscar nominations for Best Art Direction and Costumes.

	schema:reviewBody "That 'Young Bess' is based on one of the most fascinating periods in history and that it had a lot of talent involved are reasons enough to watch it.Once you get past the fact if you can that the events in 'Young Bess' are heavily fictionalised and romanticized it really does charm and entertain or at least to this reviewer it did. Historians will despair at the number of liberties taken with the facts as there is a complete disregard with them to the extent that history is literally rewritten but taken on its own terms as a film 'Young Bess' does have quite a lot to like. Sure there are flaws. The dialogue occasionally rambles and the character of Catherine Parr in terms of writing is underdeveloped and underused. And it did feel like it could have been 10 minutes longer to give more completeness to the story and make it clearer what happened to the characters for anybody who don't have knowledge of Elizabeth's early life because it did seem a touch incomplete at the end those who are not so familiar with this period of history especially will find this so. Otherwise 'Young Bess' has more strengths than it has flaws. As with many films from the 50s it looks fantastic  with lavish and meticulously evocative costumes and sets and sumptuous and rich in colour cinematography. Miklos Rosza's score is stirringly orchestrated melodically opulent emotionfilled really resonates with the soul and fits beautifully without ever getting intrusive or repetitive. Apart from the odd rambling spot the script is written with wit and grace the story is without a dull stretch and is told with poignancy and charm it helps that the chemistry between Jean Simmons and Stewart Granger married at the time is full of emotion without being heavyhanded and George Sidney's direction is assured and meticulous ensuring that the film never dissolves into unintentional cam p or cheesiness like it could easily have done in lesser hands. Jean Simmons plays Elizabeth with plenty of spirit and passion not descending into the trap of being overwrought while Stewart Granger conveys Seymour's tragedy in this film that is in a way that's moving and never wooden. Their chemistry is very genuine and doesn't ever make the film sink into overwrought melodrama and they are very well supported by Guy Rolfe's conniving Edward Ned Deborah Kerr's compassionate Catherine Rex Thompson's stately and remarkably mature Prince Edward and particularly Charles Laughton's ideally cast Henry a welcome reprisal from his performance one of his best ever in 'The Private Life of Henry VIII'. Smaller roles are solidly taken by a dignified Kay Walsh charming Dawn Addams jovial Cecil Kelloway and authoritative Leo G. Carroll.In conclusion very charming and entertaining on its own merits which I've always found a much fairer way to judge but if you're wanting historical accuracy look elsewhere. 7.510 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "Forget all the explosions car chases crazy villains special effects... The Thomas Crown Affair is not an action movie. Its not even a thriller. Instead its a welldone catandmouse movie thats smart entertaining and very sexy. If you had to use one word to describe the film it would have to be sophisticated. The movie might appeal more to mature audiences as both the leading man and the leading lady are over 40 years old. Pierce Brosnan can obviously do other roles beside James Bond but the role of Thomas Crown is at least somewhat similar to 007. Both guys enjoy women and are very suave. Overall Brosnan gives a solid performance and is overshadowed only by Rene Russo who simply oozes sexuality and class. She is simply perfect in her role and though shes twice as old as I am I find her a real knockout. Not only is she extremely hot but also a very talented and charismatic actress. A perfect combination! The classy dance scene between Brosnan and Russo belongs to the most sexuallycharged scenes in history and the following lovemaking scene manages to be both sexy and stylish. Usually nude scenes in Hollywood movies seem somehow uneasy but in this movie the scene is done in real style and with sensual music the atmosphere is sizzling. Who would want a disposable bimbo like Britney Spears when you could have a real classact woman like Rene Russo? I would also like to mention Bill Conti whose simple yet refined music is simply outstanding. Just listen to the music during the scene in which Crown and Banning go glider flying... You can just close your eyes and listen to this wonderful music. Now I have to find the soundtrack for this film! I guess I should mention that Ive never seen the original Thomas Crown but now I dont even have to bother as its updated version is a true pleasure to watch. I have nothing negative to say about it so just go get this film on DVD and enjoy!".

Instead its a welldone catandmouse movie thats smart entertaining and very sexy. If you had to use one word to describe the film it would have to be sophisticated. The movie might appeal more to mature audiences as both the leading man and the leading lady are over 40 years old.

This film was positively one of the most enjoyable nailbiting suspenseful romantic capers ever made.  A remake of the steamy 1968 Steve McQueen flick updated to the sleek and selfreferential 90s Thomas Crown features Brosnan as the title character  a bored billionaire businessman in the business of acquisitions.  For a thrill he heists an extremely valuable Monet from the New York Museum right under the noses of security guards cops and about a thousand unsuspecting museumgoers.  Renee Russo is the very sexy very worldly Catherine Banning whose insurance company underwrites the painting  and she is determined to get it back at any cost... But the cost just may be her soul as she woos and then falls under the spell of the enigmatic Crown.  Will Russo discover the location of the Monet?  Will she rat out Thomas Crown? Or is Crown manipulating her affections like Bobby Fisher manipulates the pieces on a chess board?What we have here is a highspeed chase film whose vehicle is clever dialog rich and exotic direction and more than a little sexual tension!  Brosnan as Crown is ever the cool Brit charmer whose every word and action are as calculated as the movements of a Rolex.  Russo smoulders every time she appears on screen.  And when the two of them get together the chemical reaction is pure dynamite.Dennis Leary has a nice bit as a streetwise NYPD detective on the case who dispenses advice to Russo's Banning and watches her begin to spiral out of control.  His role here most likely resulted in the deserved attempt at a television series on ABC The Job.The action in the film moves exotically from caper to coverup and back with dizzying speed... All the while we are kept guessing about the motivations of the two lead and find ourselves eagerly anticipating their next move. When the final checkmate comes we are left totally bewildered befuddled and baffled... which is mostlikely the director's intention!On all levels The Thomas Crown Affair will steal the hearts of men and women alike... but for different reasons  Men can enjoy the action and thrill of the chase and Crown's ability to win over the most beautiful women and his attempt to get away with the ultimate heist... Ladies can marvel at the suave Brosnan and his life of extreme wealth and allthewhile wonder if he will betray her or if she will betray him...I will not betray you... I ain't saying!".

Thomas Crown Pierce Brosnan slick from practicing seduction as James Bond is a powerlunching billionaire robberbaron who gets his kicks stealing art treasures from taxpayersupported museums. Catherine Olds Banning played by the tough but sexy Rene Russo is the insurance company detective determined to get back the painting he steals at the beginning of the film. If she can get it she will save her insurance conglomerate a nice chunk of change. The billionaire and the detective try everything to outsmart each other including a highly charged love affair that's a heated mix of business and pleasure. Russo looks very good with her clothes off.The director's attention to the detail of the sumptuous luxury sets provides a suitably comfy backdrop for the steamy action. McTiernan also directs the action pieces almost as well as one might expect from the director Die Hard.Brosnan and Russo supply most of the heat for the developing romance. The witty dialog by Leslie Dixon make the film move by with enough grace to paper over the fact that it is the sex we are interested in. Russo is beautiful stylish smart selfpossessed and incredibly sexy.Denis Leary gets a good character role as a police detective smitten with Russo and Faye Dunaway the love interest in 1968 gets a wholly enjoyable cameo as Brosnan's therapist who helps him try to figure out why he is such an irresponsible business man.One wonders now after Enron Tyco and other big payoff corporate heists just whom Crown is robbing to pay for his hightech robbery crew. How many of his company's employees will have to give up their pensions or health benefits to keep his company looking good on Wall Street. Who cares? It's just a movie! Actually it is a great date movie. Pop it in. See if it works.".

	schema:reviewBody "Obligatory comparison to the first film The first Thomas Crown Affair really wasn't that great with its split screens that would make even Brian De Palma sick. Like other films from that era of history it's lost some of its shock with time but unlike true classics Thomas Crown Affair has lost a lot of its charm. Worth a viewing but not worth worshipping.Only vague concepts carry over from film to film really. The same basic plot curve same basic events same basic characters except everything is retold and reinterpreted from a different point of view. And I much prefer John McTiernan's interpretation despite the more glaring plot holes such as 'Why didn't the security tape reveal who set the briefcase in the gallery to begin with?' Theoretically the culprit could've been caught then and there but then there'd be no movie. The caper's execution is rather spectacular far more entertaining than the original's though much less likely to happen. But who cares really? McTiernan directed this as a film you can't take 100 seriously anyway. This is a fun cat and mouse movie not a documentary.The premisean art theftstrikes me as more interesting than the original's robbery besides how many films have bank robberies? How many films steal art? It's something different.The characters and their portrayals are colorful and interesting walking a thin line of camp but never pushing it too far. This movie isn't about 'Everyman' nor is it meant to. It's about a billionaire who gets his kicks out of high stake gambles and wageshow do you do that without a larger than life portrayal? I particularly liked the ending sequence as goofy perhaps corny as it is it's still fun. Especially the music selection Nina Simone's Sinnerman a well chosen track. Bill Conti provides the underlying score which proves quite unique having a slightly bouncy 'piano recital' quality to its first few themes. Very fitting for the museum setting. It's a CD worth purchasing for the sake of variety alone. In the end Thomas Crown Affair works not because of the film's subjects or its characters . . . it works because of how it portrays everything. Its tone is fun and relaxing and it never tries to take itself too seriously. After all we are at the movies and not a training seminar . ..".

	schema:reviewBody "Firstly it's not a cookiecutter remake of the original staring Mr. McQueen and Ms. Dunaway  so no comparison required.You might say Brosnan was typecast by Bond and the idea of a suave player getting one over on yet another woman might be the obvious outcome but not this time! Instead we're treated to a sophisticated game of cops and robbers played out in this stylish and seductive entertainment. Mr. Brosnan Thomas is at the top of his game and may be involved in something illegal. Ms. Russo Catherine is called in to investigate claiming an office and sharing confidences with the local police department looking for clues. Catherine epitomises sophistication with hair makeup and fashions styled to perfection. She's an understatement of success a woman playing a man's game bountyhunting life and sex on her own terms and 'enjoying the chase'. Once Catherine is on the trail of Thomas Crown you'll join her in a hedonistic game of oneupmanship. She's done this kind of work before and must stay on her toes if she's going to implicate the wealthy Thomas Crown. The local cops and cultured community believe Mr. Crown to be beyond reproach an untouchable pillar of wealth and good taste.These two characters exist in their luxurious world through strange circumstance and have made it their own through hard work and some bluffing. The movie provides glimpses into their lifestyles and at the same time keeps them both just outside what you'd expect from a wealthy businessman and a woman working for an insurance company.Supporting character Mr. Leary makes a cynical yet caring detective attempting to save face by nabbing Thomas Crown  however it's quite obvious in a city the size of New York that a bored millionaire looking for thrills by staging a theft is not his priority. Mr. Leary is guilty of a bit of cussing and jaded police behaviour but ya 'gotta hope he's still on the force.The story races from one clue to the next and we glimpse a world where time means nothing and money is just well not an issue. The film really sets the tone for the lush life with ultraposh elegant sets millionairehobbies and exotic locations. The soundtrack is perfect giving the entire movie an upmarket worldly feel that befits a modern romance.This is really a love story for anyone who imagines being whisked away from the mundane into places that you've only read or heard about in glossy magazines. It's a film for any person out there who'd like to have the freedom to do what they want and damn the consequences. Well either that or have enough money to do anything then disappear. There is some hot onscreen chemistry between Thomas and Catherine making the love scenes coupled with the sexy music and breathtaking backgrounds erotic. They have a healthy appetite for each other so the love scenes in his apartment and 'island retreat' are the 'stuff that dreams are made of.'Yes there are little snafus such as a painting being folded in a manner that would permanently ruin it and the usual gaffes that serious filmgoers will pick over  but heck it's just a movie and a love story  let yourself go and imagine you're a woman who's just crashed a black tie event in a dress making every man in the room salivate or that you're the man she's heading for on the dance floor  then have fun with it . . . In the end for all their cunning Thomas and Catherine must decide if they can trust each other just like most men and women must do in any love story. What you may find hard to decide though is who to root for and who really wins the game of cat and mouse at the end of this movie.".

Instead we're treated to a sophisticated game of cops and robbers played out in this stylish and seductive entertainment. Mr. Brosnan Thomas is at the top of his game and may be involved in something illegal. Ms. Russo Catherine is called in to investigate claiming an office and sharing confidences with the local police department looking for clues. Catherine epitomises sophistication with hair makeup and fashions styled to perfection. She's an understatement of success a woman playing a man's game bountyhunting life and sex on her own terms and 'enjoying the chase'. Once Catherine is on the trail of Thomas Crown you'll join her in a hedonistic game of oneupmanship. She's done this kind of work before and must stay on her toes if she's going to implicate the wealthy Thomas Crown. The local cops and cultured community believe Mr. Crown to be beyond reproach an untouchable pillar of wealth and good taste.These two characters exist in their luxurious world through strange circumstance and have made it their own through hard work and some bluffing. The movie provides glimpses into their lifestyles and at the same time keeps them both just outside what you'd expect from a wealthy businessman and a woman working for an insurance company.Supporting character Mr. Leary makes a cynical yet caring detective attempting to save face by nabbing Thomas Crown  however it's quite obvious in a city the size of New York that a bored millionaire looking for thrills by staging a theft is not his priority. Mr. Leary is guilty of a bit of cussing and jaded police behaviour but ya 'gotta hope he's still on the force.The story races from one clue to the next and we glimpse a world where time means nothing and money is just well not an issue. The film really sets the tone for the lush life with ultraposh elegant sets millionairehobbies and exotic locations. The soundtrack is perfect giving the entire movie an upmarket worldly feel that befits a modern romance.This is really a love story for anyone who imagines being whisked away from the mundane into places that you've only read or heard about in glossy magazines. It's a film for any person out there who'd like to have the freedom to do what they want and damn the consequences. Well either that or have enough money to do anything then disappear. There is some hot onscreen chemistry between Thomas and Catherine making the love scenes coupled with the sexy music and breathtaking backgrounds erotic. They have a healthy appetite for each other so the love scenes in his apartment and 'island retreat' are the 'stuff that dreams are made of.'Yes there are little snafus such as a painting being folded in a manner that would permanently ruin it and the usual gaffes that serious filmgoers will pick over  but heck it's just a movie and a love story  let yourself go and imagine you're a woman who's just crashed a black tie event in a dress making every man in the room salivate or that you're the man she's heading for on the dance floor  then have fun with it . . . In the end for all their cunning Thomas and Catherine must decide if they can trust each other just like most men and women must do in any love story. What you may find hard to decide though is who to root for and who really wins the game of cat and mouse at the end of this movie.";

But then heck if Tinseltown in all its unoriginality doesn't do a bangup fun job of unreality with characters who have no place in the Unreel World from the classy looking opening credits to Sting covering Windmills of my Mind over the closing credits. In the opening scene I'm thinking wait I know that woman's voice and voila it's Faye Dunaway from the original film as Crown's shrink  I cheered out loud OK so I was the only one in the audience that got the joke.Pierce Brosnan and Renee Russo are an ageappropriate couple with genuine fireworks and chemistry with help from director John McTiernan and editor John Wright in the tango and copulation scenes.There's unconventionally good music choices  that tango is from Three Penny Opera of all things and a terrific use of Nina Simone's Sinner Man in a marvelous Magritteinspired ironically tense heist scene. Brosnan's trainer gets a credit as there's plenty of skin. Russo laughs a gorgeous belly laugh unlike so many frozen femmes fatale.The credits also say that no museum was used as a locale so gosh they really recreated the Met amazingly accurately and how much did that cost? though it didn't seem crowded enough Crown goes in at 9 when the museum doesn't open until 11.I would think this is a great date movie. originally written 8221999".

	schema:headline " A very good film but a very average remake";
	schema:reviewBody "Well what can I say after watching this film being a fan of the original. To begin with I enjoyed it as it was almost a 90's play by play remake and I am always pleased to see how a 60's or 70's classic would have looked 20 something years later. The early scenes in the film were very close to the original with the business deal going through and then Crown going to observe the heist although participating this time around and so with what I saw I saw a hell of a lot of promise to shine up to the original. The heist seems in both are superbly conceived and very well filmed with just the right amount of tension about the problems arising. Good stuff.Enter Russo dressed as a total Dunaway clone Remember the headscarf? and with some scenes of total over acting which could have worked well but on the whole didn't. Where Russo seems to let go and enjoy herself is a slip mistake that the character would never have done Dunaway ALWAYS kept her cool in the original.Enter the cat and mouse thriller element of the film. I have seen a few reviews here that say that this dragged the film along slowing it down considerably. However this film in both versions is not about a robbery it is about the chase. The point of the film is the exchanges between the two protagonists each trying to catch the other out and this is the brilliance of the film because it isn't a visual action plot with little in it that so many films are today. This makes you watch this makes you observe and it makes you think.Moving on to the character of Crown by Brosnan. Some people have said that Brosnan was hollow and one dimensional with no background to his motivation to the robbery. This is EXACTLY the point and this is why the ending of the 1999 version does NOT work. Thomas Crown only has two things that he cares about Greed and acquisition. The scene in both versions with the business deal at the beginning is the evidence at this with the corporate suits joking about Thomas Crown actually selling something then we find out that he only sold it because unknown to them they were offering 30 million more than anyone else. All Crown cares about is possessing as much as he can this is why he has been alone all this time. And with this being the point of the character that is why the ending of the film is so disappointing and unbelievable compared to the original. Crown desired to own the painting and he would not have given this up for the love of a woman because although it is obvious he wants a woman to love him he cannot love women because he can only love what he owns and he wants to own everything. The original version with McQueen deceiving Dunaway after she betrayed him and then leaving her on the plane is a much more convincing ending.Another unconvincing aspect is the comparison between the McQueenDunaway and BrosnanRusso relationships. Firstly the dance scene comes nowhere near comparison to the chess scene of the original and the dance scene is very poorly filmed as well. The chess scene showed both characters attempts at dominance over each other their lust to win over each other and they sexual tension between them as they play with the chess pieces slowly and seductively. The dance scene is a quick montage of unclear movement with the only piece of sexual tension being Brosnan laying his hands on Russo. All the dominance that Dunaway had in the original was disposed of and Russo caved into to sleeping with Crown very easily. Then there is the BrosnanRusso sex scene which in my opinion was HIGHLY unnecessary. McQueen and Dunaway never needed to do a nude scene together as the sexual tension between the two was so obvious that it could be cut with a bread knife. However Brosnan and Russo do not have that touch the spark was nowhere near as big and the inclusion of a nude scene still does not bring it anywhere near the status of attraction that the original couple had.This film could have been a classic remake if it didn't try to be so politically correct. The only reason why the remake switched from a bank heist to art theft is because in today's world armed robbery cannot be presented as an elegant theft. This is ridiculous as the reason that the original's heist was so smooth was because of the planning timing and element of no one of the criminals meeting until midway through the heist all goes on while McQueen watches from across the road. Where was the planning and recruitment in this remake? Oh yes Russo mentioned it so quickly it would have been dismissed faster than one of Brosnan's butler's lines. And the idea of a happy ending with both of the characters now definitely lovers flying off into the sunset with plans for happiness together. Garbage. These two characters are selfish and greedy because they only look at for number one in a dog eats dog world. McQueen's Crown saw this knowing to drop Dunaway or go to jail and this PC happy ending is just not compatible with this film as with a cat and mouse thriller someone has to lose.".

The soundtrack was fantastic even including The Windmills of Your Mind from the original. Adding Dunaway as a Psychiatrist was a masterful touch.This is much more of a caper film as you actually saw some beautiful work her. The other woman was beefed up and really added to the plot. The ending was much more satisfying and unlike the previous version which had to be rated R because the bad guy won this actually earned the rating with some magnificent scenes.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had not seen the previews but had heard about it. Brosnan's role sounded good really good so I went with my wife and a friend and we saw it one evening. This movie was quite a wondrously detailed beautiful painting emotionally enticing with sophisticated adventure. Truly I can say it sparkled. This film was like enjoying a fine and expensive dinner with a nice bottle of wine. This just totally satisfied us. I noticed from early on that the soundtrack was very alluring almost sensual in nature. The musical artist 'Sting' performed the 1968 title track from the original film. Now remade with a stunning grace. Then at times the music kicks it up a notch and goes into an action mode. We really didn't stop talking about it for quite a while. The characters from Catherine Banning Russo and 'Det. McCann' Leary and Frankie Faison as ' Det. Peretti' and of course Pierce Brosnan as the lead 'player' Thomas or 'Tommy' as friend to be Catherine would call him. But from an interview that I saw truly I am of the same opinion that Denis Leary is when he saidI'm a big fan of Steve McQueen but I think he was just miscast in the roll of Thomas Crown. I liked this remake a lot more than the original in 68. From the art galleries to Manhattan the beautiful twin towers and all the city lights where a tremendous addition to this 'platinum story' directed by John McTeirnan of 'Die Hard' I  III and 'Preditor' etc. was one of those have to be seen again and then down the line again movies that just reminds you of style travel romance and all centered around Manhattan. This was a truly delicious tale of passion an art lover a business baron ...with a magician's talent for the sleight of hand with a love's twist of fate. This is a movie for couples that I believe truly satisfies romantic cinematic cravings for a beautiful story and a wonderful ending. I can see this again and again and fall in love with it every time. ".

	schema:headline " Lacks the Original's Distinctive Style";
	schema:reviewBody "As the original Thomas Crown Affair stood in roughly the same relationship to reallife crime as the James Bond films do to reallife espionage the current 007 Pierce Brosnan was perhaps a natural choice to star as the new Thomas Crown. He brings to the role a similar combination of cool sophistication with a hint of toughness as Steve McQueen the King of Cool brought to the original. I have always thought that McQueen would have made a great James Bond if the producers had ever felt they wanted an American in the role.The new film follows roughly the same plot as the 1968 version with one or two minor variations. The setting is transferred from Boston to New York and the millionaire tycoon Crown is British rather than American. The most significant change is that the robbery which Crown organises is not of money from a bank but rather of a priceless Monet painting from an art gallery. As in the original he is pursued by an attractive female insurance company investigator with whom he becomes romantically and sexually entangled. As in the original the trappings of Crown's millionaire lifestyle are much on display his expensive cars his exclusive New York residence even more luxurious than was McQueen's his private glider his yacht. In this version Crown is a yachtsman rather than a polo player although he is still a golfer. Even the theme song The Windmills of Your Mind comes in at the end and Faye Dunaway makes a cameo appearance as Crown's psychoanalyst.Despite the similarities in plot I felt that something was lacking compared with the original film. That film is one that you watch less for its plot than for its atmosphere of style and sophistication the epitome of sixties cool. The remake never really captures this. To take an example it dispenses with the famous game of chess during which McQueen is seduced by Faye Dunaway instead the investigator here called Catherine rather than Vicki seduces Crown after they have been dancing together. To make a game as intellectual as chess sexy was quite an achievement on the part of the actors and director it is much less of a challenge to do the same for dancing an activity which has been described as the vertical expression of horizontal desires. The chess scene is memorable precisely because it is so unexpectedly erotic the dancing scene is much more forgettable. The director John McTiernan dispenses with Norman Jewison's use of the split screen that was probably the right decision as that technique used today would probably have given the film a very dated feel but McTiernan does not come up with anything equally distinctive to replace it. Pierce Brosnan is good as Crown but I was less taken with Rene Russo's Catherine who I felt surprisingly for an actress who is a former model lacked the sophisticated elegance of Faye Dunaway's Vicki.I make no apologies for comparing this film to the original version filmmakers who remake earlier movies are deliberately inviting such comparisons. It would be wrong to say that I disliked the newer version. In some respects it is superior to its predecessor it has for example a more coherent plot. There are some humorous touches such as the scene where Catherine thinks she has recovered the missing painting only to find that it is a fake painted over Monet's unknown masterpiece Dogs at Cards. There is also a neat twist at the end when Crown helped by a number of accomplices all identically dressed with bowler hats and briefcases succeeds in replacing the painting on the walls of the gallery under the noses of Catherine and the police. Seen as a romancecomedythriller the remake is not a bad film. It is however a routine one. The original was not a great film but it was never routine. It had its own quite distinctive style and personality something the remake lacks. 610".

The story is not quite as convincing here it does have some great scenes that also some that don't quite work like the dance scene which was not very well filmed and didn't enhance the story as much as the chess scene of the original. However visually it is very stylish with striking locations crisp photography and editing and great fashions. The direction as expected from John McTiernan is very convincing the screenplay is taut and the soundtrack is memorable. Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo are fine leads and their chemistry is somewhat steamier than the original's and there is also some great support from Denis Leary and Faye Dunnaway herself. Overall a more than worthy remake loose of course but very stylish and classy. 810 Bethany Cox".

What's especially impressive is that this reworking actually features leads who are older than their 60's counterparts when the original was made.

Especially pleasing in The Thomas Crown Affair are plot points that steer clear of developments exhibited in the original this remake for a change is fresh enough on its own terms that any degree of familiarity with the 1968 version is immaterial. Particularly satisfying are the climax and denouement which develop naturally and delightfully on their own terms.

And it is precisely in Spain that the movie takes place in Catalua to be more precise.Luna explores once more the theme of an obcession in this case the obcession of a young boy for the women's milk. There are some psychological concepts in this story such as the rejection complex that the elder son feels with the birth of his brother. In the movie this is what leads to the obcession of the young boy who suddenly sees all his mother's milk go to the recently born son. So he starts trying to find a breast who is able to feed him. He finds it in a woman recently arrived and from here on the movie is all around this.This movie lives a lot on imagery more than the story itself the espectator captures certain moments unforgettable moments and certain symbols the movie deserves a thourough analyses on almost everything that happens because it usually means something.... The surroundings the landscapes typical from the region as well as the surreal behaviors of the characters also symbolic and the excelent ambiguous soundtrack by Nicola Piovani transport us to another dimension not parallel to the real world but which intersects it from times to times... Worth living in that world worth watching this movie even though we may eventually and for moments get tired and a bit sick with the excessive obcession which is perhaps taken beyond the limits...I also enjoyed the performance of the protagonist... 810".

Not so sure!. Spanish cinema is often quite sexual but in a very open and healthy way that leaves the viewer without any sense of voyeurism or kink. I think that we if we northern European types had the same attitude we'd be much better off as a result.This liberal attitude is also seen in the hilarious 'Fartman Maurice' character.

The child cannot stand the idea of having a new brother and dreams about drinking milk from the breasts of his mother again . As the family's new arrival has replaced him at his mummy's Laura Maa breast . The boy asks and invokes the moon to bring him a tit only for him . Then  an imposing woman called Estrellita Mathilda May  a Gallic performer  comes in and he falls in love for her . However  his adolescent brother Miguel Poveda already his eyes on her . While the gorgeous lady herself seems sweet on her stage colleague Maurice Gerard Darmon. The whole issue being unified by the scene of the tit suckling one and all . Typical and stirring Bigas Luna picture filled with strange happenings  twisted events  erotic scenes and surrealist images . This attractive as well as erotic story is a passionate retelling and an ironical story about a dreamer kid in which his short age doesn't avoid to follow his impossible dream . Full of visual images  fetishism and wonderful scenes  but including bad taste and strong sex scenes with loads of female nudism . Third part of Bigas Luna's Iberian Trilogy also adding Jamn Jamn and Golden eggs . The first installment Jamon  Jamon concerns on satiric machismo in which a macho man falls in love for a lowerclass girl  Huevos De Oro dealt with a mean young attempts to build the great phallic symbol of power  at whatever cost  while The tit and the moon director Bigas Luna adopts a more reflective approach . It's more sympathetic  gentler piece than its immediate predecessors . Filmmaker Luna sets up symbolic opposition between sexual experience of the various males and their excessive youth . In the flick we find brief description about several Catalan habits such as  human castles  Bread with tomato  Barretinas  Sardana music  among others . This Spanish picture is an enjoyable tale with a thoughtprovoking characterizing about a few characters  compelling drama and colorful outdoors . It is an overblown as well as strange drama  including surrealist elements  being screenwritten by the same filmmaker along with his usual screenwriter Cuca Canals . Director Bigas Luna also writes the script filmed in his usual formal and stylistic scholarship  without leaving a trace the brooding issues  in terms of dramatic and narrative excitement . However  the film's essential problem is its failure to generate the sort of pace drive that would forge its metaphoric patterns into interesting drama . The storyline relies heavily on the continued dreams of the starring  including a lot of sexual scenes  almost softcore  but it doesn't make boring  however the film is entertaining . In spite of  the movie results to be acceptable and compellingly realized . Bigas carries out a perfect imaginary  a willingness almost perfect of the elements of each shot  every sequence every space . Good acting by quartet protagonist  all of them give fine performances  such as Biel Duran as likable child who must invoke the moon for a new tit to call his own  Miguel Poveda as a sexcrazed teenager usually singing Andalucian songs and Gerard Darmon as anguished romantic performer  his interpretation is genuinely moving . And special mention to Mathilda May she is marvelous and charming with her sweet and enjoyable countenance and appealing body . Sensitive as well as evocative musical score by Nicola Piovani who won Academy Award for Life is beautiful. Furthermore  a colorful and evocative cinematography by Jose Luis Alcaine who was first cinematographer to use fluorescent tube as key lightning and deemed to be one of the best Spanish cameraman . Alcaine frequently works with Pedro Almodvar  Bigas Luna and Vicente Aranda  as he has photographed The skin I live in  The bad education  Volver  Women in the verge of a nervous breakdown among others . Here he shows splendidly the impressive landscapes from Catalua.The motion picture was stunningly directed by Bigas Luna  but somehow it's the disturbing as well as shocking of dreamsequence lactation on the end that still succours the strongest and rarest impression. Luna follows his particular style  plenty of sex  food references and surrealist homages including some abstract dream sequences . Bigas Luna was born on March 19 1946 in Barcelona Catalonia Spain as Josep Joan Bigas Luna . He was a Bon Vivant who along with his wife produced wine ham and organic products  they are well shown in his films . He was a writer and director known for Jamn Jamn 1992 Huevos de Oro or Golden eggs 1993 The Chambermaid on the Titanic  Angustia or Anguish 1987  this The tit and the moon  Volaverunt  Yo soy La Juani Di  Di Hollywwod among others . He's also an expert on murky atmosphere such as proved in Caniche  Tatuaje Bilbao  Anguish and Reborn. Luna discovered actors Ariadna Gil Leonor Watling  Javier Bardem and Penlope Cruz . He sadly died recently on April 6 2013 in Tarragona Catalonia . This film La Teta Y La Luna is stylishly photographed and smartly designed and here Bigas Luna delivers his ordinary and erotic goods with nice sense of style . The picture will appeal to Mathilda May fans and Bigas Luna buffs.".

The first installment Jamon  Jamon concerns on satiric machismo in which a macho man falls in love for a lowerclass girl  Huevos De Oro dealt with a mean young attempts to build the great phallic symbol of power  at whatever cost  while The tit and the moon director Bigas Luna adopts a more reflective approach . It's more sympathetic  gentler piece than its immediate predecessors . Filmmaker Luna sets up symbolic opposition between sexual experience of the various males and their excessive youth . In the flick we find brief description about several Catalan habits such as  human castles  Bread with tomato  Barretinas  Sardana music  among others . This Spanish picture is an enjoyable tale with a thoughtprovoking characterizing about a few characters  compelling drama and colorful outdoors . It is an overblown as well as strange drama  including surrealist elements  being screenwritten by the same filmmaker along with his usual screenwriter Cuca Canals . Director Bigas Luna also writes the script filmed in his usual formal and stylistic scholarship  without leaving a trace the brooding issues  in terms of dramatic and narrative excitement . However  the film's essential problem is its failure to generate the sort of pace drive that would forge its metaphoric patterns into interesting drama . The storyline relies heavily on the continued dreams of the starring  including a lot of sexual scenes  almost softcore  but it doesn't make boring  however the film is entertaining . In spite of  the movie results to be acceptable and compellingly realized . Bigas carries out a perfect imaginary  a willingness almost perfect of the elements of each shot  every sequence every space . Good acting by quartet protagonist  all of them give fine performances  such as Biel Duran as likable child who must invoke the moon for a new tit to call his own  Miguel Poveda as a sexcrazed teenager usually singing Andalucian songs and Gerard Darmon as anguished romantic performer  his interpretation is genuinely moving . And special mention to Mathilda May she is marvelous and charming with her sweet and enjoyable countenance and appealing body . Sensitive as well as evocative musical score by Nicola Piovani who won Academy Award for Life is beautiful. Furthermore  a colorful and evocative cinematography by Jose Luis Alcaine who was first cinematographer to use fluorescent tube as key lightning and deemed to be one of the best Spanish cameraman . Alcaine frequently works with Pedro Almodvar  Bigas Luna and Vicente Aranda  as he has photographed The skin I live in  The bad education  Volver  Women in the verge of a nervous breakdown among others . Here he shows splendidly the impressive landscapes from Catalua.The motion picture was stunningly directed by Bigas Luna  but somehow it's the disturbing as well as shocking of dreamsequence lactation on the end that still succours the strongest and rarest impression. Luna follows his particular style  plenty of sex  food references and surrealist homages including some abstract dream sequences . Bigas Luna was born on March 19 1946 in Barcelona Catalonia Spain as Josep Joan Bigas Luna . He was a Bon Vivant who along with his wife produced wine ham and organic products  they are well shown in his films . He was a writer and director known for Jamn Jamn 1992 Huevos de Oro or Golden eggs 1993 The Chambermaid on the Titanic  Angustia or Anguish 1987  this The tit and the moon  Volaverunt  Yo soy La Juani Di  Di Hollywwod among others . He's also an expert on murky atmosphere such as proved in Caniche  Tatuaje Bilbao  Anguish and Reborn. Luna discovered actors Ariadna Gil Leonor Watling  Javier Bardem and Penlope Cruz . He sadly died recently on April 6 2013 in Tarragona Catalonia . This film La Teta Y La Luna is stylishly photographed and smartly designed and here Bigas Luna delivers his ordinary and erotic goods with nice sense of style . The picture will appeal to Mathilda May fans and Bigas Luna buffs.";

I've been saving it for such an occasion where I need something from a Spanish mind that is as direct as anything in Hollywood.But it involves two things that Hollywod just cannot seem to do preadolescent wonder about sex and genuine magical realism. I don't like the term because it is at once too broad like surrealism and irony and at the same time usually expressed too simply. Here the magical worlds we shift in and out of are worlds driven by lactation one of a boy's fantasy yearning a the second of the physics of what he encounters explained through that world. And there's a third which is shared only between us as adults and the filmmaker.That adult magical world is populated by a French couple a young dancer played by the desirable Mathilda May and her husband who performs with her. His stage skill is farting and he bills himself as the man of fire appearing in firepainted leathers and with a motorcycle as prop both for the stage show and the film proper.There's a magical folding of course between the show they put on the one confabulated by the boy the one we see in the film and one managed by the boys' dad. In this latter case the boy strives to be the top of a penis constructed of men. It begins the film where the boy fails and ends with him fully erect imagining May's breasts suckling both her's and his mother's.The French performing farter is loosely based on a real French performer Joseph Pujol billed as Le Ptomane. He was the most successful entertainer in late nineteenth century France. This film isn't Spanish at all instead from a land called Catalonia a quite unique land that some would say is temporarily occupied by Spain. Its a rather wonderful place which includes Barcelona. The language is more impulsive than French more languidly sensual than Italian and far more pleasing to the ear than Spanish. It borders on France and has been influenced linguistically at least by that proximity. But just as the Brazilains make fun of the Portuguese so the Catalons make fun of the French. You have to know that to appreciated the lack of wholeness the French couple has plus jokes like the French loaf for a penis.Performing the couple performs on stage the little boy on top of the human phallus the older teen on the woman and singing to her and certain nipples produce on call.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

When I was 12 I have seen her in Letters to an Unknown Lover where she's 21 and hotter than you would imagine.Mrs. May is a Meridional Mediterranean babe so highly responsive to Spanish tastes. She's lean dry supple she looks like a Spanish babe.There is a word that as fetish the Europeans are rather assmen though in Italy the predilection for Mss Grandi's and Caprioglio's tits hints to some considerable titstaste while Americans are titsmen well the Spanish cinema generally offers a nice balance.If the Italian cinema may be said to express a healthy and at times more or less kinky sensuality the full expression of fetishisms is the privilege of the Spanish cinemabreasts thighs etc. the Spanish cinema is in a way the most sensual I knowa deep and natural appreciation for the feminine body. A word might be said also in favor of two less known schools the Polish and the Czech cinemas. Buuel was very fetishist though he feigned the opposite by masquerading fetishism it is a very implied masquerade . Jos Luis Cuerda's Tocando Fondo 1993 with the nowadays underused but wholly delicious Icar Bollan is a textbook example of naughty fetishism Marisa Paredes was also very subjected to much cinematographic fetishism. There's a scene in a Goya biopic where the painter stares at the tits of a young woman by a water in a satire an old man asks a young babe to show him her tits in exchange for some favor he can return and if such scenes could seem unspecific and rather average and common the Spanish invest them with a special sensuality and gusto. The option for Mrs. May is too obvious to need any explanation she has awesome jugs and she has proved it whenever it was useful.How couldn't I be happy that my 500th entry here happened to be one about a movie that's exalting the tits and the pleasure tactile gustatory visual they give? And moreover not just any titsbut Mathilda May's! Maybe one word would be appropriate for my 500th commentaryI have taken quite some pleasures in writing them so far I have enjoyed the several exchanges with various readers these comments have already occasioned and as to the next ones I will to some extent reorient the profile of these entriesmore about silent movies ancient flicks genre movies Gothic movies and author cinema.".

You will either love or hate that way of telling a story.It is a story of how a circle of lifetime friends from kindergarten support each other and negotiate the sticky points of being adult and in the search for a partner or true love. It doesn't fit squarely into drama comedy or romance genres while having moments for all of them. While it makes social commentary on this age's shape of love and dating relationships it is light falling just short of fluffy. It is sort of a watered down version of Like Water for Chocolate so far as the aspects of chef and cooking goes. The movie has definite parallels to the movie Woman on Top with a chef quirky unexpected plot turns the bit of the surreal and a woman who would be ditsy if she weren't so loved and smart. I liked this one better than the Penelope Cruz one because Magic Kitchen struck me as having far more believable characters less sanitized view of choices in relationships with less of a pat fairytale ending. It's soundtrack isn't intrusive. It's cinematography doesn't take center stage but these things are considered. In the subtitles it would have been handy in a couple places if the print on screen would have been translated not only the spoken words.".

However there is not a single mood or occasion of a Chinese new year movie in it. I should say this movie is much better for a Christmas fare or Valentine's date movie.Yau Sammi Cheng is a successful chef and owner of a restaurant which is located in a flat called Magical Kitchen which is more like a home rather than like a restaurant. In a tale told by Yau's mother that she would be haunted by a family curse overshadowing three generations which destines her Yau to fail in every relationship. On a tour of the Iron Chef TV show in Japan Yau is at the crossroads between her love life and career.To spice up the this dish movie we have Yau's assistant chef Ho played by the hunky Jerry Yan of the fame popular Taiwan teenthrob quartet F4. Yan is secretly in love with Yau but doesn't have the guts to express to his 'boss'. Next comes in the picture is Yau's former boyfriend Chun Yao Andy Lau who is a sports goods company operations manager and a bowling expert. Further throw in two girlfriends of Yau played by Maggie Q and Nicola Cheung and you have a relationship rollercoaster ride.Sammi plays her usual unpredictable self similar to her previous movies such as Love on a Diet Good times Bed times and Needing You. Still she's a delight to watch. The same however cannot be said about Jerry who is extremely wooden here and shares little or no chemistry with Sammi. Perhaps we got to blame the casting here as with one look at it we will feel it's a mismatched couples in all the roles.If the name Magic Kitchen would have made you thought of some sort of a similar cooking stunts like Stephen Chow's The God of Cookery then you would be truly disappointed. Nothing unusual or special dish were being cooked up. At best Magic Kitchen is good for a few laughs and the chance to see so many good looking actors as well as other famous actors in cameos on the big screen. But storywise it's wasted.".

	schema:reviewBody "In my book of references Manoel de Oliveira has an unique approach to cinema. And that is because of two aspects which show vivid here as few times before in his career.Most viewers specially the Portuguese will stand on a likedislike position based on the immediately visible flaws the dialog which is old fashioned inadequate in practically any moment out of context definitely not cinematic in the vision we have today and have had for many years of what a film dialog should be sound? like. This dialog constantly explains too many things in devices to provide the spectator with information on dark areas of the plot which many times are so denounced that become childish. than the acting which is many times just awful and other times more melancholic and overdramatic than the speeches of say gone with the wind. If you dear reader think you are smart because you detected all this you're not. it's all true and i don't care about any of that.And i don't care because of two things The first one has to do with placement. Oliveira is a true master in the way he places things in his films. He places vision his camera is most of the time still not that much in this film actually. That has to do with his conception of cinema as filmed theatre but i really see in this the ability to summarize and tell a mooddialogsentiment just by looking at it. Antonioni tried similar stuff later in his life but Oliveira is a master in this. A curious note is that here his sense of visual placement is strangely to Oliveira's patterns close to what Antonioni might have done. The camera moves a lot here and i call attention to the scenes in Alentejo the road shots. One of them in which the eye of the camera is not on the road we watch for some moments the camera following the car. This way of shooting a landscape placing an action in it which becomes fundamental though shot at distance is something Antonioni did so well. Check also the placement of characters. They always start a scene walking coming from somewhere and stop in determined positions to serve the placement chosen for the camera. So it's not about how the camera found the characters but how the characters serve the camera. In the very beginning we have an interesting shots alternating up down angles with low up angles in Lisbon's Terreiro do Pao. The second aspect i truly enjoy has to do with Oliveira's very personal way of working with layers of reality fiction and fictionalized reality. The peak of this exploration of layers was in Viagem ao princpio do Mundo which i place on a special list of films i truly believe can change something about you after and while you watch it. There we had a layer of fictionalized reality that of the actor an historical account portuguese past political context and the layer of Oliveira's memory. Here he replaces the fiction for the real story of a real couple and layers his own personal layer on that couple. He gets more economic here but viagem... was far deeper visually and in terms of narrative. Let's check it here we have Manuel Luciano who by happy coincidence has the same first name as our director and we have his wife. They will serve as a motive for a kind of roadtravel film. They search the clues leading to a supposed retelling of the origins of Cristopher Columbus. Though creating around Columbus a strong theory that may also be fiction over reality. Than we have the third layer. Oliveira plays Luciano as an old man and his grandson plays him as a young man and has his wife playing Luciano's wife. I personally feel that Oliveira at a certain point was shooting mainly this third layer. So we have a number of scenes with Oliveira and his wife in close shots. They talk. I don't think they're acting. I think they're being themselves. Like in Sunset Boulevard we are constantly inside and outside realityies. One of these shots is worth mention they both seat on an interior. They talk about their past lives  i think about their own lives not the lives they're performing she proclaims her love for him he answers he loves her and he kisses her on the face. They get shy like two adolescents. He is 99. She is 10 years younger. This has to be one of the most poignant love scenes in the story of cinema and the climax of this good film. The scene alone makes the experience worthwhile.So superficially to my view the film is about the retelling of an historical worldwide known biography following with that purpose the lives of a couple who studied the subject. In a deeper meaning this is about connections. It's about linking subjects themes places and specially memories. That's why the story talks about linking loose points unexplained historical issues. The separated shots here are also interlinked. That's why we have a shot looking at the sea in Dighton corresponding to a shot looking at the Atlantic in Porto Santo or shots looking through windows in several places throughout the journey. In one particular shot a bridge is being crossed in Alentejo an iron bridge we have a shot at all close to what Oliveira did with bridge D.Luiz in douro faina fluvial this is his own cinematic memory. Vision... Memory Love Luciano loves his wife and his research Oliveira loves his wife and cinema...My opinion 45 should this be put together in a more united way and the actingdialogs not be so badly thrown in some moments and this could be something to change your imagination. Oh and the music is great.httpwww.7olhares.wordpress.com".

We have yet to meet the father who called on the lead and his brother and the flow was rather nice but then we are multiple years later and he is a doctor and a scientist lecturing a group of people on diagnoses. We are then told that he has a fianc back in Portugal but has history as a mistress.We then cut a few years into the future and our lead is getting married. And what follows this is about half way into the film is the actual plot which features 3 of their journeys their honeymoon and two trips as old people. We have not heard a single word about Columbus since the beginning.What's sad is that it's all so underplayed. We never really get close to the couple and we never really see it's obsession nor what it does to their marriage. Yes he is always talking about Columbus but we never get to see what drives it and what consequences it has. Furthermore the plot could have been built up more. As it is now it almost appears as mainly great single scenes thrown together. In fact it seems like they only got time to shoot about half the story. I really wish they had added more included Columbus more or less all the way gotten closer on the couple shown how the lead got so obsessed with Columbus to begin with and perhaps also added something about how he went from a poor immigrant to a respected doctor.It's length is just 75 minutes and it doesn't really give you time to get bored the imagery is very nice to look at and you might learn a few things about Columbus. But this is far from a great film and I would not recommend it.".

It moves very slowly for large chunks which might be okay but there are also confusing rushes of plot and exposition as well as frenetic action scenes that seem a bit out of place. The whole finale is a big action scene that goes on FAR too long reminding me painfully of Katsuhiro Otomo's disappointing steampunk anime film Steamboy.I have my doubts that kids would have much patience for this and may end up bored and restless despite the colour life and good characters with whom they can identify.

But instead of doing the same old stuff kids do they discover a hurt what looks like a dog. However he is an alien sent on a mission to protect a plant which has not been alive for over five billion years.In the mix are three bounty hunters who must get their hands on the plant at all costs to bring back to their employer. Since the kids find out the dog they saved is an alien they all get a wish to explore the farthest reaches away from adults as possible. So  they go to the moon where on the dark side is a grand city embedded within the surface. This leads a series of events for which all six venture across galaxies to hunt down the dreaded poachers.In the chase one of the kids are kidnapped and it is up to the other four kids to save her. Pochi the alien dog uses all of his resources in order to find what is known as The Space Show. A stage event for all aliens to see where Ami the youngest of the five is being held captive. During this event Pochi learns of who was the architect behind the stage show and why. Now all must try and save Ami in order for the kids to get back to earth in time to meet their parents at the week's end.All in all it was a grandiose scale of a movie. With fantastic CGI sets of such calibre that watching was a treat in itself for strange lands strange cities and strange aliens. I especially loved the fact that each child had issues to work along the way like knowing what's right and what's wrong. To make decisions that could get them into trouble later on but deciding that doing the right thing was far a better cost than to leave someone behind. They got to do an honest days work among aliens instead of sluffing off for a week. They learnt to get along in better ways strengthening their friendships. Plus they learnt how to endure hardships and obstacles which they fended off with early naive skills. Kids do bounce back in many ways and that is to say this movie held a lot of hope to those who do not have it. To some others who just watched it for detail it is sad to see such narrow views about story lines. I thought this one had every element of the human condition.This wasn't about SPFX it was about what is right and wrong. What is good and bad. Kids have a sense of being that no other can understand and it is too childish to say it had no maturity. Yes it is a movie for kids about kids. Nothing more. Yes the SPFX were fantastic but what was important through the grand scale environment was the kids had to save a friend. Dealing with problems at home in school with time off or finding a rabbit.My view is the movie held all aspects of being human in an inhumane world. I give it ten of ten stars. Extremely recommended to those aged 9 and above. For the little ones who believes in heroes not computers.".

During this event Pochi learns of who was the architect behind the stage show and why. Now all must try and save Ami in order for the kids to get back to earth in time to meet their parents at the week's end.All in all it was a grandiose scale of a movie. With fantastic CGI sets of such calibre that watching was a treat in itself for strange lands strange cities and strange aliens. I especially loved the fact that each child had issues to work along the way like knowing what's right and what's wrong. To make decisions that could get them into trouble later on but deciding that doing the right thing was far a better cost than to leave someone behind. They got to do an honest days work among aliens instead of sluffing off for a week. They learnt to get along in better ways strengthening their friendships. Plus they learnt how to endure hardships and obstacles which they fended off with early naive skills. Kids do bounce back in many ways and that is to say this movie held a lot of hope to those who do not have it. To some others who just watched it for detail it is sad to see such narrow views about story lines. I thought this one had every element of the human condition.This wasn't about SPFX it was about what is right and wrong. What is good and bad. Kids have a sense of being that no other can understand and it is too childish to say it had no maturity. Yes it is a movie for kids about kids. Nothing more. Yes the SPFX were fantastic but what was important through the grand scale environment was the kids had to save a friend. Dealing with problems at home in school with time off or finding a rabbit.My view is the movie held all aspects of being human in an inhumane world. I give it ten of ten stars. Extremely recommended to those aged 9 and above. For the little ones who believes in heroes not computers.";

This film had an interesting and slow beginning which left you wondering what this movie was about. There was a strange conflict at the start between some fantasy creatures which was short and quick and then opened into an extended bucolic Japanese family scene in the countryside centered on the life of a few school kids. Then surprise the kids are transported into space on a galactic adventure which literally boggles the imagination and leaves you glued to your seat. But the movie goes on too long. About 35 to 40 minutes too long. The film makers should not have tacked on the Star Wars type mini adventure at the end. It was overkill it was not needed really. But like I said it is the most imaginative anime I have ever seen. And I just know there was a ton of animators and art students in tonight's audience.

But as good to the movie there are some good lessons and morals to be learned from this movie. What really was stupid was that in the English dub they used the word Dollars as money instead of Yens. I am pretty kids aren't stupid to the point that they wouldn't know what are Yens Pounds Dollars Euros and Rupees and which countries they would work in. When I watched the trailer I wasn't too sure but when i actually watched the movie i enjoyed it plus some of the characters are actually stronger then they look. For example Natsuki Koyama look pretty week and scrawny but in a fight between her and a TZ33 looking droid she could hold her own and actually push against his force. Overall good movie though there are some stupid scenes.".

	schema:reviewBody "Welcome to the Space Show by all means not a bad family movie but it definitely is not a great one either. I am sure it can be very appealing to kids who have the patience to sit through it without being bored with its lack of action for the most part and it sure will amaze any parents who watch it for its interesting depiction of the alien civilization.The premise of the movie is a standard one. Some kids go on holidays alone on a rural area and meet an alien dog who agrees to take them on a trip through space. During the trip the kids must adjust and even work hard in order to overcome setbacks which delay the trip and their eventual return home. It has indeed its share of showing how little children need to work together use their skills make mistakes and learn from them as means to open their minds to a whole new world that lies beyond their simple lives. It has adventure comedy sparks of drama and mystery and even has a very actionbased finale with a cosmic threat that arose because of their presence. On paper it looks fine to follow through.Of course being a movie for the family eventually means that a lot of things make no sense or even feel off. For example in the beginning of the film the parents leave their kids to go alone for several days in the middle of an unpopulated and uncivilized area. Their ages are simply way too small to accept that. I mean what kind of a parent would let his kids go camping without adult supervision? All the mothers in my village wouldn't let us get to the swamp next to us without experienced hunters or fishermen as guides and trainers and these ones just LET THEM GO ALONE??? Even if they are to learn new things who is going to teach them or help them if something goes wrong? This is the wilderness for Pete's sake it is not the back alley of your neighborhood. Hell even most back alleys are dangerous. And as you imagine something did go wrong and they go jettisoned in the far corners of space.As for what follows it is still not exactly mindboggling either. The kids go to several alien worlds and interact with whatever creatures and environments exist there. It all looks spectacular but doesn't take more than three seconds to realize that the aliens despite claiming to be a far more advanced civilization than Earth's are still practically nothing more than 21st century capitalists themselves. They have fast food identical to ours kindergartens identical to ours mechanics mailmen merchants television MONEY heh proof of how they are not civilized at all and generally despite the fancy alien exterior this is nothing but a typical urban society. They could have gotten on the city near their home and it would make no difference. This again doesn't help you to enjoy the movie as nothing more than a mediocre road movie where the dull sceneries simply have more colors and polygons than usual.As for the plot itself the kids pretty much need to earn money in order to find a way home thus they need to work in areas their skills work best. Is it me or does this translates to CHILD LABOR? Which is kinda immoral? Or is it OK for the so called advanced aliens to create workers from the age of five? And seriously it is all about money and wealth? And hold on a second one of the kids has an Earth plant which to them is a most rare and addictive drug. And they actually make money by selling drugs to bystanders??? OK this is simply crossing the line.So this movie is practically about a group of kids taken by a stranger to a city where they need to work for money and sell drugs all means to learn about the magical and advanced world that exists out there YEAH RIGHT! The could have done the same in any ghetto for all I care. Or China. This is definitely not Walt Disney material. This is something along the lines of teaching the child audience the basics of capitalism. And since the pampered kids won't get it and the videogame0addicted ones will already know it this movie is nothing but vanilla in a fancy wrapper. It looks gorgeous with those really cool production values of its plus the kid voice actors really did a great job to pass as natural. Other than that nothing. This is not a magical setting to make your innocent mind go traveling to fairylands. It is almost vicious! Maybe it can be seen as camouflaged hard realism and a sign of the times we are living in where ideals went under and it is all about that printed piece of paper called money. That still doesn't feel like it should be a family movie. Why not some sort of teen adventure where the themes would fit better? I sure wouldn't want any kids to watch this and get funny ideas about making money.The finale of the movie is otherwise trashing even that weird feeling it was going for. Out of nowhere space villains appear and try to create some sort of universal change and there is a battle to be fought or something. WHERE DOES THAT FIT IN ALL THE REST? Once again I fail to see what that has to do with the whole idea behind the movie other than proving again how even the aliens are just capitalists with green skin and four arms. In all I wasn't thrilled with this movie. Not only its themes were notforchildren in a children movie but its plot was also unimaginative and ended expectable.".

	schema:headline " Autobiographical sensorium";
	schema:reviewBody "This tale of Oedipus starts off and ends in the twentieth century though for the most part is set in a primitive version of ancient Greece. There is not much rational connection between the stories but Pasolini manages to forge himself a free pass on that one. Whilst the Oedipus Complex theme of the first story is meant to be taken quite literally and is basically autobiographical the middle story recognisably Sophoclean is more in my opinion meant to be about an angry confused man who cannot stomach his fate nor confront truths about his identity. As both sections do genuinely feel autobiographical they knit together just fine.The first section of the film set in the 1920s is the best piece of filming I have seen from Pasolini and made me really excited. There's a wide open scene of children running off around a playing field on a hot piercing day one of those thick childhood days when the emotions battened down the hatches on squire intellect. I was reminded very much of an Edith Sitwell poem Green Flows the River of Lethe  O I stood near the Cities of the Plains  And the young girls were chasing their hearts like the gay butterflies  Over the fields of summer   O evanescent velvets fluttering your wings  Like winds and butterflies on the Road from Nothing to Nowhere! The sentiment all the more surprisingly apt given that the second part of the film is shot in what could be the ruins of Sodom and Gomorrah the Cities of the Plains for all we know.The rage of Oedipus which occurs frequently in the movie could be liked to another part of the poem But in the summer drought  I fled for I was a Pillar of Fire I was destruction  Unquenched incarnate and incarnadine  I was Annihilation  Yet white as the Dead Sea white as the Cities of the Plains  For I listened to the noontide and my veins  That threatened thunder and the heart of roses. Part of Pasolini's drive for shooting the films seems to be to continue his fascination with ancient buildings and ruins which he demonstrated three years earlier in his superb 1964 documentary The Walls of Sana'a for which he travelled to Yemen.The end of the playing field scene features Jocasta suckling Oedipus. She gazes directly at the camera and thus the audience for a long period in which she goes through a range of emotions including what could be arousal followed by disquiet which ultimately turns into a distanced understanding. For me this is cinematically equivalent to the Mona Lisa which is also a gay man's meditation on his mother greatly cryptic yet provocative set in against a natural backdrop.Silvana Mangano who plays the mother in both parts of the movie and would star in Pasolini's Teorema the following year carries a lot of it. Her beauty her alabaster skin and wispy eyebrows her perfectly tangled plaits which would send Fuseli to his knees are commanding. She has an artistic skill that eclipses that of Franco Citti Oedipus and Ninetto Davoli Thebes' crier quite totally. Franco Citti's lack of skill whilst occasionally infuriating in the context of the story his is not the demeanour of a king do however lend the film a level of authenticity given the primary motive of this sequence which was to demonstrate a pained adolescent fury and denial which was ignorant at its base.There's an unusual device of writing characters' thoughts in black lettering on a white background which doesn't quite work but which would be far better than the presumable alternative of camerafaced soliloquies.Some of the locations in the movie felt truly dreamlike to me for instance the unkempt walled piazzagarden of Jocasta the crumbled ruin where Oedipus meets a naked adolescent girl on his peregrinations the mountainous areas between cities.The props in the movie are cheap and fantastical but quite brilliant the windblown hands on the milestones to Thebes the quite bizarre head gear of the Pythoness the soldiers and King Laius. Modern producers who delight in throwing money at movies please note how Pasolini achieves far better results with great economy.Cultural references abound my favourite being the Japanese music which doesn't seem to have been referenced anywhere there are no closing credits in the movie but sounded very much like the Toru Takemitsu scores of Ansatsu Assasination Woman in the Dunes and Harakiri.The story in a strict narrative sense has problems Citti doesn't convince as any type of king or warrior giving the appearance of not understanding his lines at some points and the suicide of Jocasta makes no sense in the wake of her discussions with her son. It is a movie where feeling rather than thinking brings greater rewards.".

	schema:headline " The story of Oedipus told in comedic violent and surreal vignettes";
	schema:reviewBody "Pier Paolo Pasolini's Oedipus Rex is a relatively faithful adaptation of Sophocles' Greek tragedy Oedipus the King. Beginning in 1920's Italy a baby boy is born and is instantly envied by the displaced father. The setting then changes to ancient times where a baby boy is being carried out into the desert by a servant to be left out to die from exposure. He is eventually picked up by a shepherd who takes him back to the King and Queen of Corinth who adopt the youngster and love him like one of their own. The child grows up to be Edipo Pasolini's frequent collaborator Franco Citti an arrogant youth who wishes to see the world for himself. And so he set out on the road to Thebes the place of his birth.Plagued by a prophecy that dictates he is destined to murder his father and marry his mother Edipo is a tortured but intuitive soul. He murders a rich man and his guards after they demand he clear a path for them on the road and later frees a town from the clutches of a Sphinx by solving its riddle. Staying true to his own recognisable style Pasolini tells the story of Oedipus not with a sweeping narrative but through a collection of comedic violent and often surreal vignettes the most bizarre and ultimately thrilling being the scene in which Edipo murders the guards. He runs away from them as they chase him before charging at them one by one and cutting them down. It's a moment without any real motivational insight offering but a glimpse into Edipo's damaged psyche.PostFreud the story of Oedipus cannot be experienced without reading into the incestuous and patricidal undertones. But these themes are less explored by Pasolini than the idea of Edipo being ultimately responsible for his own downfall. Rather than the inevitability of fate Edipo creates his own path committing murder on a whim and marrying while blinded by ambition. For a bulk of the film Pasolini keeps the audience at arm's length favouring his own brushes of surrealism over a traditional narrative. While this may be occasionally frustrating  the prewar scenes than bookend the film seem out of place and confusing  Citti's wideeyed performance is a fantastic distraction and the Moroccan scenery helps provide a ghostly Biblical atmosphere as well as a beautiful backdrop.".

	schema:headline " Oedipus the Psycho";
	schema:reviewBody "Pasolini's Oedipus Rex is a crazy brutish parade of primitivism psychosis and weird headgear  the play as Sophocles himself might've mounted it were he under the influence of some strong hallucinogen. This is one of Pasolini's favorite pastimes the staging of old literary works as nutjob pageants suffused with a genuine feel for the random craziness of ritual the sense of people adorning themselves in keeping with impenetrably bizarre superstitious imperatives. The array of outlandish headwear in this movie would be enough for a museum  threefoottall cylindrical gold crowns helmets composed of curved iron segments dangling from the brim of a saucershaped hat garlands of woven straw worn not horizontally around the skull but vertically ringing the face. Even the Oracle of Delphi gets in on the act sporting a tall snowmanshaped potterymasklooking contraption with a sprig of vegetation sticking out the top. It's as if ancient life were nothing but one big act of headwear oneupmanship.The play survives intact despite Pasolini's oddball preoccupations. The director's favorite CroMagnon thespian Franco Citti portrays the hapless Oedipus while the formidable Silvana Mangano tackles the role of Jocasta Oedy's selfabsorbed motherwife. The melodrama plays out with all its earthshaking inevitability following Oedipus from foundling to patricidal loon to incestuous king to blind wandering fool Pasolini staging the action so bluntly so rawly that we could be watching an ancient performance captured by curious aliens with moviecameras. The acting as usual is variable. Citti a physically striking if technically inept actor creates an Oedipus who seems completely free of snappy psychological accoutrement  an Oedipus who is quite literally an overgrown child. As Jocasta Mangano displays the kind of subtle technical command that Citti utterly lacks but doesn't have enough scenes to really bring forth a character Pasolini uses her mostly as an embodiment of overwhelming feminine presence much as he did Maria Callas in Medea the companionpiece to Oedipus. There's very little that's subtle about the way Pasolini attacks the central psychological issues of Oedipus the stuff that has made for one psychiatric treatise after another since the days of Freud. The emotions are splashed all over the screen in typically unrestrained Pasolini fashion. Oedipus is a ranting lunatic the scene where he kills his father Laius the King of Thebes is a homicidal tantrum to make Travis Bickle blush. Citti is not a commanding enough actor to give his scenes any real melodramatic weight but this doesn't matter given that Pasolini is less interested in melodrama than he is in conveying the idea of psychosis as a kind of universal human condition. This is not Oedipus the grand tragic figure this is Oedipus the psychopath. There is little in this character that could be described as redeeming  he's a cowardly childish mindlessly violent hypocrite. He wears a false beard to show that he's a false king and after he blinds himself so he will no longer have to look upon the horrors he himself has been guilty of unleashing Pasolini transports him to the modern world for a sort of ironic coda that like the central juxtaposition in his semimasterpiece Porcile makes explicit his point about modern humanity's inability to escape its own primal urges.This isn't Intro to Greek Literature Sophocles it's a mining of Sophocles for the kind of brutishness that turns Pasolini's crank. The question one must ask again is How the hell does Pasolini get away with it? Why does the kind of material that would seem the stuff of exploitation and rank tastelessness in another director's hand become in Pasolini's the stuff of primitivemodern art? There's nothing particularly beautiful in the images except for the savage beauty of the prehistoric settings. There's almost none of that highculture flush that symbolists like Fellini and Bergman were able to give their filmbuffcoddling masterpieces. The secret must be in Pasolini's straightforwardness his complete lack of moral pretense. He's one of the few directors I can think of who could get away with turning Oedipus into an example of humanity's inherently psychotic nature and still not come across like a highminded putz. He tears Oedipus Rex down from the realm of stodgy highculture and reenvisions it as a cry of psychopathic rage set in a world as inscrutable as the mind.".

It combines beautiful and fascinating poetic color visuals unusual landscapes and locations with the classic story of Oedipus.The story is told with very little dialog subtitles for the dialog where present and this enhances the internal primal feeling of the piece. Pasolini was often compared to Fellini but I feel he is much better because he uses his visuals always to advance and to the purpose of the story. To me Fellini's visuals were often purposeless antic oddity. Here any ambiguity is not in the story but in character motivation which lends modern reality and immediacy to the whole.The acting style combines the classic Greek use of stylized mannerisms and mask work seamlessly with smaller modern film acting. The setting transitions from 1960s Italy to a primitivetribal landscape which lends itself beautifully to the timelessancient feeling of the Greek story. An example of detail tribal body painting is used to represent both a ritual queen in shades of Elizabeth R to the whiteness of a plague death the costume designs are a combination of rustic and EgyptianPapal religious.Cast mainly with little known actors the big name actor in this film was international star Alida Valli who has only two or three brief scenes. Her talent is fairly wasted here but her presence is riveting as the aging childless queen. Valli A brilliant Italian actress who had a brief career here in the 40s50s then returned to ItalyEurope and balanced her commercial work in slashers with more oddball artistically challenging work. Her work often embodies excess within control the dichotomy of superficial clam with seething internal emotion. PARADINE CASE THE THIRD MAN THE MIRACLE OF THE BELLS CASSANDRA CROSSING EYES WITHOUT A FACE SENSO WALK SOFTLY STRANGER. This film is the kind of work I would hope to be a part of as an actress and artist.

The scene in which Oedipus kills three Roman guards is one of the finest tapestries of tension and viscera in cinema. The acting isn't worth mentioning this film is Pasolini's triumph. It is mainly a triumph of striking and occasionally nauseating imagery. The shifts in time periods are rather tacky and simplistic in retrospect they are done so gracefully though. The conclusion is pulled together with beautifully written dialogue that only Paolo Pasolini could deliver. The film is not one that is easily forgotten and is sure to be remembered for a long time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Sophocles' Oedipus Rex is adapted well for the foreign screen. Pasolini better known for the controversial Salo 120 Days of Sodom has kept the intensity level to a minimum while still presenting the perverse qualities for which he would be known for. If you don't know the story like who doesn't read the play before seeing the movie  there tends to be a shortage on literature freaks these days. Beautifully filmed Oedipus Rex begins in modern times continues sometime BC and finally ends back in the 20th century thus presenting a sociological thesis for the viewer. The acting is a bit hammy seeing Oedipus with a mad streak can be over the top although the characters are developed well and recite their lines as if on stage. My only complaint is the subtitles seem to blend in with the scenery  white subtitles against a white background. Therefore this flaw makes it difficult to enjoy some scenes and Pasolini's poetry is usually superb. Nevertheless it's still a great film and is worth a look especially by people with preconceived hatred for Pasolini's later work and there's definitely a lot out there.".

The editing is rough some of the actors just seem to walk through like Silvana Mangano as Iocasta others like Pasolini himself as Oedipus seem in a constant manic state. You have to look fast to see Alida Valli as Merope but her performance is the one I remember with the most pleasure. The camera work is unrelentingly stark to the point of boredom. And why in the name of Pete that modern bookend at the beginning and the end? No sense at all to it unless Pasolini is trying to say this is a story for all ages but heck I already knew that.The story as Pasolini tells it follows Sophocles fairly well with touches taken from Homer but he doesn't mind going off on his own once in a while. If there is anyone who doesn't know the story don't read any more until you have seen the film there's an excellent DVD. In Sophocles after Oedipus finally realises he has killed his father and fathered four children with his mother as his wife he blinds himself. Pasolini leaves us there by going back to his modern conclusion. Actually in the legend his two daughters Ismene and Antigone subjects of another play by Sophocles guide him on his way to Athens where he ultimately dies. I wish Pasolini had at least given us a glimpse of the girls and this journey. Oh well just call me a philistine who doesn't appreciate real art.".

	schema:reviewBody "It really helps when you know the myth of Oedipus. You understand the story much better and can more easily follow the stages of madness of Oedipus.For Greeks it was not a dishonor to make fun of their Gods as many did in comedies. But it certainly was a dishonor not to recognize their power. The Gods were so powerful for the Greeks that they could tell you their horrific prophecies and you would still have the same fate despite this. I think the work really encapsulated all of Greek theatre in it. There were people in masks and crowds representing the chorus that in a hidden way was the protagonist narrator of the story back BC. There was a protagonist in his hero's journey and the story was practically the same.One difference was how Pasolini blended the modern times with the antiquity of Greece. Truly amazing how the film starts and end by the same sequence spinning around looking up at the treetops and end with the finite horizon of the green valley. This shows that even though the times have changed and now instead of carriages people travel in cars and even though Oedipus is not truly blind nothing has really changed. It's the same journey in the hero's head.This also very strongly links with Pasolini's Porcile Pigsty for me. The same combination of modernity and antiquity to begin with however there the world is parallel. I would even go as far as to say that Julian was none else but Oedipus. He says he killed his father ate human flesh and is still full of joy. So was Oedipus. He was full of joy at the end when he was blind couldn't see anything and wanted to hear nothing he didn't belong in this world.Another striking similarity is the carriage that appears in both these films. There is a certain irony in that too because in Porcile there are three women following the carriage instead of men but still nothing is different. And Julian still kills his father that is what his modern self is referring to. And when I was reviewing Porcile I wasn't sure what the pigs represented. But now I think I know. The pigs are the chorus the Gods or the society. The pigs are the silent narrators of the story yet again.The portrayal of modern man in both those films is very similar too. He's lost as if he lives in the past reality and is consumed by the business of the modern world. Deep inside he is still the same man the same hero undergoing the same journey. The boy is not actually eaten by pigs but rather hung from the cross in Porcile. And Oedipus truly does lose his sight despite having eyes. There is even a certain feeling that fate is truly predisposed before a child is even born.Another motif in both those films was the musical instrument. In Procile father of Julian plays the harp that seems to be controlling the world with his Nazi German magic wand. In Rex Oedipus plays the reedpipe and I noticed that the sound of this reedpipe recurs through the entire movie many times. It's like all those people are music that a god or gods control and they don't even know about it.Overall a really cool film I liked most of the things about it.".

Yet the emotion is here thanks to the charm and subtle portraying of Nathalie by Marie Gilain the rest of the cast is very good too. The great strong point of the movie is to smash every clich about violence in modern society. Tavernier does a kind of movie about movie viewers the youngsters watch a De Palma's Scarface video over and over and in the French reality violence is not exciting not graphic not choreographic only real... The characters are even able to close their eyes on their own violence very efficiently as if nothing really happened while it's possible to avoid it's consequences... This kind of modern approach is really hard to achieve unless the directing is really good and many bad directors tend to use the same tricks such as hand held camera etc... some other can't help emphasizing too much on the darkest aspects of the human nature but here on the contrary there's a positive energy that flows from the characters which makes the meaning so ambiguous and interesting and as for the directing the free but controlled camera moves and the general pace of the movie gives it an elegant style which serves the script.".

	schema:headline " Protracted Triangle Love Story";
	schema:reviewBody "This romanticcomedy was shown at the 35th Hong Kong International Film Festival recently and the big deal among the media was that the movie was in Mandarin instead of the usual Cantonese. Obviously an attempt by the filmmakers to penetrate the Mainland boxoffice. For viewers elsewhere however Don't Go Breaking My Heart will probably be a longdrawn meetcute and actcute love triangle that stretches for almost two hours.Thankfully the movie somehow manages to maintain its charm even if it looks contrived and phony throughout the proceedings  thanks to the chemistry of the three leads.When the movie opens we find Zixin Gao Yuanyuan getting dumped by her boyfriend Terence Yin who is married. We can understand her subsequent caution with men especially when she tries to recover from this heartbreak that makes getting rid of her past those photos gifts and even a pet frog rather difficult. Helping her to turn over a new leaf is a street drunk named Fang Daniel Wu who is actually a disillusioned architect. Fang helps Zixin 'get rid' of her exbeau's minibar collection and even take cares of her ugly pet frog while she helps him get back to drawing.Zixin is also attracted to Cheng Louis Koo a fund manager who works in the building opposite her office. She watches him through the glass wall daily and they 'communicate' by sticking PostIt notes on their respective windows. Soon Cheng a playboy at heart takes over the troubled company she works for  and starts wooing her in earnest. Will she forget Fang the friend waiting in the wings or will she keep a promised date with him? Ultimately the big question is who will she pick Cheng or Fang? It takes a long long time for Zixin to decide  and the title is rather apt. Having had her heart broken Zixin is definitely going to break the heart of one of her suitors. We are kept guessing which one. This is the most demanding role yet for Gao Yuanyuan and it is evident that she has what it takes to be the leading lady. She makes us root for Zixin throughout the movie even if we find her indecisiveness irritating.Koo and Wu are veterans in their role and they pull it off easily. However Koo's Cheng seems rather implausible. The writers have gone overboard having Cheng buy an apartment and a Maserati car as gifts for a girlfriend at a time when the economy during the 2008 downturn calls for prudence and accountability. Wu is the more pathetic of the two and his Fang even cooks! Chalk these up as the filmmakers' attempts to wow the women in the audience. This chick flick makes for an entertaining date movie though. limchangmoh.blogspot.com".

My summary line offers another angle  watching this romcom flick is very much akin to watching a tennis match. Using everything they know about the game the two players take alternative service games vying for the ultimate prize the woman of their heart's desire. With delightful twists and turns the match culminates in a cliffhanger of a tiebreaker.One thing you do not expect too much from a romcom is unpredictability. The Jonnie TO and WAI Kafai veteran teamup however sprinkle their work as usual with unpredictability not the kind of convoluted twists you find in a mystery thriller but enough to keep the movie interesting. At the start it would seem that the financial tsunami of 2008 features significantly in the plot but soon it is apparent that it is only a plot element that is discarded as soon as its purpose is served. The woman meets the two suitors separately just as the global financial trouble is about to reach a meltdown. She soon loses contact with both of them. Three years later when the financial world is well on its way to recovery she meets them again. That is when the match starts in earnest. Nothing more needs to be said about the plot. Just a few words on the triangle.GAO Yuanyuan playing a financial market analyst brings with her a touch of the smalltown girl simple charm from Qing Hong Shanghai dream Cannes Jury Prize winner in 2005 making her otherwise rather bland character very likable. Louis KOO gets an almost customized role by profession a financial executive by nature a bad guy the sort that invariably has a magnetic attraction for nice girls waving his motto like a protective force field 9 guys out of 10 are womanizer and the 10th is considering the prospects. He is certainly not no. 10. But at least he is honest about it from day one. Playing the polar opposite no. 11 you might say rival is Daniel WU a successful architect and the perfect guy in every girl's dream.

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Don't Go Breaking My Heart";
	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit there was a little bit of apprehension going into the movie because Johnnie To's recent effort Linger continues to linger in my mind as one of the worst romantic films seen in recent years. No doubt I'd prefer To's gangster flicks but sometimes market forces and demand dictates opportunity that cannot be passed over. So with his usual Milkyway crew and regular cast such as Lam Suet Louis Koo and Daniel Wu To and frequent collaborator Wai KaFai make another attempt at the romantic genre with this film that proves thankfully to be notches up from Linger.And perhaps one of the positives coming out from the film which aided in its enjoyment was the fact that the language track was left unmolested here by the powers that be. It's in a smattering of Cantonese Mandarin and some English which in all likelihood reflects the cosmopolitan nature of Hong Kong society with its foreign base from the occasional Indian Caucasian and of course the influx of Chinese from Mainland China. In the past all utterance of spoken Cantonese would have been dubbed over so this is yet again another small but successful push of the envelope in our local cinema scene.One of the two opening films at this year's Hong Kong Film Festival Don't Go Breaking My Heart tells of a love triangle between three characters brought about by the indecision of the girl Zixin Gao Yuan Yuan who journeyed from Suzhou to Hong Kong to follow her boyfriend find herself being dumped and becoming the object of affection of both a drunkard bum Qihong Daniel Wu and a selfmade finance industry CEO Shenran Louis Koo. Her budding relationship with Qihong comes from the latter saving her from an accident while in her post dumped delirious state and becoming the surrogate owner of her exboyfriend's frog. Qihong soon disappears for the most parts of the first hour and here's when Shenran becomes her target. Yes you heard that right because the lass does what you can do in today's Internet age and discovers he's a mighty fine catch with the kind of money in his possession.Set about the time of the Lehman Brothers debacle Shenran becomes Zixin's boss and a relationship with a subordinate is nothing to frown upon having to fast forward their relationship through the throwing of a Masserati and a luxury condo penthouse at Zixin. Impressed her mind's almost made up if not for the reentry of Qihong into her life now reborn into a new lease of life going back to the architectural profession he turned his back on in an office located opposite Zixin's. And this is perhaps one of the brilliance of the story with the trio able to engage in romantic shenanigans through their office windows and this is something that is extremely plausible given the close proximity of buildings in Hong Kong that Singapore too is emulating given our scarcity of land and exorbitant office rentals.Is the modern relationship defined by material wealth with no money being having no honey? It certainly seemed so in this romantic tale where Zixin doesn't even bat an eyelid at Qihong at first given his bum like appearance and lack of prospects and her obvious delight when discovering Shenran is an alphamale who rock climbs and having riches beyond her wildest dreams. And even though Shenran's been proved a playboy and a cad time and again with the amount of cleavage that he can't take his eyes off from leaving him becomes that impossibility given the opportunity costs that goes along with it. As for Qihong's he's a little bit of a softie and a nice guy that tries really hard to get the girl being that sentimental man hanging onto every sliver of memory from the past taking care of a frog for companionship and the perfecting the art of cooking mussels from a restaurant that he shared a meal with Zixin once.What made this film work is the chemistry amongst the trio that while you may not like their characters they're made believable through the actors' performances except perhaps for parts when you know Zixin's behaviour in the real world would lead to her being fired from her job. Lending supporting star power are JJ Jia as Qihong's assistant and Shenran's temporal dating distraction and Lam Suet this is Milkyway after all as the atypical office kaypoh to provide some much needed comic relief as the film propels toward the third act that relied on plenty of cheesy moments to try and wrap it all up. But being made for the Chinese market would mean toeing a very conservative development and providing that air of affluence to target trap its intended audience  overnight roundtrip flight from Hong Kong to Shanghai anyone?At least the film had the courage to resolve this messy triangle unlike its Hollywood counterparts which would opt to keep things ambiguous or open ended just because. But having to come to a decision was a long drawn effort that bloated the runtime to close to two hours and an abrupt ending that didn't do much justice to one of the characters having just shown a purposeful change that made it more like an act put up instead. However this is a romantic comedy meant as a date movie with Hong Kong providing most of the backdrops in which stories get told though with the Milkyway brand I was half expecting some form of thuggery to appear in a shoot them up.".

This is the first Johnnie To movie that I watch that is not an action movie. Its a romance and he did it really well with his best friend forever Wai Ka Fai. Many people said that this story is kind overrated because of the complex feeling of the female lead character Gao who is kind of messyweird and unbelievable. She have big problem with her love life because she just want a man who only looks at her not other woman not even a glance. That's why at some part we find that her character is so irritating but the good thing this movie have is the fair love triangle. There is no bias here like any other clich romance. Both man's character developed really well until we feel hard to root to any of the 2 man. It make me feel like she just need to choose both because both of them are the best. But what we can do she can only choose one. So just enjoy it fun romance from Johnnie To!".

Don't Go Breaking My Heart does succeed in constructing a romantic triangle and a couple of laughs to go along the way but as far as being realistic it is not.Gao Yuanyuan plays Cheng Zixin the female in the love triangle along with Louis Koo as Cheung ShenRan and Daniel Wu as Fang Qihong. In this world that the movie constructed ShenRan is an affluent CEO of an investment company that operates in the building opposite Zixin. After noticing her on the bus and seeing her have an incident with her horrible ex he later tries at work to cheer her up by sticking a smiley face post it note on the window for her to see. This works and they begin to communicate across buildings visually.Concurrently after Zixin's incident on the bus she was distraught and walked through the streets without noticing her surroundings. Just as a car was about to hit her Qihong saves her. They part ways with Qihong continuing to drink his alcohol. Later Zixin sees him at the supermarket buying alcohol and she proceeds to give him all her ex's things. After selling those things Qihong encourages Zixin to spend the money on herself. At the end of their night Zixin gets Qihong to promise to quit drinking and return to his architectural work.With this stage set the movie progresses to develop the relation between the characters. The actors' chemistry works and situation while corny do seem to work. However it is a little too obvious which guy she should pick so her indecision makes her a little more unlikable as the movie goes along. The fact that it appears she is seduced by money one guy buys her a Maserati an apartment adds some realism to the movie but its not what we want to see in a romantic comedy.There are some comedic bits particularly with Qihong's interactions with the frog and with Zixin's boss.This movie creates a world full of attractive people and money. The men in the movie act like men in the real world lust love etc. but the young females in the movie except Zixin seem to be a little whorish easily seduced seductively dressed.But as a romantic comedy it provides the romance and the comedy.".

Another good thing about this movie is the beautiful scenery during the last scenes at the waterfalls. That said the movie is too long and not all of the scenes work or make sense.

	schema:reviewBody "Contrary to common belief this film actually portrays three consecutive eras of Hungarian historical reality using visually shocking symbolism. The film starts with the final days of fascism where one oppressive extreme gives birth to an other directly opposite on the political scale. Communism was the bastard child of fascism however there was a few years of discontinuity hence the man of the flaming penis getting executed after laying his seed in the pigwoman. Why the flaming penis? Great 'balls' of fire literally enflaming the globe resulting in war of a global scale. The great jizz in the sky and paedophile fairytale settingA self delusion thinking you can 'F' the world and manipulating your own population to further grotesque goals...Here little girl put your hand over my heart. In all reality it was a system that gave the big 'F' to its own people. The second generation is the era of pigboy eating with both hands consuming all he can and more. In historical terms it is what was once labeled as Goulash Communism. After the '56 Hungarian uprising communist leaders made the country the 'Happiest barrack' to avoid more trouble with the ever restless Hungarians. It was a communist style Let the Hungarian eat cake. A nice touch in the film when the eating champion is told ahead that the Soviet will be the first and he himself can be second. Reality was that as long as there is no '56 style open challenge to the system you can have your private Hungarian worldwithin the barrack as you like it. The third generation is the taxidermist making a living out of preppingpropping up the decaying system. In all reality there was no real political change in Hungary following the downfall of communism. Yes communism ended in nominal terms but the same leaders and their cronies stayed and held onto power. Working together with multinational companies the World Bank and IMF they successfully stuffed their own pockets while wrecking the local economy and enslaving the population. If you notice the taxidermist is pale almost bloodless with a fragile sickly body. He lives alone among the stuffed animalsrelics of the past. He is unable to attract the woman he likessociety of alienated individuals. He works out almost fanatical like a hamster locked in a ferriswheelexpand all your energy you will still never get ahead way. He still labours on and feeds his ungrateful fatherthe ever present oligarchs the corrupt system that never ended just got worse with the passage of time. The father fattens up cats kept behind bars but when the gate is left open in a careless moment the cats consume his gut. The symbol of fat cats Bankers are often depicted as fat cats. Here the film comes full circle. It starts with Fascism and ironically the true definition of Fascism is the marriage of state and industry businessin modern termsGlobalism Fascism on a global scale. Political systems on the extreme are ultimately selfdestructing but not before they destroy their host society. At the end the father is prepped with the cats displayed protruding from his gutthe system that literally ate itself. The doctor with the foetus is an abortionist. The tiny foetus still in its embryonic state sports a pig tail. Pigboy and the system he represents is nothing more than a kitschy keychain...the Hungarian population is also one of the fastest declining. The taxidermist preps himself in a 'Statue of David' style and his remains are admired in a futuristic setting by an artsy crowdno future. It is selfsacrifice at the altar of utter helplessness. The missing head and armHis knowledge alone was not enough to save him and his right handhand of righteousness justice itself. All that is left is a stuffed torso in the style of 'David' yet eerily reminiscent of the stuffed scarecrow of OZ. No heart no brain but all the knowledge and feelings of the world. A once great nation a once great people like so many before them are reduced to a sideshow. Hungarians are not alone in this process. We can see the same unfolding in many countries the world over. Western societies are on a long decline as the ebb and tide of expansion and prolonged contraction of societies carries on.Why 9 out of 10? Simply put perfection is a figment of imagination. Here is the long version I feel most of the meaningsymbolism gets lost on people raised on a steady diet of Hollywood and most see the sensationalistic the grotesque the demented and the fantastic without being able to put everything into context. Such people are not able to process the story presented the way it was meant to be. This film is filled with grotesque and disgusting scenes which is both culturally and historically specific. It was the only possible way to depict the full depth of the horror of past eras culminating in the present. Hungarians are disgusted and do think all that is going on is a grotesque freakshow and this is what this film is all about. There are also discreet hungarianisms puns and references that those not living in the culture would have difficulty noticing. At the end such viewers see attention grubbing sensationalism only and either they love it purely for its visual effects or hate it because they find it simply disgusting.".

I found the film to be a deep black comedy with some stomach churning twisted scenes intermixed with beautiful artwork and sophomore characters. Through chronicling the lives of three generations of one family a soldier from the Second World War a sportsman and a taxidermist each is shown to have their own perverse and distorted lifestyle which is cleverly exhibited through among other approaches myriad masturbation excessive gluttony deformation dismemberment and taxidermy. In this film Palfi has created a deviant and anomalous world and via his own talented cinema techniques has managed to depict it in a shrewdly reflective manner i.e. he holds a mirror up to our own. Those familiar with European cinema will be able to reminisce with the many influences on show with some scenes even harking back to Pasolini's epic Salo  this is also combined with many other surreal influences. Some would argue that Taxidermia is a gory violent and unnecessarily eccentric film but it is all necessary in serving its narrative and is not present for titillation purposes  as is so often found in some of the more contemporary European cinema.Generally I feel that Taxidermia tells of a society in which defect sleaze and dishonesty serves its creators own personal vision or goal to further themselves and that this search justifies everything regardless of how twisted or harmful. In addition to this journey Taxidermia presents the audience with some of the ugliest and darkest places of the human mind. Without saying anymore I would even go so far to say that Taxidermia is one of the greatest feats of 21st century moviemaking.".

It is dark and repugnant but very deliberately so. It is not at all selfindulgent although it might seem that at first glance. However 30 minutes into the film one cannot help but realize that all this gore is meant with purpose that this sickening texture of coherence is what gives this satire its peculiar authenticity. L'art pour l'art gruesomeness really gets my goat but in this case everything falls into its right place. Although I got physically sick watching it I have to admit I am an admirer of Taxidermia.We see three generations of men from a strange family an army orderly obsessed with onesided sex his son an acclaimed speedeater and an animal preparator. They are all peculiarly abnormal in their own ways but so is everybody else in the twisted world Gyorgy Palfi has created. But we all know that however deviant a world is on screen it merely is a reflection of our even more deviant everyday life. What Palfi tries to put across is that in our society sick is not even sick any more dementia is not dementia any more and we are ready to accept any defect or corruption of mind as long as they serve the self right in his quest for creating something new something with which he can stand out from the crowd even more.

First off I will wholeheartedly admit that these types of art films aren't my thing. I mainly watched it on a recommendation from a few friends who loved it and since I had no expectations going into it and knowing that these types of films are not really my forte  I can't say I was disappointed so much as unimpressed. I'm sure lovers of the film will say that I didn't get or understand it and that may be true  I just personally found that other than the pretty strong beginning and the bizarre but cool end scene  the rest was pretty much lost on me. Once the film moved into the second generation of the men I was bored and uninterested. People speedeating and purging constantly holds no interest to me so I guess I missed the point. Anyway  if bizarre arthouse films are your thing I wholeheartedly suggest checking TAXIDERMIA out  if not I'd say it's an filmic oddity at best with a few interesting parts...510".

	schema:reviewBody "The first partstory is about a soldierpeasantwhoever who gets erections looking at just about anything. He spies on peasant women bathing and masturbates in his shed. Later on he observes them clandestinely and lustily from his supershed as they muck about in the snow. He notices a small hole in the wooden wall of the house and decides to stick his proud and filthy member inside it. The masturbation starts or is it housescrewing? now there's a real intelligent philosophical dilemma that presents itself for all ye pompousdeluded film students. However the poor schluck doesn't get very far with his sexual shenanigan because a rather bored but grimlooking rooster sees what looks like a wormlike animal to him and pecks it very hard. A rare funny moment. The chronic masturbator emits a loud yowl.But there are more perversions! I've barely even started listing them. Our peasant is apparently also a pedophile as we watch him lose himself in a fanciful fantasy world that involves a fairytalelike house and a girl barely 8 years old. Guess what happens next? Exactly the peasant takes the girl's hand and tells her to put it down there. Cut to HareLippy inside his shed he masturbates to this imagined girl and the director is even kind enough to show us not only his erect penis but also the semen that shoots out of it  all the way towards the nightsky towards one of Earth's nearest stars. Proxima Centauri? Perhaps his semen will start off a whole new worldcivilization of filthyminded attentionseeking Hungarian directors there... Was this Art? Symbolism? Alienation? A metaphor for something similarly stupid and irrelevant? Nah... Just a perverse Hungarian director who probably believes that porn is artistic and belongs in mainstream movies. No wonder of course Hungary is the Metropolis of Europe's porn industry so I guess the least we can expect in any modern Hungarian movie is erections vaginas pedophilia bestiality etc. Oh come on we have to be openminded about such things! The next scene shows the graphic depiction of the butchering of a pig. You might have guessed it already as I had our antihero is sexually drawn towards all of that freshly slaughtered bloody dripping flesh so later that evening he decides to lie on what's left of the porker and  but what else?  fantasizesmasturbates to various peasant women who so constantly provoke him with their large breasts and happy smiling faces. At first it isn't entirely clear whether he is actually having gasp! normal sex with a consenting adult from the same species and of the opposite sex because it appears as if the fat middleaged woman is really there  making her moves on him. But then it becomes clear that it's yet another fantasy i.e. that this movie's director would never stoop so low as to show us too much of sex between mere two humans That'd be too square right? After all the director feels compelled to compete with Greenaway Miike and the like. The next morning the fat woman's husband enters the peasant's shed and blasts his head off with one clean shot to the head. The head dissolves into bits of flying debris some of it perhaps hitting the cameralens. Not sure about that one. Either way the director had already managed to fulfill his Extreme SexViolence Quota  only 20 minutes into the movie. From here on any further filth is merely a bonus for the movie's drooling fans.And more filth there is. What follows is that the fat woman gives birth to a babyboy who has a hahafunny anomaly attached to his derrire a pig's tail. Daddy doesn't seem to be too keen on having a semiporker for a child so he rushes to get a pair of pliers and cuts off the piggytail with boredom almost as if he'd been doing that sort of thing for years.Cut to around 20 years later the second story begins. There is a foodstuffing competition going on in what seems to be a satire of Communist lust for sports glory. One of the morbidly obese competitors we easily recognize as the baby boy from the previous scene on account of the remnants of a small pigtail still bulging out just beneath his lower back. We're somewhere in the early or mid60s. The second part mostly ignores sexual deviation but there's still plenty of vomiting and retarded behaviour as to please even the most jaded fans of socalled shockcinema. As our halfpiggy hero lies in bed his fiance's very hairy armpit hangs over him dripping sweat  right onto his face. He licks it off having obviously been sexually stimulated by it. Later on there is more competitive foodmunching some brief doggystyle sex etc. It's all very stylishly shot but quite unfunny and mostly infantile.The third story features HalfPiggy much older and by now weighing around two tons looking distinctly like a Eurotrash version of Jabba The Hutt. He is immobile spending his time in a dark depressing flat where he stuffs three large cats with food and reminisces of his foodstuffing glory days. He is taken care of by his disappointingly skinny son a taxidermist. In his spare time Junior flirts unsuccessfully with female cashiers and makes plans for turning himself into a stuffed statue. The film fittingly ends with its most disgusting extreme and absurd scene in which Junior taxidermizes himself into oblivion. His empty head gets lopped off the right arm is severed and some time later he is discovered by one of his customers who then proceeds to display this work of art in some trendy museum. He gives a philosophical speech about Junior and this soliloquy is supposed to be very very deep and meaningful. The End.".

But in the end it all feels much ado about nothing. Taxidermia is made up of three parts each representing three generations of a Hungarian family and each generation symbolizing Hungary in the era in which it is set. The first takes place after WWII where a perverted cleftlip soldier masturbates over a couple of cuties who wander about he also shoots fire out of his penis surely symbolizing something but who cares what. He can only lay the local fat woman though and a slaughtered sow. The second generation is represented by a competitive eater. As gross as the first third of the film is the second part was worse for me because it had about ten minutes of scenes where people were vomiting. I can put up with bestialitynecrophilia but vomit is where I draw the line! The third section is almost a relief after the first two the competitive eater's son is an expert taxidermist. His father is still alive looking sort of like Jabba the Hutt and he dominates his son's life angry because his son didn't follow in his own footsteps instead becoming a scrawny little man. The images throughout are certainly intriguing but after a while it all looked like a particularly interesting heavy metal video.".

	schema:reviewBody "Taxidermia is a journeying into a mind we wish not tread a peek into a couple of worlds and the odd lifestyle we wish not observe it is an ugly depraved grossly confrontational film out to upset and induce nausea than tell any kind of story or greatly explore any kind of material. The film ends up an oddly alienating mess an adventurous and ambitious piece with a scrap of an idea at its very core which is gone about in its exploration by placing content up on screen of the most horrid most irritating and most putrid sort more often than not causing us to selfcensor on a number of occasions when we aren't contemplating terminating the filmwatching experience anyway. There is no baselevel toward which the film might stoop there is no bottom of any barrel the film is not willing to have a go at scraping the only thing accessible to keep one sane during the watching of Taxidermia that of being able to recall films of old that have been equally controversial in their content on account of certain directors such as Greenaway or No but films which have been able to incorporate great many degrees of substance to compliment such material.

Balatony Klmn Trcsnyi born at the end of the 1940s segment is a world speedeating champion competitor in rivalry with many others and with his eye on a female champion of said sport named Aczl Stanczel. They in turn create another child a certain Balatony Lajoska Bischoff whom later transpires to be the man that operates within the field of the titular profession in modern day Hungary and whose relationship with his domineering and disgruntled father propels the film's most interesting third for the final act.The extravagant and expansive approach of delving through the generations and progressing things onward a full sixty or so years masks the fact that very little is either actually achieved or that the film actually goes anywhere. The film is ultimately a demonisation of various sinful acts Morosgovnyi's lust getting him into bigger trouble than he would of liked with his lieutenant Balatony's gluttony and pride at what he does having him come to resemble that of a cross between Jabba the Hutt and that large supporting character they had to wheel out on a digger's scoop towards the end of that terrible 1996 film Barb Wire while it doesn't do his wife much good either. His son Lajoska partakes in certain acts later on which in turn comes to represent grotesque inglorifications of wrath as plot developments transpire and the pride Lajoska takes in what he does combines disturbingly with the action he takes born out of narrative revelations. I don't doubt for a second that Plfi answers to no studio executive in the ultimate creative choices his films probably harbour but surely there might have been somebody in and around the project of Taxidermia that on another day would've taken the man aside and just had a word in his ear Really Gyrgy? Really? Do we REALLY need those extended sequences of slicing cutting injecting piercing and stitching on top of all that projectile vomiting?".

The film ends up an oddly alienating mess an adventurous and ambitious piece with a scrap of an idea at its very core which is gone about in its exploration by placing content up on screen of the most horrid most irritating and most putrid sort more often than not causing us to selfcensor on a number of occasions when we aren't contemplating terminating the filmwatching experience anyway. There is no baselevel toward which the film might stoop there is no bottom of any barrel the film is not willing to have a go at scraping the only thing accessible to keep one sane during the watching of Taxidermia that of being able to recall films of old that have been equally controversial in their content on account of certain directors such as Greenaway or No but films which have been able to incorporate great many degrees of substance to compliment such material.

	schema:headline " loyal to his tradition";
	schema:reviewBody "Christ Stopped at Eboli is one of the best movies by Rossi loyal to his tradition of neorealism. The movie depicts isolated ruralpeasant life as an account of an urban intellectual  doctor painter and a political activist who has been exiled to this remote area due to his political dissent during the Fascist rule in Italy. Not like similar movies in lenght Crist Stopped at Eboli constantly absorbs audience probably due to its realist description and selective representation of peasant life which is frozen in time. The film pushes the audience to contemplate on philosophical aspects of the concept of time and it is heavily imbued with the display of social and political problems.Rosi beautifully describes the destitute of the peasant settlers of this remote and isolated land their ignorance and apolitical life the deep rift between these people and state and the irrelevance of the quasicomic victories of the Il Duce to these people among many other social and political issues. Like Rosi's other movies here again neorealist representation goes along with the combination of documentary techniques and fictional context. Rosi lets the images to speak for themselves rather than the Gian Maria Volente who is in the central role in the movie.In the movie as it is in the book the peasant life and urbanity are represented as two alien civilizations and antithesis of each other. These peasants have their own way of life own customs own aspirations and means of joy. What is going on Rome or the war in Abyssinia for regaining the glory of the Rome does not capture their interest. They are aware of the state through the taxes collected or men called for military service. In his letter Levi describes the urban civilization as an antithesis of this peasant life which aspired throughout the history to colonize it.The Christ Stopped at Eboli also pushes the audience to ponder on the philosophical meaning of history its relevance nature and meaning. It describes this peasant life as frozen in history cut from outside life and lacking the understanding of time that we have. History as we understand is the history of urban civilization. As peasants are alien to this civilization they are alien to this concept of time as well. In the village you stop counting days hours as they become more and more irrelevant there you return and base your life on the natural cycle of life which is based on seasons. In this sense the movie challenges our notion of history which is the history of the city.In this sense Christ Stopped at Eboli is very analogous to Y. K. Karaosmano287lu's Yaban. Yaban is also the story of a Turkish intellectual war veteran who abandons amenities of Istanbul for the Central Anatolian village with the hope of finding his roots and alleviating the torments of his memoirs. However to his disappointment he finds himself in an alien peasant civilization where he can not communicate to those people can not be similar to them and can not understand their aspirations. What makes Yaban and Christ stopped at Eboli similar is their approach to dichotomous nature of human civilization and the concept of time. In both novels there is a representation of antagonist peasant and urban civilizations and a relative concept of time. In both novels there is description of life which is frozen in time and alien to urbanity. Indeed the study of Yaban from this perspective can be insightful for the discussions of continuity and change in the History of Mediterranean as Turkey is widely excluded from such studies. However when you read Christ stopped at Eboli and Yaban what strikes you first is the patterns of similarity in peasant life and experience of the intellectuals visiting these places. They can back both the universality of two civilizations argument and lounge duree approach in the Mediterranean area.".

	schema:reviewBody "Carlo Levi an Italian who fought against the arrival of Fascism in his native Torino was arrested for his activities and sent to exile in the Lucania region of the country now known as Basilicata. The hill town of Gagliano was to be his home for the time he had to serve. This was the Italy of the 1930s where the rise of Mussolini and his quest for conquering Ethiopia an ill conceived idea from the start.We watch as Dr. Levi arrives at the Eboli station where he must change to a local train and a taxi in order to reach the hill town which was also the home of other political prisoners. Right after Levi descends from his train at Eboli he sees Barone a dog that has been abandoned and who will become his companion in exile. His arrival in Gagliano causes curiosity among the local folk who see in him a cultured man who sticks out. Carlo Levi observes the people as he takes his daily walks. He can't help but notice how backward everyone seems to him. At the same time he gets to appreciate them because even if they are ignorant of the outside world they are genuine.Levi who had training as a physician receives a visit from his sister Luisa a doctor herself. He comments on the primitive state of medicine in the town a place that boasts two doctors who are ineffective and set in their ways. Levi clashes with the mayor a man who is a devout follower of Mussolini and his movement because the way he wants to censor his communication with friends. After he receives his release Levi is not prepared for the way he made his presence felt among the locals who come to see him off.Francesco Rosi who adapted Carlo Levi's novel is a director with a strong sense of political awareness. He presents the figure of Carlo Levi as a noble man who was helpless against what he wanted to do for the people of Gagliano but the local government was not exactly enthusiastic about his meddling in the local affairs. Where he is able to connect with the populace is with his knowledge of medicine. Carlo Levi also painted the people of the region.Gian Maria Volonte was an actor of quiet intensity. He is in almost all the scenes and he expresses a rage with his eyes. Mr. Volonte was the main reason for watching the film. Since he had collaborated with Rosi before it seemed logical he would portray Carlo Levi in the movies something that he does with ease and elegance.

	onyx:emotionText "Carlo Levi an Italian who fought against the arrival of Fascism in his native Torino was arrested for his activities and sent to exile in the Lucania region of the country now known as Basilicata. The hill town of Gagliano was to be his home for the time he had to serve. This was the Italy of the 1930s where the rise of Mussolini and his quest for conquering Ethiopia an ill conceived idea from the start.We watch as Dr. Levi arrives at the Eboli station where he must change to a local train and a taxi in order to reach the hill town which was also the home of other political prisoners. Right after Levi descends from his train at Eboli he sees Barone a dog that has been abandoned and who will become his companion in exile. His arrival in Gagliano causes curiosity among the local folk who see in him a cultured man who sticks out. Carlo Levi observes the people as he takes his daily walks. He can't help but notice how backward everyone seems to him. At the same time he gets to appreciate them because even if they are ignorant of the outside world they are genuine.Levi who had training as a physician receives a visit from his sister Luisa a doctor herself. He comments on the primitive state of medicine in the town a place that boasts two doctors who are ineffective and set in their ways. Levi clashes with the mayor a man who is a devout follower of Mussolini and his movement because the way he wants to censor his communication with friends. After he receives his release Levi is not prepared for the way he made his presence felt among the locals who come to see him off.Francesco Rosi who adapted Carlo Levi's novel is a director with a strong sense of political awareness. He presents the figure of Carlo Levi as a noble man who was helpless against what he wanted to do for the people of Gagliano but the local government was not exactly enthusiastic about his meddling in the local affairs. Where he is able to connect with the populace is with his knowledge of medicine. Carlo Levi also painted the people of the region.Gian Maria Volonte was an actor of quiet intensity. He is in almost all the scenes and he expresses a rage with his eyes. Mr. Volonte was the main reason for watching the film. Since he had collaborated with Rosi before it seemed logical he would portray Carlo Levi in the movies something that he does with ease and elegance. Others in the film include Lea Massari as Luisa Irene Papas as Giuglia Alain Cluny as the Barone Nicola Rotondo. A favorable impression is made by Paolo Bonacelli who appears as the mayor Luigi Magalone who even when censoring Levi showed a lot of respect for him.The actual filming was done in Aliano an ancient hill town where the real Carlo Levi went to live after the war.

Sometimes these movies get so preachy about a case that end up sounding idiotic looks like they selling something to its viewers. And in the end people who already don't care about the importance of politics in their lives will never understand it how influential this power is. Now what Cristo Si  Fermato a Eboli Christ Stopped at Eboli achieves in its deeper premise is showing how politics have to do with the humblest people of a country and the way it affects them mostly for the bad things since this is a film about Italy during the Fascist regime in the 1930's and 1940's. The main character Carlo Levi Gian Maria Volont is an exiled painter and also a medical doctor who helps the peasants of Eboli a small village to overcome their daily problems by assisting them with some medical treatment since the local doctors don't care about them properly and listening to what they have to say. He's there almost like a prisoner he can't write letters criticizing the government can't read Montaigne can't go outside of the city limits but he has some liberties here and there. And despite being marveled by the simplicity of the peasants life and how things work for them this is a man aware of the politics importance and still seems to quietly fight the Fascism on its own way giving some trouble to the city mayor. In one of the most fascinating moments of the film the poor cause a great commotion in the city hall urging that Carlo must be their doctor something he couldn't do it at the moment since the regime wouldn't allow him.As being an observation to life rather than a dramatic picture this Francesco Rosi's film is quite interesting when it gets to this social theme but it disappoints by going for too long and showing so less scenes are quite distractive long some dialogs are uninteresting and after seeing as a whole the movie didn't work as I expected it was quite meaningless. I like slowpaced films but this is just too much. Volont's performance is very good he's very versatile pleasant the cast is quite good the film is beautifully shot and the locations are wonderful but only that can't make a film better. One scene I'll hope to remember in years to come is the Christmas mass with the drunken priest who lost the paper with his nice speech to later be found with him saying This is a miracle from God. I've found my speech. And what it turns out to be his speech? A denounce against the Fascist. It's a very funny memorable scene. It's not a bad film it's just a little weak. Worths a view for curiosity for its themes and some good elements already pointed out in this review. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film as a part of a Suzuki retrospective in Amsterdam my first meeting with Suzuki not knowing that it is all but representative for his more famous work from 50s60s.The plot of the film is difficult to describe because it is told almost without a cohesive narrative and totally nonlinear and disjointed. I've never seen a film that resembles a feverish dream so closely. Roughly the story is about man confronted by one man a rich businessman and two women a Japanese Geisha and a European who dresses like a Japanese women.Besides the 'narrative' distorted uniqueness which allows the characters to jump from one location to the next or pop up even within the same shot the other interesting aspects of the film are the locations the visuals and intertextual connections. Just to name a few We see the protagonist on a range of different locations in the Japan of the 1920s both in the city as in the countrysides. Also the European woman with her piercing blue eyes and blonde hair only when the moon shines is a fascinating image. Suzuki's use of distorted Japanese paintings as a backdrop and a Noplay performed by children in the final part of the film send shivers down my spine.Although the film drags a bit in the middle I left the theater with a positive if slightly confused feeling. Maybe I liked it because it lacks any form of explicit explanation just like a dream subjects you to an illogical and irrational 'story' that somehow makes sense. It is a film that forces you to leave every sense of western storytelling at the door. Or maybe it was just because it is fascinating to see a film in which every next shot is the complete unknown.".

With Kageroza the source material is a short story by Kyoka Izumi a writer most famous for his idiosyncratic Gothicflavored ghost stories. And indeed this very much captures the spirit of Suzuki's Taisho series.The plot is intentionally obscure and unclear. The beautiful woman Shinako remains unnamed for almost the first half of the film as is her identity as Tamawaki's wife if in fact that is who she happens to be. Some ambiguity is necessary for the story to play out as it does but it is taken an extra step by being purposely vague with identities. Rather than a shortcoming this could be seen as a strength as it would encourage repeat viewings for a deeper understanding not unlike Mulholland Drive or other David Lynch films. According to critic Tony Rayns Kageroza... may well be Suzuki's finest achievement outside the constraints of genre filmmaking. Variety called it a beautiful film and said it was an Orientalized take on Luis Bunuel which is not only complimentary but apt. Still others have compared the film to Luigi Pirandello's theater of the absurd which may be going a bit too far.Arrow Video has released the film on Bluray as part of their Taisho Trilogy set. Though perhaps not as celebrated as Zigeunerweisen there is much to love about Kageroza and the film is worthy of deeper exploration and contemplation.".

	schema:reviewBody "No one has reviewed this gem yet? Wow! This is the fourth WarholMorrissey film I've seen and the only one without Joe Dallesandro. But he isn't missed too much with the amazing talent and storyline given here!Jackie Curtis Candy Darling and Holly Woodlawn the three top drag queen Superstars are three members of PIGs Politically Involved Girls. We see their trials tribulations relationships with men and women their feminist attacks on men and how they all end up wasted and abandoned.Of the three lead actresses Jackie Curtis is my favorite. She knows how to deliver dialogue to make it zing with humor she knows which facial contortions display which emotions and she certainly is a natural comedienne. I had only seen her previously in Flesh and was not impressed by her acting or her drag getup but here Jackie gets a look that suits her and delivers the goods. Candy Darling is a gorgeous willowy blonde the only queen with a chest resembling a woman's and she is just as great as the socialite member of PIGs. She is a lot better than she was in Flesh and gives a starmaking performance. Now Holly Woodlawn was Oscarworthy in Trash and was the main reason why I bought this movie.

Her one good scene her opening scene where she's yelling atbeatinghaving sex with her boyfriend Marty. Other than that Holly is wasted and just plain forgettable. It's not her fault I blame director Paul Morrissey for spending unequal screen time with all three actresses!Women in Revolt has several hidden surprises for Warhol fans. Veteran Warhol actors make appearances but don't live up to their previous performances. Jane Forth is a member of PIGs but how could she top the rich girl in Trash? She has barely any lines and appears in three scenes. Geri Miller another one of my favorites is seen briefly in Lorraine's Bar and has no lines. Shame her voice is cute and so is her personality. Maurice Braddell the old artist in Flesh is Candy's stuckup father. He also isn't as memorable as his previous role. Michael Sklar the welfare worker in Trash plays a sleazy promoter who Candy sleeps with to get a job. He's not too good here. Jonathan Kramer who was one of few Warhol Superstars to appear in Midnight Cowboy as a transvestite is a crummy journalist who humiliates Candy and gets into a fistfight with her! He's great! Martin Kove plays Marty Holly's boyfriend completely in the buff quite a change from his appearance as a comic relief cop in Last House on the Left! Johnny Kemper is Mr. America a male gigolo who conforms Jackie to heterosexuality. I wonder if they were a reallife couple? An injoke is evident when Candy mentions her new movie Blonde on a Bum Trip an actual exploitation movie made in 1968!Overall Women In Revolt is a forgotten Morrissey film but is a whole lot funnier than his Dallesandro films features a better ensemble cast than any of his other films and is itching for a new modern audience to embrace it!".

	onyx:emotionText "No one has reviewed this gem yet? Wow! This is the fourth WarholMorrissey film I've seen and the only one without Joe Dallesandro. But he isn't missed too much with the amazing talent and storyline given here!Jackie Curtis Candy Darling and Holly Woodlawn the three top drag queen Superstars are three members of PIGs Politically Involved Girls. We see their trials tribulations relationships with men and women their feminist attacks on men and how they all end up wasted and abandoned.Of the three lead actresses Jackie Curtis is my favorite. She knows how to deliver dialogue to make it zing with humor she knows which facial contortions display which emotions and she certainly is a natural comedienne. I had only seen her previously in Flesh and was not impressed by her acting or her drag getup but here Jackie gets a look that suits her and delivers the goods. Candy Darling is a gorgeous willowy blonde the only queen with a chest resembling a woman's and she is just as great as the socialite member of PIGs. She is a lot better than she was in Flesh and gives a starmaking performance. Now Holly Woodlawn was Oscarworthy in Trash and was the main reason why I bought this movie. Instead her character here is badly composed and Holly is given little to do throughout the movie!

As most Warhol movies are Improvised...but following a plot..Jackie felt the need to speak all the time and to try and overpower everyone else in the scenes with her...when some of the minor characters spoke Jackie constantly interrupts and delivers her own lines.

There are some interesting Parallels between the Movie and the shooting Andy Warhol experienced at the hands of Valerie Solanas in '68 She was a fierce Feminist creating a manifesto called S.C.U.M. Society for Cutting Up Men and one can  see the apparent mocking of the whole women's lib. movement with Casting three Transvestitesdrag queens to play the Lead women. If this was intentional is unknown  to me but there must have Antifeminist atmosphere at the factory after Valerie. The movie dosen't really touch up on Political issues for too long and like any Movie from the factory is always filled with interesting character's Like Mr. Morrissey says himself it's the character's that made the films. Some of the more memorable moments are  Jackie Curtis having her boyfriend do her nails spraying him with air freshener and then throwing matches at him to speed up his housework having him totally naked with his flabby body exposed adds to his further degradation.".

	schema:headline " A Magnificent Hong Kong movie";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the movies that Tsui Hark's had his hands in and when that happens one can expect a pretty good movie. Tsui Hark is one of Hong Kong's most influential producerdirectors and there is very little that he has not been involved in nor who he has worked with. Many of his movies are of high quality and Shanghai Grand is no exception.The movie is about three people Ding Lik Chung Chung Fey and Hui Kueng. It opens with Kueng on a boat captured by Japanese and he manages to escape where he is washed ashore in Shanghai and found by Ding Lik a dogs body for the local crime gang. When Lik sees the girl he likes Fey kidnapped by the local gang he intervenes and earns himself the gang's enmity.The plot itself is complicated but what it does is that it examines the lives of these three people and how they have become interwoven. We watch the rise of Ding Lik and we what Hui Kueng try to hang on to his life as he has enemies everywhere. I was not really sure who Hui was but the cover of the video says that he was a Taiwanese spy in the Japanese Army the movie is set in the 1930's and that the Japanese are chasing him.Shanghai Grand is really a character study in these three people much like the Killer is a character study as well. The difference here is that the lives of the main characters are heavily intertwined in a way that I won't fully explain least I spoil some parts of the movie. What I can say is that it is a tragedy as are a lot of nonAmerican movies and some American movies are quite tragic but not all of them.".

No this is not a film noir they didn't flesh out the characters and the story and the flat mood went from start to finish.Not recommended unless you're familiar with how this story goes and watching it as a follow up to where the TV series left off or just watching it for Leslie Chung and Andy Lau.".

	schema:reviewBody "Along with Tezuka Osamu Astro Boy Jungle Taitei Hasegawa Machiko Sazaesan Ishinomori Shotaro Kamen Rider Kikaider and Fujio Fujiko Doraemon PaMan Obake QTaro Mizuki Shigeru is among one of the most prolific Japanese manga artists of his time. His Ge Ge Ge No Kitaro manga which debuted in 1959 reintroduced Japanese children and adults to the fantastical spooky and sometimes horrific folklore of the Japanese yokai ghost spirits.The fascinating mythology of the yokai is rooted in Japan's ancient past but was captured by ukiyoe woodblock print artists during the Edo period 16031868 in elaborate colorful and wondrous art which is much sought after even now. Drawing from this rich world of ghoulish and haunting imagery by artists like Toriyama Sekien and Aotoshi Matsui Mizuki created Ge Ge Ge No Kitaro which told the story of a ghost boy born in a cemetery from the womb of his dead mother and who used his supernatural abilities to protect humans from the mischief and torments of other Yokai like himself.Ge Ge Ge No Kitaro proved to be Mizuki's most popular character so much so that the manga series lasted more than a decade in print and spawned five different anime series 19681969 19711972 19851988 19961998 2007 and several movies mostly anime Eigaban versions of the series. There is even a museum dedicated to Mizuki and his creation in the town of Sakaiminato in Tottori Prefecture Japan. The Ge Ge Ge No Kitaro theme which cleverly remarked at how carefree a ghost's life can be is still fondly remembered by adults.Motoki Katsuhide's live action version is just the latest installment to come to light and While all the elements from the manga and anime are here this version unfortunately doesn't have the charm or fun.Pop idol Wentz Eiji one half of singing duo WaT along with Koike Teppei plays the ghostly hero Kitaro. Wentz plays a slightly older version of the character who in the manga and anime is generally supposed to be an eternally young elementary aged kid. From the grey fright wig to the tattered uniform and wooden geta shoes Wentz looks ridiculous. What may have worked in anime doesn't seem to translate well to live action.The movie in fact seemed very much a Disneylike kid's movie with much of the action toned down and more of the slapstick variety than frightening or thrilling.The main story revolves around a young boy Miura Kenta Uchida Yuka and his father's Riju Go possession of a magical talisman that was said to be forged by the goddess Tenko Koyuki and in which housed the spirits of mad Shogun Oda Nobunaga and Christian warrior Amakusa Shiro among others. The talisman was protected by a pack of Bakke Kitsune Ghost Foxes whose leader Sora GitsuneSky Fox Hashimoto Satoshi obsessively wants to retrieve it back so he can use its power to become a god.Wentz makes for a passable if albeit uninteresting Kitaro and his disinterested acting style was more than a bit boring. The pretty Inoue Mao makes for a slightly more interesting character and love interest as Miura Mika but her scenes are too few and ultimately she is relegated to just the girl in peril. Uchida Yuka is a cute kid but he is frankly annoying as Kenta.I was pretty surprised at how silly and cheap some of the costuming and SFXCGI effects in general looked. One can't help but be disappointed considering the missed opportunities at bringing to life Mizuki's unique yokai designs which were so spooky in the manga.When reviewing Ge Ge Ge Kitaro it's impossible to not make comparisons to two other recent films that also dealt with Yokai  Miike Takashi's Yokai Daisensou remake and Shiota Akihiko's Dororo both of which were much better films technically and story wise.Whereas Yokai Daisensou and Dororo succeeded in bringing to life the mythical creatures of Japan like Kappa Tengu and other ghosts the yokai in Ge Ge Ge No Kitaro seem to be just bland maninasuit types and looked much more at home on children's Tokusatsu TV than on the big screen.Surprisingly a number of recognizable Japanese talento stars make guest cameos as various Yokai among which were 'YOU' Koyuki Nishida Toshiyuki Dave Spector Nakamura Shido Kanbe Hiroshi Takeshima Yasunori Fuji Takashi Yanagisawa Shingo and Tani Kei but their efforts don't really save the film and amount to mere interesting and comical diversions from the lackluster story.Kitaro's inner circle of friends and associates was another bright spot. Tanonaka Isamu who has voiced Kitaro's wise father Medama No Oyaji in most of the anime versions once again does the honors here. Oizumi Yo Gamera 2 Udon is hilarious as the treacherous HumanYokai hybrid Nezumi Otoko. Much like Dr. Zachary Smith of Lost In Space his constant scheming and cowardly antics were much amusing. Tanaka Rena Drugstore Gal GTO Tokyo Marigold is also great as Neko Musume the catlike girl friend of Kitaro. Muroi Shigeru Makoto Out as Sunakake Baba and Hazama Kanbei Out as Konaki Jiji were also very good in their roles although they weren't given much screen time.Overall Ge Ge Ge Kitaro seemed squarely geared towards undemanding kids and tweens who just want to watch kid friendly entertainment but to those like myself who were hoping for slightly more edgier entertainment in the spirit of the anime series or other ghost movies like Ghostbusters Ge Ge Ge Kitaro was a bit of a disappointment.".

Unfortunately that's a tough hurdle but since Miike couldn't keep all of his adult perversity out of a kidfriendly film maybe the producers thought there was a chance for them with this one.The art direction is fine and the whole production is decent looking. Unfortunately a few mistakes really pull this movie down. First is the casting of Pop TV star Eiji Wentz for the main role. He seems like a nice guy but brings very little inspiration to the role of Kitaro. Later in the film when he's supposed to be falling in love with the sister we need the other Yokai to verbally inform us that this has occurred since Wentz is unable to convey the emotion at all. However it's probable that the young teen girls who are fans of his couldn't care less how blandly he acts. It falls to the other actors and CG animation to fill in the personality of the film. The film moves along well into the last half where is loses it's pacing and gets boring.Hard to recommend to anyone but Eiji Wentz fans and those familiar with the Kitaro manga.".

Usage of CG to show Ittan Momen Flying cloth was a nice touch.The movie was little rough at the edges as it was the first attempt to bring Kitaro into live action movie This improves a lot on the Millennium Curse. The story tried to tell too much. There's the Yokai kingdom with Oo Tengu as the judge there's Kitaro's friends Neko Musume Konaki Jiji Sunakake Babaa Nurikabe and Ittan Momen and then there's love story between Kitaro and the girl. Things got little bit confusing and the characters didn't get enough time of the day on each of their parts.But the movie was fun to watch and entertaining. I really liked the rendition of Kitaro in this movie. It could have been a real cheese but it wasn't. The movie is recommended as is its sequel. A nice Yokai movie from Japan.".

The live action movie about a world divided into humans and monsters is very Japanese. Unlike an American movie like say The Dark Crystal this stays firmly in the kiddie mode with a little eyeball guy with a body a cat girl and various monsters that are about as monstrous as HR Puffenstuf. The story about a glowing stone or rock being stolen gives way to teaching young kids about right and wrong and a parent's death but anyone could see the happy ending from a thousand miles away. There are some lines an eight year old at least in America just wouldn't understand and since this is aimed at them parents will have some explaining to do at points in the film. I found the Ratman more annoying than the little Japanese boy but most Americans find all little Japanese boys annoying even in Godzilla movies. It's not a terrible movie just a fair rental for children. I would rather watch something like Spirited Away with kids but I wonder what a live action version of that film would be like. Also this might work better in America with dubbed English voices and simpler lines for kids.".

Each of the characters will betray one of those ideals and they will see their lives and relationships come crashing down. But while most of the movie is alienating depressing and leaves you almost begging for some relief it is there you will laugh occasionally in the end there is redemption not in a glorious comeback or victory but in the simple dignity of picking up the pieces and carrying on with a brave face. The train station scene is especially impressive showing the sudden determination and loyalty in the main characters when faced with the ruin of their lives.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERSAfter seeing many negative reviews of the film I was not expecting it to be that great but I'm a fan of some of the actors in the film so I figured I'd give it a go. I was pleasantly surprised but I don't feel my opinion was heightened by lower expectations. I think it was a truly good film overall. There were a few slow areas and scenes which were heavy handed either by director or actor but the main storyline was engaging and easy for most people who have any shred of introspection to relate to.Damian Lewis and Kristin Scott Thomas were excellent as usual. Both stayed admirably true to both of their characters both of whom are a mass of complexities and contradictions under the surface and also appear at the outset to be fairly one sided. I felt that there was a good representation of when you meet someone in real life and know only surface and appearance related info about that person....slowly the story builds as you get to know them and all the facets start to show. and really were perfectly true to their characters.Ben Chaplin plays an old friend with altrustic intentions on a general level but sinister ones where actual lives are concerned. His sudden appearance in a friend's life deception and betrayal are excellently plotted and echo of the very best of Shakespeare. This storyline and performance is a strongpoint.Penelope Cruz as a dying call girl basically recycled her performance from every tragic young woman role she's been in. I didn't really care for her acting save for certain scenes notably the end of her love scene with Sir Ian Holm excellent restrained and poignant as usual in his role as pinched ineffective patriarch. Rhys Ifans was also quite good but I felt the attachment he formed was quite quick and seemed somewhat forced.There was a surprising amount of humor in this film. In particular I found myself laughing out loud at the furtive awkward sex scene between Lewis and Scott Thomas as well as their verbal fumblings as they try to steer their way through a terse bitter marriage.Not surprising but appreciated by me anyway was some of the subtle undertones of the film which is basically about a whole bunch of interconnected people who really have no REAL connections to each other including those who can cast away real connections for the sake of convenience or personal gain. Early on a character who will end up in jail plays the Clash's I Fought the Law and that song is played again in a crucial dramatic scene in the background. Also a cast off hardly worn red dress floats through London from the home of a wealthy seemingly privileged through a charity shop to a woman who wears the dress on her dying night. There's something to be said for the literal visual impact of the red dress being passed between strangers but it also speaks eloquently of the larger issue of fashion and consumerism as a defining factor for some very unhappy people which is a theme in the film as well.All told a well crafted film that only suffered minorly from vague heavy handedness. The acting was excellent and it was most definitely an enjoyable watch. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to connect relate and enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "Renting this DVD in 2010 the film encapsulated the decade of the noughties in all its extreme materialism consumerism and negation of personal relationships. To begin with I thought the film was going to be too depressing and overly precious in style and content but as the themes developed the intricacies and subtleties of character and plot wove carefully into a seamless whole and the result was a satisfying if excruciatingly cynical survey of London society at the beginning of the 21st century. As it is necessarily a work of fiction and not a reality show the characters were allowed their melodrama such as Penelope Cruz playing a prostitute dying of cancer inexpertly 'helped' in her distress by a wonderfully subtle performance by Rhys Ifans as a social worker. Some of the darkest scenes in this dark dark story depicted the state of the social work system and its inefficient uncaring way of managing those in need of the service  a scathing critique worthy of Dickens. In many ways this film worked like a novel  it had a beginning middle and end the structure was deliberate and meticulous the style perfected and the whole brought together by a superb cast of actors. Kristin ScottThomas is to me one of the best British actresses ever she can play any part with subtlety and nuance and express the minutest detail of emotion with a change in her eye expression or a slight movement of her mouth. She is painfully affecting as the ignored and bored wife shopping expensively to no purpose neglecting her son because she has neglected herself feeling frustrated and considering breast implants to restore her selfesteem a knock at the prevalence of cosmetic surgery in present society. Her performance understated with more expression than dialogue presages her Oscarworthy acting in 'I Have Loved You So Long'.Having just seen Damien Lewis in a bravura performance as Alceste on the London stage in 'The Misanthrope'  a brilliant reworking of Moliere's play by Martin Crimp  I could see the origins of what he brought to the character of Alceste in the way he played Marcus in this film. All Marcus really wanted was to play the guitar in a band not waste his life in the corporate world of high legal protection of privileged and corrupt professionals.Ben Chaplin Ralph Fiennes playing himself as usual but effectively Ian Holm and Harriet Walter were all equally good and as the disparate characters weave in and out of each others' lives the ensemble piece comes together in a moving and impressive drama. I was not sure about the redemption ending but maybe Martha Fiennes felt the film was just too deeply dark not to have some kind of cathartic closing. After all Dickens does the same and we love him for that. So you will love this film. Stay with it you will not be disappointed.".

	schema:headline " Wants to be a broad and somewhat epic character study but the result is an alright realistic drama about some individuals we may connect with.";
	schema:reviewBody "I feel as if I should've liked Chromophobia more than I did. It's funny the things that should work in the film's favour actually contribute in it being of the ordinary and unspectacular kind rather than the broad masterful and interesting. These things are the things like the cast in which so many huge names are a part of the production that the film gets bogged down and lost concentrating on them all as if they were all fighting for the limelight. Secondly the multi strand narrative approach works against the film ever so slightly due to the overall concentration. There are times when certain scenes from certain strands are played out and you feel rather immersed in how they'll contribute to the overall piece but the mininarratives will come to a sort of sudden ending and the film will focus on something else that isn't as interesting.The Chromophobia of the title refers to a definition of a piece of art within the film. It's a long and complicated definition that we do not get enough time to digest a tactic director Martha Fiennes uses on purpose to get across the epic and broad feeling she wants the film to have. Chromophobia is the title of the film and the definition of the title reads something like '.....an advanced piece of art that juxtaposes the genre whilst......blah blah blah.' This self recognition and deliberate attempt to tell the audience what they're watching through preachy visual aids is one of quite a few weak points in the film but when the film is weak it comes across as either quite pompous or quite uninteresting.Within Chromophobia are three different strands of groups of people. The most interesting is probably the one involving Gloria Cruz and Colin played by Rhys Ifans in one of his 'Once Upon a Time in the Midlands' roles rather than a 'The 51st State' or a 'Kevin and Perry Go Large' role calmer and more aware. Colin is a social worker that visits call girl Gloria to check up on her and her young child Colin is an excop but he does not carry that rugged look an excop might and I think he is completely misscast. This strand works because it is focused more on characters than actions and reactions it carries a fair amount of antagonism and sexual tension between the two that works quite well on a dramatic level.The film also focuses on victim of the postmodern age housewife Iona Aylesbury ScottThomas and her postmodern home complete with metallic feel and transparent look whilst keeping with her relationship with husband Marcus Lewis and potentially disgruntled son Orlando Tibber. In terms of character she represents the more sensitive study of the film a descent into potential madness with suspicion threatening to dominate her feelings to do with her husband and there is a level of ignorance surrounding her son who clearly has some sort of problem but she doesn't seem able enough to either deal with it or inquire into how to. She is more focused on a matching set of televisions displaying the same image in perfect tandem than the well being of her son's and her own health.I got the feeling that a part of this juxtaposition between whatever it was the quote said earlier on is evident in the early exchanges. The film flicks from the postmodern house mentioned complete with ambiguously diegetic piano music to a rough council estate in a few cuts that I presume was supposed to force us to sit up and take notice. Around this area is where Stephen Tulloch lives and he's played by Ralph Martha Fiennes' brother. The role is perfect for Mr. Fiennes as the passive but eerie in a shifty way guy that doubles up as the villain as seen in Red Dragon. As a contribution to the film Stephen acts as one of the more chilling characters in the piece and makes sure he gets in some Apple Mac. product placement as well Yes it comes with a webcam! but while the paedophilic narrative ideas are there they are underdeveloped and consequently anticlimatic echoing what I said in the first paragraph about how individual situations are played out but come to a premature finish. Through one event or another the scariest or evilest character in the film is placed in a hospital bed for the rest of the film.The other strand involves old buddies Trent Chaplin and Marcus Aylesbury again in a weekend away for shooting and hunting and so forth but Trent being a journalist manages to screw the friendship up through a powerful event that will create ripples for weeks to come. I think in the end there are just too many characters that all pile up and tussle for recognition on the screen. There is so much going on and so many different emotions to try and connect with so many different characters that it borders on overload. We cannot feel empathy or pity towards one person because we know what they're like when they interact with another in another strand and we cannot as human beings evoke various different reactions on demand as the finale rounds things up. The film's heart seems to be in the right place and certain things are pulled off to a decent degree but it remains underwhelming and like I said a missed effort.".

	schema:reviewBody "Enjoy trolling? Enjoy watching people get trolled? Here's your movie. Chronicle stumbled into theaters thoroughly undervalued. Although it does have its flaws it has paved an entirely new route in the wornout genre of superheroes. Chronicle brings all the major superhero questions into playWhere did our powers come from? How should we use our powers? In the end however those questions are irrelevant. This movie is not about three superheroes. It is about three teenage boys who just happen to have super powers.This movie is quite extraordinary. All three of the main actors are unknowns. When the movie begins they all promise to me stereotyped high schoolersthe popular one the outcast and the stoner. As the movie progresses those stereotypes become worthless. These actors were up to the challenge. Each main character changes so much that you won't recognize them from beginning to end. Mix this with the unique storyline and this movie has an extremely strong core.A good deal of this movie is enjoyable simple because it is realistic to life. The bullying is brutal. The type of things that the main characters do with their powers is exactly what I would do. That's the shining point of this movie. It is true to life. It doesn't cover up life or try to smooth it over with simplifications. This movie is beautiful with its honesty. It allows the viewer to laugh hysterically one moment and cringe the next.The problems are minor but still present. The incredible climax is followed up with a lackluster conclusion. The father's character is rather overthetop. I can't tell if it was the writing or the acting that made it so. These two facts won't pull you away from enjoying the movie. It's just too bad that such a good movie would end on such a low note.This movie is worth seeing. Some people will have trouble watching it in theaters because it is a shot from the first person and can be jerky at times. If you are okay with that I would recommend seeing it in the theatre. I saw this movie with a large audiencewhich appeared to add to the experience. For the average Joe this will be an enjoyable movie. For the superhero fan this could be a cult classic.reillyreviews.wordpress.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Chronicle is a found footage film that is similar to Cloverfield The Blair Witch Project and  the infamous  Paranormal Activity series. Those kinds of films mainly Paranormal Activity have a tendency of being awful predictable and nothing but a cheap money grab Chronicle thankfully is different.Andrew Dane DeHaan is a highschool teenager who has decided to make videos of his life. Through these videos we find out Andrew is a total outcast and doesn't have an easy life. Andrew's father is an abusive drunk his mother is dieing of cancer and his cousin Matt Alex Russell barely tolerates him. One day While Matt is driving Andrew back from school Matt urges Andrew to go to a party with him. Matt then pleas Andrew not to bring his camera Andrew doesn't listen. After being punched in the face by a drunk raver the footage then cuts to Andrew sitting outside the party crying. Steve Michael B. Jordan walks up to Andrew and tells him that he and Matt have found something they want him to film. What they find is a huge hole. As Andrew is filming the hole an odd sound is being produced from the inside. Steve Matt and Andrew both climb into down hole to see what is. What they find is . Some time later Andrew Matt and Steve are then shown that they've developed telekinetic powers that's when the fun begins. Instead of using their powers to fight crime the three  now friends  use their powers to play practical jokes on people. As their powers get better so do the camera angles. Andrew is eventually able to levitate the camera anywhere imaginable as he's doing anything. It's pretty cool.What amazes me about Chronicle is how well everything has been written. The writing is very well thought out and so are the three main characters. It's rare that you see this in any film. It's even rarer when you see this in a found footage film. I'd advise any writer that plans on writing anything about highschool teenagers to watch this film These are how real high schoolers act. They're not too immature they're not too mature. They're teenagers. simple. That's one of the reasons why I love these characters I can relate to them. Regardless of who you are you can relate to at least one of the three main characters. As for the other two you probably knowknew someone who had similar personality traits. It doesn't hurt either when the three form a strong friendship with one another. The first hour or so is a great bromance filmThe effects are pretty good for the most part considering Chronicle is a lowbudget thriller. Most of the effects are practical with uses of some green screen technology. The stunt that looked a little odd to me was the flying but you get used to it after a while and accept it for what it is. Even though some of the effects looked a little awkward I have no choice but to respect it for the fact Chronicle didn't rely solely on CGI.Dane DeHaan Alex Russell Michael B. Jordan give great convincing performances. These characters feel real so you have to give credit to the three main actors for making them come to life.In case you can't already tell I really enjoyed Chronicle and I think anyone that likes superhero movies will too. Chronicle is the definition of a great found footage film. Chronicle is a fun thrilling movie with simple yet great dialogue that comes with a great story. Chronicle does a brilliant job at making you feel like you're part of the movie I really felt like I was the fourth member of the crew and that means something. I give Chronicle a very enthusiastic 4 out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chronicle is one of those films that kind of snuck up on everyone and may very well have slid under the radar if not for a somewhat dead weekend in February and good word of mouth. And it's rightfully earned. After last weeks fantastic The Grey the new year continues to produce good film with one of the most interesting takes on the comic book film in a long time.Now you might be tempted to blow this off as another low budget shaky cam movie ala Paranormal Activity but you'd be wrong. Firstly this is a film that establishes it's lead camera men as experienced with a camera so shaky cam is mostly gone from the film. We also have some other rather interesting excuses for better than average fauxdoc filming namely the main character's ability to levitate his camera around to get multiple angles. Suffice to say the camera work is mostly good and legitimized so it never feels like it's too good. So if you fear that this is just another poorly made handheld excursion fear not. This is a very well made handheld excursion.The story itself is nothing terribly new or original. A group of teens inexplicably get super powers from some weird glowy crystals and that's about it. But where most stories about super powered people might find them fighting evil or exploring human nature Chronicle takes it's time to show a more realistic approach. Our characters play pranks gain popularity and try to just have fun. Also realistic are how the powers come out in other forms manifesting the inner turmoil of one troubled teen who becomes too powerful for his own good. Although the story may not be wholly original the script is pretty good and the films take on both the handheld film sub genre and the super powered sub genre is good. This is a more grounded look at what might happen should we find ourselves with power we can't understand. We don't get noble causes or some epic quest to save the world we simply get teens who are being teens albeit with telekinetic abilities. I read this film compared to Carrie and it's somewhat accurate only this is Carrie x5.It helps that the leads do a great job in their respective roles. They seem naturals as the teens and DeHann in particular is great as the troubled Andrew. We can see what's to come but when his turn finally comes most noticeably in a scene involving a spider it's a frightening wake up call to the true nature of the forces at work here. There is some reality in this film and it's frightening to think what some might do with that kind of power if given it. Even with that last bit of darkness at the end of the film it's fun and shown in a very intimate way. Being so up close and personal with the action is exhilarating and there are moments when the film even feels like a ride for a time. There are several good scenes displaying the use of the teens power but the final 15 minutes are some of the most exciting super powered moments of any film of it's kind. The fact that it feels more realistic than say something like Iron Man makes it feel that much more exciting. It's like watching a high school fight but pushed to the 10th degree.Suffice to say Chronicle was a pleasant surprise. It's the kind of film you hope to walk into. As a fan of comic book films it was especially pleasing as it really shakes the genre and tries successfully I might add to do something very different. It could have been a complete disaster with typical handheld filming and a typical story. But the smart and creative take on the genre makes this another in the great beginning of 2012.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ever since the breakout success of 1999's The Blair Witch Project the found footage film has become a subgenre in its own right. In a similar vein to Blair Witch the Paranormal Activity series has found great financial success with their comparatively meagre budgets and Cloverfield in 2008 proved that even on a larger scale the handycam aesthetic can deliver effective thrills when employed by filmmakers who have a solid understanding of the style. Josh Trank's Chronicle represents an evolution of the found footage genre taking the character as cameraman conceit to interesting new places and marking the director as a young talent worth monitoring.Chronicle differs from predecessors like Cloverfield in the sense that this handycam footage isn't presented as 'found' per se but rather is a stylistic and narrative choice which puts a refreshingly original spin on a well overdone story the superhero origin. After encountering a strange glowing object in a deep underground cave high schoolers Andrew Dane DeHaan Matt Alex Russell and Steve Michael B. Jordan discover they have telekinetic powers which allow them to move objects with their mind. Matt considers the powers to be like a muscle which can be strengthened through training and after beginning small eventually the trio build superhuman strength and to their delight the ability to fly. The special effects betray a small budget at times but the initial flying sequences are breathlessly entertaining and the pure joy of the characters makes them more effective than most megabudget blockbusters. These are meant to be regular kids and although the story loses focus as the scale grows towards the climax the early scenes are surprisingly genuine and affecting. But make no mistake this is an origin story one which doesn't necessarily beg for a sequel however and Trank and his cowriter Max Landis son of John Landis use the visceral inyourface nature of the found footage to breathe life into a genre which has come dangerously close to wearing out its welcome in the past decade.As is the case with almost all sciencefiction a lot more can be read into Chronicle than what is happening on the surface. Aside from the excitement of fighting and flying about there is a very real human story at work with a lot of teenage life's triumphs and tragedies. Trank and Landis clearly poured their own experiences into the film with the three leads seeming like people from everyone's high school years. Added to this is a nice element of selfreflexivity as Andrew an unpopular misfit uses his camera to define himself and how he sees the world. The old adage about writing what you know seems to ring true in the case of Chronicle and seeing Andrew learn to move his camera in more dynamic ways thanks to his new found powers is perhaps the tiniest hint of autobiography from Trank. The film is filled with subtle aspects such as this which will probably be missed by most but thankfully simply taking Chronicle at face value is a rewarding experience proving that the superhero origin story is not dead it just needs a good shake up from time to time.tinribs27.wordpress.com".

	schema:headline " Despite it's short length I really enjoyed Chronicle.";
	schema:reviewBody "Throughout the years audiences have been treated to origin stories such as those based on superheroes. With the recent success of the Batman XMen SpiderMan films and also worth mentioning Thor XMenFirst Class and Captain America it's not hard to see why they click with audiences. With Chronicle the superhero origin story is given a fresh new spin.Directed by Joe Trank Chronicle tells the story of three friends who gain superpowers from a mysterious tunnel discovered in a remote part of a suburban town. Strangely these teens don't seem frightened or confused about their new found power. Think about how frightened and confused Bruce Banner was when he first transformed into the Hulk. But whereas Hulk was bombarded with gamma rays Chronicle takes a swipe at a fairly plausible Dues Ex Machina plot device that has yet to be explained in possible future installments.It's true that some may find fault with it's vignettestyle story telling in the vein of Cloverfield. But unlike Cloverfield which was a good film in it's own right but had a little too much shakycam effect the technique is surprisingly easy to follow. That along with the wellwritten script and performances made Chronicle all the more enjoyable and engrossing. Maybe in the future filmmakers should take notice from this film in order to make a superb product. Not only that they even managed to achieve believable special effects on a low budget along with the script. That's really impressive that they achieved to reach fans of superhero comics and films as well as the general audience very unique.But I really wished it was longer. With such an intriguing premise even more better than Hayden Christensen's stinker of a superhero origin story Jumper. Jumper was such a disappointment. It wasn't even fully developed on it's potential and sadly was utterly wasted. Thankfully Chronicle delivers on everything that film didn't and more. The climaxwhich I will not spoil is one of sheer awesomeness. Emotionally charged with a nice dash of good vs evil done in an unconventional way. The length of the film bummed me out but from the looks of things I can see this film grow into something really special.".

It's all fun and games until they get into trouble. It's a great idea but it could have been filmed in a regular filmmaking style. The handheld camera fails to make the film credible. Despite from that the film tells a great story with a great twist. The actors are fun. The CGI is good enough. The film is short and small but it's undeniably exciting and really compelling than any other big blockbuster films we usually get.Chronicle abandons the clichs of superhero films. Usually when they discovered their powers they use it to save someone and make their own costume and save the day. The movie asks what will happen if teenagers in real life have superpowers? In this film the kids are just recording themselves having fun with their powers. And one of them will use it more for revenge than saving the day. It's a clever idea.It could have been filmed in a regular movie camera. The foundfootage style is pretty unnecessary. The film doesn't need that to look credible. Also there are too many random cameras and angles which is kind of awkward. Though the shot was pretty good. But it's still unnecessary. The CGI works better in large objects. It looks dated when comes to the small ones like the spider and the legos. Dane DeHaan Alex Russell and Michael B. Jordan are all fun together. It gets better in the third act. Dane DeHaan gives a great rage to Andrew. The climax is awesomely fun.Chronicle may be short and small but it feels long and bigger. If only the film was shot in a regular style. But it still makes a great movie. The concept is great. It's fun intense and compelling enough to enjoy it in the big screen.".

Never would you have imagined a super hero origins movie being shot with a handheld camera. They are often related to high octane action sequences and graphics and CGI. Well that thing doesn't change here either but the treatment is creative and thoroughly engaging. If suppose paranormal activity and any super hero movie were to mate their offspring would have been called Chronicle.I think by now the handheld camera trick in films is becoming a little stale. Sure it can help smaller productions and can make some films visually spectacular. However it seems that it is used in way too many films usually horror flicks at that. Chronicle however is nothing less than a masterpiece at not only the found footage style but is also a brand new way of making a superhero movie mainly because the people it centers on are far from heroes anyway. They are portrayed as everyday people. People with real problems and psychologies.

	schema:reviewBody "Like many of you I gleamed at the trailer and poster with a heavy amount of skepticism. Yet another superheroesque film I thought this time brought to the screen with the increasingly hawkeyed handheld style. Is this really necessary? Well no its not but its a lot of fun.The plot you can decipher from the trailer three teenagers Andrew Steve and Matt find a hole in the ground and uncover something that gives them the power to move things with their minds. Then they act as any normal teenager would if suddenly given superpowers they goof off. Things however get murky when Andrew Dane DeHaan begins lashing out as his broken family life becomes too much for him to bare. Actors Michael B. Jordan and Alex Russell complete the triptych as the local high school's popular kid and Andrew's toocoolforschool cousin.Capturing teenage angst on film has always seemed like a real struggle for Hollywood. Common knowledge dictates that if you faced the camera towards a group of well groomed twentysomethings and relegated them to a particular clique it'll all work out. Yet Chronicle's script expands on that world without making it the film. Steve is popular because he is genuinely a sociable guy not because he's some feckless ladder climber. On the flipside of the coin Andrew is withdrawn and antisocial because his mother is ill and his father is an alcoholic with a rage problem. These are very real issues that are glossed over or ignored in average teen movies.But this isn't just a comingofage tale its also a showcase for emerging talents director Josh Trank and screenwriter Max Landis. While some of the camera tricks and dialogue may seem contrived at times there's no denying their boundless creativity. Trank breathes new life into the 'Blair Witch' gimmick taking footage from a wide array of handheld gadgetry to create a pretty convincing collage or dare I say chronicle.As the three climb into the hole to investigate one of them makes a reference to Plato's allegory of the cave. Perhaps a quote from 'Alice in Wonderland' would have been more apt. Like Alice all three are young surprisingly accepting of the situation and about to enter a world where the natural laws of physics need not apply.httptheyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com".

I actually wouldn't recommend kids watch this.I didn't know it was a handheld camera aspect type of film and that probably would have put me off but honestly it really doesn't matter at all and I thought it helped with building a believable story from the kids' perspectives.It has the usual groaninducing moments of explaining why the camera is constantly on but that's to be expected.Storywise I can't really fault it. It's realistic and the effects are superb probably some of the best super power sequences I have seen in a while.Couple of downsides I would have liked the abusive father stuff to have been less restrained andor the mother and son scenes to be more poignant because I personally didn't quite believe one of the kids' motivation for the things he did it was also weird that the cousin didn't really spend time with his aunt...I don't want to give too much away though.I also wasn't happy with the final scene. The ending itself was absolutely superb  I wasn't expecting it to be as massive as it was thinking their budget might prevent that but it was amazing. The very final scene though left me feeling like it wasn't necessary  but it didn't detract from anything that had gone before it just meant I looked at my friend afterwards and said why? instead of wow!.But we were both animatedly talking about how brilliant the film was for hours after and how glad we were that we watched it.One final thing something happens in the film that I'm not going to spoil...but it was totally unnecessary and harsh  you will know when it happens.Best and most satisfying film I've seen in ages 1010".

I cut myself out from the world of Chronicle so as to avoid any spoilers or opinions leaving me going into this film with a fresh mind a blank canvas. If my mind was the canvas and this film was the artist then it has just painted a masterpiece. I have seen tons of films yet this one seems to have left a massive lasting impression on me. It's an interesting take on the 'foundfootage' subgenre and it's incredible. We first see these seemingly normal highschool boys one of which is the classic quiet and disturbed teenager who has a bad family life. The way this film deals with his life is perfect and it's entirely believable. The thing that drew me into this film the most is what they do with their newfound abilities. In reality if we acquired superhuman abilities our first thoughts wouldn't be to help people. We are only human after all and thus we would pursue money fame or popularity. This is especially true for teenage boys who are naturally reckless. The film is soaked in originality and if you're obsessed with superhuman films like myself it will leave your heart racing and your mind so blown it will be splattered all over the floor.The story isn't exactly unique but it somehow manages to tell that familiar superhuman story in a new way. The reason that the main character acquires the camera is natural and it's something that you can imagine someone doing in his position. To tie it all together in a wonderfully neat package is the visual effects. The effects are fantastic and it all adds to the realism. The flying effects and fight scenes are all fantastically well done and it's worth seeing just for that! All in all great film. Whether your into superhuman movies or not go and see it. You will not disappointed.".

This is especially true for teenage boys who are naturally reckless. The film is soaked in originality and if you're obsessed with superhuman films like myself it will leave your heart racing and your mind so blown it will be splattered all over the floor.The story isn't exactly unique but it somehow manages to tell that familiar superhuman story in a new way. The reason that the main character acquires the camera is natural and it's something that you can imagine someone doing in his position. To tie it all together in a wonderfully neat package is the visual effects. The effects are fantastic and it all adds to the realism. The flying effects and fight scenes are all fantastically well done and it's worth seeing just for that! All in all great film. Whether your into superhuman movies or not go and see it. You will not disappointed.";

I can honestly say I haven't been this entertained and adrenaline rushed since I watched Kickass all the way in 2010. This movie is a epic but not a Lord of the Rings epic a different kind of epicness. Although this movie is not original in the slightest it is a breath of fresh air and P.O.V handheld camera is very well done. For a movie that has no known actors I got to say some of the performances are great. Especially by Dane DeHaan. Don't ask why I know but i'm certain he will have a great career ahead of him. Also Michael Kelly as the abusive dad was great. Alex Russel was good too and Michael B. Jorden played role really well as well. But more importantly director Josh Trank debut which is a great achievement! Bravo Trunk! Bravo. I'll keeping an eye out for his upcoming movies. Of course there are some bad points. The lack of explanation on how they got their powers. And the bad CGI most notably. This movie is extremely recommended!".

Film is done in a Blair Witch Project way main characters are filming everything and it's the same way of personal camera story tell way. As all we know it tells the story of American teenagers and such teenagers are the only positive audience this film can have. Actually I am really surprised it can have any positive audience as I really tried hard to understand what could be graded so high... Film doesn't show anything action just goes flat forward relentless guys are talking about everything but nothing they say is really interesting. It tries to show feelings guys share between each other their relationship and emotionplay. The thing is that story is sooo poorly made and scenario is sooo weak that all the behaviour of the guys specially Andrew with his psycho problems is tiresome and is annoying for the spectator. The only positive thing is special effects they are nice but you could good as well watch them separately you would save a lot of time...

After the area is closed off by the authorities it is no longer given any reference in the movie.2 They fly up into the sky at the same level that jets are flying yet they have no problem with hypothermia or lack of oxygen at high altitudes.3 There are references to nosebleeds when they use their powers but the bleeds are irregular and don't have any impact on their lives other than the boys commenting I've got a bad nose bleed.

The first part should have been fun to watch how they got and tried out their new powers but it felt cheap and unsatisfying. When things went wrong it was unpleasant and out of sync with the earlier part. The script is bad  it doesn't transition well from the first part discovering the powers to the later part where things go wrong. The directing is abrupt and disjointed.Terribly unsatisfying feel to the story. I know they wanted it to be a dark type of story but it ended up being not entertaining. This movie has a cheap feel. The handheld handy cam photography is headache inducing and doesn't show what is happening well.The cast is made up of relative unknowns  probably to give it a realistic feel.

	schema:reviewBody "Imagine for once you're a high school kid shy secluded wimpy gets beaten down and then BAM! you your cousin and friend get these fantastic powers! You can get back at the bullies fly to Tibet on a whim and fight back that bad bad father.Now imagine that same kid is bland boring brainless and brings little to the table  his superfriends too  and the special powers are allbut a backdrop to whatever's not happening on the screen. Sounds like a fun time?It's hard not to put yourself in the shoes of these Teen Titans of 'Chronicle' 15 Stars and when you do you should be thoroughly disappointed in these shallow kids' discovery.Literally or BARELY nothing changes in these kids' lives following an alien encounter that leaves the three with the ability of telekinesis. And that's not a good thing these boys didn't have that much depth or anything going for them prior and following they have even less. Oh there's some training and a girly girlpodcaster side story that's about as interesting as watching Bella and Edward's courtship but other than that these fools do not act like normal kids who would find themselves much stronger than the day before. One example after a good friend dies the first instinct at least in this reality is to film the funeral in some arthouse fashion and then its business as usual following. The supposedly farlesser realistic kids of Elm Street showed more emotion towards their lost friends at each film's obligatory funeral.I was a teenage boy once I read comics watched superhero movies and daydreamed a lot. Like what would happen if I had the ability of flight invulnerability and the power to move objects with my mind through my hand. This mercifully short film was NOTHING like I imagined.

You can get back at the bullies fly to Tibet on a whim and fight back that bad bad father.Now imagine that same kid is bland boring brainless and brings little to the table  his superfriends too  and the special powers are allbut a backdrop to whatever's not happening on the screen. Sounds like a fun time?It's hard not to put yourself in the shoes of these Teen Titans of 'Chronicle' 15 Stars and when you do you should be thoroughly disappointed in these shallow kids' discovery.Literally or BARELY nothing changes in these kids' lives following an alien encounter that leaves the three with the ability of telekinesis. And that's not a good thing these boys didn't have that much depth or anything going for them prior and following they have even less. Oh there's some training and a girly girlpodcaster side story that's about as interesting as watching Bella and Edward's courtship but other than that these fools do not act like normal kids who would find themselves much stronger than the day before. One example after a good friend dies the first instinct at least in this reality is to film the funeral in some arthouse fashion and then its business as usual following. The supposedly farlesser realistic kids of Elm Street showed more emotion towards their lost friends at each film's obligatory funeral.I was a teenage boy once I read comics watched superhero movies and daydreamed a lot. Like what would happen if I had the ability of flight invulnerability and the power to move objects with my mind through my hand. This mercifully short film was NOTHING like I imagined. These punks might as well been given a used iPad vs. abnormal abilities.There were enough misfires in this film that I left the theatre and said to myself Thanks for the preview.

The 1980s were filled with such movies and looking back I am glad that I grew up in that decade. Children now are exposed to altogether soulless movies.Set in the late 21st Century Enemy Mine has humans reaching out into the depths of space after achieving world peace. But a rival species the alien race of the Drax don't take to kindly to humans poking about the galaxy and an interstellar war kicks off. A human pilot Dennis Quaid and a lone Drac Louis Gossett Jnr. crash land on a remote desert planet and learn the hard way to stick together if they want to survive. Despite their ultimate conflict they discover that they are not all that different from each other and neither yet both are to blame for the war.Enemy Mine suffered from severe problems during production. Apparently the original director Richard Longcraine Wimbledon Richard III shot the entire film on location in Iceland before being replaced by Wolfgang Petersen who reshot the whole film all over again but changed the story somewhat in the process. So in reality there are two completely different versions of Enemy Mine. One which was released into cinemas that has become a classic in its own right and another that only exists in the vaults of Twentieth Century Fox. I would love to see this alternate cut.The fantastic photography and production design look very very good for a film from 1985. Some of the effect shots and matte paintings are simply gorgeous and the cutting between desert locations and desert sets is almost seamless. This isn't like an episode of the original Star Trek series in which the cast simply take a half hour drive to a bit of desert outside of LA the desert locations with the matte painting backgrounds look utterly authentic.If you like the look and feel of films like The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth then you'll appreciate the fantasy of Enemy Mine. I know I am going to sound like an old coot but they just don't make films like this anymore. Everything these days seems to be geared towards the average ASBO teenage boy. In ten years time I honestly think that films will be no more than a test card that offends and stimulates no one.I will consider myself lucky that films like this were once made and that they were a part of my formative years.".

It kept me rivited from beginning to end. Dennis Quaid is one of my favorite actors and I didn't know Lou Gossett was the lizard but I guessed it from his voice. When I checked the credits at the end I was right! He was soooo good. I can't describe it you have to watch it. I shed a few tears toward the end. Won't tell you if they were happy or sad tears tho!

I figured and learned some more things out since I am older and that made the movie even better! I like how to survive they had to learn to be friends and get along with each other which I thought was very nice. It's honestly a very simple direct message in the movie for us to survive and do well in life we must try to get along with one another and help each other out. We are always fighting wars and hurting one another we truly have to stop that. I also figured out what the mine was all about ha ha. The dracs were being used as slaves at the end you find out in a mine. When I was young I had absolute no idea what the title meant. But all in all it was an awsome movie and will still go on as being one of my favourite movies. Yes the 80's had some of the best movies this world has ever known!".

	schema:reviewBody "When I was a little girl I adored SciFi my dad and I could watch any science fiction movie you threw at me and one of my favorites besides Star Wars was Enemy Mine. I couldn't get enough of this movie in fact I remember being in trouble for wearing out the VHS. Growing up without seeing the film for a while was weird but by some miracle I found the film on DVD for five dollars and couldn't wait to see it again to bring back such great memories. I remember being so frightened by the sand creature loving the make up effects wanting to learn the Drac language and loved the relationships between Willis Jerry and Zammis. I definitely did grow up because now I'm a little more picky about films I'm actually a little surprised that I did love this movie as a kid. However I still love this movie not for the good memories but for the great story that it had.Willis E. Davidge and Drac pilot Jeriba Shigan engage in a spacecraft battle which results in both crashlanding on a strange dark alien world with two moons a breathable atmosphere water and bizarre animal life. After initial hostilities the two eventually learn to cooperate in order to survive. They work together to build a shelter for protection against intermittent bombardment by meteorites and to satisfy their needs for food water and warmth. Over a period of years they learn to overcome their differences become friends and learn each other's languages and cultures. He then discovers that Jeriba is pregnant. He promises to take care of the baby drac and to take him back home but it becomes difficult when humans crash on the planet enslaving dracs and now Willis must protect the baby from being captured.The reason I think I was just a little disappointed was due to the pacing of the film. I wished they had trimmed it a little more. There's also this very beautiful moment where Willis starts explaining to Jerry's son Zammis what his relationship was like with Zammis' father You're father was my friend and then it cuts. I would've loved to hear a bit more about what he had to say about Jerry. You go through this incredible journey of these two creatures who just hated each other without even really knowing why they then realize how silly they're being and actually find out they like each other. It's a wonderful story and it would have been a terrific to hear Willis' point of view on the story. However the effects are still out of this worldno pun intended fantastic. The sand creature still is as terrifying as I remember. The acting is very good especially on Louis Gossett Jr.'s part. I still get teary eyed during some scenes between Jerry and Willis their friendship was so powerful and I loved the way it ended with the Dracs coming to peace with the humans. It's still a great movie just needed some better editing. But I would always recommend Enemy Mine.810".

	schema:reviewBody "This magnificent film has a lot to offer the viewer. From its opening to the end it keeps on a thrilling pace. You'll be glued to to the TV screen in anticipation to what happens next.It is based on the story of the same title by Barry B. Longyear.I rank this film in the same category as Robinson Crusoe On Mars 1964. And if you think about it Enemy Mine comes close to the remake of that film.This is a film based on a theme of survival on a harsh planet with limited resources. It is also a film about friendship and understanding or cultural exchange between two different species.Full Plot In the late 21st century an interstellar war between humans associated as the Bilateral Terran Alliance or BTA and Dracs a reptilian humanoid race is being fought. Human pilot Willis E. Davidge Dennis Quaid and Drac pilot Jeriba Shigan Louis Gossett Jr. engage in a spacecraft battle which results in both crashlanding on Fyrine IV a strange dark alien world with two moons a breathable atmosphere water and bizarre animal life.After initial hostilities the two eventually learn to cooperate in order to survive. They work together to build a shelter for protection against intermittent bombardment by meteorites and to satisfy their needs for food water and warmth. Over a period of years they learn to overcome their differences become friends and learn each other's languages and cultures. Each saves the other's life on at least one occasion.Davidge haunted by dreams of spaceships landing on the planet leaves in search of help. He finds signs of a human presence but learns that the planet has been periodically visited by human miners who employ Dracs as slave labor. He returns to warn Jeriba whom Davidge nicknames Jerry only to discover that Jerreba is pregnant Dracs reproduce asexually with no control over timing of conception.The combination of a blizzard and attack by one of the planet's predators forces Davidge and Jeriba to flee their shelter. To pass the time Jeriba teaches Davidge his full ancestry a necessity if his child is to be accepted into Drac society. Jeriba later dies during the childbirth but not before making Davidge swear that if he ever escapes the planet to take Jeriba's child back to Dracon the Drac Homeworld and recite his full ancestry so he can join Drac society.Davidge raises the child Zammis Bumper Robinson as his own. Over the years Davidge and Zammis form a very close bond and although the young Drac refers to Davidge as its 'uncle' its emotional range towards Davidge is as a son would look up to a father  an emotion that Davidge shares as well. Davidge knows of the mining crews scouring the planet in search of minerals and ore deposits and he knows that they have little regard for Drac life so he remains on guard to keep Zammis from getting captured or killed should they run into any of the miners. However Zammis does not realize the danger and goes off to get a closer look at such a spacecraft. Although Davidge follows and tries to rescue him Zammis is abducted by the humans with Davidge hurt and left for dead. A BTA patrol ship finds Davidge anonymous unrecognizable and apparently dead and it returns him to the space station where he was formerly based.On the station during the funeral ceremony Davidge awakens when one of the disposal technicians tries to steal the small book the Talman that Jerry had given him years before when he first wished to learn the Drac language. Davidge's former patrol crew vouch for his loyalty to the BTA even after it is discovered that he speaks the language fluently. Sometime later Davidge is reinstated to duty but not as a pilot. Unable to enlist assistance to rescue Zammis from the miner villains Davidge desperately steals a spaceship to rescue Zammis solo. He manages to find and infiltrate the miners' ship. Davidge contacts the Drac slaves in their own language which convinces them to help him overcome the brutality of the human overseers and eventually reunite with Zammis. Eventually Davidge is also assisted by a BTA crew who pursued him. They finally realize that whatever it was that he experienced while missing in action MIA has made him more human he no longer hates Dracs.In the epilogue Davidge and Zammis return to the Drac homeworld for Zammis's introduction ceremony to the Drac Holy Council so that it may be accepted into Drac society. As required and as he promised Jerry Davidge recounts the complete Jeriba ancestry before the Holy Council in the traditional ritual as he was taught by Jerry. A narrator explains that years later when Zammis also has a child and brings it to the Holy Council for the same ritual the name of Willis Davidge was added to the line of Jerreba.Louis Gosset Jr. is outstanding as the Drac Jeriba Shigan. Dennis Quaid plays the fighter pilot Willis Davidge. Bumper Robinson plays the role of the offspring of Jeriba named Zammis. Special effects is the main plus point of the film as it relies on them to create the harsh environment of the alien planet. Dialogue is solid and at times thoughtprovoking.Favorite quote by Jeriba as he is dying giving birth to Zammis you have divided yourselves into two sexes male and female to enjoy that brief joy of during union or something to that effect.Recommend you buy this film on DVD as it is a gem of a film. Also buy Robinson Crusoe On Mars as well. Thanks for reading!".

Over the years Davidge and Zammis form a very close bond and although the young Drac refers to Davidge as its 'uncle' its emotional range towards Davidge is as a son would look up to a father  an emotion that Davidge shares as well. Davidge knows of the mining crews scouring the planet in search of minerals and ore deposits and he knows that they have little regard for Drac life so he remains on guard to keep Zammis from getting captured or killed should they run into any of the miners. However Zammis does not realize the danger and goes off to get a closer look at such a spacecraft. Although Davidge follows and tries to rescue him Zammis is abducted by the humans with Davidge hurt and left for dead. A BTA patrol ship finds Davidge anonymous unrecognizable and apparently dead and it returns him to the space station where he was formerly based.On the station during the funeral ceremony Davidge awakens when one of the disposal technicians tries to steal the small book the Talman that Jerry had given him years before when he first wished to learn the Drac language. Davidge's former patrol crew vouch for his loyalty to the BTA even after it is discovered that he speaks the language fluently. Sometime later Davidge is reinstated to duty but not as a pilot. Unable to enlist assistance to rescue Zammis from the miner villains Davidge desperately steals a spaceship to rescue Zammis solo. He manages to find and infiltrate the miners' ship. Davidge contacts the Drac slaves in their own language which convinces them to help him overcome the brutality of the human overseers and eventually reunite with Zammis. Eventually Davidge is also assisted by a BTA crew who pursued him. They finally realize that whatever it was that he experienced while missing in action MIA has made him more human he no longer hates Dracs.In the epilogue Davidge and Zammis return to the Drac homeworld for Zammis's introduction ceremony to the Drac Holy Council so that it may be accepted into Drac society. As required and as he promised Jerry Davidge recounts the complete Jeriba ancestry before the Holy Council in the traditional ritual as he was taught by Jerry. A narrator explains that years later when Zammis also has a child and brings it to the Holy Council for the same ritual the name of Willis Davidge was added to the line of Jerreba.Louis Gosset Jr. is outstanding as the Drac Jeriba Shigan. Dennis Quaid plays the fighter pilot Willis Davidge. Bumper Robinson plays the role of the offspring of Jeriba named Zammis. Special effects is the main plus point of the film as it relies on them to create the harsh environment of the alien planet. Dialogue is solid and at times thoughtprovoking.Favorite quote by Jeriba as he is dying giving birth to Zammis you have divided yourselves into two sexes male and female to enjoy that brief joy of during union or something to that effect.Recommend you buy this film on DVD as it is a gem of a film. Also buy Robinson Crusoe On Mars as well. Thanks for reading!";

My parents where rather protective with what my siblings and I saw as young children and up till then any movie we saw was as a family usually some Disney film. This time Dad had heard good things about this one and thought I was ready for more mature fair. So my father planed a boys night out bowling  pizza and a movie. It is one of my fondest memories from my youth. More recently I saw Enemy Mine on DVD at the local megamart and had to buy it. I still think it's one of the greatest movies ever. It's not just a scifi masterpiece nor a special effects ground breaker the legendary Wolfgang Peterson sound stage was built for this movie! nor is it one of the most poignant commentaries on the human condition ever written touching on subjects like prejudice the universal truths that govern all great religions friendship etc.. Instead it truly is all of these and more. There is a heavy dose of lighthearted frivolity that keeps it from being overly preachy despite it's heady content. Its easy to follow with out being so simplistic as to lose its credibility. In the end I'm still not sure whether it's nostalgia or substance that makes me love this film more. However I can say  without a doubt that I would recommend this movie to absolutely anyone. Especially any father wanting to bond with his 10year old son and teach him a few good life lessens in the process but who am I to say you be the judge.".

It is not uncommon in todays literature and films to be shown the similarities between enemies in fact it is now so common an element that it is sometimes thrown in as an afterthought. But in 1985 the ideas of the day were still largely black and white good and evil right and wrong. This movie demonstrated how two enemies vastly different even down to their very species could find common ground and how it is possible for two seemingly opposed views to both be absolutely right. It was a touching exploration and I strongly urge anyone whether scifi fan or not to see this movie at least once. The two hours will be betterspent than most and you may find that you have a new favorite.".

	schema:headline " A Story of Friendship Love and CrossSpecies Adoption";
	schema:reviewBody "Wolfgang Petersen acclaimed director of Das Boot and many others brings us the story of a future where Earth no longer battles itself but must fight other entities the Dracs in order to get resources from unclaimed planets. After one dogfight a human and Drac land on the same planet and aren't sure whether to help or destroy each other.The casting of this film was by far the best part. Science fiction films in general often suffer because they are harder for an audience to believe and accept. But Louis Gossett Jr. and Dennis Quaid are both actors who are able to make anything seem plausible. Gossett is particularly amazing going so far as to manipulate his speech and appearance to the point of being unrecognizable. I will say that any actor who does well when we can't even tell it's him is a man to be respected.There are some flaws with the film. I for one found it unusual that a peaceloving Earth would be so quick to fight other aliens rather than pursue some diplomatic relationship. But I guess I shouldn't assume humans are logical. I shared a concern with Roger Ebert who said that the film gives us an alien that is too human too familiar. It takes that amazing planet and gives it food water gravity and atmosphere that are suitable for both humans and Dracs... Why couldn't the Drac be truly alien in this film? I don't mind that the planet was an Mclass planet but I did find it sad the alien was so humanoid in nature particularly after they explicitly stated there's nothing human about them. Ebert in his review actually goes on about this concern for some time referencing other science fiction stories which I will not do here.Ebert also ponders As the slavers stood over their captives with whips I found myself wondering how costeffective it would be to transport manual laborers millions of light years. Surely a technology capable of arriving at the planet Fyrine IV would have figured out a better way to mine its ores? I guess he thinks about this sort of thing far more than I do as I had no real problem with the slave traders or any of the subplots. The film was a buddy film at heart and a commentary on racism. But it was also an action film and any good action film requires some senseless fight scenes and killing. Action movies are generally not Oscarworthy in their writing but that's because they cater to the primal urges and not the mind which isn't always a bad thing.Ebert's last concern is that this is a movie that made no compromises in its art direction its special effects and its performances  and then compromised everything else in sight. I have already addressed why the action scenes work for me. And yes I suppose their was a cheesiness to raising an alien child to like American football. But this wasn't an Asimov or Crichton sciencerich story  it was a fun story. And it was a 1980s film for goodness sakes.He is right about the art direction and everything he praises. The directing acting and scenery were amazing. I forget where this was filmed but it serves very well as an alien landscape. My only bother with the art was that I felt the film had a bit much influence from Star Wars. I know this is a film from the same era so it's hard not to be influenced. But there is a creature that is very much like a Sarlacc and the spacecraft shown in this film had George Lucas written all over them. Maybe I'm just picky though.All in all i really enjoyed this film. It was at a good pace it had great acting from two of the better performers out there and it comes from Petersen who refuses to make lowquality pictures. Ebert might be overly concerned with the technical aspects of this universe but for all the shortcomings this film had in that regard it more than made up for with sheer pleasure.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the past week I had seen this movie in the TV cable listings just about every day being offered on a variety of channels. Sensing that this might have been a mysterious calling out to me on some personal level I decided to watch it. I stayed till the end but I have to say I can't for the life of me imagine whatever prompted the film makers to put this thing to celluloid. This would have been interesting if it had been done thirty years earlier in black and white then it's camp value might have placed it among the revered scifi classics of the day. Something along the lines say of Creature From The Black Lagoon which I was immediately reminded of when 'Jerry' was shown swimming underwater.Apart from that the picture is entirely derivative of many sources of scifi that had gone before most notably Star Wars from the opening space battle to the copy cat Sarlaac pit that even burped after consuming an unfortunate victim. Even the confrontation between a human and a reptilian type alien had seen treatment before almost twenty years earlier in episode 1.18 of Star Trek 'Arena' with Captain Kirk doing the honors of course. And the dialog? I can only point to my summary comment above  couldn't the writers have come up with anything better than this? There was only one compelling scene in the picture for me one that made me stop and think  that being Dennis Quaid's recognition of words from the Drak writings that reflected the spirit of the Lord's Prayer.

	onyx:emotionText "In the past week I had seen this movie in the TV cable listings just about every day being offered on a variety of channels. Sensing that this might have been a mysterious calling out to me on some personal level I decided to watch it. I stayed till the end but I have to say I can't for the life of me imagine whatever prompted the film makers to put this thing to celluloid. This would have been interesting if it had been done thirty years earlier in black and white then it's camp value might have placed it among the revered scifi classics of the day. Something along the lines say of Creature From The Black Lagoon which I was immediately reminded of when 'Jerry' was shown swimming underwater.Apart from that the picture is entirely derivative of many sources of scifi that had gone before most notably Star Wars from the opening space battle to the copy cat Sarlaac pit that even burped after consuming an unfortunate victim. Even the confrontation between a human and a reptilian type alien had seen treatment before almost twenty years earlier in episode 1.18 of Star Trek 'Arena' with Captain Kirk doing the honors of course. And the dialog? I can only point to my summary comment above  couldn't the writers have come up with anything better than this? There was only one compelling scene in the picture for me one that made me stop and think  that being Dennis Quaid's recognition of words from the Drak writings that reflected the spirit of the Lord's Prayer. Just about everything else had me groaning in embarrassment for the two principals. At least Louis Gossett Jr. was able to hide out in his lizard costume.

It does the best with the resources it had at the time and for me growing up with stuff like The Thing and Alien the imaginative special effects hold up wonderfully even today. Dennis Quaid a solid guy who's picked some really awesome high concept fantasies throughout his career Frequency Innerspace Dreamscape Pandorum is fantastic here as a hotshot earthlings pilot who in the midst of a dogfight with a hostile alien race crash lands on a distant unfamiliar world with only one companion a member of the race he is at war with who also crashed. Louis Gossett Jr. that snarky prick drill instructor from An Officer And A Gentleman is physically and emotionally unrecognizable as the alien pilot and should have been nominated for his staggering stunning work. He wears the biologically fascinating prosthetics with ease creating a thinking feeling creature that will win your heart. Gradually these two mortal enemies learn the only way to survival is through each other to build a mutual trust and understanding. The film explores this beautifully taking its time showing us both of these being's nuances fears and hopes for a truly riveting one on one character drama. The gorgeous galactic setting does wonders for the atmosphere and when our two heroes get acquainted with the planet's local wildlife some truly cool practical creature effects come into play. The emotional core sits with the relationship between these two though and both actors totally own it completely present and emotionally committed without a hint of schlock. The 80's gave us some of the best in the Sci fi genre and this is one of my favorites.".

	schema:reviewBody "I had seen this movie when it came out I was 13 and thought it was totally awesome and extremely thoughtprovoking. And I love cheesy scifi of all varieties so I thought I'd revisit it. And how I suffered as a result.Now we all know that people are the same wherever you go. There is good and bad in everyone. And as we learn to live we learn to give each other what we need to survive together alihihive. Ebony and ivory live together in perfect harmony side by side on my piano keyboard. Oh Lord why can't we? These are the questions I was forced to ask myself as I watched Enemy Mine. In the movie there's the humans and the Dracs and they're at war because the Dracs have asserted squatters rights to parts of the universe they have taken over. Uh squatters rights? Is this the way to start a raciallysensitive drama? Why not say that they're tooling around the universe in galactic Cadillacs at the human's expense? Regardless we start off with a tepid space battle in which Drac ships seem to be just passing through they all just fly straight barely acknowledging the enemy and no one shoots without immediately hitting its target. Anyway through Dennis' psychotic obsession with killing the Drac that killed his friend he crashes on a rocky planet along with a Drac ship. Dennis soon enough finds the ship is captured by the Drac and they are forced to coexist. Soon enough they're learning each other's language and hunting together and shootin' the shizz around the campfire.Around this time I was thunderstruck by a sudden thought Wait a minute! I said Could this entire thing be seen as a metaphor for racial relations right here on Earth? A metaphor seemingly conceived of by a sensitive sixthgrader? Imagine my shock and awe to discover that INDEED it is.Some may be moved by this. I found it unendurably tedious. The whole thing is handled at such a middle school racism is wrong level that it just made me want to puke. It would be one thing if the script could come up with something decent for these people to say or a situation that we haven't seen 300 times before but that is not to be. You can write the script yourself just from what I've told you so far and it would go Scenes of them fighting scene in which one saves the other's life the first word of common language blabbing by the fire a fight based on their love for each other! etc. It was all so banal I was really clawing my eyeballs out.Halfway through there's a turn in the storyline welcome but equally cloying leading to an annoying resolution in which a giant step for intergalactic racial relations is made. It's so beautiful.Dennis Quaid is terrible but he has the most painfully phony dialogue to work with. Lou Gossett actually manages to bring some dignity to his role. The score by Maurice Jarre is about fifteen miles over the top with its oldtime adventure themes and wholesome family drama motifs. And then you thinkthis was directed by Wolfgang Peterson! The guy who rocked us with Das Boot and still somehow retains some cachet has been turning out premium garbage like this ever since hasn't he? Troy? The Perfect Storm? And I just saw a preview for his remake of The Poseidon Adventure. How is it he is somehow lumped with Ridley Scott as a director who delivers interesting films? Anyway I hated every minute of it. I guess it is to be applauded by essentially setting an intimate drama in a scifi setting but so what? You're gonna have to write it at above an sixthgrade level for it to work.

	schema:reviewBody "Hardly anyone seems to have noticed that Enemy Mine is virtually a spaceage remake of Hell In The Pacific. Instead of an American and a Japanese soldier marooned together on a remote island we have a human and an alien marooned together on a remote planet. Nonetheless Enemy Mine is a nicely done film which features some pretty amazing sets and locations awesome lizardman makeup and a fairly thoughtful albeit sentimental storyline.In the future the nations of Earth have finally found peace with each other and begun to channel their energies into the exploration of space. However whilst navigating the star systems claiming planets and moons as colonies the Earthlings discover that another race exists in the universe known as the Dracs from the planet Draco. It isn't long before the humans and the Dracs are engaged in a fullscale space war. The film opens with a spaceship battle between a squadron of human fighters and their Drac opponents. Human pilot Davidge Dennis Quaid crashes his spaceship on a desolate uninhabited planet whilst pursuing one of his foes but before the crash he manages to cause enough damage to the other spaceship to make it crash also. Eventually Davidge and the Drac Jeriba Louis Gossett Jr find each other on the surface of their new temporary home planet. Initially they hate each other and spend most of their time trying to kill each other. But as it becomes clearer that they are stranded with no apparent help en route to rescue either of them they realise that they must put aside their differences in order to survive. After several years the Drac being of an asexual species gives birth to a baby son but dies during the labour. Davidge is left to raise the baby Drac Zammis Bumper Robinson but things take a turn for the worse when some cruel human scavengers arrive and set up an illegal mine on the planet using captured Dracs as slaveminers.The best part of the film is the exploration of Quaid and Gossett's relationship how they initially hate and distrust but gradually come to appreciate and understand each other. The makeup used to transform Gossett into this lizardlike alien is absolutely incredible. Later when Gossett's character dies and his baby son takes his place the bond between human and young alien becomes genuinely touching. The film is less enthralling during the more actionorientated scenes as well as the scenes set aboard the human space station. The opening spaceship battle is stilted and unconvincing the scenes where Davidge is reunited with his fellow humans after years stranded on the unfamiliar planet are done too hurriedly and make little impact on the story. The film's climax in which Davidge tries to rescue his young Drac friend from the scavengers has flashes of gruesome excitement but is another scene that seems to have been put together in great haste the ending feels really sudden and underdeveloped. However purely for its lovely middle section  which has more to do with issues like tolerance and teamwork than science fiction  Enemy Mine remains a commendable film.".

That wouldn't have happened if he hadn't been greedy. So she found a way to teach me one of Life's lessons via an Italian monster movie! Meanwhile I like this movie because it is one of the best blob movies around I don't count THE HMAN as a blob movie because the Hbeings are intelligent. These days the age of the movie shows. A computer takes up an entire room and is referred to as an electric brain poster art depicts the wounded Max as a Frankensteinian style mutant and serial buffs will recognise the scene of a car plunging off a cliff as coming from KING OF THE ROCKETMEN 1949! Still we watch these movies for the monster right? Caltiki is an effective monster but such a messy eater. Unlike THE BLOB who absorbed all his its? victims Caltiki just takes the good stuff and spits out the bones. The scene of one victim being crushed and then absorbed is especially memorable. Lamberto Bava son of Mario Bava who it is said finished this film after Ricardo Freda walked off the set I heard a similar story about THE DEVIL'S COMMANDMENT once recalled that the house destroyed by Caltiki at the end was actually a model of his father's real home and the miniature furniture was contributed by Mario's father Eugenio. That explains the meticulous attention to detail in the miniature sets. All in all a very well done movie and worth seeing again today. It used to pop up now and then on Showtime and would someone please hurry up and put it out on video? Oh and Aunt Carol . . .thanks for watching this with me so many times.".

Lamberto Bava son of Mario Bava who it is said finished this film after Ricardo Freda walked off the set I heard a similar story about THE DEVIL'S COMMANDMENT once recalled that the house destroyed by Caltiki at the end was actually a model of his father's real home and the miniature furniture was contributed by Mario's father Eugenio. That explains the meticulous attention to detail in the miniature sets. All in all a very well done movie and worth seeing again today. It used to pop up now and then on Showtime and would someone please hurry up and put it out on video? Oh and Aunt Carol . . .thanks for watching this with me so many times.";

I just watched it again for the first time since 1959 and I believe it was a combination of having my wits scared out of me when I identified with the little girl and her mother trapped in the bedroom with Catiki swelling up against the door and stomach churning revulsion at the nasty looking mess that was left after Caltiki started digesting its victims. Unlike Steve McQueen's Blob which looked almost like an edible piece of cherry Jello Caltiki sometimes took on the appearance of a soiled cloth rag completely saturated with thick dark mud or some unmentionable organic substance and the mess that was left after it digested its victims was indescribably disgusting for the era. The plot is corny and hackneyed with the obligatory hysteria over the evils of radiation and knuckleheaded careless scientists. But it is campy and scary and worth watching. I ended up springing for a DVD since I never see this shown on television anymore apart from once seeing it offered by Showtime many years ago. Why do movies like this just vanish?".

This review has to be longer so without giving away the ending I will just say that the only disappointing part of the movie is that the Blob is kinda slow... and needs radioactivity to grow and move. I would have like for him to cause more death and destruction before the end of the movie. There are some cool graphic death scenes and plenty of comic relief from the dated but entertaining acting and even a tribal belly dance. Plenty of greedy evil crazed scientists too.".

Recently thanks to the internet I got to watch this movie after so many years and was surprised to find that archeology was the basis of its sub plot.Archeologists goes on an expedition to a cave near Mayan ruins of Tikal and accidentally discovers the monster Mayans associated with goddess Caltiki.

Meanwhile a comet is due to pass close to the Earth  the same comet passed near the Earth at the time the Mayan civilization mysteriously collapsed. Will Caltiki rise again this time to end our civilization ?Seriously this is one of the best scifi movie from the late '50s. I saw this movie before I saw Steve McQueen's Blob and the Blob was somewhat lukewarm compared to Caltiki. There's been many movies featuring slime monsters but this in my opinion is the best. The movie has the monster placed in middle of a pretty serious background where all the actors and scenery looks real. This is what makes this movie extra creepy and also interesting to watch. To categorize this as a common B movie don't do justice. One of the better movie from the '50s.".

	schema:headline " Interesting and inventive fifties monster movie";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm not a big fan of fifties monster movies in general but this one is pretty decent. The film was directed by Riccardo Freda although he was going under the pseudonym 'Robert Hamton' in order to fool audiences into thinking that the film was an American picture. The film does take obvious influence from the American monster movies and is similar in style plot and execution and actually credit does have to go to Freda in that respect as if it wasn't for the awful dubbing one would have no reason to think that this wasn't an American film. The plot is rather well worked and focuses on the demise of the Mayan civilisation. We focus on a team of archaeologists studying some ancient Mayan ruins when they come across a cave which houses a lake. After diving into the lake they discover that it is full of gold although things go a bit awry when they also find out that the lake is inhabited by an ancient bloblike monster. They end up taking part of the creature back to the lab where upon studying it they realise it could threaten the whole world...It was unveiled that many of the films which Riccardo Freda took credit for were actually directed by his young apprentice Mario Bava  and Caltiki is one of those films. I have no idea how much of the film was directed by Bava but I'd hesitantly say that I think it was mostly done by Freda as the film does not feature much in the way of Bava's trademark styling's although in truth the filming style is all very by the numbers and there's not a lot of room for stylish visuals. The plot is well done however and is certainly more inventive than I thought it might be. The special effects are not particularly spectacular though they certainly are serviceable for the type of film and are used well. There are a handful of good ideas on display  the fate that awaits a particularly greedy archaeologist being one of the best parts of it. The film tries to a bit spectacular towards the end and it does work somewhat although many of the American pictures did the spectacular ending better. Still this is a decent little monster movie and I'm sure fans of this stuff will enjoy it.".

I would never have been able to live that down with my brother sister and cousins. But I could not sleep for days afterward. The scenes of Caltiki devouring its victims was so graphic for its time and makes today's special effects pale in comparison. I have not seen the movie since but I remember it so vividly to this day.

	schema:headline " Solid enough if still flawed early creature feature";
	schema:reviewBody "Heading to a Mayan village a team of scientists looking to understand the mystery surrounding the disappearance of a longdead city only to come across a living blob of radioactive material that kills whatever it touches and continues to grow in size forcing the team to stop its deadly rampage.For the most part this one wasn't all that bad of an effort. One of the most impressive efforts featured here is the absolutely stellar and imposing atmosphere created by the ruins within the temple. The large elaborate caverns that make up the majority of the spaces within the temple that we witness here as well as the excessive and extreme look of the different statues and decorations placed through offers a really enjoyable and creepy opening. This is greatly enhanced by the rest of the atmosphere around the village outside where the local tribe being shown hanging around the temple gives this some extra benefits. The scenes of them warning the team away through their somewhat suggestive dancing and their customs about dealing with the figure within the area gives this one a rather enjoyable setup. As well the film's most impressive and important feature here is the action scenes with the giant blob in action getting off some really impressive scenes. The creatures' first appearance in the underwater cavern and attacks the member of the expedition starts this off with a great sequence leading into the wild attempts to stop it that drives the film going forward as the second half gives this some more wild creature action in the village as now only does the rapidlygrowing creature running loose but also the deformed victim trying to seek help for his condition in the wrong manner yet still leaving this one with a strong and frenetic finale that has so much to like. Coupled with the fine gore effects for the devoured bodies these manage to hold it up rather well over its flaws. The main issue to be had here is where the middle section of the film bogs down to the point of being utterly bland and boring.

	onyx:emotionText "Heading to a Mayan village a team of scientists looking to understand the mystery surrounding the disappearance of a longdead city only to come across a living blob of radioactive material that kills whatever it touches and continues to grow in size forcing the team to stop its deadly rampage.For the most part this one wasn't all that bad of an effort. One of the most impressive efforts featured here is the absolutely stellar and imposing atmosphere created by the ruins within the temple. The large elaborate caverns that make up the majority of the spaces within the temple that we witness here as well as the excessive and extreme look of the different statues and decorations placed through offers a really enjoyable and creepy opening. This is greatly enhanced by the rest of the atmosphere around the village outside where the local tribe being shown hanging around the temple gives this some extra benefits. The scenes of them warning the team away through their somewhat suggestive dancing and their customs about dealing with the figure within the area gives this one a rather enjoyable setup. As well the film's most impressive and important feature here is the action scenes with the giant blob in action getting off some really impressive scenes. The creatures' first appearance in the underwater cavern and attacks the member of the expedition starts this off with a great sequence leading into the wild attempts to stop it that drives the film going forward as the second half gives this some more wild creature action in the village as now only does the rapidlygrowing creature running loose but also the deformed victim trying to seek help for his condition in the wrong manner yet still leaving this one with a strong and frenetic finale that has so much to like. Coupled with the fine gore effects for the devoured bodies these manage to hold it up rather well over its flaws. The main issue to be had here is where the middle section of the film bogs down to the point of being utterly bland and boring. Once the monster is released and thought dead it drops the creature feature format into being more about the research into the creatures' origins to the complete detriment of scenes featuring it still being active and around.

The injured scientist who is left scarred and maimed was a bit of a cad and a jerk and now adds dangerous insanity to his resume. In the meantime a comet flies by and reactivates all pieces of Caltiki the blobtripe and things really start to multiply. Enjoyable and entertaining.

The movie unfortunately tries to fit two stories into one film which many have attempted to do but rarely succeed at. We have two problems to deal with. Caltiki the creature herself and a man who has been injured by Caltiki who as a doctor explains may have been driven insane by the poisons of the amoeba. I noticed as well that the Mayan dancers whom we see performing a dance to ward off evil spirits are most certainly not mesoNative American actors but who actually appear to be African. In fact the songs which they sing sound more like voodoo culture rather than that of true Mayans. Of course that aspect may not bother everyone. Was it a good film? Well let me put it this way it's worth watching at least once especially if you are a true lover of the classics!".

	schema:reviewBody "Caught this movie way back in the 60's on Supernatural Theater. The movie The Blob Starring Steve McQueen was made one year earlier to American audiences. The success of the film despite the poor screenplay and acting gave Italian film makers an idea a spin off.This movie was filmed in Black and white with poor dubbing. A group of archaeologists stumble across a cave laden with gold with the Mayan Goddess Caltiki. They find skeletons near the gold but fail to realize that a blob like substance is in the adjacent pool. Greed gets the better of our explorers as the first diver is consumed and the second diver Max Gerald Haerter barely escapes but has his arm consumed by the blob. Then you see the mass rise up from the pool ready to digest anyone in it's path. The crew barely escapes as the mass follows them out of the cave . Luckily a gasoline truck crashes into the massblob and destroys it. Next the team returns to Mexico City as their injured colleague is tended to to remove the blob scraps from his arm. Dr John Fielding John Merivale takes the blob substance and puts in his mansion for further analysis. Ironically a comet that passes the Earth every 850 years causes the blob to grow. Reminds me of the George Romero narrative in the Night Of the Living Dead. The Good Dr. Fielding tries to convince the Mexican government to destroy the blob but they arrest him instead. Meanwhile Dr. Fielding's house is being consumed with his lovely Wife and Daughter inside. I just enjoyed the ride from start to finish . Till this day foreign film buffs wonder who handled the bulk of the direction in the film. Was it Ricardo Freda or Mario Bava? I enjoyed this picture much more than the Blob despite it's many flaws especially in the special effects department. At times the mass looked like heavily stained bed sheets being pulled too and fro. The English voices were very distinguished especially Max's character deep and throaty in nature. Just another 50's spaghetti scifi production that will leave you full.".

Riccardo Freda the official director of the two films is also a fairly prominent and admirable name in the Italian horrorcult industry but both films simply have Bava's style and trademarks written all over them. His already gained craftsmanship as a cinematographer and his visionary look on directing built up during the fifties undoubtedly are the main reasons why Bava became one of the greatest of all time starting from the early 60's already with the tremendously brilliant Black Sunday and onwards. Caltiki clearly is a blatant ripoff of other and hugely successful unidentified monstrous substance attacking people SciFi movies from throughout the 50's decade like The Quatermass Experiment and most obviously The Blob. But there were The Blob is an overall disappointingly dull and politically correct thriller this Italian dish of deliciousness is a downright outrageous and extremely fastpaced shocker. The main characters are much more vivid and identifiable the body count lies much higher the violence is more confronting and the special effects and makeup art are more explicit than those featuring in American and British horror productions of that era. And still in spite of the familiar concept the screenplay of Caltiki nevertheless attempts and often succeeds I may add to bring some variety and inventiveness. The titular monster doesn't come from outer space for once and it doesn't necessarily have to consume human flesh in order to grow in size or strength. Caltiki has always resided here on earth and relies on radiation instead to become more dangerous. It very much likes to turn victims into skeletons but doesn't have to! How cool is that? A group of scientists and their whiny women embark on an expedition near an ancient Mayan temple in order to finally find out why an entire civilization just disappeared in a nick of time. Shortly after a volcano eruption it becomes clear to them that the lake underneath the temple homes a hideous and unstoppable monster. They have the opportunity to bring back a piece of the monstrous substance when the greediest member of the crew nearly loses his arm trying to reach for a piece of treasure when he clearly shouldn't have. Instead of researching the matter they quickly find themselves battling the thing again as it grows in size and hunger.
