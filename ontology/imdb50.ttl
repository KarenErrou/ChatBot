But in 5x2  a vivisection of modern marriage  Ozon's fans won't be let down. His trademarks are there the fascinationdisgust with romantic love marriage and family life q.v. his entire filmography! the unconventional sex scenes his talent for creating wonderful female characters his gift with actors everybody's fine in 5x2 but Valeria BruniTedeschi is a knockout and his ability to skilfully integrate image dialog music drama and humor. 5x2 is about the impossibility of love marriage and family life in the 2000s. All couples are troubled the protagonists Gilles and Marion Gilles and former girlfriend Valrie Marion's parents who at the end start of the film no longer speak to each other and the gay couple Gilles' elder brother and his very young lover who are loving and tender but lead mostly independent lives and don't have sex with each other that is. In 5x2 love and sex are sharply distinct Marion  Gilles are constantly avoiding sex and the only time Ozon actually shows them at it is in the desperate postdivorce rape scene. In another scene Gilles talks about the night he proved his love for Marion when he indulged in a bisexual orgy at her request she watched but didn't join in. Gilles' exgirlfriend Valrie is only turned on by the thought of Gilles cheating on her. We are told that the happy gay couple have a platonic relationship. And the only time we hear je t'aime in the film is from Marion to a totally drunk Gilles  who's asleep and can't hear her  right after cheating on him on their wedding night with a total stranger.Ozon includes long scenes of divorce and marriage rituals. He wants us to pay particular attention to contrast between the misleading simplicity of a marriage bond and the labyrinthine complexity of a divorce contract as if saying that something must be wrong with an institution that evolves from the brevity of a fidelity support and care vow at the wedding ceremony to the intricate endless clauses involving division of properties alimony insurance children's custody visiting rights etc at the divorce procedure not to mention the need for lawyers!.Whether you'll like or dislike or remain indifferent to 5x2 will probably depend on your own lovelife experience and your disbelief in romantic love marriage and family life. This is crucial in your interpretation of the last first scene at the Italian resort if you're an optimistromantic you'll be sensitive to the eternal magic of falling in love no matter if it may eventually bring suffering if you're cynicalsarcastic you'll perhaps giggle at the postcard scene of two people falling in love out of boredom and loneliness spiced up by a beautiful scenery only to be inevitably crushed by the bleak reality of marriage and family life  please notice that the last time we see Marion and Gilles happy is at their wedding party.The soundtrack includes great Italian love songs from the 1960s Ho Capito che ti Amo Una Lacrima sul Viso Mi Sono Innamorato di Te etc these are some of the most shamelessly romantic lyrics ever written spelling out for Marion and Gilles the feelings they don't know how to articulate to each other or to themselves. 5x2 ends with Paolo Conte's Sparring Partner and we can see Ozon slyly winking at the audience he's closing a movie about the difficulties of marriage with a song that compares married people to well sparring partners. Though there are undeniable similarities to Staley Donen's Two for the Road 5x2 looks to me as a turbinated updated Rohmerian Moral Tale Ozon creates a similarly masterful mix of drama and irony using similarly arbitrary twists of love and fate on similarly selfabsorbed characters recalling Rohmer's classic lesson on how vacation and lovely landscapes can push romantic buttons in all of us think of Le Genou de Claire Pauline  la Plage Le Rayon Vert the 4 seasons Tales etc. We can thank our favorite Gallic saints that given Ozon's talent for drama he's such a playful cool witty guy who welcomes both romantics and cynics in his scripts as well as in his audience.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the most resonant films I have seen for a long time. Superb performances by both leads and a simple but very effective structure. To begin at the end and move backwards to look at moments glimpses fragments is such a simple device yet devastatingly effective as demonstrated with such expertise by Ozon here. I found certain moments deeply moving such as the physical assault on his wife. It seemed like a desperate attempt by the husband to try and claim power over his wife. But we know that the relationship is in the final throes of death. I loved the scene on the wedding night when she looks at her mother and father who we have previously seen rowing just dancing alone at the reception. Somehow you know that their relationship will last and there is hope for them. The adultery the wife commits seemed to work although at first I thought it too contrived. Her pleasure on seeing her husband and love for him as he sleeps when she creeps back into the room felt very real. For me however the most beautiful and most moving sequence was the end when they first meet. It was wonderfully set up and echoed real life so well. It is always a series of events a chain that causes all the pieces to fall in the right place and the couple to meet. It such a subtle scene when they talk on the beach as we know they are about to fall in love. When they walk into the golden sea bathed in light the two are literally becoming one as they embark on a new chapter in both their lives. The beauty of the scene is made more powerful by the conflicting emotion in our minds as we know that this love will be destroyed. How can something so perfect ever diminish? What Ozon is saying is that all things must die that surely it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all. Go and see this film. It is marvellous.".

	schema:reviewBody "As another reviewer before me I also can't believe how badly people are writing about this film here. I adore Francois Ozon and I've seen all his featurelength films. This one seems quite different from the others except maybe Sous le sable and it's as lowkey as Ozon could ever get but it is still an excellently scripted and played film that makes one think.I didn't consider the backwards structure to be gimmicky at all it rather helped the viewer to better make out flaws early in the relationship. There is betrayal in each one of the episodes starting with the last chronologically the first one. The film shows us that even little egoisms and uncharitable behavior can lead to grave consequences  in this case to divorce. The woman Marion seems to be easily led anywhere not having enough standing of her own while the man Gilles seems to be egoistic cowardly and sometimes just simply sexcrazed.I think the structure rather helps us to understand the characters better since we have already seen the consequences of their actions and attitudes. I didn't consider the large gaps between and also in the episodes to be a problem  they only acknowledge that the whole story can never be told because it is made up by every single moment between their first meeting and the last time they see each other. These episodes can only indicate what went wrong they cannot explain  that would be too simplistic.The actors were excellent especially Valeria BruniTedeschi. The way the looks of the main characters changed during the film becoming more and more youthful and fresh as the story goes backwards was also excellently done.The parallel love stories between Gilles's brother and his young lover and between Marion's parents shed some more light on the relationship between Marion and Gilles  also on what might have gone wrong.This film should probably be required viewing for every couple wanting to get married...  Not in order to deter them but rather to make them aware of the pitfalls of relationships and married life.".

	schema:headline " Finely nuanced and impressive performances";
	schema:reviewBody "The 'reverse chronology' format that has now been tried and tested a few times will perhaps one day become as unshockingly acceptable as the more prosaic use of 'flashbacks'. Both involve nonlinear storytelling and both attempt to grab audience attention by time distortions. Flashbacks are now so commonplace within mainstream films that the 'purist' Dogme movement banned them altogether  being so structurally clichd and rarely justified. So when Ozon's 5 x 2 tells a love story about two people in five chapters but starting with the last chapter and working forward is he using a valid artistic device or just being gimmicky? In the opening scene our loving couple Marion and Gilles are finalising the details of their divorce. Afterwards they have a lastfling sexual bout which takes an unpleasant turn. Flipping back scene by scene we next see them as a loving married and entertaining visitors chatting away about fidelity and sexual deviance and again we see a slightly unpleasant turn  perhaps the seeds of the divorce that we already know will happen. In each chapter we follow the love story to earlier and earlier stages.In Irreversible another French film the reverse chronology format was used to shock to take us on a journey from hell to heaven. In Memento it was used to heighten suspense and provide the basic device that the mystery revolved upon  we never knew more than the main character about what had happened before.In 5 x 2 the effect is to highlight small things that go wrong in a fairly ordinary relationship. If it were a gradual decline from better to worse they might have gone unnoticed but our starting point being divorce our interest in why things went wrong is perhaps more acute.The other thing that marks out this slightly unusual film is the remarkable acting range shown by Valeria Bruni Tedeschi who won Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival for her portrayal of Marion. We see not only an incredible range of emotion but many sides to her character. The finely nuanced performance draws attention to things like the person a woman may be to her husband whilst still have a secret side or her ability to put on a brave face when crying inside. The observation of a range of emotional and sexual explorations is done with the attention to detail that seems so intrinsic to much French cinema the characters really seem to feel what is happening as if there is no camera on them at all. Sadly 5 x 2 however may not have the shock value of film like Irreversible or the sugarcandy feelgood factor of films like Amelie mainstream foreign audiences like their French movies to nevertheless fulfil certain passive entertainment criteria which this thinking and understated movie obstinately refuses to do.".

In each chapter we follow the love story to earlier and earlier stages.In Irreversible another French film the reverse chronology format was used to shock to take us on a journey from hell to heaven. In Memento it was used to heighten suspense and provide the basic device that the mystery revolved upon  we never knew more than the main character about what had happened before.In 5 x 2 the effect is to highlight small things that go wrong in a fairly ordinary relationship. If it were a gradual decline from better to worse they might have gone unnoticed but our starting point being divorce our interest in why things went wrong is perhaps more acute.The other thing that marks out this slightly unusual film is the remarkable acting range shown by Valeria Bruni Tedeschi who won Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival for her portrayal of Marion. We see not only an incredible range of emotion but many sides to her character. The finely nuanced performance draws attention to things like the person a woman may be to her husband whilst still have a secret side or her ability to put on a brave face when crying inside. The observation of a range of emotional and sexual explorations is done with the attention to detail that seems so intrinsic to much French cinema the characters really seem to feel what is happening as if there is no camera on them at all. Sadly 5 x 2 however may not have the shock value of film like Irreversible or the sugarcandy feelgood factor of films like Amelie mainstream foreign audiences like their French movies to nevertheless fulfil certain passive entertainment criteria which this thinking and understated movie obstinately refuses to do.";

	schema:reviewBody "How to tell the life of a couple nowadays? This is what Franois Ozon tried to study in his new featurelength movie 5x2 2004. I went to see it at the movies on the first day of its release and it didn't disappoint me at all. Ozon chose to focus on five precise moments in the life of a couple. Originality these moments are related backwards! It means that the film begins with the divorce between the two main characters and it ends with their meeting. Ozon declared that he was influenced by a TV film made by Jane Campion a couple of years ago which told a friendship between two young girls. Campion's work began with their separation and it ended with their meeting.It is significant to notice that in Ozon's cinema the couple never remains stable. In Under the Sand 2000 Bruno Cremer disappeared leaving Charlotte Rampling hopeless. In 8 Women 2002 Catherine Deneuve wanted to leave her husband for her lover. In 5x2 the couple formed by Gilles Stphane Freiss and Marion Valeria BruniTedeschi isn't an exception to the rule and presents a dull and bitter image. From the beginning it means at the end of the film! their relationship is bound to fail. There's a cue pronounced by Valeria BruniTedeschi before they are going to swim We shouldn't go and swim in this part of the sea. It is dangerous. This part of the sea can be taken for a connotation of their forthcoming tormented love life.Then to tell their slow but inevitable disintegration the director preferred to leave lowkey several parts of dialogs or sequences. There are 2 examples to prove it. Gilles doesn't attend Marion's childbirth and we really don't know why. A sign of cowardice? Maybe... On another hand in the first step of the movie when they are in the hotel room Ozon lets us suggest that they have both a lover which may have caused their divorce to notice that in this step when Gilles tries to have sex with Marion it can be taken for a hopeless try to reform the couple. It could mean that Ozon's screenplay remains unfinished. Besides he once declared that he hated writing and his scripts were nearly always unfinished. But in reality he plays with the spectator once again. Ozon wants him to take part in his movie as much as possible the following way it is to him to formulate ideas or hypotheses that are likely to explain the ambiguous points scattered throughout the movie.Furthermore the movie contains several details that speak volume about the progressive disintegration of the couple. The beginning of the movie shows us a bearded Stphane Freiss with the disenchanted air and a pale sad Valria BruniTedeschi. Ozon also put in a lot of effort in the light. The beginning of the movie takes us to rather dark rooms while the end presents shiny landscapes.At last we really can't say that Gilles and Marion form a united couple. During their wedding night Marion spends the night outside with a stranger and the fact that Gilles doesn't attend his wife's childbirth nearly causes an argument between Marion and her parents. So Ozon made somber two events which are in general happy ones.Even if the originality that had secured Franois Ozon's reputation is less pronounced in his new movie except as I previously said in the order of these five moments 5x2 is a new success in this genuine filmmaker's work who doesn't seem to be out of inspiration. Let's hope it lasts!".

	schema:reviewBody "5x2 is not the first film to explore a relationship by going backwards from its end to its beginning Pinter's Betrayal comes to mind let alone the mystery in Memento.But writerdirector Franois Ozon aided by superb acting uses the structure for a thoughtful and intriguing commentary on love and marriage.The first scene sets up our curiosity as while a lawyer dryly reads the divorce agreement letting us know the cold facts of the marriage there is palpable electricity between the about to be exwife and husband such that we are not surprised when they immediately head to a hotel as it turns out their relationship started in a hotel.We are introduced to the complexities between this couple as their layers are played out through a sexual encounter that is open to he said she said interpretations that will continue as we flashback to key points in their relationship. The other four incidents show them as parents at the birth of their child at their wedding and at their meeting all played out in relation to her parents' longtime conflicted marriage and his brother's homosexual arrangements amid other encounters.Valeria Bruni Tedeschi is so luminous as Marion that I'm not sure if it's her beautiful acting as she is in turn uptight conflicted sensual fragile or aggressive or her character who changes or that Franois Ozon is such a sensitive director of women as he showed in Swimming Pool and Under the Sand Sous le sable that I favored her character even if we gradually learn that she may or may not be as much of a victim as it seems and she is as much influenced by physical imperatives as he is. Stphane Freiss plays virtually the opposite of his caring husband in Le Grand Rle even if it becomes less and less clear he's the S.O.B. he at first could appear to be or if his character experiences any changes or learns anything through serial somewhat monogamy especially because some details in their past are just left mysterious.The film is certainly not optimistic about love being an effective basis for a man and a woman to sustain a long term relationship and it leaves openended for a gendered discussion about whether that applies to the particulars of these individuals or to them as French or as Europeans vs. universals as Americans would probably interpret their interactions differently than other audiences.Certainly in a frankly sexually mature film it's nice to see nonHollywood bodies of a zaftig woman and a guy without a personal trainer credit listed.The frequent use of Paolo Conte songs on the soundtrack add to the ironic feeling surrounding the film even if the lyrics aren't translated in the many whiteonwhite subtitles.Going off into the sunset and the cinematography and production design from dark to light throughout are lovely hasn't had such an ironic conclusion since the original Planet of the Apes.".

Right now there are few directors who are allowing themselves to produce features that allow them to move freely within the world of the story reconfigure it and present it in a new way that may shed light as to what really is taking place and even if it means anything in particular. It is possible that some audiences will be getting tired by the use of style  in this case telling a story backward a plot device used most notably in Christopher Nolan's smash 2000 debut film MEMENTO. But when you look at it it's not so much the story as the feeling of irony that keeps getting stronger and stronger until it is a force of nature equivalent to the Category 5 hurricane that destroys a marriage and further inflicts damage by imposing that one last time sexual encounter in an anonymous hotel. Maybe Marion Valeria BruniTedeschi heartbreaking and luminous and Gilles Stephane Freiss were never meant to be together in the first place. Their backwards story so pregnant in what isn't being said what isn't being expressed and what the two seem to be going through is crystal clear from the getgo despite that illusion of the Sun setting over the horizon they were doomed. Something crucial is missing between them  a something that rears its ugly head in two key moments of their lives. First the day Marion gives birth to their son. Gilles for some reason cannot be there when she goes into labor nor when she talks on the phone with him after it's all over. Her argument with her parents is only a hint of what we've seen earlier the crumbling of their marriage in screams and a rape scene. Second their wedding night when Gilles falls asleep when he should be enjoying this blissful moment with Marion and has her exiting the hotel looking for a substitute even when a moral part of her yells at her with exclamation points what she's doing is wrong. In fact Gilles seems to be sabotaging his chance at happiness at every turn and it's hard not to see Marion's face subtly change expressions when he tells his brother Christophe and his young lover late in their marriage early in the movie that Marion and he participated in an orgy where he had sex in every possible way. There's just a hint here that he couldn't see himself living with her. He is in fact the person who states that Christophe is headed for disaster with his new lover. Of course the last blow he inflicts on Marion will be the most painful one and Ozon never strays from showing it in its ugliness.If only we all could turn back time and go to that perfect moment when all was well under the aegis of the Sun setting over the golden sea.... 5 x 2 makes the viewer wonder what we could do should we have the power to go back and revisit that tender moment.

As the title suggests it is comprised of five short glimpses at the doomed relationship of a handsome professional couple Marion Valeria BruniTedeschi and Gilles Stephane Freiss. As in Two For the Road we see unchronological snapshots of this couple's failing marriage but unlike the '67 film rather than being given scattershot scenes from various periods here we proceed continuously backward in time from the divorce settlement and its rather icky aftermath backward to one of the couple's dinner parties back still to the birth of their premature son on to their wedding party and a most unusual wedding night to put it mildly and all the way back to one of their first meetings. Our foreknowledge that the couple's marriage is doomed makes the cracks in Marion and Gilles' relationship stand out all the clearer. Consequently the pretty upbeat ending is rendered bittersweet at best with our preglimpse of what their future holds. 5X2 has been finely put together and features sterling acting down to the smallest bit players. It was especially great for me seeing that grand old actor Michael Lonsdale who will always be Hugo Drax for us Bond fanatics still acting at age 74 here playing Marion's father. My only complaint really concerning 5X2 is that it is a bit on the short and sketchy side perhaps a few extra scenes would have enabled us to more fully understand the characters' motivations particularly Gilles' and especially his noshow at his son's birth. This for me is the only thing that prevents 5X2 from being a perfect 10.".

The effect is quite different in 5x2. Rather than create mysteries and then gradually revealing the answers each scene in 5x2 sheds new light on previous ones while the shadow of the earlier scenes is always on the latter chronologically earlier ones creating an effect that would make the film almost too painful to watch a second time. The story is extremely realistic and relatable and there are no shocking revelations throughout the film's strength is in its subtle simplicity which makes it seem unimpressive while you're watching it but stay on your mind for a long time after. Valeria Bruni Tedeschi and Stphane Freiss create real relatable likable but very flawed characters that bring the story to life a story about love sex and marriage that is sincere and real in a way that American films hardly ever comes close to.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie left me really thinking and intrigued. With the final scene of the happy couple entering the sea you can only remain shocked at how something so beautiful could go so terribly wrong. The answers become more and more clear with each phase of their relationship the 5 key phases of being two as the director viewed it. Watching it again I can only notice how every detail is very carefully thought and adds up something more about the nature of the characters and the holes crumbling their relationship. Going backwards from present to past through the phases of Marion and Giles' relation from the divorce scene to the bright scene of the sea the movie gets the viewer surprised and curious to discover what stands behind this painful failure. However instead of leaving a bitter taste if all was chronological the final contrast between what one sees and what one knows that happened is much more surprising and raises much more questions.The beginning shows the painful end of Marion and Giles' marriage how incredibly much they grew apart. They talk about things and we can see the complex resentments maybe even hatreds that have grown up between them. Gilles seems incredibly insecure and frustrated while Marion looks patient and resigned  but actually unburdened to get away from their disintegrating relation. Then as the film moves backward starting from the divorce scene there are several moments that show what went terribly wrong...the mistakes and faults each of them had made.First comes the shocking confession Gilles makes in front of his brother and his boyfriend about the orgy he had joined under the very eyes of his wife. The courage to do that and then the courage to tell the story in front of the other 3 looked so unbelievable still they show the selfishness and hidden desires in Giles that were tearing their relationship. What I also found interesting in this scene is that the director doesn't actually see infidelity as a necessary cause of the problems. In the case of Giles'brother and his boyfriend trust warmth and an open heart actually seem more important and they're exactly the things that miss from Giles and Marion's relationship.Then the day of their son's birth Marion lies in the maternity ward suffering while Gilles stands outside smoking afraid to face the reality of what is going on. Then aware of his cowardice makes excuses for not coming to see his wife.Then his selfishness comes out again in the next scene their wedding night. He falls asleep on the bed with little care apparently halfdrunk while Marion was preparing for them to spend the night together. Marion resigns herself and goes outside for a walk but in the night she meets a handsome American. The meeting though polite first almost turns into a rape but though she could have avoided anything happening she gives in without strength to control her desires.After this scene the holes in their relation came out strikingly. It becomes apparent how each of them suffers from their own form of selfishness of being coward. They're both incapable of fidelity of giving themselves to the other with whole heart cause they're filled by doubt by hidden desires by insecurity. The beginning of their relationship brings out even more clear all these fears. Marion is just coming out of a failed relationship and looking for affection and Giles seems attracted by her insecurity and sweetness because he was starting to feel insecure too with his partner. Both insecure and not ready to commit but at the same time fearing to be alone the very beginning of their relation seemed to start on the wrong foot.Looking at the whole movie it seems that what never worked in their relation was communication. Loving each other in their own selfish way they are unable to be honest about their own faults and desires and unable to commit fearing they won't get the same in return while the space between them grows permanently. After seeing the movie what intrigued me most was why each of them had become the way he was. What made them so unable to commit him so selfish and her so patient and undetermined. Maybe the combination of their characters just brought out all their faults maybe it was simply in their nature.I think 5x2 manages to emphasize the key details which finally lead to a failed relationship in this story of a marriage that looks so painfully real. The depth of the characters and the realism of the plot made it for me one movie worth watching and remembering.".

	schema:reviewBody "Instead of asking will they end up together Francois Ozon's latest asks how did they end up apart? Many comparisons have been made to Memento but I think the narrative device is closer to Irreversible another attimesunwatchable French film. In Irreversible the rape scene is in the the middle here it is at the beginning. Both films end begin with the couple in paradise. However in 5 x 2 the cruelty is much more emotional than physical. Some critics have dismissed the backward storytelling as a gimmick but I would argue Ozon does it to play with the audience's expectations specifically the desire to assign blame to one or the other party. Most relationships of course are both but we are conditioned to choose sides. Who cheats first? Who really cares? The end result is the same and without knowing all the information who's to say cheating is bad. The order of the scenes is also closest to the way actual memory works with the mostrecent events taking precedence over older memories. It seems the device also works to stimulate a viewer's imagination to fill in the narrative blanks. Is the opening sex scene anal rape? Was Gilles making up the story about the orgy? Is the child the American's? Did Marion go to the spa expressly to meet Gilles? Will they get back together? These are some of the questions that have been interpreted different ways much like the ending to Ozon's Swimming Pool. The way you answer probably has much to say about your outlook on relationships. The romantic would say it was coincidence they vacationed together that Marion was perfect for him and that their wedding was a fairytale except for the American who practically raped Marion. Gilles stayed away from the hospital because like all men including Marion's father he was squeamish and unsure He did apologize and showed his love for the boy in a later scene. The couple had troubles and sure they divorced but they obviously still love each other since they were willing to have sex one last time. The cynic might say Marion went to the spa to steal Gilles away from his girlfriend. Then on the happiest night of her life she was so selfish she snuck away to cheat on him. The reason he stayed away from the hospital is because the baby was the American's and the only reason he loved the child was to use him as a pawn to get back at her. They divorced and he used the occasion to rape her. Any way you look at it the story stays with you and brings up important questions about fidelity repression and the institution of marriage.

	schema:reviewBody "Comparisons have often been made of 5x2 with Memento. I would tend to take a simpler view that it is just the good old Merlin style of living one's life backwards. Rather than reflecting certain technique in making motion picture 5x2 really lets you experience Merlin's existence of remembering the future and looking forward to the past.A short 90minute film in 5 approximately equal segments tracing backwards the relationship between Marion Valeria Bruni Tetdschi and Gilles Stephane Freiss their divorce a small domestic party childbirth marriage and first encounter 5x2 is a very unOzon film. The simplicity of narration and filming leaves you wondering if it is really from the same director of 8 Women and Swimming Pool.If we follow the events chronologically in reverse order of the way they are actually presented in the film we may notice that it actually starts with two breakingbroken relationships Gilles just about at the end of a 4year endurance test in a relationship that probably should never have started and Marion adjusting to being single again after recently breaking up with her boyfriend. The story also ends at the beginning of the film with a broken relationship the divorce.In between Ozon has left everything delightfully open Was the child the cause or deterrent of the breakup? Was Gilles brother's homosexual relationship really better than his own marital relationship? Was there a hidden reason for Gilles to stay away from the hospital? How much has Marion been influenced by the stormy relationship between her parents? Was it rape or adultery at Marion's wedding night? These are but only a few of the many questions not meant to be answers in the film.5x2 is best watched with an absolutely open mind with no specific expectations and certainly no preconceived ideas. Then you may be able to see more such as the small but intriguing subplot of the relationship between Marion's parents which in a way runs parallel to the two main characters' and yet has a distinct flavor of its own.Acting is superb from Tedeschi and Freiss to the parents the brother and his dashing young boyfriend. Leaving out those who look for explosion carchase and sex which 5x2 has but certainly not to woo the mass audience serious movie goers will not find 5x2 particularly emotionally elating or intellectually stimulating. Yet they should not come out of it feeling emptyhanded in a manner of speaking even if it's just for the acting but hopefully for more.".

The story also ends at the beginning of the film with a broken relationship the divorce.In between Ozon has left everything delightfully open Was the child the cause or deterrent of the breakup? Was Gilles brother's homosexual relationship really better than his own marital relationship? Was there a hidden reason for Gilles to stay away from the hospital? How much has Marion been influenced by the stormy relationship between her parents? Was it rape or adultery at Marion's wedding night? These are but only a few of the many questions not meant to be answers in the film.5x2 is best watched with an absolutely open mind with no specific expectations and certainly no preconceived ideas. Then you may be able to see more such as the small but intriguing subplot of the relationship between Marion's parents which in a way runs parallel to the two main characters' and yet has a distinct flavor of its own.Acting is superb from Tedeschi and Freiss to the parents the brother and his dashing young boyfriend. Leaving out those who look for explosion carchase and sex which 5x2 has but certainly not to woo the mass audience serious movie goers will not find 5x2 particularly emotionally elating or intellectually stimulating. Yet they should not come out of it feeling emptyhanded in a manner of speaking even if it's just for the acting but hopefully for more.";

	schema:reviewBody "Francois Ozon the brilliant French director seems to want us wait until the end for the clue to solve the puzzle he is presenting for us in his latest film 5X2. Mr. Ozon's film shows us five stages in the relationship between Gilles and Marion an attractive couple whose marriage disintegrates in front of our eyes.Working with Emmanuelle Bernheim in the screen play Mr. Ozon decides to present his story backward a device that has been used before by other directors. Each one of the five vignettes that make the movie reveal a little bit more about Gilles and Marion and how every incident seems to contribute to pull them apart. If you haven't seen the film perhaps you would like to stop reading here.When we first meet the couple they are sitting in front of a judge being read their divorce proceedings. Each one signs and we figure this is the end of the story but no when that scene ends we watch Marion and Gilles walking along a hallway of a hotel where they are going to have one last sexual encounter for old time sake. There is nothing that prepares us for the violence that Gilles exerts upon Marion. What might have been a good and amiable parting of the ways turn ugly as it's clear Marion doesn't want anything to do with her former husband.The next sequence involves a small dinner party for Gilles' brother and his boyfriend. It's clear this couple is open minded they have no prejudices. It becomes apparent that in recounting an incident that happened some time before involving an orgy at a party where Marion refused to participate but Gilles seems to have enjoyed the experience the only time by his account he has been unfaithful to his wife.The third part of the story has to do with Marion being pregnant and having to undergo a Caesarean section in order to save the premature son. Marion is seen calling Gilles at work. It's only logical that any normal would be father to go immediately to his wife at the hospital. But no we watch as Gilles never leaves the office and when he does is to go have dinner. He arrives too late to be of any help as the boy has already born but the resentment from his motherinlaw as well as from Marion are clearly evident. Is it guilt Gilles is feeling that makes him act that way or is he afraid to face the new responsibility?The marriage of Gilles and Marion is presented next. We witness as the happy couple dancing at the wedding party. Gilles evidently has drunk too much and he is not in the least capable to have sex with his wife who after coming to bed realizes her man is no good for that night. Marion goes to the castle's gardens where she sits reflecting perhaps her experience. She is startled by a stranger another guest at the hotel that can't sleep. One can clearly see where this will lead and what is obviously going to happen Marion is ready to consummate her marriage even if it's not with her own man! Returning at daybreak to her room she is happy to realize Gilles has slept without stirring.The last segment of Gilles and Marion's story is perhaps the best. We meet Gilles and Valerie at a Sicilian resort. Marion arrives on her own. By coincidence Gilles who meets Marion at the beach realizes she does work with his firm but they have no contact. Gilles who appears to be bored with Valerie turns up at a remote spot in the beach where Marion is sunbathing. When Gilles asks her if she would like to swim Marion answers she has been told not to attempt to go into the water because of the dangerous tides. Obviously neither Marion nor Gilles heed the advice of the native wisdom and we watch them getting in the water slowly walking and then swimming into the sunset! A sad mistake indeed.This seems to be Mr. Ozon's point one that makes a lot of sense in this or any human relationship. What made this couple fail to live the way it is expected from them? It seems clear these two should have stayed away from each other since we don't see anything solid between them at any time. The resentment and hurt have gotten the best out of both partners and nothing can repair their damaged marriage.The acting is first rate. Mr. Ozon gets excellent performances of the two principals Valeria BruniTedeschi and Stephane Freiss. Ms. BruniTedeschi is a beautiful woman who brings a lot to her Marion. This actress projects a natural elegance in all her screen appearances and she proves to be an asset for the film. Mr. Freiss is also good as the complex man that Gilles is. We might end despising him by the way he is at the end but we keep wondering whatever made him be this way. The supporting roles are well played by Geraldine Poilhas who is seen as Valerie the girlfriend who loses her man to Marion. Francoise Fabian and Michael Lonsdales appear as Marion's parents.This film solidifies Mr. Ozon as a man who is not afraid to delve into the human mind to find out what make his characters act the way they do in this frank but refreshing look at a marriage in trouble.".

A step further back to the courting days reveals more dissident threads and finally the couple's original meeting at a seaside resort where Gilles is retreating with his then girlfriend Valrie Graldine Pailhas suggests patterns of behavior that knowing the ending because it was the beginning of the film bring the audience into the realm of understanding.The cast is excellent the lovemaking scenes are seductive and well filmed and the transitions for the retrograde story are smooth and intriguing. The film allows us to examine three sets of relationships in detail and in doing so gives us insight as to just why trust is so important to success. Recommended. Grady Harp".

I believe the first intention of Franois Ozon is to remember that behind every divorce there is a couple that loved each other in the past that decided to marry each other expecting to live together and raise a family of their own. However relationships usually deteriorate and time destroys everything including love. In these fragmented glimpses of the lives of Marion and Gilles the viewer does not see exactly when their love ended but after their initial encounter there are many signs suggesting the beginning of the end the adultery of Marion in the wedding night the absence of Gilles in the birth of his son his consented participation in an orgy in the presence of Marion visibly showing one sort of last attempt to save their empty marriage. Further to the good screenplay the outstanding and strong performances of the sexy Valeria BruniTedeschi and Stphane Freiss give the credibility to the characters.

	schema:reviewBody "Going into the cinema I had high expectations for 5x2. The reviews were glowing the plot and structure sounded intriguing and I have a genuine love of French cinema. I came out hugely disappointed.Mistakenly? I had hoped to see a film which showed some feeling and insight into the tragic decline and ultimate disintegration of a marriage and relationship between two people. And yes while it's true that we do witness various stages of a marriage falling apart what we don't ever see is any kind of meaningful relationship or feelings between any of the characters in the film. They are all so selfcentered and one dimensional that it's a mystery that any of them are actually in a relationship in the first place. And it's even harder to care what happenshappened to them.There's a few attempts to give the film some edge  a couple of she's being raped... oh actually she's enjoying it scenes that give misogyny a bad name and a supposedly shocking tale of a mixed heterohomo orgy complete with gasp! poppers and cocaine  but ultimately the whole experience is a grey limp and lifeless one. The introduction of an analogy to seemingly still waters hiding dangerous currents beneath is truly groan worthy and a special mention has to go the American character that appears midway through the film  his presence is memorable despite its brevity by being one the most toe curlingly wooden performances I have ever seen.In the end 5x2 left me depressed. Depressed at the thought that anyone could relate to the socalled marriage that is central to this film and its cold insular world.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Agar is the green second lieutenant David Brian is his company commander and Frank Lovejoy is the avuncular top sergeant herding the platoon through the hedgerows of Normandy after landing on the beach in 1944. Agar is passable. Brian has the John Wayne role of the tough distant taskmaster who secretly knows every man in the platoon by his first name but will never admit it. Lovejoy is not the most expressive actor who ever lived but he's always likable.As for the men in the platoon let's see. 1 A goodnatured Southern redneck who cries when his dog is killed. 2 A tough kid from the streets of Chicago. 3 A goofy looking comedian who impersonates movie stars. 4 An ambitious corporal who thinks of nothing but running for Congress when it's all over. 5 The older pipesmoking family man who is a reassuring presence. 6 A dimwitted muscle man who avoid noxious foods and women either of which might drain him of his lan. 7 The kid with glasses too young to vote. 7 The Jewish kid from the Bronx who shares his salami with the others.There is a good deal of banter  there always is  but no serious conflict among the men. Brian's company commander is hard on everyone but he has a heart of well not gold but not stone either. The banter is absolutely terrible all forced gaiety. The writers seem to know quite a bit about Army protocol and equipment but nothing about producing a screenplay. The usual girls show up improbably from time to time.Two scenes do stand out though amidst the dross. In the first one a German tanks is trundling implacably along a sunken road between the hedge rows. The platoon has nothing to stop its advance. But William Campbell already wounded climbs aboard the tank from the rear and destroys it with a grenade. The others shout at him telling him to jump off before the Panzer blows and Campbell cries out I can't! I ain't got no LEGS. The second scene provides the climax. Brian is relieved of command of the company and booted upstairs with a promotion to major. Both he and his superiors know he's not needed at staff but he's pustular with tension and is about to pop. He turns the company over to Agar along with his own silver firstlieutenant's bar. It doesn't sound like much I know but it's played well almost entirely without sentiment.It might be worth adding that the advance through the hedgerows was as difficult and costly as it was not just because of the terrain but because the German withdrawal was so skillfully managed. The Germans would hold out against the advancing Allies until the last minute but before leaving their shell holes and trenches they would have them zeroed in for mortar fire  hole by hole. They left mines at the bottom of some of them.".

The rifle company breaking out of the Normandy beachhead then fought its way through the bloody and vicious battles of the hedgerows in the Normandy countryside to finally to the outskirts of the French town SaintLo. It was the breakout at SaintLo that in the end put the Germans forces to flight right out of France.Lead by its company commander Captain Tom Hale David Brian the rifle company got pinned down in the hedgerows that made it's use of amour or tank and artillery support as well as air power totally useless. It was the close quarters combat that started to slowly grind down Capt. Hale's men with reinforcements or replacements slow in coming. It's Capt. Hale's second in command Lt. Joe Mallory John Agar and the company's top kick sergeant Pete Bell Frank Lovejoy who kept the men together in the fighting even though Captain Hale after three years of combat experience started showing signs of not only battle fatigue but mental deterioration.Trying to distance himself from the men under his command Capt. Hale thought that would isolate him from knowing about themselves and their friends and families back home when any were killed or wounded. All these pent up feeling started to get to Capt. Hale leaving him a wreck of a man by the time his company was to participate in the final breakout at the French strategic town of SaintLo. It's then that Captain Hale was relieved of his command and kicked upstairs to Divisional Headquarters with Let. Mallory taking over. Let. Mallory in the end didn't let the now almost committable Capt. Hale down in the bitter fighting that was to come. But at the same time he realized what Capt. Hale meant by not getting too close to him men. It can do more damage to a company commander then a direct his from a German 88.Great combat scenes many taken from actual US Army combat photographers make the film Breakout one of the best and most honest there's no phony Hollywood wartime heroics here movie about WWII in how it was really fought.

He notably took part in Alain Corneau's thriller Srie Noire 1979 five years after this adaptation of his own novel. Shot by Bernard Quesyanne and awarded with the Jean Vigo prize the filmmaker found an adequate cinematographic language to capture the somewhat desolate spirit of the novel.A student who's about to end his studies decides overnight to stay completely indifferent to the world that surrounds him. It's a silent black  white movie only enhanced by a woman voice over which introduces the young hero to the audience and comments from his own standpoint his actions. Although we don't know the reasons of his retirement from the world we learn many things of his lifestyle his bedroom his wage his eating habits his wandering all over Paris etc... It's interesting to note down the mellow voiceover of the woman that gradually gets worried and angered. Indeed our student is at first completely silent and indifferent but then anxiety fear overcome here. Is it really possible to stay indifferent like that during a lifetime? Is there a possible exit?This film could be a cousin of Alain Jessua's debut film La Vie A L'Envers 1964 in which a man stops to comply to the routine of everyday life. Such is also the case here. Only the voiceover enables the audience to penetrate the empty soul of this young man and to try to decipher his thoughts although as I previously said his motivations to refrain from social life remain blurred. Through him Prec wanted to express his view on French society but in a neutral way. He was always interested in it and showcased it in several of his books especially La Vie Mode D'Emploi 1978. Given the anguished tone adopted by the voice in the second half of the film the writer probably feels fear towards the banality and the mundane character of everyday life that offers no exits. Perhaps that's what our main hero tries to do to stay in silence to try to discover another world. But it is bound to fail. So what to do?Jacques Spiesser is perfectly directed and his expressionless faces capture the nothingness he voluntarily creates all around him. He is at the center of an arty film which tries and succeed to depict the humdrum common life that can verge towards absurdity.".

Whenever I watch a film that audiences or critics viewed as being existential I am always left with some degree of disappointment although I liked all of these films because the existential themes were not as explicitly expressed as I hoped it would. Fight Club I Heart Huckabees and American Beauty were a few that came to being pretty downtoearth about the intended existential themes. However I find this specific film Un Homme Qui Dort The Man Who Sleeps to be very blatant about the intended existential themes. When you watch the film you do not have to try to look for any existential cues as you would in other films and consequently dub one of them as An Existential Film. In this film the existential theme becomes a completely disclosed reality through both visual scenes music and secondperson narrative monologue. The secondperson narrative monologue can be little dry repetitive and occasionally boring but it is also full of the use of metaphors similes and existential terms Existence Emptiness etc. that conveys the boundless empty depth of the modern soul. This does not only express itself through the monotone and speech of the secondperson narrative but also in visual scenes such as a wide empty road an empty hall or an empty subway. In this films...existentialism is right in your face...because it captivates the indifferent motion of the mundane reality in various facets. It conveys meaning to captivate meaninglessness. The transition from unauthentic artificial living towards the selfrealization that one's existence is vulnerable obscure and contingent becomes apparent in the film as well.I personally think that while the film can be a little dry and boring to most people who are use to the the adrenaline rush that Hollywood tries to enhance the film offers something very valuable that I haven't found in other films. Rather than constructing a reality through plot characters acting specialeffects script etc this film makes existence as it understands it as explicable as possible. It is by this intent and the success of it that I have this film a full rating.".

	schema:reviewBody "This criminally underrated 1974 film easily ranks among the likes of Pickpocket Breathless and The 400 Blows as among the greatest films in french cinema. This film chronicles a young man who has dropped from his studies and is trying to distance himself from the world around but starts finding it increasingly hard. Shot in black and white the film feels like a new wave film with it's raw low budget cinematography having a grainy and gritty look that punctuates the intense somber mood of the film. Scenes in darkened areas are reminiscent of noir films in their use of shadow and the editing is generally quick sometimes with a musical flow. In addition to the imagery the story is conveyed through a second person female narrator second person meaning the narrator is always referring to you such as you do or don't get up. Interestingly whenever the situation becomes more anxious and desperate the narrator's normally flat tone starts to become more panicked or angry. So while the film may seem initially as just a woman talking about something this man is doing in reality it does have a albeit abstract character arc.Although at times trying on the patience this film's style ultimately pays off creating a completely unique and engrossing experience. The slow subtle deteoration of the main character's mental state spills into your mind. I was rarely bored while watching thanks to the powerful imagery and raw minimalist atmosphere. The detachment our lead is trying to create is perfectly conveyed. The film recreates the tedium and a sort of numb pain the depravity desperation and entrapment this attempted lifestyle leads to.If you want a more traditional narrative certainly look elsewhere. If what you've read here and in other reviews sounds interesting than this is probably the film for you.".

First the screenplay is terrible with many clichs and holes and awful characters. The restricted budget associated to the reasonable acting make this direct to DVD movie forgettable and a waste of time. My vote is four.Title Brazil A Cela 2 The Cell 2".

First the screenplay is terrible with many clichs and holes and awful characters. The restricted budget associated to the reasonable acting make this direct to DVD movie forgettable and a waste of time. My vote is four.Title Brazil A Cela 2 The Cell 2";

Shot on no budget this Utahlensed video makes little effort in the special effects department in stark contrast to The Cell with its operatic sets and imaginative use of CGI. So it's pretty much a standard criminal pursuit film and the truth is one can get more kick out of an episode of TV's Criminal Intent. Toward the end for a few seconds we get to see our clairvoyant heroine all gussied up. And I must admit I wouldn't mind spending a little time with her.

In the 'first' movie I'm starting to think that the relation between the two is nothing more than the name and the first two shots of the second one the dream scape was immersing creative and beautiful sometimes in a creepy way. In The Cell 2 the dream scape is just a cheap effect a few squiggly lines at the edges of the screen. Storywise it lacks any continuity. Instead of having to be suspended in the air hooked up to some extreme high tech system in weird suites the main character is half awake while in the back of a plane holding a personal item of someone involved. Somehow they took that awesome dreamsurfing equipment and made it some bluetooth dongle stuck to her head. Furthermore The shots look cheap as do the sets. The tactics used by the police or swat are not remotely realistic and quite frankly make them look like a fart of the antagonist could blow them away. Now all of this would not be ultimate gamebreaking stuff but i just saw The Cell 1 only two hours ago and was hoping for some more psychedelicdreamycrimehorrorthrillersexychickslopez movie but instead I got ' a shot at the bigtime 'Not every director has a huge budget and there's nothing wrong with that but somehow this director acquired a ' The Cell ' license and then ran out of money.

Maya who could only access your subconscious mindor whatever and check out some of your memories at the beginning of the movie can towards the end almost control mentally the way you function?!

	schema:reviewBody "The Cusp is a killer who repeatedly kills his victims then brings them back to life until they beg to die. Some psychic chick has to go into the killer's mind to find his latest victim before she is killed.I'm a fanatic for the first film. On a scale of 1 to 10 my excitement was about a 15 when I heard this sequel was being made. When I found out it was going directtovideo that excitement plummeted to a 2. Looking back I realize that even after that drop to a 2 I was way overexcited for this movie. Yes  it's THAT bad.The plot doesn't sound too terrible. I like the idea of a killer making his victims beg for death and doing that by actually killing them is interesting. But the delivery of this concept was painfully lame. The victims don't put very much effort into their performances at all. The first girl who's getting her heart cut out responds as if it's only a minor inconvenience. Seriously I picture the director behind the camera saying Okay now act like you're in mild discomfort. I also thought the killer would be using some ritual or something interesting but instead he's using legit medical practices. One example is suffocating his victim with a plastic bag then performing CPR to revive her. It's just not very interesting. I'm not sure if a ritual would be much better but what we're given is just underwhelming.There are so many little details about this movie that are just flatout tacky. First of all the intro to the movie is a short clip from the first film during which a narrator says something about how a psychic entered the mind of a killer and now ... there is another. This is the only time we hear the narrator's voice. It feels rushed and stupid. It had me and my friend laughing mere seconds into the movie. Then during the end credits we see aerial shots from a helicopter. Half of the shots have the chopper's shadow in view. It seems like they spent half of their budget on renting this helicopter so they were milking it for all they could. Then the credits stop twice to showcase brief behindthescenes shots. Both of these shots are boring and offer absolutely nothing interesting. There's no point in their presence whatsoever. Any class that the picture could have had is flushed down the toilet by dumb little moments like these.An especially tacky aspect of the script is the use of FBI vs. local cop clichs. Not only is the local cop the hero while the FBI guy is almost a villain for doing his job but this movie teaches me that it's okay for a cop to tightly grip an FBI agent's testicles and threaten him in order to get a point across. Apparently he won't get fired arrested or sued for sexual harassment. Wow. You learn something new every day.The only connection this story has with the first movie is A. the brief intro that simply mentions JLo's character B. the general concept of entering a killer's mind to save one of his victims and C. the ethnicity of the main characters. It really seemed that they cast the leading lady in this sequel for her ethnic appearance rather than acting ability. There was no reason for this. We don't care what ethnicity she is we just want someone who can act.The way they depict the mind in this sequel is nowhere near as stylish or visually interesting as it is in the first movie. I feel like I shouldn't rag on this aspect too much since they were obviously on a very small budget. There is one very small visual that's slightly interesting when you see it in context but it's delivered with horrible CGI.There is one area in which this movie genuinely impressed me. I was blown away by this movie's ability to make the most simple moments hilarious through awful editing camerawork and performances. There's a part where two FBI agents are chasing after the two main characters. It doesn't sound funny but the horrendous editing effortless camera work and HALFASSED JOGGING of the actors makes the scene side splittingly hilarious. There's also a carchase scene that is made incredibly funny by the awful camerawork and editing. This is honestly one of those movies that I'd show to film students as an example of what NOT to do.Overall the movie has one or two interesting ideas wrapped into the script but the weak acting lazy filmmaking crappy writing and tacky moments make this movie funny as hell and there are no interesting visuals to save it. I find this movie just as entertaining as the first film but only because it's so hilariously terrible.".

I cannot even call it a B movie C or D movie at best... plain waste of money and time... You will figure out everything after the first 4 minutes. If this movie is your choice for a rental rent another one with it or your movie night will be ruined.

No friggin' way time was not kind to him but he did a great job in this movie. I was a little baffled by most of the actors in this especially the lead actress Tessie Santiago who seems to be in a trance most of the time is it because she's under the spell of The Cusp killer? I think that was the direction but it just wound up making her dull.

As he leans forwards in pain you can clearly see the fact that the axe is rubber and the blade is bent at right angles to the guys back. The fact that this is left in the final cut should tell you something about the quality of this film. The fact it was called 'The Cell 2' seems just a vehicle to get bums on seats. Whereas the first was an imaginary well shot and directed movie with real suspense and a feeling of dread this movie is boring predicable and plods along waiting for something to happen but never does. I'm sure one of the special effects used in this movie is actually a superimposed screensaver from youknowwhich software giant. Watch it and I'm sure you will spot it.Even if you have seen it many times watching the first one again or any other film for that matter will be way more enjoyable than trying to sit through this waste of time.".

It was so incredibly dry unemotional and boring that even if the script was good which it most definitely was not it wouldn't have helped. I was not drawn in even a bit by any of the characters in this film and in a film of this genre you sort of need to be to enjoy it.Then we have the villain who was so contrived and boring that it took all of the anxiety and depth away from the film. The socalled heroes were an absolute pain to watch as they fumbled over their lines and delivered a performance memorable only for its lack of talent.The special effects were reminiscent of early 90s power rangers episodes I think that's enough said there.The actual plot was annoying and underdeveloped. The general idea had some merit to it but the angle they took with the herovillain interaction ruined it for me just too farfetched for this kind of movie. The direction as well made this feel like a home made film and not in a good way. It was just scene after scene of amateur shooting. I'm not a film buff by any means and even I thought it was horrible. They even showed you some behind the scenes shots at the end so make sure you stay tuned through the credits....wow.You'll notice I gave this film 3 out of 10 stars... that's because the last 1020 minutes of the film might have warranted 45 stars whereas the first 90 probably 12 stars so I averaged them. Though to be fair I'm not sure if the end was better than the beginning or if I was just getting excited that it was almost over.Also of note I haven't seen the original The Cell so no it's not like I went into this expecting a similar movie to the original I had no basis for comparison.Anyway if you decide to watch this regardless of my warnings above I'll leave the I told you so here for you when you're done.

Having lived in SLC I also appreciated all the shots of the city and the big ending when they crashland the helicopter in the baseball park!Overall I was definitely pleased with my purchase and time on this one. Really great crime thriller and in a lot of ways this one was better than the first Cell!".

Maya is really hot too. whaley had a really interesting take on the serial killer and did a good job. having watched a lot of garbage in the last few weeks it was really refreshing to watch a film that kept it simple and effective like this one. won't win any awards but it's a great move for date night or for 2pm in the afternoon on a Wednesday.".

The girl is hot and I would've liked to see more nudity. I recommend watching this and under the right circumstances as it is an enjoyable film.

	schema:reviewBody "Review I'm surprised that this movie wasn't bigger than it was because it's quite an epic movie with some fairly big names in the cast. I did find the leading character a bit annoying but Michael Sheen was a joy to watch. The storyline wasn't bad either. Basically it's about young boy whose looking for his kidnapped brother whilst on a quest to find a magical box which can turn anything into gold. With the help of Michael Sheen he ends up working in a hotel which is were all the clues lead to find his brother and the box. It's not exactly Indianna Jones but it's a mysterious tale which leads the audience down many different avenues after following the many clues. I think that the director wasted a lot of time on trivial matters in the middle of the movie but the showdown at the end was half decent and it looked very glossy. Personally I thought that the movie was OK and I'm surprised that it made such a lose at the box office. Average!RoundUp I think this movie would have been much better if Michael Sheen and Sam Neill had more scenes and if there was an actor with more screen charisma playing the lead. The director left the storyline open for a sequel but judging by the lose at the box office I doubt that we will be seeing one anytime soon which is a shame because the concept wasn't that bad. All the clues did seem to drop on the main characters lap with ease but he did have the help of his new found friend who he falls in love with and the great Sheen who helped his partner in many sticky situations. In all I honestly think that people would enjoy this film if they gave it a chance but you do have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it.Budget 25million Worldwide Gross 14000 Terrible!I recommend this movie to people who are into there mysterious magical movies about a quest to find a magical box which can turn anything into gold. 510".

Aneurin Barnard was fantastic as 'Mariah Mundi'! He has such an interesting and emotional look with the acting chops to really pull off this role I also loved him in The White Queen. Michael Sheen totally pulled of the character of 'Captain Will Charity'. He was hilarious and deeply serious all at the same time. Watch him in Unthinkable some time and witness what this thespian has to offer. Lena Headley has cemented her role as a self seeking witch I LOVE GAME OF THRONES but she always plays the 'Cersi' role..branch out babe!. Sam Neil was great as always. And I must give props to the young Xavier Atkins for his portrayal of 'Felix' he was great.Overall if you let your children watch films like Hugo they will enjoy this one!".

The dialogue really does not help and everything is far too obvious there are no secrets in this film our main hero confides everything he knows to a scullery girl he has never even met before and she believes it all without question. The screenplay does not really make sense either and just adds to the lack of suspense worse still is the complete lack of spatial continuity you continually feel that the locations chosen do not flow and the film jars from one place to the next.

But it is a fantasy movie anything goes....The story line is not very clear and sometimes even confusing. It shows an American train style and the set was supposed to be in England. On top of that the kid actor was acting like as if it was on stage performance. I can not understand what they see behind the camera that they did not catch this kind of bad acting...And of course there is this Hollywood things. Part of the act was when they try to steal something from the office. Being a thief does not make somebody being cautious but hey.... take as much time as you need and explore instead of getting the important information. There is no sense of urgency that you can see on the face of the actors who's doing it. And if you have something valuable given to you to safeguard flaunt it so that everybody can see that you have it so they can steal or take it. For something with a budget of 25 millions I expect more on the script. Better makeup better plot and consistent story are the least that they can do. I would have considered this one as a B grade movie but the budget seems a bit too much for a B grade. If you don't have anything to do and have a bit of extra money to waste then this might be the movie to see.".

No doubt if I knew the book which I assume is aimed at the YA steampunk audience I would have followed the plot with more clarity. This isn't a bad movie but there are plot jumps that leave you wondering if you missed something while reaching for some popcorn. Definitely needed those transitions that are probably on some cutting room floor. While it seems clear this film was shot with a sequel in mind you can watch it as a stand alone. Basically if you are home and it's a rainy or snowy day and you want a well shot escapist film to watch then this is a contender. Plot is basic Before parents disappear they hide two parts of amulet with their children along with a cryptic warning younger brother gets taken by bad guys older brother goes in search of younger sibling and gets some help along the way and relatively happy ending with cliffhanger. Think of it as Warehouse 13 in 19th Century.".

There are three women in the movie one is the mother of the protagonist one is his love interest and the other is the sexy lover or wife of the main villain.

I am so sick to death of this trite sexist racist Hollywoodstyle crap. I'm starting to turn into JD Salinger and dread movies.

	schema:reviewBody "I came across the DVD having never heard of this film. It was a fun family adventure film similar to the Mummy series. I like the fantasyreality world of set in the 1800's with the wild inventions and crazy machines. Micheal Sheen's character was well done and I would like to see more of him in this role. You can tell the movie is based on a teen adventure novel as it wasn't too complex and has some plot holes. I think more time could have been spent on them events leading up to the main movie plot. The race to find various magical antiquities leaves endless options for future films. Sadly as the box office was small I doubt there will be a sequel even though the movie sets the stage for this to be one of many adventures. Overall it is an enjoyable film.".

Of course momentous events forces the trio together and the villains are in for a major beating.The settings and moods are much darker and has a strange gothic 1960s air to it. It focuses on the motivations and fears of the main characters their hopes to rebuild the future hopes of escaping to a safer place their hopes to rescue loved ones etc. Worries of the Chinese takeover are quite everpresent.When the first one was whacky roughandtumble this movie is more slow paced and thougtful and beautifully shot. I just LOVE the trainstation scene with its slo mo cartridges and yellow lighting. It has a more desperate theme where the villains succeed and the heroes fail and despair.Although the story contains a few glitches like sudden and unmotivated slapstick in the midst of tragedy or the never seen before or again carwrecker villain the fan of the HKcinema has learned to overlook and enjoy such anomalies.

I for one only liked Heroic Trio as a novelty though it was good  it just lacked something...that something was a devastated future where everyone is being oppressed. Since it is set in the future after an atomic blast the Heroic Trio has gone their separate ways and is now under the thumb of a cruel mastermind that controls the clean water supply. However this mastermind wishes for absolute control and seeks to destroy the ruling military government. It is up to the Heroic Trio to unite once more to stop his evil ambitions before he can complete his coup and rule the entire country. That is where the fun really starts and never lets up. This one has much more action and plot than the first one could have ever hoped to achieve. The Heroic Trio is no longer a one dimensional force of fighting women but they all have new lives...they have roles to fill other than fighting crime now...and most of all they all have better things to do than play super hero. When one of them finally decides to step up she is soon imprisoned for her efforts. Though this spawns her former comrades into action it is not without heavy loss. That too was lacking in the original nobody cool seemed to die. This one has death galore everyone from new supporting cast to one of the heroes eventually meets a violent and untimely end. When you factor in the harsh reality of a world affected by military rule and radiation it just boils over into a delightful affair.This movie is a great kungfu epic and a worthy successor to the beloved Heroic Trio. I could not ask for anything more...if you like high flying mayhem conspiracy and a generally fun story then I would get this movie at any cost.".

If you like The Heroic Trio this is well worth checking out. It's not that film's equal but it is an aboveaverage action film in its own right.";

The director in charge of this flawed albeit spectacularly entertaining flick is Johnny To. True to most Asian martial arts cinema To keeps the action fast furious and completely unbelievable.

In crashes our heroines riding fullthrottle on a motorcycle and they somehow ride up on the wall and jump off  spiraling  toward the henchman. The day you see a flying motorcycle in an American martial arts movie or any other movie is the day pigs fly and CGI can make it happen unless you stuff a hog in a cannon. But the story of The Heroic Trio is that the three rival superheroines Invisible Woman Yeoh Wonder Woman Mui and Thief Catcher Cheung must band together if they are to find out who is responsible for several babynappings in Hong Kong. All possess great powers and abilities and their mission will take them from the streets and backalleys of the city to the demonic underworld.

	schema:reviewBody "Ching Siu Tung the master of wire work and Johnnie To the director of incredible The Big Heat directed Heroic Trio in 1992. It stars three incredible beauties Anita Mui Maggie Cheung and Michelle Yeoh. The story is very confusing but these ladies play Thief Catcher Cheung Wonder Woman Mui and Invisible Girl Yeoh somewhere in future where evil demon is kidnapping little babies in town and it is soon revealed that he wants to train one of them to become the future king of China. The Demon has a helper played by very talented actor Anthony Wong The Untold Story Hard Boiled Full Contact etc. who can fight and keep intruders away from the demon master and babies. These three fighting ladies are on the trail of that baby stealing demon and they start their fight for justice as the babies must get back safe. The story has some twists and turns so it may seem a little confusing at first viewing but the main merits of the film are not in the plot but in the outrageous and unbelievable action scenes from which director Ching Siu Tung is best known. His most important films include Duel to the Death the debut Witch From Nepal and Swordsman films among many others. He is known also as the wire master and it is easy to tell why.Heroic Trio is fantastic fantasy film and will blow the viewer away if one is not familiar with these kind of Orient wonders. These films have no equivalent in Western cinema. In Heroic Trio there hardly are any slow moments and only little of the usual stupid slapstick humor that ruins little otherwise great films like Savior of the Soul and Ching Siu Tung's Terra Cotta Warrior. Heroic Trio is pure action and visuality and it is easy to love because there are practically no negative points in the film considering this is pretty harmless fantasy genre.The photography and atmosphere is stunning! The streets of Hong Kong are very misty and the greatest scenes are in the underworld in which the demon lives. It is hard to describe with words how this film looks like. The camera twists and flows smoothly and there seems not to be limits for visuality in these films. The fight scenes are great as usual as wires are used and people fly high and camera shoots every detail in every possible angle. Ching Siu Tung is also action director and choreographer and he has served in these roles in films like Tsui Hark's Zu Warriors From the Magic Mountain and John Woo's The Killer and A Better Tomorrow 2. Films in which Ching Siu Tung are involved are usually totally overthetop magic fests and thus very unique even in Hong Kong cinema.There is no any particular content in Heroic Trio and it is kind of empty but if one can tolerate that and enjoy the visual perfection of this action film then Heroic Trio is among the greatest Asian fantasy films. The sequel is far more serious as the atmosphere is very dark and holocaust like and it is easy to see symbols about Hong Kong's future in 1997..Heroic Trio has also very memorable music soundtrack and the film won even some prize for its theme song in Hong Kong movie awards or some other movie contest. The music is especially brilliant and sort of ominous in the underworld scenes with the sleeping and waking evil demon. The atmosphere is so brilliant and the feel is just like one would feel in demon's cave! The soundtrack is great throughout but those particular demon scenes are definitely worth a mentioning. Heroic Trio is not too serious film it is just action fantasy almost as fantastic as they come but if there had been some theme or message in the film it probably would've been even greater as a whole. A Chinese Ghost Story also Ching Siu Tung's film is perfect example of this both visually unbeatable and still spiritually noteworthy. I like Heroic Trio still very much because the look of the film is so unique and this was actually the first of these Orient fantasy films I ever saw and thus I was very amazed when I first saw this. Now after second viewing the magic's still there and the movie has not lost its impact on me.Heroic Trio is 910 film and is among the greatest if not the cleverest Hong Kong fantasies ever made. There are many many others too but Heroic Trio is proudly among them.".

The movie indeed is style over substance and there are many great moments...visual moments that will leave the inexperienced HK viewer in sheer awe. However in spite of the many great moments this movie is not necessarily what it has been made out to be.The main problems exist with the action scenes. They are choreographed by Ching Siu Tung whose credits include the Swordsman series A Chinese Ghost Story and Dr. Wai to name a few. The action scenes are much too short and the sword fights look like exhibitions there's no intensity in them. Also there is little real martial arts in the whole film. Michelle Yeoh's talents are essentially wasted except in a quick fight w Anthony Wong at the beginning. There are some great moments in this film. Anita Mui running across the telephone wires the flying motorcycle in the train station and such. The wire work and cinematography is very good and almost aweinspiring at times. The special FX are pretty good as well.This movie is a lot like Swordsman II. There's a lot of awesome visions and visual delights but the action lacks any intensity and the talents of the leads are wasted both Jet Li in Swordsman II and Michelle Yeoh in this. In the end the film is entertaining but is essentially overrated for what it is.".

The sets costumes and special effects are very cheesy but in an amusing way. It reminds one of Bmovies except that this one is entertaining. Of course there's hardly much of story or character development but that obviously wasn't the filmmaker's priority either. For me it's always at least worth seeing a movie that has the feisty Michelle Khan Yeoh the elegant late Anita Mui and the sensational Maggie Cheung playing lead roles. All three actresses do a fantastic job. While Cheung provides excellent comic relief in a very funny biker outfit Mui and Khan Yeoh in quirky superhero outfits carry the more intense and dramatic sequences. The rest of the cast is pretty hilariously awful but that adds comic value to the film. The cotton horned villain is a riot and man is he tough to kill. The cinematography is first rate and the choreography of the action sequences are superbly done. 'Dung Fong Saam Hap' is Hong Kong ActionAdventureFantasyComedy at its best.".

You see the mighty and respected Wonder Woman who can jump and fight acrobatically and walk on power lines may have met her match in Invisible Woman the seemingly evil perpetrator of said kidnappings. Getting involved in the whole mess is Thief Catcher a sassy motorcycleriding and buttkicking yet bumbling babe who offers her aid in uncovering the absent infants for a price. This swell movie combines great special effects with overthetop situations and characters. True it can be moving at times like the artful moments concerning Invisible Woman and her dying boyfriend but depending on your mood or sense of humor most scenes come off as hilarious just owing to the fact that absurd things happen while the characters take them so seriously. A scene of Thief Catcher throwing grenades at little kids and the little kids wetting themselves might seem shocking to some but I found it ludicrous and funny.  Of the three leads Anita Mui and Michelle Yeoh are superb but special mention must be saved for Maggie Cheung who's Thief Catcher is tremendously funny while remaining valiant and sexy she also has the coolest outfit of the three and gets all the good lines.".

Getting involved in the whole mess is Thief Catcher a sassy motorcycleriding and buttkicking yet bumbling babe who offers her aid in uncovering the absent infants for a price. This swell movie combines great special effects with overthetop situations and characters. True it can be moving at times like the artful moments concerning Invisible Woman and her dying boyfriend but depending on your mood or sense of humor most scenes come off as hilarious just owing to the fact that absurd things happen while the characters take them so seriously. A scene of Thief Catcher throwing grenades at little kids and the little kids wetting themselves might seem shocking to some but I found it ludicrous and funny.  Of the three leads Anita Mui and Michelle Yeoh are superb but special mention must be saved for Maggie Cheung who's Thief Catcher is tremendously funny while remaining valiant and sexy she also has the coolest outfit of the three and gets all the good lines.";

It must be hidden very well for the film made little sense to me. Something along the lines of Demon trains girls to become action heros but fires two of them before they grow up. Then decides he wants a male baby to conquer the world for him and has 18 of them kidnapped from hospitals by his last remaining female disciple. There's also an invisibility cloak some police officers and other nonsense in there but on the whole the idea of story seems quite tertiary compared to action So story Rubbish confused and created by combining various stereotypes.But action movies can entertain even without stories see The Warrior King  one of the worst scripts ever but also fantastic action. Heroic Trio however can't. It has dated badly Seeing thick wires carry the heroes desperately calls for some digital retouching. In some scenes you can even see a giant circular plate above them from which the wires are suspended making them look like marionettes. So wirefu may have been pioneering but is outdated and quite terrible. Fine. What about martial arts action? Mostly it consists of people standing about 4 metres apart and making quick movements with their hands and feet. Somehow the illusion that the actors were fighting was rather unconvincing  it looked more like a video game or a dance certainly nothing where any kind of contact might ever have occurred.Bad story... bad action... and to top it off ridiculous special effects. By the time you see a very flimsy puppet and later a rubber backpack used for a monster you realise this film could be bettered by student productions.Oh and the heroes get away with kidnapping and accidentally killing babies without a second thought. It's probably the only innovative thing about it but it seems too much like an afterthought inserted for a five second moment of fake poignancy in the middle rather than a well thought out plot element.Basically watch this film drunk with friends if you want to laugh at something terrible ideally with sarcastic commentary. Don't watch it for a good story good action good FX or any quality apart from being so bad it's funny.Heroic Trio  Attack of the Killertomatoes for martial arts films.".

	schema:reviewBody "Never turning up on television long out of print on video and never released to DVD HOUSE OF THE LONG SHADOWS has fallen prey to neglect in recent times. To a degree this is understandable taken purely on its own HOUSE at first seems to emerge a bit disappointing today. The oftcited problem is that the four horror stars seem painfully marginalized in order to make way for Desi Arnaz Jr. But when seen in a larger context HOUSE rises far above its humble origins and becomes something much greater than the sum of its parts. Much like James Whale's THE OLD DARK HOUSE  a film that shares much in common with HOUSE  it is a film that requires multiple viewings to fully appreciate.Just as Universal's Dracula of 1931 inspired and influenced a cycle of horror films that would grow mature mutate and ultimately flounder in various forms till the late Forties so too did another horror zeitgeist bloom during the late Fifties Sixties and Seventies. The British studio that had produced 1957's groundbreaking THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN Hammer Films found great success in the genre over the next twenty years not infrequently making use of Christopher Dracula Lee and Peter Frankenstein Cushing. Meanwhile in Hollywood American International found their superstar in Vincent Price whom they headlined in a series of literate atmospheric Edgar Allan Poe adaptations beginning with THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER in 1960. Eventually this series too would cross the Atlantic. The popularity and profitability of these scare shows insured a legion of secondrate cheapness from various entities many of which utilized Shakespearian actor and erstwhile Universal horror veteran John Carradine who crept his arthritic way through such lowbudgeters as GALLERY OF HORRORS and BLOOD OF DRACULA'S CASTLE.But by 1982 this cycle of traditional horrors had seemingly come to a dead end. Hammer and AIP were no longer producing feature films and most of the great horror stars of the time were now electing to either shoot for mainstream success or a semiretirement save for the occasional film and television cameo appearance. As the Eighties dawned too the genre was foregoing Gothic horror in favor of the summer camp bloodbath the holiday massacre and the dreamslaying slasher. In the midst of these gruesome developments however director Pete Walker not unfamiliar with bloody subject matter himself decided to provide the oldfashioned approach one last goaround and gather the very icons of that style to do it.The plot is old humbug another revitalization of Earl Derr Bigger's old standard Seven Keys to Baldpate which had been filmed a number of times before. Jaded novelist Arnaz accepts a bet from his impish publisher Richard Todd which involves him spending 24 hours in an old Welsh mansion and writing a Brontelike Gothic story. As the stormy night progresses various dodgy characters turn up who as it emerges are all members of the benighted Grisbane family gathered on this night to release a horrible secret in the attic. Before long various unwary visitors  as well as the Grisbanes themselves  begin to be murdered in grisly ways by a mysterious psychopath. Many twists and turns later the narrative works its way toward a lighthearted conclusion.There had long been plans to unite the four horror superstars in one film but scheduling conflicts had made it impossible. Finally the opportunity arrived with this project and all are well served by their roles here. Each is allowed to indulge in his particular acting persona. Price is flamboyant and theatrical Lee imperious and sinister Cushing genteel and sympathetic Carradine sonorous and stentorian. Price in particular excels here and this was his last real opportunity to shine in a fullfledged horror film. Though he would return to the genre two more times before his death in 1993 neither his embarrassing appearance as an expletivespewing sorcerer in BLOODBATH IN THE HOUSE OF DEATH or his cantankerous turn hosting THE OFFSPRING can compare to his grandly overstated Lionel Grisbane. In particular Lionel's pitched introduction at the doorway is unforgettable a true highlight of horror cinema.If there is a major regret here it's that Cannon opted to recut the film for some theatrical showings  and that's the version released to VHS years ago. This move appears to have been done in order to play up the horror content and mute the comedy. Though I've never seen the original cut it almost unquestionably would have been preferable. Both Price and Cushing seemed to feel so and lamented the fact that many of the comic buildups were left in only to have the punch lines cut. The real loss was the original end credits sequences in which each member of the cast steps out of character to take a final bow.But in the end the shortcomings matter little. HOUSE stands as truly the last of its kind and more than that can be seen as the point of embarkation for a new style. Just as Universal provided the iconographic monsters of the Thirties and Forties with a peculiarly reverential sendoff in ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEN so too does HOUSE OF THE LONG SHADOWS allow its four veteran bogeymen of the Sixties and Seventies to gracefully bow out in character and with their dignity intact. It's sublimely appropriate that the film should meld Eighties slasherbodycount horror themes gruesomely accented ax murders stabbings acid baths etc. with the traditional Gothic approach these men specialized in by taking part in those very situations themselves Price Lee Cushing and Carradine thereby pass the torch to the knifewielding maniacs that would come to rule the genre in their place. Seen in this light the film's faults seem to considerably melt away and one realizes what a true unique gem we have here. That is a lighthearted but affectionate goodbye to twentyfive years of classic horror films executed with great deft and style.".

Vincent Price Peter Cushing Christopher Lee and John Carradine are the big four and their presence alone makes seeing this film a must.  I don't think any other film had three of these men in the same film same time and same scenesScream and Scream Again has Lee Cushing and Price but Cushing does not share screen time with either Lee or Price.  The men are all still great to see and brought a flood of nostalgia to me as they made their entrances into the film.  The film however is weak and there really is no denying that.  I like the film because of the four boogeymen but cannot say in good faith that it is a good film.  It is not.  The story concerns an author having a bet with his publisher to stay in a creepy place and produce a book in one evening for twenty thousand dollars.  It is a very worn plot and to make matters worse the scriptwriter butchers his way through the script trying to squeeze out anything that might have been thoughtful and original.  The male lead is none other that that master thespian Desi Arnaz Jr.  I know hearing his name makes you tingle with anticipation but this man has no clue how to perform.  Plainly put he is awful and painful to watch as he delivers hackneyed dialogue with a smug manner.  He certainly canot hold his own with the reverent cast or even female character actress Shelia Keith who really shines in her small role.  Some of the dialogue is funny some serious but there are only four reasons to watch this film  Price Cushing Lee and Carradine.  They put in this film what little life this film has.  Of the four watch for Vincent Price playing ever the ham!  He is superb.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well yeah in all honesty House of the Long Shadows is an extremely disappointing and weak film but I'm convinced that there isn't a single real horror fan out there that can bring himherself to spread an entirely destructive criticism about this unique feature. After all it is the only movie that ever managed to assemble no less than four of the most legendary genre icons and even show them in the same scenes! Something that stars Vincent Price Christopher Lee Peter Cushing and John Carradine all at once is simply fundamental viewing for horror fans whether or not the storyline is any good. The plot is a reworking of the famous 'Seven Keys to Baldpate'novel and introduces Ken Magee as a rather cocky writer who bets his publisher 20.000 Dollars that he can complete a successful novel in the likes of Wuthering Heights in a short period of only 24 hours. To have the required isolation for writing his publisher gives him the key to an old deserted mansion in Wales. Instead of finding peace and quiet there the writer is subsequently interrupted by his publisher's attractive secretary and four uncanny members of the Grisbane family that reunite in the house to release their mad youngest brother after an imprisonment of forty years. Writing a novel is completely out of the question when it turns out Roderick Grisbane escaped from his room and started a new killing spree around the house. House of the Long Shadows is a heavily flawed and clichd film that would have been long and righteously forgotten by now if it weren't for the top notch cast listing. First and foremost the film got released at least a decade too late. The early 1980's were an era dominated by raw and bloodsoaked slasher movies and an oldfashioned hauntedhouse chiller simply couldn't fascinate the audiences any longer. Then it also takes far too long before something interesting happens. The story is over halfway by the time all four horror legends are fully introduced and it takes another twenty minutes before anything even mildly horrific occurs. Then there suddenly are too many childish and overly implausible plottwists going on in the last sequences resulting in a totally unsatisfying climax. The tone and themes of the film as well as the murderscenes are regretfully tame. It's actually hard to believe that Pete Walker directed this film! He was the British exploitation master during the 70's and made shocking movies about murderous priests House of Mortal Sin cannibalistic grannies Frightmare and barbaric women prisons House of Whipcord. The House of Long Shadows doesn't feature one single shock and hardly any suspense moments apart from Christopher Lee's gruff facial expressions. It certainly isn't the masterwork I secretly hoped it to be but if I could make one wish it would be going back in time and pay a visit to the film set.".

Something that stars Vincent Price Christopher Lee Peter Cushing and John Carradine all at once is simply fundamental viewing for horror fans whether or not the storyline is any good. The plot is a reworking of the famous 'Seven Keys to Baldpate'novel and introduces Ken Magee as a rather cocky writer who bets his publisher 20.000 Dollars that he can complete a successful novel in the likes of Wuthering Heights in a short period of only 24 hours. To have the required isolation for writing his publisher gives him the key to an old deserted mansion in Wales. Instead of finding peace and quiet there the writer is subsequently interrupted by his publisher's attractive secretary and four uncanny members of the Grisbane family that reunite in the house to release their mad youngest brother after an imprisonment of forty years. Writing a novel is completely out of the question when it turns out Roderick Grisbane escaped from his room and started a new killing spree around the house. House of the Long Shadows is a heavily flawed and clichd film that would have been long and righteously forgotten by now if it weren't for the top notch cast listing. First and foremost the film got released at least a decade too late. The early 1980's were an era dominated by raw and bloodsoaked slasher movies and an oldfashioned hauntedhouse chiller simply couldn't fascinate the audiences any longer. Then it also takes far too long before something interesting happens. The story is over halfway by the time all four horror legends are fully introduced and it takes another twenty minutes before anything even mildly horrific occurs. Then there suddenly are too many childish and overly implausible plottwists going on in the last sequences resulting in a totally unsatisfying climax. The tone and themes of the film as well as the murderscenes are regretfully tame. It's actually hard to believe that Pete Walker directed this film! He was the British exploitation master during the 70's and made shocking movies about murderous priests House of Mortal Sin cannibalistic grannies Frightmare and barbaric women prisons House of Whipcord. The House of Long Shadows doesn't feature one single shock and hardly any suspense moments apart from Christopher Lee's gruff facial expressions. It certainly isn't the masterwork I secretly hoped it to be but if I could make one wish it would be going back in time and pay a visit to the film set.";

This unique cast alone makes this movie essential regardless of the ridiculous storyline.Young American author Kenneth Magee Desi Arnaz Jr. makes a ridiculous bet with his English publisher that he can write a novel as great as Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights within 24 hours. His publisher therefore sends him to a Welsh manor where Kenneth is supposed to have the necessary quietude to work effectively. Soon after his arrival however some strange guests show up amongst them some of our favorite Horror icons...Vincent Price Peter Cushing Christopher Lee AND John Carradine  A movie with this cast is once again absolutely essential for any fan of Horror. These four legendary actors clearly had a lot of fun shooting this overall silly movie together especially Price plays his role very humorously and seems to enjoy it a lot. Apart from the four Horror legends the movie has little to offer. Desi Arnaz Jr. delivers a dreadful performance and Julie Peasgood is not exactly a very good actress either. The story and its many twists are quite ridiculous. There were some points in the movie when I actually started to like the story but these moments are quickly destroyed by silly twists again. If it wasn't for this movie's stars the film would if for anything be remembered for its silly premise but Price Cushing Lee and Carradine make this an absolute mustsee! An overall silly film with a ridiculous storyline House Of The Long Shadows is made a real joy by the four great Horror legends.

In fact it was the sixth filmization  scripted by Michael Armstrong whose own directorial career was curtailed following the notoriety of his MARK OF THE DEVIL 1970  of Seven Keys To Baldpate a novel by Earl Derr Biggers creator of Charlie Chan that was adapted for the stage by George M. Cohan yes the songwriter played by James Cagney in YANKEE DOODLE DANDY 1942!.Besides its plot about a dysfunctional Welsh family that includes a lockedup maniac and whose mansion is 'intruded' upon by innocent strangers is a virtual retread of James Whale's sublime THE OLD DARK HOUSE 1932 one of my absolute favorites  though with little of that film's style or wit. Another direct link to it is the fact that there is a Roderick involved  and let's not forget that Vincent Price who costars here had played a character by that name in Roger Corman's seminal Poe adaptation HOUSE OF USHER 1960! The final revelation which wasn't at all surprising nor come to think of it was the identity of the mysterious killer then is straight out of SEVEN FOOTPRINTS TO Satan 1929 The cast also highlights two other lesser horror stars  John Carradine who's supposed to be the patriarch of the family when the difference in age from at least Price and Cushing is minimal! and Walker regular Sheila Keith replacing the ailing Elsa Lanchester. The young cast isn't in any way comparable obviously  however both Desi Arnaz Jr. from childhood scifi TV show AUTOMAN 1983! and Julie Peasgood prove reasonably engaging nonetheless. By the way Richard Todd appears as novelist Arnaz's genial publisher  who makes a bet with his client that he won't stay the fulllength of 24 hours in an ostensibly haunted house which is the exact same premise of the Abel GanceMax Linder short AU SECOURS! 1924 I've just watched and I see Michael Elliott did too!.At the end of the day the film is clearly old fashioned despite the occasional gore but undeniably fun  which makes the Leonard Maltin guide's 12 rating a genuine headscratcher!".

	schema:reviewBody "If this film was as good as its credit sequence it would have been great. The film begins by introducing the three greatest horror icons of all time  namely Vincent Price Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. This is then followed by the names 'John Carradine' and 'Sheila Keith' and just when you think things can't possibly be any more promising Pete Walker's name turns up and you've got to start thinking you're in for a masterpiece. However you'd be wrong to do so as while the film does have some positives it's mostly very sluggish and doesn't do justice to its awesome array of talent. The plot is fairly routine and follows an American writer who travels to a manor house in Wales in order to write a novel. He has a bet of 20000 that he can write a novel that is better than Wuthering Heights in just 24 hours. However he thought that the house he was planning to write at would be empty but upon arrival he happens across a caretaker and his daughter and pretty soon a whole host of weird and wonderful characters invade his tranquillity...When I think of Pete Walker it is dark and foreboding films that spring to mind. Films like House of Whipcord are what sum him up but this film is nothing like Walker's earlier efforts and is actually more of a comedy than a real horror film. The action is mainly focused inside the central manor house and this actually does provide a decent place for the film to take place as Walker provides House of Long Shadows with a classic styled horror atmosphere. The three big name stars are the support cast really but they do get more screen time than I thought they would which is one of the film's few positives. None of them particularly stand out for delivering great performances but merely seeing them is good enough for me on the acting front. Most of the movie just sort of drones on and there isn't much at all added to the plot until the end. The ending is quite frankly about as bad as it gets. The film itself isn't that exciting anyway and then Walker makes a mockery out of his audience with a stupid clichd finale. Overall this film is worth tracking down for fans of classic as aside from the REALLY bad 'Scream and Scream Again' this is the only film to feature all three horror heavyweights but unfortunately it's not all that good.".

	schema:reviewBody "An arrogant American writer bets 20000 dollars that he can write a classic novel like Wuthering Heights at a remote Welsh manor in 24 hours. He is apprised the place has been abandoned for years but he discovers there are plenty of peculiar people staying there including a woman named Mary Norton that he becomes very attracted too but not necessarily trust. The people start popping up dead one by one. Think the movie Clue if you decide to watch this movie only with virtually no suspense. The manor is a perfect place for this movie. It adds creepy atmosphere in spades but they fail to deliver on it in a big way. For the first hour or so it's nothing but Talk talk talk talk Nothing much happens at all. We get plenty of meandering around the house people show up here and there. But there is no excitement to be found. It does eventually start to get a little more interesting but it was too little too late for me. The choked on a great opportunity with an all star cast despite most of them being in their twilight years. Desi Arnaz Jr. is completely miscast. His smug character irritated me to no end. This guy doesn't react to ANYTHING. People are getting killed all around you REACT! He's an emotionless robot for the most part. He can't act worth a lick and I have no idea why they casted him in this part. He was far too arrogant and talentless. He is the main reason aside from the dullness that I didn't like this movie. Peter Cushing looks somewhat gaunt but delivers a fun performance. it was nice to see him play a paranoid character unlike the subtly strong willed characters I usually see him play. Vincent Price does one of his patented Shakespearean performances and I loved it as usual. How can you not love Vincent Price? He's epic. Christopher Lee is dependable as always with another menacing character. John Carradin doesn't have much to do but he does it well. Julie Peasgood has a sexy British accent. She was easy on the eyes if nothing else. The finale throws in many twists and turns but it got so convoluted not to mention I was past the point of caring. It got way too clever for my liking. Final Thoughts Leave this one in obscurity where it belongs. You can do a lot worse but you can do much better as well. Resist the temptation from the amazing cast4.610".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit that seeing Cushing Lee Price and Carradine in the same room together gave me thrills and joy. What saddens me is that their great monumental teaming is in this turgid exercise which is at times a daunting task just to sit through. While the film has some wonderful lighting and the manor for which Arnaz Jr stays is ominously photographed. Sadly it's the ebb and flow of the film itself that disappoints. The film is a mixed bag for me. While I pleasured every moment the great stars spent on screen they were stuck within a story that was a trial to watch. What hurts even more is that bore of a character played by Arnaz Jr. who ought to thank his lucky stars mama was Lucille Ball for he did nothing for the film whatsoever except prove how bland and unlikable that prick of an author could be. I wished that Lee would spring from the shadows and bite a plug out of his neck so I could continue to watch the other stars for whom I really desire to see. The film is supposedly about an author who bets his publisher he can write a horror novel in 24 hours. His author has a manor for Arnaz Jr to stay in and so this is the place for all the action to take place. Arnaz Jr. finds that the manor is filling up with mysterious characters who represent the Grisbane familyVincent Price as Lionel Peter Cushing as Sebastian John Carradine as Lord and Sheila Keith as Victoria. This family harbors a dark secret which is held within a sealed room in the manor. Christopher Lee portrays Corrigan someone who buys property and is to possibly purchase the Grisbane estate but there's more to him than meets the eye. Julie Peasgood portrays Mary Norton Arnaz Jr.'s publisher's assistant and possible love interest. The film follows Arnaz Jr as he tries to uncover the mysteries that lurk behind the Grisbane family for deaths start to occur thanks to the curse in the house. The film has some genuine moments of Gothic atmosphere but unfortunately too many twists at the end not to mention not enough screen time for the legendary horror kings make everything such a waste. Arnaz Jr. just doesn't have any charisma and I just kept feeling like there should be more to this film than ever materializes.".

That's a statement I'm willing to stand by but TCM was by no means the last modern horror film to reuse that triedandtrue concept and though it was the best it certainly wasn't the only good one.'House of the Long Shadows' is a nice tribute to the 'Old Dark House' genre as well as a refreshing breeze during the era of the slasher. A sarcastic writerDesi Arnaz Jr. who hates Gothic novels makes a bet with his publisherRichard Toddto write a novel that makes use of the Gothic settings and purple prose that he so despises and it has to be completed in 2 days time. So our hero takes off to an abandoned manor in Wales. After a frightening encounter at a train station in the pouring rainwhich feels like the beginning of a giallo film he arrives at the manor only to find that the supposedly deserted mansion is very much inhabitedFor a place deserted for 40 years this house is more active than Time's Square!.Then a clich storm sets in while the real storm outside rages.It's all here A madman locked up for decades a creepy developer bickering family members with unusual habits 'Ten little Indians'inspired murders a contrived romance flat tires visitors who kill each other if you've seen it in an Old Dark house film it's in here somewhere. The script is taken from the oftfilmed 'Seven Keys to Baldpate' but still manages to work in elements from various other works such as several Lovecraft  Bloch stories several William Castle filmsnotably the underrated 1963 version of 'The Old Dark House' and even the TV. movie 'Bad Ronald'.This clich storm needs an umbrella.It's all bythenumbers and all the family members are as onedimensional as can be defined by speech patterns or clothing and various broadly played traits but when the family is played by John Carradine Vincent Price Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee who could complain? This is like the Magnificent Seven of horror. All of these old pros appear to be having a good time as for the other actors Arnaz makes us really relate to his irritability and longing for peace and quiet and unknown Julie Peasgood is good as his love interest she's definitely unusual looking but a welcome break from the talentless cheerleader types seen in most '80's horror films.As clich as it all is the film manages to be compelling enough to stick around to the end. And everything ends in a triple twistending that works on onehand and is infuriating on the other. For one it explains the ridiculous level of coincidence away but the next twist cancels it out then cancels it out AGAIN for a happy ending. It would be much better if the last 5 minutes had been cut. Still this film is definitely worthseeing. With much to enjoy on repeat viewings. Recommended.".

The film is about a man who bets he can write a novel in 24 hours while spending the night in an old secluded Welsh manor. He arrives at the old Grisbane manor but begins suffering some serious writer's block. As the night goes on various characters enter the home travelers and various others and some of them are even descendants of the Grisbane family who owned the manor. During the night though the guests begin to die in grisly ways and the stormy evening turns into a night of terror. But is what they think happening really happening?This film has a giant plot twist tacked onto the end and it works out well actually and is very clever. But I won't spoil it it's a movie you need to watch for yourself. That is if anyone gets the chance to. This film is extremely hard to find on video and hasn't even gotten the DVD release that I think it deserves. It reminded me of Clue a bit but it is much different of a movie and is slightly better. Desi Arnaz Jr. is teamed with horror legends Vincent Price and Christopher Lee and they are all excellent in the film along with the other characters within the movie. The only minorly negative thing about it was the lighting which made some things hard to see but all in all it wasn't too bad. It's been years since I've seen this and I wish I could get my hands on it again and rewatch it. To sum it up this is a pretty good lighthearted movie that blends horror and comedy together with a good result in the end. I wish someone would release this on DVD it is a good movie that deserves to get a little more attention. 810.".

This twist ending is just so silly its unbelievable and you can see it coming a mile off. Most of the film is set in a big country mansion with no electricity so its pretty dark.

	schema:headline " A brilliant throwback to the good old glory days of horror";
	schema:reviewBody "House Of Long Shadows is a fantastic film with a brilliant cast of horror legends and I just can't believe that this movie isn't more well known I've personally never even heard of it until quite recently and given the fact that it's directed by the ever brilliant Pete Walker whose other works I've enjoyed Frightmare The Comeback House Of Whipcord. He displays the same elegance and chills in this underrated masterpiece and sad to see that this would be his last horror movie but well I must say that this was a well and truly fitting end and going out with a bang.This does have that classic old school feel to it and given the fact that this came out in 1983 where horror had moved on to stalk and slash with the likes of Jason and Michael Myers. Well this may have seemed a bit old fashioned but that doesn't take away the brilliance of this. The plot to this was very good and thought out with an American writer Kenneth Magee takes a bet with his publisher that he can write a novel within 24 hours and arranges for him to go a secluded mansion called Baldplate Manor in the Welsh country side. But soon as he arrives he is greeted by two creepy caretakers and despite being told that the place is deserted more and more people start to turn up namely the previous owners The Grisbanes who hold a dark secret surrounding the place and soon enough things start to take a strange turn with people ending up getting murdered.Well for starters the mystery element to this is very effective and the tension that surrounds the mansion is well handled along with perhaps every horror movie clich known to man thrown in for extra delight and plus featuring the legendary cast of Vincent Price Christopher Lee Peter Cushing and Sheila Keith all in one movie is a pure joy for any movie buff. Once all the guests arrive at the manor then the movie gets going at a very brisk and cracking pace where event after event is thrown at the viewer and the shocks and thrills never seem to stop and I loved the angle of which the story takes you where we find out about the reason why the Grisbanes have returned to free their long lost sonbrother from his prison of 40 years for committing a murder of a pregnant girl then finding that he's escaped and is on a rampage of revenge where the innocent bystanders get caught up in this terrifying web. The horror scenes are well delivered in this with some shocking twists and turns that keeps you guessing until the very end and with some brilliant and grisly deaths to enjoy along the way and okay there are two random characters thrown in about halfway through for just pure fodder but that only adds more fun to this movie.The acting performances well what can I say from such legends and even the other cast members are well performed. The main character played by Dezi Arnaz Jr really holds his own surrounded by the screen legends and gives a very decent performance as the cynical American writer. Vincent Price gives a wonderful performance as always and may be known for hamming it up at times but who cares with his brilliant dialogue and scene stealing presence. Christopher Lee gives a no nonsense presence and pulls it off greatly with his sharp dialogue and forceful manner and as the movie goes on he's given more layers to his character which works superbly. Peter Cushing plays a different type of character than his usual domineering presence in the Hammer films here he is wonderfully eccentric and lovable and is the perfect foiling against the other two. Sheila Keith whose another brilliant and genius addition to this cast in full creepiness mode and always a joy to watch in this and House Of Whipcord Frightmare and The Comeback despite not given enough screen time and bows out relatively early she gives an astounding memorable performance. John Carradine is another pleasing surprise in this and gives a strong performance. Then finally Julie Peasgood as the love interest Mary who I found rather likable and despite not being as memorable as the others she was still a nice addition to the cast.All in all House Of Long Shadows is a wonderful throwback to the good old glory days of horror that's highly entertaining and a hell of a lot of fun the ending may be a slap in the face to some but I found it rather fun although does get rather confusing at the very end but the other twists and turns that precede this are brilliantly done and this stands as a brilliant must see for any horror fans.".

The plot's rather simple a neuropathed mood man Claude Ridder who tried to commit suicide is selected by a secret organisation in order to experiment a very dangerous and quite hopeless travel a journey in his own past. If you ever experienced resnais' border lined cinema you'll obviously understand that this movie will not use the same old usual vision of time travel basically 'where and when' HG Wells stuff  Formally try to see it as a sequel of emotional paintings of the hero's past life more than 150 sequences from 2 seconds to 2 minutes which may or may not have links between them about the life which he and his accidentally past away wife Catrine tried to built in the late 60's in Paris. A forced introspection by the most violent and merciless way to revive key moments of his life relive them as they happen is the scientific purpose but why not relive them mixed up with his subjectivity ? How great is the strengh of our past on the present when we have the opportunity to change it ? This film's also about weakness of memories in front of memory's complexity brought by an organic space machine would of course make the travel more difficult than it is for his companion an academical white mouse which allow itself to sneak into his past. Human perception of the socalled reality our ability to create new ones every morning and every time 'selfinterrogation about memory and memories' comes from the bottom of forgetfulness to the present moment to change our view on events are described in such a unique and powerful aesthetic way that this piece of cinematograph makes 'Je t'aime Je t'aime' an unique experiment as 2001 is and will be.

	schema:headline " The Narrow Trap of Love";
	schema:reviewBody "Alain Resnais made his first feature film in 1959 and just as most of the films by new wave directors so has Hiroshima mon amour remained as his most remembered film. In 1961 he directed his second film Last Year at Marienbad which still was strictly in the district of the Nouvelle Vague. In his own words it was his first attempt to deal with the subject of thought. These two films alongside with the documentary Night and Fog are usually the only ones people remember by Alain Resnais. However after Marienbad he made Muriel and after Muriel he made The War Is Over both of which were quite well received and not overlooked. In 1967 Alain Resnais started to film Je t'aime je t'aime which despite a few good reviews was instantly overlooked and left in the shadows of the incidents in May 1968. It's a shame that Je t'aime je t'aime is Resnais' most forgotten film because it easily survives multiple viewings and is nearly a perfect piece of work.To my mind I Love You I Love You is Resnais' finest film since 1961 and I could easily put it at the same level with Hiroshima and Marienbad. By saying this I mean no insult for Muriel and The War Is Over both of which are brilliant films. I Love You I Love You is a simple story it might just be the simplest story Resnais has ever told. But the way how Resnais tells this story is unconventional unique and opaque he has completely abandoned temporal order. It's a story of a certain man called Claude Ridder who loves a woman and has tried to commit a suicide after the woman's death. Not having succeed in killing himself an institution takes contact to him and wants to use him in an experiment. For the first time they want to try to send a man instead of a mouse to the past.Resnais has always been interested in past without being interested in the future  with the exception of The War Is Over. In I Love You I Love You this fascination for past is at its most concrete but the science fiction is just a frame story which gives a rational explanation for cutting the man's life in pieces. It's an abstract film and differs quite a lot from other films Resnais made in the 1960's. For instance compared to Muriel I Love You I Love You only consists of about 300 pictures where there are about 1000 of them in Muriel. On Resnais' caliber the rhythm of the film is almost calm and relaxed compared to the hectic rhythm of Muriel. In the art of editing musical terms become essential rhythm harmony and chord and in I Love You I Love You Alain Resnais has completely understood the joy of the editing table and its force to dissect the rhythms and riddles of reality.The film is perfect for its rhythm and harmony it's as close to their features as film can get. The way how Alain Resnais approaches cinema is cubist Resnais was incredibly fascinated with visual arts and made a few documentaries about artists in his early days. He breaks his film into pieces and reorganizes the parts according to a higher logic than chronology. The pieces of the protagonist's life are given to the viewer without any chronological order and we are at times inevitably forced to destroy our puzzle and start building it all over again. The rules of continuity are broken continuously in every turn and this is the core of the Nouvelle Vague to change to develop and put the limitations of cinema to the test. Nonetheless despite Resnais breaks the rules of continuity the film somehow works as an integrated entirety  much more integrated compared to the earlier films by Resnais.The repeat of the title I Love You I Love You reflects the repetition of emotions  the title refers to the repetition of events. The protagonist is forced to experience his past again and again while being trapped in a time capsule  in between of past and presence. But living these events again and again isn't nearly as distressing as the agony and pain caused by love. In the presence he is forced to love the dead Catrine  he's a prisoner of love. He loves her loves her and there is no redemption for this everlasting pain that love occurs suicide is the only way out from this prison but it doesn't work out either. Experiencing the suicide all over again only leads him to the same place to the table surrounded by scientists.The small mouse who shared the capsule with the man visited the man's presence. The man wondered if he could sometime visit the mouse's. What does the last freezeframe of the mouse pushing its nose through the blowhole of the dome indicate? Is the mouse a prisoner of the man's past and forced to live his past again and again. The mouse is trapped in a narrow place  in a dome. Is the dome same for the mouse as love is for the man? The mouse tries to breath but at times it's just so incredibly difficult.".

In the art of editing musical terms become essential rhythm harmony and chord and in I Love You I Love You Alain Resnais has completely understood the joy of the editing table and its force to dissect the rhythms and riddles of reality.The film is perfect for its rhythm and harmony it's as close to their features as film can get. The way how Alain Resnais approaches cinema is cubist Resnais was incredibly fascinated with visual arts and made a few documentaries about artists in his early days. He breaks his film into pieces and reorganizes the parts according to a higher logic than chronology. The pieces of the protagonist's life are given to the viewer without any chronological order and we are at times inevitably forced to destroy our puzzle and start building it all over again. The rules of continuity are broken continuously in every turn and this is the core of the Nouvelle Vague to change to develop and put the limitations of cinema to the test. Nonetheless despite Resnais breaks the rules of continuity the film somehow works as an integrated entirety  much more integrated compared to the earlier films by Resnais.The repeat of the title I Love You I Love You reflects the repetition of emotions  the title refers to the repetition of events. The protagonist is forced to experience his past again and again while being trapped in a time capsule  in between of past and presence. But living these events again and again isn't nearly as distressing as the agony and pain caused by love. In the presence he is forced to love the dead Catrine  he's a prisoner of love. He loves her loves her and there is no redemption for this everlasting pain that love occurs suicide is the only way out from this prison but it doesn't work out either. Experiencing the suicide all over again only leads him to the same place to the table surrounded by scientists.The small mouse who shared the capsule with the man visited the man's presence. The man wondered if he could sometime visit the mouse's. What does the last freezeframe of the mouse pushing its nose through the blowhole of the dome indicate? Is the mouse a prisoner of the man's past and forced to live his past again and again. The mouse is trapped in a narrow place  in a dome. Is the dome same for the mouse as love is for the man? The mouse tries to breath but at times it's just so incredibly difficult.";

The screenplay is witty and smart and it never focuses too much on the scientific aspects of time travel which is much to it's benefit because it would totally ruin the vibe of the whole film because it's not about time travel it's about this man coming to terms with his past and figuring out the kind of person he is.

We see how they grew apart and broke up and what happened of them.Resnais' touch is that we don't see any of this in that order rather as convalescent images relived as though there might not be pattern there. But once the novelty plays out he doesn't take it far enough. He has to rely on montage for all this and acquits himself rather well. When they break up he doesn't follow the scene with something from older happier times the contrast would've been much too easy instead he gives us an anonymous scene from a time inbetween where she's crying on his shoulder.It's a simple film only because it comes by the hand of Resnais.

As with the films of Jean Luc Godard Je T'aime has a chaotic narrative which oozes with dystopian gloom. The nonlinear structure is a bit fatiguing and frustrating. Still I like it because of the arresting imagery and magnetic cast.Claude Ridder played by Claude Rich who has held many different office jobs has recently survived a suicide attempt. When leaving the sanitarium Claude is approached by creepy members of a secret organization which is conducting timetravel experiments. At the remote facility he is encouraged to allow the scientists to transport him back a year in time for a minute. The scientists tell him that they have successfully conducted this experiment with lab mice and now need him for the first human trial. A few days later Claude and a mouse in a small container enter the Time Machine which looks like a human brain from the outside. The Time Machine TM starts up. Woopsit immediately begins skipping like a dirty CD. While the scientists outside the TM lament their inability to stop it Claude begins reliving short segments of his past randomly without end. He can exit the TM only after decompressing for four minutes but the endlesslylooping Time Machine keeps interrupting the closing sequence. The repeated perspective of a large brain in the background with anxious scientists in the foreground worried about the brain's condition comments upon brainwashing.It takes a while but Claude's often repetitive flashbacks eventually reveal why he attempted suicide. A year ago Claude was on a Scotland vacation when his comely girlfriend Catrine Olga GeorgesPicot died. The two were an exceptionally attractive couple. Nevertheless she had been the one was always seriously depressed long before Claude was. The two represent different types of depression. Catrina seems to be bipolar while occasionally happy she invariably finds little about life to make her struggle worthwhile. Claude's state of mind is more connected with Catrina's poor mental health and inevitable death. He harbors feelings of guilt out of the belief he killed her. The worldweary conversation between the two is usually compelling. Some of us wonder how exceptionally beautiful people can ever be suicidal. Catrina's enervated dialogue is even more heartbreaking when we consider that the stunning Olga GeorgesPicot is playing herself. In real life she struggled with depression for decades. Unlike Claude Ridder's try Olga GeorgesPicot's 1997 suicide attempt did not fail.Visually Resnais is superb. His color choices and use of the entire frame are remarkable. One often has the feeling of being in an art museum when viewing some of the imagery on display. The haunting Gothic and possibly Satanic soundtrack from Krzysztof Penderecki is also very distinctive.Catrina and Claude both share the belief that life is unendurable and look forward to an end to their suffering. Resnais has a cruel surprise in store for Claude It turns out there won't be an escape to his torments. Cinephiles who don't mind putting in some effort should find out why. However if you chose to arrive to the revival theater showing this by Time Machine please make sure it is under warranty.".

He is seized upon by a cadre of researchers almost as spiritually dead as he is and made the willing subject of an experiment in time travel that goes badly awry. So we have the cruelty of love the self destructiveness of man and the heartlessness of monolithic industry as the less than novel foundation of this movie.Going back in time with the man allows us to glimpse fragments of his deteriorating home life and of the romantic dalliances he engages in to spice things up and make his existence tolerable. It is challenging to piece together who met whom when but whatever plot exists in the innumerable and disjointed flashbacks consists of the man meeting talking with and bedding several women. There is his mistress of 7 years a woman who often seems like the dictionary definition of depression and whose wailing and gnashing of teeth grow exceedingly tiresome for her lover as well as the audience. There are two other women  I think there are two but may be wrong since it is quite hard to tell  who are uncharacteristically tolerant of his incessant commentary on his lover's emotional problems and his ultimately unorthodox response to those problems.While all of this is going on the various corporate scientists are monitoring developments but cannot seem to bring themselves to do anything to intervene. This seems unrealistic but it would of course hinder the time travel of the protagonist if he were stabilized once again in the movie's present tense. Thus the scientists wring their hands unconvincingly and the time travel goes on until its rather interesting denouement.This is not a bad movie but calling it a masterpiece as some reviewers do seems excessive to me. It's worth watching but don't see it on a day when you're depressed because it may exaggerate your symptoms to an unhealthy degree. Whether you love it or not this was decidedly not the feelgood movie of 1968.".

As the researches claim he's a perfect choice because he has nothing to lose. The tragic guinea pig thinks the same and joins the test confining himself into a strange machine that goes back in time although very jumpy going back and forth without any logic replaying facts of the man's life before his suicidal act. Most of the flashbacks revolve around the time spent with the woman he loved good moments turned into painful memories to the subject trapped in the machine who wakes up from time to time due to the project's malfunctions.Alain Resnais devotes his time here in presenting who the main character was instead of focusing in the utility of a time travel projects which reveals to be quite empty since it's very risky actions can't be altered everything is doubtful and flawed. It deconstructs the character through random flashbacks completely out of order and very repetitive almost like waking up every morning in Groundhog Day instead of punching the clock alarm the recurring scene is a happier moment of the man coming out of the sea talking about the fishes he saw there a tender moment with his lover. Sometimes it goes forward when it's time to explain what truly happened with his woman by the time everything gets deeply confusing and a little more frightening. This movie's concept is great but there isn't much gain when you don't have answers to some questions and above all it's lack of a true purpose makes of Je'Taime Je'Taime I Love You I Love You something remotely interesting difficult to endure and more off than on. I loved the fact of this being a scifi movie that doesn't circulates with scientifical mambo jambo it's more humanistic in this aspect. But in the real human level it's very brainy exquisite lacking in heart passion and exceeding in small talks and distractive actions. I didn't fell anything for the couple the fragments of what they had in common wasn't enough for me to develop any kind of feeling for them the man on the other hand was a brilliant and tragic character with genuine emotions slightly uncertain why he went ahead in joining the test enjoying in revive the life he had but at the same time hating the awkward experience of not seeing things as they were with clarity  the machine the drugs taken interfere in everything causing him some pain. We ask ourselves if we would do something like that. Technically fascinating with its unusual editing for the time but a little dead inside this is a nice film that surely leaves you thinking but not much loving and dreaming and wanting more. Would benefit of an American remake but too bad some would see it as a clone of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. 610".

I would have loved to be in the editing room when they made this flick. Where does scene 59 go? the editor asks. Just stick it somewhere in the first half replies the director.

The movie drags on and on and the tedium rarely lets up. One keeps hoping that eventually the director gets tired of his collagelike approach but he never does. Yes we get it this isn't a conventional timetravel scifi but a semipretentious psychological drama with plenty of fortunecookie philosophy hoping to pass of as profound insight into life's many mysteries. Or is it just a pointless analysis of the downfall of a skinny Frenchman? Bla bla bla bla. Big fing deal. The whole existential shtick is some kind of a loony obsession by France's New Wave buffoons and gets old fairly quickly except the cat hypothesis.JTJT is also typical of many French dramas from the 60s and 70s 1 the male protagonist is skinny 2 he sleeps around with attractive women 3 he is unfaithful 4 his unfaithfulness is portrayed as commendable and a badge of honour not to mention proof of high machismo 5 he is way out of the league of all the women he sleeps with and yet he somehow gets them into bed despite not being a wealthy man 6 all the women he has affairs with are half his age admittedly that's a small difference many French films have an age ratio of 5615 i.e. a 56 yearold man dating a 15 yearold Lolita 7 at least one of the characters is a hobby philosopher constantly musing about this fascinating world and 8 the skinny Frenchman cheats on his attractive women  rather than the other way round which would make a whole lot more sense.How many women have any of you ever met that constantly philosophize about the world? Who make up unusual theories about the world? Exactly you don't know any and you've never met anyone who has ever known such a woman. It is characteristic of French movies to be cut off from reality i.e. how real people behave. God forbid a Frenchwoman in a French drama should talk about shopping all the time  that would be too realistic though in this case no duller than most of the conversation pieces we're subjected to. After all French movies are to the most part male fantasies disguised as meaningful dramas to varying extents either the middleaged male protagonist dates women in their 20s or those in their early teens that's the only difference. Also sometimes the male protagonist is bald and ugly whereas sometimes he is merely skinny and averagelooking as is the case here. But essentially it's the same shtick over and over male fantasies told in a number of moreorless notthatdifferent ways this time it's timetravel but Resnais could just as well have picked a costume drama or a rundown postoffice.By the time the plot's tempo finally shifts from turtle speed to occasional froghops baby frog I'd lost interest. Claude's timetravel maze is hardly a cinematic extravaganza. Instead the timehopping is filmed and offered in such a dry lazy and sterile manner that it makes a mockery of the genre term scifi. The photography is fairly poor for its period the hundreds of scenechanges were glued together in a dull unexciting manner and the characters are neither interesting nor likable. It's hard to give a toss about this man he is neither fascinating nor a man of high morals. So why give us this much insight into his life? Given a choice between a more conventional timetravel flick and a lame character drama the choice is simple  at least given THIS kind of dialogue this director's lack of imagination or sheer incompetence? and the nonexceptional cast.Catherine's God as Cat idea however is quite good. She says that God might have created the cat in his own image and then created man to serve the cat. It would certainly explain why cats rule the world whereas French movies don't.A clever twist would have been the revelation that the team of boredlooking scientists had in fact used this man for the experiment over and over time and time again leaving the movie in a sort of endless loop. Obviously some scenes at the beginning would have to be rewritten and it's not terribly original either but at least that would give us SOMETHING as a conclusion. As it is we find out that the experiment had failed well not really he did travel to the past didn't he? So why was everyone so down on themselves? and that's pretty much it. Not enough by a long shot.I shall now explain to you why this movie has such a high average. It is because it is a French drama made in the 60s although any other period would do and by a leftwing French director. If this had been an American drama with the exact same kind of dreariness and Philosophy for Beginners 101 it would have had a much lower rating. That's because moviegoers  generally so against prejudice  are prejudiced against American cinema while prejudiced in favour of French Iranian and Swedish ones. Stupidity and confusion have many manifestations and this is but one of many.".

Je t'aime je t'aime is his attempt to revisit a man's memory of his past love who committed suicide through a scifi framework.

He wants to return to a time when he was at his happiest with his beloved Catrine. Claude  Claude Rich becomes hopelessly lost and unstuck in time as the machine jumps from one memory to another in the process something goes wrong and the patient's memories become fragmented uncoiling in bits and pieces out of order sometimes looping back again and again. In the process we see relationship come together and fall apart and the tragic nature of what we're watching isn't clear until the final moments. The question is did Resnais film the memories in the same random order that the novelist Jacques Sternberg wrote them? Moment to moment we're unclear of what we're seeing even when it seems so simple so plain. As the narrative continues to spin around like a zoetrope a visit to the beach or a quiet conversation in bed acquires new meanings as the film progresses. It's as much a love story or a sciencefiction story as it is a story about storytelling itself and continues on themes which Resnais has treated before. The surreality of each image and scene lies like shattered glass. We're left to put the pieces back together tracing the rapturous highs and turbulent lows of his relationship with his girlfriend Catrine Olga GeorgesPicot. Ridder is trapped in an isolated world of his own fractured infinitely repeating memories.Resnais captures the seemingly mundane rituals of everyday lifedead time that define the essence of human existence. Ridder's unremarkable life is presented in terse and abstract episodes that although also eschewing narrative inherently illustrate a complexity of form experience tactility and emotional realism. In the end it is the film's organic ability to convey depth and texturality that elicits pathos and humanity for the deeply flawed alienated modern day tragic hero imprisoned by the eternal torment of his inescapable haunted memories.This is a remarkable filma link between Marker's La Jete and Gondry's The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mindwhich doesn't quite come off as you can't quite pinpoint the moment the lover's drifted apart. A cubist structure is built up from a man's life cut in pieces. It's compelling technically not emotionally Claude is a neurotic daydreamer and can't effect any changes washed on the tides of fractured memory like a jellyfish.Like the haunting image of the mouse at the end the self is trapped in a glass cage gasping for air.

Today's is my first review again after a nearly five month break. I mainly used the time to further develop my publication of bloc notes a cultural record containing amazon film reviews film book reviews and revIews of some Malaysia Philharmonic Orchestra mpo performances. My new film series ie No 251 onwards will first review a series of films which have been neglected for a variety of reasons mostly unavailability of minimum quality copies. The reviews here are also meant to complement some earlier country or author series.  Now the movieIn this provocative scifi drama from Alain Resnais a man wakes up in a hospital after an attempted suicide. He has invented a time machine that has proved effective but only transports the subject back in time for one minute. Upon his release he gets his hands on the machine to go back to a time he fondly remembers spending with a woman he apparently has feelings about. The two stroll on the beach before she leaves for Scotland. He follows her but tragedy ensues and it is not clear if he has killed her or if she died an accidental death. The timemachine angle of the film features a dreamlike series of flashbacks making it unclear if the action is presently unfolding or is merely a vague memory from the past.  Dan Pavlides RoviIMDbThe Wikipedia free encyclopedia Alain Resnais article gives much more material on Resnais' work but tends to overvalue his achievements This film was meant to be presented at Cannes 1968 but expecting from radio news the chaos which then ensued Alain Resnais broke his train journey to Cannes at Lyons and turned back to Paris. The festival was cancelled the film was lost for a festival presentation and hence never really made it into the commercially relevant distribution circuit. Accordingly it was nearimpossible to get hold of a copy  no DVD's then and DVD's now but not released until very recently I waited four years for it still highly priced. The film was not worth any of these efforts.

Meaning that if you like action movies Van Damme delivers with ones that you will probably watch again sometime.Like Assassination Games 2011 this one features his son and daughter his daughter also produces. No his kids won't win any acting awards either but they turn in credible performances for their characters. For his part Van Damme acts better than I have ever seen him act before as a troubled exmercenary who has built a reputation finding and returning kidnapped children. He also seems to have built one for leaving a lot of bodies behind including innocents. Unlike most of his other movies where he does no wrong this one has him a lot more fallible and even negligent. His realizations have him showing lingering regret that really spices up this plot.While this film is vaguely similar to Taken 2009 there are more differences than similarities. It also shows what amoral lengths the family of a kidnapped child might be willing to go to to get their kid back.This is a good action flick with some thought provoking moments about consequences and choices. I recommend it.".

His realizations have him showing lingering regret that really spices up this plot.While this film is vaguely similar to Taken 2009 there are more differences than similarities. It also shows what amoral lengths the family of a kidnapped child might be willing to go to to get their kid back.This is a good action flick with some thought provoking moments about consequences and choices. I recommend it.";

OK you won't have Academy Awards performances but the actors did a good job. The action is well executed and the plot line captivating enough. I believe that Joe Flanigan made his character believable and convincing enough. Plowman was also decent as the mum looking for her kidnapped daughter. Overall I give 6 Bullets a solid eight.

Another Van Damme movie shot in a East European country with the same director of Assassination Games AG a good and standard action movie with a cheap look and some solid but basic action.And that is exactly what you get with Six Bullets but even more. This movie starts of interesting with a big actionscene with JCVD on a motorcycle..and the movie is filled with good directed fights. Joe Flanigan who is basically the next big name in this movie is great as Van Damme's costar. The only thing that is annoying that the rest of the cast is filled with unknowns and Van Damme talented son Kristopher Varenberg. He plays how surprising the son of JCVD in the movie. Also some of the locations in the movie were recycled from AG. The openingsscene is shot at the same manor from AG  the one were Scott Adkins kept his wife It all feels very save not mindblowing but very watchable and it is great to Van Damme doing some action again. Ernie Barbarash is developing as a solid director and seems to get the some good movies out off Van Damme who seems to step of his basic moves and shows some new stuff. This movie was shot prior to The Expendables 2 and it shows. Van Damme seems to be very motivated. Not like he was in AG. Although his character has a dark secret and is kinda depressed.Six Bullets is a fun movie. Overall people didn't like it that much. Lots of complaints about the cheapfactor in this one and comparing it to Van Damme's Cannes classic JCVD. But Six Bullets is nothing like this movie.. It is your standard but good DTV.. Nothing more nothing less 610".

	schema:headline " A great Van Damme movie...";
	schema:reviewBody "This is without a doubt one of the better Van Damme movies in the entire course of his career. Why? Well because it is not the average generic movie that he usually makes where he is sort of a lone underdog hero who is fighting an uphill battle against overwhelming odds and with some miraculous force he manages to singlehandedly emerge victorious at the end even after having received a beating that would normally drop dead a prizewinning bull.6 Bullets is a great storydriven movie in which Van Damme plays Samson Gaul a mercenary who is working in Eastern Europe to infiltrate human trafficking rings and rescue underage boys and girls and bring them home to be reunited with their families after these horrible ordeals. However during one such a mission something goes horribly awry and two innocent young girls end up dead. Haunted by the apparitions of these dead girls Gaul ends up seeking solitude and salvation at the mercy of alcohol while trying to make a living as a butcher. A young American girl is kidnapped from her hotel and the parents seek out Gaul for help. But can Gaul redeem himself of the past and step up to the task at hand? The storyline in 6 Bullets was really interesting and captivating as human trafficking is sadly every day events in parts of the world. So with that in mind then this story really takes on a personal approach and becomes more than just mindless martial arts entertainment.Plus the storyline is really helped along by some powerful performances not only by Van Damme who really stepped into character and showed a great acting side but also by Joe Flanigan playing Andrew Fayden.The movie was nicely shot the dialogue was good and it moved at a great pace. There was a fair amount of drama in the movie spiced up with martial arts of course and also gun fights. This is really one of the better Van Damme movies that I have seen in a long long time and it is good to see that he is back in the game.There were just a couple of things in the movie that I didn't really understand. In the opening sequence how did Gaul manage to plant all that explosive in the cars parked outside the building when there was all that much security personnel around? And also when he wanted a phone number traced it started with 555 which is a number associated with Hollywood movies so we must assume that it is an alleged American fakemovie phone number so why was it showing up on an Eastern Europe phone? And finally why would most people in Eastern Europe opt to speak English first whenever addressing strangers? Wouldn't it make more sense to speak in their native language? Anyway these touches are just small flaws that don't really have much impact on the movie. I just happened to notice this and wonder about it.6 Bullets is a great addition to movie collection for fans of Van Damme. And it is also good entertainment even if you are not particular a fan of him.".

Will 6 Bullets keep his streak alive after E2 has brought him back to theatrical prominence? 6 Bullets follows an exmercenary known for finding missing children is hired by a mixed martial arts fighter whose daughter has been kidnapped but is still struggling with a failed assignment. For the most part this isn't one of his better films but is a decent addition to his filmography. There is plenty of action that's pretty simple and only averagely executed but mostly loses some of its effectiveness due to bad editing. Where this film lacks on some of the expected action Van Damme delivers another character with a wide range of emotions. While still nowhere near the performance of JCVD he really carries the film well giving the character more depth than his normal bad ass persona. The supporting cast including Stargate Atlantis star Joe Flanigan and both Van Damme's son and daughter all do a decent job with what they are working with. The story is simple but does add some clever twists here and there to give it a bit of an edge you may not expect. The foreign setting really helps this movie both visually and size to give it a bigger feel than it may have had being shot here in the US.While this wasn't a great movie it still delivers enough of a kick to entertain the hard core Van Damme fans out there. Over time Van Damme much like the other action stars of E2 has seemed to really embrace his age and seems to have enhanced his performances a bit more. Worse case this film will serve as good filler while fans eagerly wait for his next film Universal Soldier Day of Reckoning.httpwww.examiner.commovieindallasbobbyblakey".

Like AG Ernie gives us a really cool opening intro to the movie! For the most part 6B is shot really well considering the budget. Acting wise I thought everyone was above average for a DTV...with the exception of BiancaJC's real daughter. Even though she isn't in it that much I thought her line delivery was just awful. KrisJC's real son however is better than usual. He still has a lot to learn but he didn't stink up the place like usual. Flannigan was good and I liked seeing him in something other than Stargate. Neal Acree turned out another good music score although a lot of it may be a little too piano heavy which kind of kills the tone in a few scenes. It sometimes added a made for TV vibe. Overall though this is another good step for Ernie and definitely one of JC's best DTV's. I'll probably watch it one more time before it expires. 3.255".

What most impressed me about this film is the work of JeanClaude Van Damme shows that there really is a great prejudice of the major studios with him because the guy every movie shows that he has talent who can act which is a great actor but people are prejudiced in his early films he was not so good performance in the question but if surpassed by their performance in fights and action scenes. Van Damme over time just came to improve their way of working which is showing a great actor for drama in his last film role that usually always has a dramatic story behind. 6 Bullets is an action movie with drama and suspense fantastic not shot anything he said I just think it's time to return to Hollywood enchergar this myth and hero of martial arts and action movies and my prayers and hopes Van Damme is to return to the top of the world.

	schema:headline " Not bad for a direct to video film not great either  Minor spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "Six Bullets is directed by Ernie Barbarash. Who recently directed Assassination Games also starring Jean Claude Van Damme and Scott Adkins. Six Bullets was recently screened at Cannes 2012 and here is my Review contains spoilersVan Damme plays a depressed ex military or something along those lines. It's never really discussed by the name of Samson Gaul who is hired to rescue the daughter of an MMA fighter Andrew played by Joe Flannigan. Joe portrays the equivalent of Floyd Mayweather in the MMA world. Surprisingly you get the feeling that Van Damme is not the lead in this film and from the off set it's apparent that Joe Flannigan is the main attraction here. Joe is an 'MMA fighter' whose daughter has been kidnapped due to his spiraling debts you later learn that Joe is due to throw a fight and bets against himself for a large sum which he owes to Vlad. Things don't exactly go accordingly and Vlad deploys a number of his team to kidnap Joe's daughter Monica. Andrew then realizes that he is in over his head and calls on an old ally who is renowned for his recover of small children. Fans of Jean Claude will be pleased with what he has to offer and looks in tremendous shape when he is boxing a hanging piece of meat a la Rocky style with Joe Flannigan There are a few references to Sylvester Stallone Jean Claude saves the best for last which I won't spoil. Samson and his son set out to rescue Monica and reunite her with her father. Kristopher Van Varenberg is surprisingly entertaining in his role as Samson's son and his shootout albeit with the rather unimaginative villains is similar to the Van Damme movies we all grew fond of as a teenager and he certainly has the ability and is worthy enough of carrying the Van Damme name if he so chooses. The main shoot out takes place outside an old mansion and the slow motion 'shoot and kill' moment is very similar to that of the slow motion capture used in his father's earlier films such as the Hard Target. Kris also adds an element of comedy the way he dismembers one of the henchman in the knife scene that takes part in mansion's kitchen. Van Damme's daughter Bianca BreeVan VarenbergVan Damme I am not sure what she names herself makes a brief appearance although it really feels like she happened to be on set and they threw a small cameo at her to keep her father happy. Overall there are a few action scenes that we have become accustomed with in a Van Damme film  He certainly displays better punching prowess compared his more recent DTV efforts he takes out three guys Transporter style in the end mansion finale in a small hallway. Although there is more gun action than fight scenes there isn't really a need for Van Damme to demonstrate his kicking ability as there isn't the opportunity to do so. In fact I would have expected more from Joe Flannigan's character given his supposed background as an MMA fighter. Joe doesn't participate in too many action scenes and it's transparent he doesn't have any interest in becoming an action star. He should have been a more lovable rogue than an MMA fighterYou kind of hope that Van Damme has more dialogue in the movie. Throughout the film you feel slightly frustrated that he is not presented with more dialogue and most of his lines are no more than one or two in length. For those that have seen Assassination Games will instantly feel the Barbarash vibe to this movie the tone well used locations and pace of the movie more than give this away. The story is all too familiar in the direct to video market and isn't going to win any awards and fans of low budget action direct to video movies will enjoy this  I give this 610.".

It's the little things like that which pull me out of the story. It's the reminder that I'm just watching a bad movie. I laughed out loud at many of the scenes because of the blunders. They don't even bother covering the fact that they're using blanks...one scene toward the end some dude loads a bolt action sniper rifle with what is clearly a crimped blank round. Then they show some surveillance feed that shows the rear of the surveillance camera in the feed...what???? Comically horrible. The issue of human trafficking deserves a better movie.".

For a guy who's improved so much it would be nice if he was given better projects than 6 Bullets a dreadfully slow poorly edited and acted straight to DVD release who's 115 minutes feels more like 3 hours.6 Bullets actually begins with promise with Van Damme in a fantastically choreographed fight scene which proves to be one of the last you'll see from him in the film. There's another decent scene about 2 thirds in but the opening with Van Damme sporting disguise facial hair is easily the best part. It's all downhill from there.I'm not incredibly demanding of the plots of stuff like this so a kidnaprescue type thing is in no way bad it can be pulled off really well as seen in Taken with Liam Neeson. But everything about the execution and the way the kidnapping happens coupled with how we don't see the villains or any motivating factor for the villains til much later really hurts the movie.Speaking of hurt one of the worst aspects of the movie is the insanely plain Joe Flanigan. Everything about this guy is bland and he is beyond unconvincing for his role as an MMA fighter. Not only is he not in shape for the part at all but he has these distractingly awful douchebag tattoos that are supposed to sell him as the fighter he's supposed to be but so clearly isn't. It wouldn't be too bad if Flanigan was in the movie briefly to allow Van Damme to come in and kick some ass but that isn't it. Oh no. Flanigan and his character's wife practically take over the movie making you forget at parts that Van Damme is even in it with each segment including Flanigan being gutwrenchingly grueling.Everything 6 Bullets really has to offer is in it's opening scene. Had the entire movie been made that way it would've been a fun oneoff action thriller. As it stands it's a lesson in the value of pacing in filmmaking.".

But maybe due to his recent revival Expandables 2 he will be able to do movies he always wanted to do next up is a comedy in 2013 and that's something he's been dying to make!";

Gaul reluctantly accepts as he also persuaded by his son who is a cop. Gaul discovers that the criminals are being aided by the Romanian secret service on behalf of a wealthy Arab arms dealer who wants an American virgin.The film wants to make serious points about the child vice trade a serious issue in parts of Eastern Europe since the 1990s wrapped around an action thriller. Van Damme is assisted by Joe Flanigan who plays the dad and who in the movie plays a major MMA star therefore he can share the action scenes with Van Damme.Of course its basically a low budget Taken rip off without much verve or characterisation that the original Taken had. Its still an involving story decent action scenes although the parents of the kidnapped daughter are flatly drawn.".

There's nothing too special about the story seeing as it's been done before in various forms e.g. TAKEN. Even the cinematography isn't too unique and has a washedout palette that is alltoocommon in these types of movies. But unlike TAKEN this movie actually takes the time to develop its characters and give you reason to care about them. In other words it's not all asskicking and oneliners and in fact there really isn't any humor. The run time is a little overlong by about 1520 minutes but it's spent with characters you can identify with and a story that has some dramatic impact. Definitely for JCVD fans but also for anyone looking to branch out beyond the middling action fare that Hollywood churns out nowadays.".

And I have no Idea what this is doing in the 6's. SOrry if it duped you into renting it too.The first moment I'll mention comes fairly early in the film when Jean faces off against some villains in a room. He takes out the lights and puts on his nightvision. The camera bounces backandforth between his fluorescent greenyellow night vision view and then back to the regular view which should be nearpitch blackhence the reason for nightvision but it's not it's like library dark the kind of dark that's darker that usual but no problem seeing much of anything. It's laughable.Another moment comes late when Jeanand the couple he's helping scout out the hideout of the enemy and come together to talk about a plan. I prepared myself for this mindblowing idea that turned out to be her pulling up to the gate and getting approached by one of the enemies and then Jean jumpingin from the side onto the guy... really...? that was the masterplan.. this stuff happens every 5 minutes here.Couple all those stupid moments with some deplorable acting bad setpieces and an unoriginal and poorly written script and you have yourself a real stinker. In hindsite JCVD and Bloodsport are the only Jean Claude films that I would rank at or above a 6... this is not even in the same ballpark.Save your money and your time. 34100 You might like this if you liked Lionheartbetter Cyborgbetter and Legionaireabout equal or slightly better. This amounts to an absolutely terrible remake of Taken. 6.1? Hilarious. As a comedy  maybe 5.1.".

I guess I'm a little thrown by the different spellings of the road since I believe the other film Zzyzx actually has it correct which if that's the case I'm not sure why they spelled the title of this film as they did. There's also the fact that the 2 apparently came out the same year. Nevertheless this wasn't a bad watch and I would suggest it to folks who like the HorrorSuspenseThriller thing.".

I guess I'm a little thrown by the different spellings of the road since I believe the other film Zzyzx actually has it correct which if that's the case I'm not sure why they spelled the title of this film as they did. There's also the fact that the 2 apparently came out the same year. Nevertheless this wasn't a bad watch and I would suggest it to folks who like the HorrorSuspenseThriller thing.";

Grillo and Sizemore are also great Sizemore is an awesome villain. The storyline is very different  lots of twists and keeps you on your toes. Overall it's a fun and exciting thrillermystery. Zyzzyx Road is the actual name of a road in Las Vegas. The film has a funny history  grossing 30 at the box office! That makes it the lowest grossing film of all time but there's a lot more to it than that. It's an interesting story look it up on Google some time. I think that its also in the trivia on this page. For the record it is pronounced Zizzix".

	schema:reviewBody "I rented this movie knowing nothing about it. I guess I should have gone with my gut instinct and skipped it.The movie is about a married accountant Grillo and his girlfriend Heigl who are discovered fooling around by her psychopathic boyfriend Sizemore. The accountant kills him with a vibrator ! and they take him out in the desert to bury him. The name of the movie for no apparent reason comes from the road they take into the desert. Once they get to the desert Sizemore's body seems to have disappeared from the trunk of Grillo's car.The pacing and directing were absolutely awful. I would say the acting was terrible but I can't blame the actors for having so little to work with. In fact the only reason I gave this a 2 was for Heigl's game efforts to do something with this mess. The plot what there was of one was stupid. Worse yet it went off in a completely different direction midway through. Plot holes? Why yes there were plenty of them. They were so frequent and so big it was hard to follow the story. If it had been campier and had something resembling a plot it might have made a decent B movie but it doesn't even rise that far.I was particularly amused at the makeup. Heigl's makeup varies from scene to scene and the blood effects are hilarious. Grillo goes through most of the film with a cut on his head from his fracas with Sizemore. It is obvious that the cut is drawn on with a sharpie and smeared with grape jelly. What's more it looks the same throughout the entire movie. Sizemore has a bruise on his forehead from being bonked with the vibrator that keeps moving around.John Penney who wrote and directed this travesty should never be allowed to make another movie. Heigl and Sizemore need to fire their agents. Even if you're a B movie fan you should give this one a pass. It's 90 minutes of your life that you can't get back.".

	schema:headline " Maybe likable for young girls";
	schema:reviewBody "'Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen' comes as a disappointment from Lindsay Lohan after the very funny 'Freaky Friday' and 'Mean Girls'. Here she plays Mary naming herself Lola a girl who leaves New York the city she loves and moves to New Jersey with her mother and two little sisters. At her new school she becomes friends with Ella Alison Pill mainly because they both like the same rock band Sid Arthur. Lola is a nice person but lies too much because she wants to be liked. She seems very sure of herself but we understand that is only on the surface. Since the school is where most of the story takes place we need a villain another good looking girl named Carla Mega Fox. Parts of the story involve the bad Sid Arthur breaking up a last concert they will give in New York and Lola and Ella trying to get in. Carla will be there since her father is the lawyer that represents Sid Arthur. Other parts involve a school play where Lola is cast for the leading role and Carla only for a small supporting role.I am not sure why this film was made but I guess to show Lohan dancing singing being arrogant learning her lesson have a happy ending do some more dancing and some more singing. It felt more like a Hilary Duff film and I was not surprised to learn the part of Lola was in fact offered to her first. No offense to Duff but Lohan is a much better actress and has proved that in films with scripts so much more intelligent than this one. This one fits in a line with Duff films like 'A Cinderella Story' or 'Raise Your Voice' films where you can enjoy the good looking lady but nothing else. I hope Lohan's next film will have the wit of a 'Mean Girls' again. I even have hard time believing young teenage girls will enjoy this one. There are some moments for them to be funny I guess but most of the time it is not. Not for male adults not for teenage girls.I like Lindsay Lohan a lot actually therefore I was able to finish this film. She does the best she can basically proving she is too good for material like this. Without her I would have hated this film completely. Since most people will not like Lohan as much as I do I can honestly say you will probably hate this film too.".

	onyx:emotionText "'Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen' comes as a disappointment from Lindsay Lohan after the very funny 'Freaky Friday' and 'Mean Girls'. Here she plays Mary naming herself Lola a girl who leaves New York the city she loves and moves to New Jersey with her mother and two little sisters. At her new school she becomes friends with Ella Alison Pill mainly because they both like the same rock band Sid Arthur. Lola is a nice person but lies too much because she wants to be liked. She seems very sure of herself but we understand that is only on the surface. Since the school is where most of the story takes place we need a villain another good looking girl named Carla Mega Fox. Parts of the story involve the bad Sid Arthur breaking up a last concert they will give in New York and Lola and Ella trying to get in. Carla will be there since her father is the lawyer that represents Sid Arthur. Other parts involve a school play where Lola is cast for the leading role and Carla only for a small supporting role.I am not sure why this film was made but I guess to show Lohan dancing singing being arrogant learning her lesson have a happy ending do some more dancing and some more singing. It felt more like a Hilary Duff film and I was not surprised to learn the part of Lola was in fact offered to her first. No offense to Duff but Lohan is a much better actress and has proved that in films with scripts so much more intelligent than this one. This one fits in a line with Duff films like 'A Cinderella Story' or 'Raise Your Voice' films where you can enjoy the good looking lady but nothing else. I hope Lohan's next film will have the wit of a 'Mean Girls' again. I even have hard time believing young teenage girls will enjoy this one. There are some moments for them to be funny I guess but most of the time it is not. Not for male adults not for teenage girls.I like Lindsay Lohan a lot actually therefore I was able to finish this film.

On a better note Lohan's character Lola was an entertaining one and i enjoyed watching her overexaggerated perspective of things. I must admit that the set up of Lola's room and the way their family lived and the clothes Lola wore were inspiring. I don't know if this is going to be the case for everyone haha but i know that point of the movie made it all worthwhile for me.I'd recommend taking a younger sistercousinfriend between about 612.

After trying to nab the lead role in the school play the competition between the two girls culminates at a soldout concert by Lola's favorite band that Carla conveniently has tickets to see.The previews made the film seem boring and for the most part it is. There's not really a story and it's hard to tell what the real intentions of the film are. There were a bunch of little stories but none of them really went anywhere. I know this film is directed towards teenage girls but they deserve better films than this. The movie was just so lame and unfunny. The whole clumsy girl act is really getting old and it wasn't really funny to begin with anyways. They were trying really hard for laughs and it just wasn't working. There were just a few small chuckles and that's it. The only reason why someone should watch this is because of Lindsay Lohan. She actually gives an entertaining performance and she saves the film from being really bad.Sarah Sugarman does a terrible job at directing. She doesn't have one clear idea for a story just a bunch of random scenes put together. It was pretty much just Lindsay Lohan running around all over the place. Lohan doesn't really get support from the rest of the cast since they all decide to phone in their performances. The film is also very unrealistic and it sends a bad message out to kids. For example two thirteen or fourteen year old girls wouldn't go to a concert in New York and depend on a scalper to give them tickets. Then they have this scene where the two girls are in the bedroom of Sid Arthur having a pillow fight while there's a party thrown by a rock star going on downstairs. It was just completely stupid and unrealistic. The ending is also pretty bad since it randomly ends with Lohan kissing Sam even though they hardly focused on this romantic subplot. This film was just an uneven unfunny mess. In the end Lindsay Lohan is the only reason to watch this and it's really just for die hard fans. Rating 310".

She wants to be an actress and she creates dramatic stories about her life and like some teen aged girls she gets over dramatic about the events happening around her. It is all part of her attempt to be more interesting.I really thought the movie could have been better.Lohan does a great job playing the drama queen and for the most part her character is believable.Her new friend Ella played by Alison Pill is the nice rich girl while Carla played by Megan Fox is the nasty bitch rich girl and Lola's main nemesis.I was in drama club in high school and those scenes did seem believable as the group is preparing for the school musical. In fact one year we had a freshman girl beat our the senior girl for the lead in our school play. That caused a lot of issues just like those shown in the film. Carol Kane's Miss Baggoli was a bit too loopy but my drama directors could be strange.The problem was the story.The main theme of the movie as I saw it was Lola building this fantasy world for her life having it crash down as lie built upon lie does eventually then comes redemption and she becomes a better person for it in the end. Lola learns she can be interesting just being herself.That is a nice film in itself. Unfortunately the filmmakers couldn't leave it alone and added an unneeded big city adventure for Lola and Ella. It is understandable since we need someway to have Lola's interesting fake life uncovered but it led to an unbelievable situation when she meets her rock star obsession. I kept expecting her and Ella to get into one zany scrape after another but that didn't happen. If you are going to waste film shooting in the big city at least have something major happen.The other issue was one of theme.If the theme is that lying to make oneself interesting will bring retribution  in this case Lola's humiliation in front of her classmates then the ending of the film didn't fit the theme. I guess it was just Disney's way of getting a happy ending but the stories Lola created were so huge it was not believable that she got what she wanted in the end. She turns out to be really no better than Carla who gets what she wants because she thinks she deserves it.Lola was far too lucky. A little realism would have been nice.Lindsey Lohan showed a spark that could lead her to better roles. I really think that she could be a big star a few years from now. She shined in this movie and was by far the best part of it bad script and all. I think years from now people will be saying Hilary who?Personally I thought the most interesting supporting character was Calum Cep Lola's dad played by Tom McCamus. Those of us who watch scifi shows produced in Canada may know McCamus from his role as Mason Eckhart on the Mutant X television series.".

While her performances constantly amaze me I was baffled by how truly talented she was in this film she captured her character like no other actress could. Besides being humorous Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen also managed to make me tear a little bit as Lola's and Ella's friendship was shown. The story develops perfectly and the cast is presented just as well.All in all I give this move a 910 the small cartoon bits threw me off just a little".

No I'm not a tween I'm a teen who appreciates wellwritten wellcast and wellacted films. This comedy had its moments that tickled my funny bone and Lindsay Lohan Lola shined through brilliantly. While her performances constantly amaze me I was baffled by how truly talented she was in this film she captured her character like no other actress could. Besides being humorous Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen also managed to make me tear a little bit as Lola's and Ella's friendship was shown. The story develops perfectly and the cast is presented just as well.All in all I give this move a 910 the small cartoon bits threw me off just a little";

No it's not high drama. No there's no big stars although after one viewing we can all agree that Miss Lohan will be.

She's perfectly charming but not syrupy sicky sweet as I can imagine this character would have become in the hands of Mandy Moore or Hilary Duff. No there's some kind of an 'edge' there with Lohan nothing you can quite put your finger on just 'star' power I guess and the 'killer bod' as we said back in my day doesn't hurt either of course.But it's not just Lohan. Every detail of the movie is 'flufftacular' from the casting notables the 'dork' sidekick best friend the cutiepatootie guy friendcrush the richbitch popular girl the wacky drama teacher to the costumes the high school girl's version of Sarah Jessica Parker's ifonlyIhadthegutstowearthat wardrobe to the soundtrack Atomic Kitten Simple Plan Lillix Wakefield and tracks by Lohan herself that I guarantee you'll be humming.

The familiar dilemma of juggling one's dreams with the realities of school family and selfesteem is there  but it is first  foremost about friendship portrayed in a wonderful natural way by Alison Pill Ella and Lindsay Lohan LolaMarie. The friendship portrayed by these two lead actors are as real as any I've seen on screen. I especially look forward to seeing Alison Pill Pieces of April in more firstrun movies.The movie has a fine cast and firstrate performances in the supporting roles  Glenne Headley as the single mother is understated but a steady anchoring presence in the entire movie. Megan Fox is the stylish school queenbee whose role is much more complex than on first impression. Carol Kane is hilarious as the overwrought drama teacher.Because the script is based on a popular novel the movie rewards the viewer who listens carefully as it has densely humorous script. There are subtle lines and touches which can be missed. One example of the original nature of this movie is the way the budding 'romantic interest' of Lola is treated as a true subplot. This movie is about friendship not romance.The director Sara Sugarman deserves a lot of the credit for adapting the book to the screen with imagination and playful flourishes which reflect the mindset of the lead character and don't get in the way of the movie. The characters come across as real people with real lives. There is an overall loving attention to detail in editing production design and the several subplots all have meaning and contribute to each other without contrivance.This is an accomplished movie with a nice message which succeeds at many different levels. While underappreciated during its original theatrical run I predict it will stand the test of time.".

Desperate to go to the concert she and her friend try all the teenage clichs and so many things we have seen before to get in. She finally meets her idol the singer of the band and comments him on his alcohol addiction. We can all predict the outcome of the film from a mile away. There is also a subplot with a High School play. Where is trying to get the lead part.The acting isn't impressive but I have seen worse. Lindsey Lohan played better in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Which were also better movies by the way.In the end this is just another Disney high school movie where popularity stands central and predictability is inevitable. Some people might enjoy this but for the majority of the moviegoers this is a major let down. Grade 410".

But i was disappointed at this film OK so it's a Disney film so i couldn't expect a Mean Girls style of humour or a Solid easy storyline like that of Freaky Friday. but i at least expected a little more passion in the movie. The storyline was drab and very slim. there wasn't much to go apart from the Lola Lindsey Lohan characters dream of being a starlet. The plot was so weak that absolutely anything could of happen which isn't really a good thing. The acting especially from Lindsey was very amateurish. Linsey's character was so OTT that it looked as though she had ignored the director and decided to improvise her role. Alison Pill's role Ella was boring and lifeless and i could see that she was upstaged by an over excited Lindsey. the sub characters were poorly written especially the love interest Sam Eli Marienthal who is brilliant in Tucker and American Pie who is wasted and underused and also completely pointless to help push the story forwards. the only saving grace in characters was Adam Garcia as the drunken Rocker Stu. is utterly superb playing a drunken White stripes meets Keith Richards character. he lifts the film at one point. But He can't save this Turkey of a film. I would recommend this film to Lindsey Lohan fan's who like her music more than her acting and 10 year old girls.".

	schema:headline " A typical Disney High School Teen Flick!";
	schema:reviewBody "Let just say from a nonbiased point of view this film was nothing special. From start to finish it remained a typical Disney Teen Movie the main role of Lola is played by Lindsay Lohan. It has to be said Lohan does not do a bad job of acting in this simple box standard teen flick. Many parts of the film are rather unrealistic and although this relates to the tilte  'Drama Queen' maybe the film is a little far fetched. A good example of this is when Lola is talking to Ella about the death of her father the story is told in I would say Lizzy Maguire style with all the cartoons etc. These cartoons are totally over the top and stand out like a sore thumb as this style is never used in the film again. The whole aspect of a girl with a dream moving from New York City the dream city with the lights sparkle and Broadway to a small basic town in New Jersey. Although this small basic town seems to have large malls a high school able to put on a show that you would expect to see on Broadway and more Apple Laptops than NYU. Some scenes in the film are extremely dragged out for example the scene in which Lola and Ella follow Stu Wolf. I personally found it long and boring. A highlight of the film is Lohans rendition of 'That Girl' which takes part at the end of the High School show. Also the performance from Allison Phill is excellent and at times moving showing the girl who was 'brave enough to be different' because of Lolas influence. Over all the film is a typical high school teen flick. I should not imagen it has made a significant promotion or change in Lohan's career or that of any actor involved. I would advise if you are a fan of Lohan's or like this type of Disney Teen flick I would go see the film otherwise catch it on cable sometime. Notthing special.".

	schema:headline " One of the worst movies of 2004";
	schema:reviewBody "This long titled movie is the type of annoyance that should've gone straight to video because it was so bad. I couldn't believe how bad Lindsay Lohan was in this after she made some good efforts in movies such as The Parent Trap Freaky Friday and my current favorite Mean Girls. Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen is one of her lamer efforts and so far it's the worst movie I've seen this year.While watching this garbage I asked myself. What the hell is this movie about? It's about nothing. There's no conflict at all or anything that will keep the audience guessing. Its utter nonsense and its about a girl named Lola that moves to New York goes to a new school tries to get the lead role in her school play while finding out that her favorite band is breaking up. No conflictno fun. This was a pretty selfish movie that didn't even try to make it appeal for all ages and genders all it cared about was its target audience which is young preteen girls. The supporting actors showed no signs of a promising career and they made these characters even more obnoxious because these type of people don't exist. Everything is depicted in a very lazy and fake way.These type of movies are not suppose to be boring they're suppose to be fun for anyone. I've recommended many movies that might not appeal to men like A Little Princess and Mean Girls but 'Drama Queen' is NOT for us. There wasn't one moment in where I was laughing. I didn't like how the director depicted the streets of New York as if they were happy and vibrant by adding neon colored trash bags and some other redundant material. There were many offputting plotholes that young girls might not become aware of but anyone who's seen many movies will of course notice many flaws in this. My little sister liked this movie and she has seen it 3 times now. She's crazy I guess it was because of all the bright colors and costumes worn by Lindsay Lohan and maybe she liked the musical finale as well which was the worst part of the movie in my opinion. I don't recommend this to anyone not even little girls. There are better movies than this on the Disney Channel and that's saying that this movie is infact TERRIBLE because movies on the Disney channel are often bad as well but not as bad as this.210".

	onyx:emotionText "This long titled movie is the type of annoyance that should've gone straight to video because it was so bad. I couldn't believe how bad Lindsay Lohan was in this after she made some good efforts in movies such as The Parent Trap Freaky Friday and my current favorite Mean Girls. Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen is one of her lamer efforts and so far it's the worst movie I've seen this year.While watching this garbage I asked myself. What the hell is this movie about? It's about nothing. There's no conflict at all or anything that will keep the audience guessing. Its utter nonsense and its about a girl named Lola that moves to New York goes to a new school tries to get the lead role in her school play while finding out that her favorite band is breaking up.

No big deal...Another thing which surprised me i have the feeling that everyone in Hollywood has a firm belief that girls under their 20th year of life are mentally retarded. I'm a teenager myself but i had never seen or done such things in school or in my private life than youngsters usually do in films like this. Now imagine this scene in your real life you're around 17 your best friend stares at you then asks what would you like to do and in the next moment both of you are happily skipping on a big bed in funny costumes you're listening to some silly music and flapping eachother with pillows. And of course messing everything up. Sounds realistic huh?I didn't like this movie in any way. Oh and i forgot to say that it's end was downright disgusting. Of course all the dreams of the brainless girly will come true she will be the school's most popular gal and she will find his dream knight.Is there any sense in watching this movie? NO !!!

Seriously I expected this film to be as bad as A Cinderella Story. Folks this is not just badthis must be the most immoral film to ever be done by Disney! I am speechless as to how wrong this film was I must write a looooong rant!!!Lola is the worst Disney protagonist ever! She is in no ways different from Carla. Lola is just as selfcentered and worse she lies. At least 99 of what Carla does in this film she earned without lying. I felt so sorry for Ella. She allowed someone like Lola who only cares about doing what it takes to take over the popularity circuit to tell her how to live her life just because she is not popular herself. Every minute I'm like Ella please please snap and just bitchslap her! I was disappointed when all we got from Ella was a fit about Lola lying about her father which died in a few minutes.Now in A Cinderella Story when Sam got humiliated you knew she didn't deserve it from day one. But you cannot tell me that when we get to 'Lola's Low Point' that she did not deserve it! But then again the whole band thing was unbelievable. I would've been likeso you may or may not have met some rock starwho cares? And she almost loses her part in the play and decides to go home and cry about just because no ones believes her. OH BOOHOO. WHY DIDN'T ELLA SLAP HER BACK TO REALITY THEN?!!! And Lola and Ella's obsession with that band is just messed upit almost made me sick.How can Ella and Sam survive being around Lola for one second without being wierded out?!! What made me even angrier was that Sam was in love with her. Sam deserves someone better not a lying selfish not to mention weird bitch who thinks that everyone's a retard so getting what she wants wont be difficult!Then I smirked as we got near the end when you know that Disney was just putting in stuff to cover up this evil characterlike telling a rock star he's drunk and get him on rehab the next day? OH PLEASE!!! This I learned from reality 99.9 of all people who get drunk WILL DENY IT! Oh yeah and no tweenie film would be complete without the whole believe in yourself phrase. It worked for A Cinderella Story because it was actually relevant to the plot. They just tossed the phase somewhere near the end of this filmand then pulled off their own 'Cinderellaending'. And we don't even know if Lola learned to stop treating people like retards. The ending has some okay moments but some bad ones No Sam! Stay away from Lola!!!So as bad as most tweenie films are this should've never seen daylight. Girls do not learn to believe in themselves or that drinking is wrong. They learn to believe in the idea that they can get whatever they want because the world revolves around them that sounds kinda like Disney right now! In my opinion this would've worked better as a PG13 rated parody flick with lots of teen sex. It amazes me that Mean Girls was a lot more believable and moral despite being made for older audiences. As for what Confessions was originally intended to beit has failed in every spot not to mention become the worst influence on adolescence period. Funny because the stereotypes in Confessions were low compared to other films.".

Seriously I expected this film to be as bad as A Cinderella Story. Folks this is not just badthis must be the most immoral film to ever be done by Disney! I am speechless as to how wrong this film was I must write a looooong rant!!!Lola is the worst Disney protagonist ever! She is in no ways different from Carla. Lola is just as selfcentered and worse she lies. At least 99 of what Carla does in this film she earned without lying. I felt so sorry for Ella. She allowed someone like Lola who only cares about doing what it takes to take over the popularity circuit to tell her how to live her life just because she is not popular herself. Every minute I'm like Ella please please snap and just bitchslap her! I was disappointed when all we got from Ella was a fit about Lola lying about her father which died in a few minutes.Now in A Cinderella Story when Sam got humiliated you knew she didn't deserve it from day one. But you cannot tell me that when we get to 'Lola's Low Point' that she did not deserve it! But then again the whole band thing was unbelievable. I would've been likeso you may or may not have met some rock starwho cares? And she almost loses her part in the play and decides to go home and cry about just because no ones believes her. OH BOOHOO. WHY DIDN'T ELLA SLAP HER BACK TO REALITY THEN?!!! And Lola and Ella's obsession with that band is just messed upit almost made me sick.How can Ella and Sam survive being around Lola for one second without being wierded out?!! What made me even angrier was that Sam was in love with her.

Impact is a quite artful picture obviously made by first rate professionals. The balance between location shooting mainly in and around San Francisco and the extraordinarily stylish sets is in my opinion perfect and well thought out. At the center of the story is the attempted killing of the main character by his wife's lover. The car with the two men drives at night along a sinuous mountain road. It slows down and stops because of a flat tyre. As the viewers already know this is the spot where the murder should take place. With unbelievable ease the natural surroundings reminding you of the dramatic climax in Hitchcock's Family Plot change into an almost expressionistic stage set with artificial fog at the bottom and everything. It is an unforgettable moment. What the film people could achieve in those days!Brian Donlevy has some very good moments. As after a phone call he fully realises that his wife who he naively loved calling himself Softy in his messages to her had cheated and betrayed him he stumbles to a bench on a station platform stares into the void with dim eyes and then starts crying with rage and frustration. The scene takes almost a minute and proves that Donlevy is a much underrated actor who should be honored more.Apart from the realistic presentation of parts of San Francisco in the late Forties it complements Welles impressions in Lady from Shanghai Impact has some nice pieces of slang at least to a foreigner whose mother tongue is not English. Grovel a shuteye for taking a nap that's nice isn't it?".

The director Arthur Lubin is a Bmovie figure with a lot of films to his name and I'm going to guess just from this one that there are others in the history that are very good. This has been running the noir circuits for a long time and is especially noteworthy. The photography by Ernst Laszlo is especially helpful and with some smart editing it makes for a visually terrific movie. But the acting is great too. Yes everyone fills some familiar roles for this kind of upper crust murder and cover up but it's tightly done convincing throughout. Brian Donlevy is a fabulous and typically Donlevy industrialist who has to take on a second identity for part of the film and it's a great surprise. The two lead women both the same age 29 and both with short careers play two very different types of women that the industrialist bounces between. The first Helen Walker is the clever rich wife. The second Ella Rains is the homespun girl who wants only for everything to turn out okay. Rains was a Howard Hawks discovery and with her classic clean cut looks even made it on the cover of Life Magazine twice on February 28 1944 and August 11 1947.One other character whose performance is sterling is Charles Coburn playing the aging detective. A lesser role but from a remarkable actress is the maid played by Anna May Wong who got stereotyped in the movies but who is now increasingly appreciated as the first major ChineseAmerican actress.Yes this is a great film for film buffs and a really good story for everyone. Make sure you have a clean DVD transfer to appreciate the photography see httpwww.dvdbeaver.comfilmDVDCompare10impact.htm for some info on that kind of thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Brian Donlevy is a wealthy business executive who loves his wife Helen Walker. That's reasonable enough. She's an elegant dish with a voice as mellow as nectar. She's sweet to him too but behind the smile is deceit adultery conspiracy to murder. She has a boyfriend Tony Barrett and they intend to murder good guy Donlevy.The plan is this. Donlevy is about to drive out of town on a business trip and Walker asks him if he'd be kind enough to drive her cousin the ruthless Barrett with him. The considerate Donlevy does so but once out of San Francisco Barrett beans Donlevy with a lug wrench and leaves him for dead in a ditch. Barrett's final words before the wrench drops This is for me and Irene sucker. Barrett then makes his getaway in Donlevy's neat Packard convertible but smashes at high speed into a gasoline tanker and is burned beyond recognition. The police naturally conclude the remains are those of Donlevy. They inform the grieving widow who sobs convincingly and looks forward to a rendezvous with both Barrett whom she believes to be still around somewhere and with the immense wealth that Donlevy has supposedly left her.Donlevy comes around and gets hold of a paper informing him that he's dead. His wife has made no mention of her cousin and Donlevy's most bitter suspicions are confirmed.I guess I'll have to make this exposition shorter.Donlevy doesn't go to the police. He wanders into a town in Idaho and gets a job as an auto mechanic at Ella Raines' gas station. It's one of those small Western villages where the blazing sun turns everything pale gold the poplar leaves flutter when the breeze stirs a tranquil river flows nearby everybody knows everybody else the people are trusting and generous and treat oddballs kindly and all the men belong to the volunteer fire department. Says Raines' mother to Donlevy When you trust folks you trust 'em. If you didn't already know it was a fairy tale the music would tell you. In the dramatic city scenes the score turns into a dramatic frenzy. In the dreamy little town a melodic flute cops its style from Peer Gynt which is apt not only in helping establish the atmosphere but in suggesting Donlevy's embittered solitude. He loves Raines too but he's no longer capable of making that kind of emotional commitment.Then it gets complicated. Scraps of evidence  measured in shreds as in shred of evidence  keep turning up that implicate the wife and she winds up in jail. Donlevy decides after a few months that he can't let his wife fry for something she didn't do so he returns to the city and tells his story. Walker the quickwitted fabulist and an actress of rare talent twists everything around to make Donlevy appear guilty of murdering Barrett out of jealousy. Donlevy takes Walker's place in jail and a trial follows. You can guess the outcome.One thing that bothered me all the way through after Barrett's attempt to murder Donlevy. Why didn't the victim go immediately to the cops? Wouldn't it have been more sensible than hitch hiking to Idaho? I was finally able to figure it out. If he had gone at once to the police there would have been no movie. That's why the Indians always try to shoot the stagecoach passengers and never the horses. It's why Hamlet doesn't kill Claudius after chatting with the ghost.The acting is all of professional caliber nothing to be embarrassed about except maybe Charles Coburns' Irish accent. Ella Raines is pretty enough in a mechanic's jump suit and her hair tucked under her cap but she's smashing in a bareshouldered white dress and her lustrous brunette hair loose. Donlevy is a burly presence more convincing when he's grim than when he's trying to be nice.Everything else is pedestrian. Arthur Lubin the director never simply suggests a hidden motive. He gives you a good clear shot of the sneer the suspicious glance the glazed look of adoration. But he has one subtle moment. When the District Attorney asks the court that charges be dismissed against Donlevy and that Walker be arrested Lubin shows us Walker's surprised face. She turns her head to look at the judge then her gaze drops slowly and the camera follows it down her arm until we see the bailiff's hand move to cover her wrist.".

He wanders into a town in Idaho and gets a job as an auto mechanic at Ella Raines' gas station. It's one of those small Western villages where the blazing sun turns everything pale gold the poplar leaves flutter when the breeze stirs a tranquil river flows nearby everybody knows everybody else the people are trusting and generous and treat oddballs kindly and all the men belong to the volunteer fire department. Says Raines' mother to Donlevy When you trust folks you trust 'em. If you didn't already know it was a fairy tale the music would tell you. In the dramatic city scenes the score turns into a dramatic frenzy. In the dreamy little town a melodic flute cops its style from Peer Gynt which is apt not only in helping establish the atmosphere but in suggesting Donlevy's embittered solitude. He loves Raines too but he's no longer capable of making that kind of emotional commitment.Then it gets complicated. Scraps of evidence  measured in shreds as in shred of evidence  keep turning up that implicate the wife and she winds up in jail. Donlevy decides after a few months that he can't let his wife fry for something she didn't do so he returns to the city and tells his story. Walker the quickwitted fabulist and an actress of rare talent twists everything around to make Donlevy appear guilty of murdering Barrett out of jealousy. Donlevy takes Walker's place in jail and a trial follows. You can guess the outcome.One thing that bothered me all the way through after Barrett's attempt to murder Donlevy. Why didn't the victim go immediately to the cops? Wouldn't it have been more sensible than hitch hiking to Idaho? I was finally able to figure it out. If he had gone at once to the police there would have been no movie. That's why the Indians always try to shoot the stagecoach passengers and never the horses. It's why Hamlet doesn't kill Claudius after chatting with the ghost.The acting is all of professional caliber nothing to be embarrassed about except maybe Charles Coburns' Irish accent. Ella Raines is pretty enough in a mechanic's jump suit and her hair tucked under her cap but she's smashing in a bareshouldered white dress and her lustrous brunette hair loose. Donlevy is a burly presence more convincing when he's grim than when he's trying to be nice.Everything else is pedestrian. Arthur Lubin the director never simply suggests a hidden motive. He gives you a good clear shot of the sneer the suspicious glance the glazed look of adoration. But he has one subtle moment. When the District Attorney asks the court that charges be dismissed against Donlevy and that Walker be arrested Lubin shows us Walker's surprised face. She turns her head to look at the judge then her gaze drops slowly and the camera follows it down her arm until we see the bailiff's hand move to cover her wrist.";

The story involves a scheming wife out to murder her husband a plot that backfires when her lover botches the job and winds up dying himself in a fiery crash. Poetic justice there but the follow up is where things get interesting as jilted protagonist Walter Williams Brian Donlevy spends his time trying to sort things out while keeping his real identity a secret.Helen Walker turns in a strong performance as the two faced Irene Williams a character you'll love to hate as the story progresses. She showed she could think on her feet when being tailed by a detective and when her husband unexpectedly shows up after his three month disappearance. It's somewhat of a surprise then when one of the 'keys' to her undoing winds up in her coat pocket.I couldn't quite warm up to the romance between Williams and would be mechanic Marsha Peters Ella Raines. Even in her garage gear she's an absolute knockout and to be smitten with Donlevy's character seemed to be a bit of a stretch. Fortunately though she had the tenacity and energy to team up with Detective Clancy Charles Coburn. Credit Clancy with the suitcase connection that finally unhinged Mrs. Williams' story.Everything about the late 1940's settings works well from the busy streets of San Francisco to the bucolic trappings of Larkspur Idaho. My own home town had the same type of fire department signal system used in the story while I was growing up so that was a neat memory. I'm sure younger viewers will have no idea what the 'Klondike 2' telephone number is all about and when was the last time your cab ride cost 1.15? Throughout Impact I couldn't help drawing comparisons with another noir flick from a few years earlier 1945's Conflict starring Humphrey Bogart and Sydney Greenstreet. In that one the scheming partner in a murder plot is the husband Bogey and the deed is done on top of a winding mountain road. It's got a clever twist that trips up the bad guy without using a trunk full of evidence. Both films suggest that some of the best noir efforts of the '40's and '50's had single word titles.".

	schema:reviewBody "I am a true believe that the best films that Hollywood ever produced came from the 1940s. Whether it was in the early 40s like the film Gaslight or later like Lean's Great Expectations I have never seen so many great stories with so much originality humanity and creativity. Impact is no different. What transformed this picture from your typical filmnoir thriller into a fullfledged murdermystery is not just the creative story but also the strong characters the twisting themes and the questionable ending. Impact could not have been as fascinating as it was if it were not for the impressive story. From the opening scene we think that we have this film already pegged as your typical wife cheats on man and he now wants revenge story but as director Arthur Lubin guides us further down his diabolical path we learn that there is going to be more surprises than we originally anticipated. These surprises will not only lock your jaw in a shocked position but it will also provide 111 minutes of pure uncut filmnoir.I have read other reviews that claim that Impact does not fall within the typical filmnoir genre. I see where they are saying this but I do not agree. Lubin I believe was creating a classy filmnoir for his audience but he tricked us. He not only tricked us from the beginning of the film to the end but also where the filmnoir style should be placed. We assume that the because Brian Donlevy is our centralized character that he has to be the dark and brooding one the entire time causing the sensation of filmnoir. I saw this film in a different light. As Lubin kept Donlevy in the eye of the camera for most of the film I thought that the true sinister dark brooding spooky and edgy character was Irene. Helen Walker did a superb job with this role. Not only did she portray the backstabbing wife with such precision and ease but she also played this very strong character that I was not expecting. That sensation of filmnoir with the themes of suspicion anxiety and pessimism are all collected well within Walker's portrayal of Irene. It is this character that fully embodies the idea of filmnoir and I couldn't keep my eyes off her the entire film. To see such a powerful female character in such an early age of Hollywood impressed me. I do not see why Impact has not made a bigger impression in the film communities. It is a landmark film that will keep you guessing in a better way than any Shyamalan film will.Even if you cannot agree with me about Lubin's slight of filmnoir hands it is unmistakably true that Impact contains some of the best story coupled with acting that we have seen in quite a long time. Even in today's Hollywood you just do not see this type of intensity excitement and curiosity as you found in Impact. I would not be surprised if we eventually saw a remake of this film in the future. It has all the elements that one would desire to be a boxoffice sensation an evil wife a passionate husband and a dark secret. Who wouldn't love to see this? I personally could not keep my eyes off the story or the actors in this film. Brian Donlevy was beyond normal as the disarmed man facing the truth that his wife is no longer in love with him. This being my first Donlevy film I cannot wait to see other pieces of his work. I think he was both strong and weak enough to carry the picture. He had to show that he still loved his wife no matter what she did and he pulled it off with so much dedication that I nearly wanted to stand up and clap for him in my living room. I have already spoken on Irene who I believe matched Donlevy straw for straw. Lubin needed a character that was going to counter Donlevy's likeability and Helen Walker did just that. As audience members we wanted to love her and hate her at the same time. Ella Raines was nothing spectacular but did bring this light profeminism theme into this light filmnoir thriller. Tony Barrett was the epitome of evil never breaking character and always making me feel slimy. My personal favorite character was Lt. Tom Quincy. I have seen many parodies when they would use the southern flatfoot but I had never seen a film that utilized this clich character. Impact did it and Charles Coburn perfected it. As he attempted to solve the crime he used the vice of kindness and dedication making this critic smile with delight. He carried the truth of this film on his back without any struggle at all.Overall I thought that Impact was yet another great film that I can attribute to the 1940s. I don't know who the brains were during this cinematic time but I wish I could go back and shake their hands. Their imagination ability to keep audiences guessing as well as produce great B level actors giving more than 100 of their abilities to a film is nearly impossible to find today. I would have loved to live during this era and see these films in the smoky auditoriums packed with untouched minds. Impact was nearly flawless. I guess it dragged sometimes and the ending seemed to be wrapped up a bit too quickly again the happy factor wasn't needed at the end but this film kept my attention throughout. I cannot wait to show this movie to friends and family. To fully see where we get our ideas for our films in the year 2006 we must make sure that we respect the films from the 1940s. Impact should be at the top of every film enthusiast's list! Grade  out of ".

I first saw this movie on a single day booking at the Silver Theatre at age 11. What stuck in my mind after seeing it is that if life ever went sour to the point of contemplating suicide a wise alternative might be a fake suicide  followed by a renewed and drastically different second life as in this movie. There was no suicide fake or otherwise in this picture but I thought that was a healthy idea to place into a young viewer's mind whether intended or not. Then there's Ella Raines. Hmm!

	schema:reviewBody "Successful businessman Walter Williams Brian Donlevy loves his pretty wife Irene Helen Walker more than anything. Little does he know she's plotting with her lover to kill him. During the murder attempt Walter is hit hard on the head but lives. The other guy however is killed in a car crash and burned beyond recognition. Believed to have been the man killed in the crash Walter decides not to come forward. Instead he goes to work as a mechanic in the garage of Marsha Peters Ella Raines. When Irene is tried for his murder Walter must decide whether or not to reveal he's still alive.Brian Donlevy is pretty good. He's at his best when his character is angry or edgy. The sappy romantic stuff doesn't fit him well. Helen Walker is a particularly hissable villainess. Lovely Ella Raines is the good girl. There's no meat to the part but she does well with what she's given. Charles Coburn plays the detective out to get to the bottom of things. He's always fun. Arthur Lubin's direction in the first half is great film noir. I loved the scene where the lover tries to kill the husband. The whole thing was brilliantly executed. Then something happens and it's like a separate movie. The second half is much less like noir and more like a standard crime melodrama where a girl has to prove her guy is innocent of murder. If the entire picture had been like the first half I'd say it was one of film noir's best. But it isn't. It's still an enjoyable movie with some good twists and turns.".

	onyx:emotionText "Successful businessman Walter Williams Brian Donlevy loves his pretty wife Irene Helen Walker more than anything. Little does he know she's plotting with her lover to kill him. During the murder attempt Walter is hit hard on the head but lives. The other guy however is killed in a car crash and burned beyond recognition. Believed to have been the man killed in the crash Walter decides not to come forward. Instead he goes to work as a mechanic in the garage of Marsha Peters Ella Raines. When Irene is tried for his murder Walter must decide whether or not to reveal he's still alive.Brian Donlevy is pretty good. He's at his best when his character is angry or edgy. The sappy romantic stuff doesn't fit him well. Helen Walker is a particularly hissable villainess. Lovely Ella Raines is the good girl.

	schema:reviewBody "This wonderfully twisted tale of the events that take place before and after an attempted murder is both highly entertaining and full of surprises. It was written by Jay Dratler who also cowrote the screenplays for other film noirs such as Call Northside 777 The Dark Corner and Laura and his skills as a storyteller and a writer of snappy dialogue are both in strong evidence in this movie.Walter Williams Brian Donlevy is a wealthy industrialist whose wife Irene Helen Walker colludes with her lover Jim Torrence Tony Barrett to murder him. She arranges for the two men to share a car journey to Denver during which they have to stop on a mountain road to change a wheel after a tyre which Jim had previously damaged suddenly blows. Jim uses the opportunity to hit Walter over the head with a wrench and leaves him for dead. As Jim prepares to continue his journey a large van pulls up and the driver offers him assistance which he refuses but this incident spooks him so much that he drives off in the car at high speed and accidentally crashes headon into a tanker full of fuel. Walter regains consciousness in time to jump into the back of the van but soon passes out again.When the wreckage of Walter's car is later discovered and the occupant is so badly burned that he's unrecognisable the presumption is made that Walter is the dead man and further evidence found by the police soon leads them to believe that Irene is culpable.Walter eventually arrives at the small town of Larkspur Idaho where he's offered a job as a mechanic at a gas station run by an attractive young widow called Marsha Peters Ella Raines. From a remark that Jim had made when he attacked him Walter knows that his wife was behind the attempt on his life and so when he reads in a newspaper about her arrest on suspicion of his murder the opportunity to take revenge by doing nothing to help becomes very attractive.Walter and Marsha fall in love and when she learns about what happened to him she persuades Walter to do the honourable thing and return to San Francisco to tell the police his story. Unfortunately when he does this further unexpected developments follow and he finds himself charged with the murder of Jim Torrence.Impact is a film in which certain sharp contrasts are made. The city is compared unfavourably with the small town where people are much more friendly and supportive the difference between the evil Irene and the kind and decent Marsha couldn't be more stark and Walter's conduct in his professional and personal lives are also incredibly different.When Walter first appears  he's seen as an extremely dynamic and forceful businessman but is then later shown as a very caring husband who Irene calls Softy. He's also normally confident and direct in his manner but during his time in Larkspur he goes through a period of confusion and selfdoubt. The fact that Brian Donlevy is able to bring all these aspects of Walter's personality together in a believable way is very commendable and enjoyable to watch.Helen Walker and Ella Raines are both excellent in their roles and Charles Coburn provides the pick of the supporting performances as the veteran detective who's assigned to investigate the case.".

Helen Walker is perfect in the role of a cynical femme fatale and Ella Raines is extremely beautiful and efficient in her role. Brian Donlevy performing a character of twentyfive years old is miscast. This is the greatest flaw in the screenplay since he was a successful man that had worked for ten years as a worker and than reached a supervisory position. How could he be so powerful executive with this age only? Considering Walter Williams a man of forty and something years the story becomes credible.

	schema:reviewBody "Impact is an interesting and entertaining mix of film genres. I won't give away details of the plot and story but just some generalities to whet the appetite of anyone looking for a good mystery to watch. It starts with some drama and romance moves into suspense and skulduggery then takes an unusual twist then another unusual twist and another and ends on romance.This 1949 film is a very nice vehicle for Brian Donlevy who plays the part of Walter Williams. This film came about midpoint in Donlevy's career. At 48 he had already played a number of diverse roles. In 1940 he received an Oscar nomination for supporting actor in 'Beau Geste. He didn't reach the level of stardom of the big names of Hollywood but he had a respectable portfolio for his film years. Whether he was a crook or a cop a cowboy or a comic Donlevy always entertained. He slowed down in his later years and did more work in TV roles than for the silver screen.Ella Raines has a nice role opposite Donlevy as a war widow who falls for this quiet but kind guy who knows how to fix cars. Raines is best known for her female lead in Hail the Conquering Hero made in 1944 while WWII was still begin fought. For a short career  just 29 credits including films and TV appearances she played opposite some big stars of the time. Among them were John Wayne Charles Laughton George Sanders Broderick Crawford Randolph Scott Dan Duryea Edmond O'Brien Burt Lancaster and William Powell. She had good roles in films that did well at the box office but she chose to retire from films in 1956  after just 14 years in Hollywood.Impact doesn't have a large cast but the supporting roles are all very good. Helen Walker plays a very good devious wife able to cover up her chicanery with sweetness. This is toward the end of Anna May Wong's career and she is very good. But Charles Coburn delivers the best supporting performance as detective Lt. Tom Quincy.I wonder if other people  those who have been around a few decades enjoy seeing scenes of familiar cities and towns as I do. This one has some nice scenes with late 1940s automobiles clothing and other things. While those change over time the street scenes from that area of San Francisco are probably the same these many decades later. They were when I last visited there a few years ago. And we can count on the fabled cable cars to continue operating for decades to come. They are part of the San Francisco culture  enjoyed and used by locals as well as tourists.Impact isn't a fastaction film  not that many were in that time. It develops slowly and after some crimerelated scenes it moves into a nice story of recovery honesty integrity and love. As I said  quite different than the usual fare of a crime drama film.".

Supported exquisitely by Ella Raines with a very solid performance the film moves through what could easily have been a thick and sluggish plot at a pleasing pace.I've always enjoyed Brian's brilliant yet simple interpretation of his roles and this one is particularly refreshing and interesting. Charles Coburn's portrayal of a stuffy yet sharp and humorous cop adds a delightful bit of saltiness.Rarely am I left disappointed that a film has come to its conclusion like turning the final page of a really good book this is one of those films. I was left disappointed to be sure  only in the fact that it was over. Impact is a simply a very good film in nearly every way.".

	schema:reviewBody "Too bad the movie's a disappointing crime thriller after a promising start. Brian Donlevy plays a highpowered corporate executive with a lavish apartment and a silken wife Helen Walker. Trouble is the doeeyed Walker has teamed up with a lowclass lover Tony Barrett to plot Donlevy's murder. When that fails Donlevy finds himself stranded in a small Idaho town where he settles in with new girl friend Ella Raines. However police are still trying to unravel what happened at failed murder site so an unresolved cloud hangs over both Donlevy and wife Walker.Strong opening that nicely sets up the melodrama and Donlevy's betrayal. Middle part is unusual for crime drama since it celebrates virtues of small town life. Yet it does so fairly effectively such that even a hardcharging executive like Donlevy would find welcome escape from city life and a faithless wife. Last third however settles into routine suspenser as Raines seeks evidence to clear Donlevy.Though movie contains noirish elements particularly spiderwoman Walker and destinycrossed Donlevy director Lubin films in flat uninspired fashion that adds nothing to the script. In fact his approach tends to drain excitement from those parts that should have impact. For example the business around the doomed car needs a few emotional closeups to emphasize the catandmouse stalking going on. Instead Lubin's camera remains at an impersonal distance as if it's a family outing being filmed. The movie's entire texture appears better suited to a police docudrama than that of a man menaced by unseen forces.Casting too amounts to a problem. Donlevy's a fine character actor who could bring off authority figures with real conviction. As a highpowered executive he's excellent as a romantic figure he's about 10 years too old and not much good at softer emotions. Then too having the comely and much younger Ella Raines quickly fall for him is something of a stretch. A bigger problem lies in framing Walker's lover as something of a lowlife without the charm or polish that would naturally attract a highclass woman of her social standing. The script would have been wise to imply that Walker is just using him to get rid of her husband. Just as unpersuasive is the casting of a geriatric 72 yearold Charles Coburn as a cop even if he does manage some finesse. All in all the oddball casting just doesn't work. An exception is Helen Walker who's perfectly suited to her role as the devious woman. Watch her array of expressions as the cops close in. Her career was unfortunately slowed down by a debilitating accident and she died much too early . Though largely forgotten today because of her few credits once you see her you don't forget her with her upside down eyes statuesque bearing and unforced beauty. She's unforgettable as Tyrone Power's scheming nemesis in Nightmare Alley and could do comedy equally well as in the hilarious Murder He Says 1945. In my little book she could easily qualify as an actress with a cult following.Too bad that an Anthony Mann Robert Siodmak or Andre deToth didn't get hold of the material before the pedestrian Lubin. The premise is prime material for noir treatment and with more astute casting might have become a classic.".

He is matched here with two ladies who were under 30 but it is quite believable.The new Packard convertible looks nice. This was a time when an expensive convertible could be parked on the street while you shopped. You would leave the top down on the car. No Club on the wheel.Ella Raines was beautiful. We see her working on the engine of a Kaiser with a hammer. Dumb broads. Brian Donlevy fixes the engine just by listening to it and tightening the mojo or something.Brian's bad girl first wife Helen Walker is beautiful also but she has this silly notion about killing her husband. She has this loser Tony Barrett help her with the job but he is dumber than the girl with the hammer fixing the Kaiser. That's about it...Except for Charles Coburn who could have taken his role as the older detective right into a TV series if it had been about ten years later. He is excellent in this. All the actors do a great job.There is a Bekins moving van that appears to be a product insert. It is a great memory prodding sight. Moving vans used to look like that.Both Brian Donlevy and Ella Raines died of throat cancer strangely enough. They both left many wonderful films for viewers.Tom Willett".

	schema:reviewBody "Impact 1949 is a narrative film that relies on psychology to drive its characters actions purposes and values. It is a moody noir piece not badly acted and adequately directed or better at every moment. Arthur Lubin directed the twists and turns of this intelligent film from a story by Jay Dratler and script by Dratler and Dorothy Reid. Its story can be told in a single sentence Walter Williams is a man who rose out of nothing against the usual U.S. disdain for individual ability to become the key man at a major corporation then he loses both his adored wife and his position in life for a time and has to decide whether to let the wife who tried to have him killed be punished for his murder or to risk going back to take up his life again. Music is by Michel Michelet with strong cinematography by Ernest Laszlo. The Art Direction was supplied by Rudi Feld with challenging set decoration by Jacques Mapes and very good costumes by Maria Donovan. The producers were veterans Joseph H. Nadel and Harry M. Popkin and Leo C. Popkin. Brian Donleavy stars in this understated film and his usual vocal strength and calm demeanor make a lot of his varying situations and moods. As the two women in his life Helen Walker and Ella Rains bring intelligence and liveliness to taxing parts. Charles Coburn Mae Marsh and Robert Warwick all do well with unusual roles. Others in the cast worthy of note include Clarence Kolb Art Baker Anna May Wong Philip Ahn Jason Robards Sr. William Wright Tony Barrett Glen Vernon Thomas Browne Henry Erskine Sanford and Harry Cheshire. I find this to be an ambitious and generally successful film which will stay in the memory a long while. It presents a strong circumstantial murder mystery but concentrates on the characters their motivations and reactions. It is I suggest unusually realistic and worth seeing more than once.".

So in true Postman Always Rings Twice style Torrance plans to murder Softy on a dark lonely highway one night. Only problem is that he screws the murder plan up.

Softy escapes to a small Idaho town and finds solace in spunky kind Marsha Peters Ella Raines yet his past eventually catches up with him.It's very noir despite the majority taking place not in the dark city streets but the welllit Larkspur the comforting AllAmerican town of homebaked cherry pie and early morning fire drills. Helen Walker is at her diabolical best also check her out in Nightmare Alley parading under her luxury apartment plotting her weak husband's murder while Ella Raines is pretty endearing and very modern as the smalltown widow and mechanic who collides with Donlevy's life for the better.

The idea of making it into more of a comedy didn't help at all. Characters looked stupid and storyline was ridiculous and boring. After about 30 minutes I kept looking at my watch but I kept going because I wanted to see the ending. What a disappointment! I'm really mad with the final result. Let's hope the 4th installment won't be so crappy. I did enjoy the acting though because Daniel Martin the actor playing Koldo is one of my favorites from Spain and the woman playing the lead role did a good job too but the characters were lacking so much insight that at the end talent wasn't enough. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you're a big fan of the first two and want to see everything related to it!".

I give the director and writers credit for attempting to try something different and add new material that could be categorized as idiotic and Desperate. It seems the original story that I had been very interested in had gone into a complete tangent. The drama sensation of fear within the first two movies are lost as this cheesy flick is what Shaun of the dead could get away with. But when you mix comedy into a serious movie then it becomes a mess to clean up.The movie is slow there's more time wasted on introductions and scenery and then you have a few minutes of chaos... I tried my best to like I truly did again I watched it with an open mind and low expectations. I am certain that this movie will bomb so bad that a final installment maybe canceled or perhaps they will go back to their roots after the angry mob of viewers complain enough to wake the director up.Bottom line See this movie if its free netflix if its there but don't go spending money on this movie I watched over 10 people leave the theatre I should have been one of them sadly.".

There was a pretty good story and i fell in love with the shaky camera. When i saw they were going to create a third and even a fourth movie i was thrilled. I just finished watching it and i can't recommend this to anyone. The storyline of the first two movies is completely gone. There is no progression at all and it just feels like a stand alone horror movie. It doesn't contain any scares and you aren't startled watching it it looks more like an action horror comedy which is over exaggerated on so many levels. And then the shaky cam one of the things the REC series was so famous for is gone as well. The first 20 minutes does contain the shaky cam but after that it's just filmed as any regular movie. People who loved the original two films should stay away from this one. I guess you could just skip to the fourth movie since there is no story telling here. You will be disappointed!".

This sequel to one of the highest earning horror movies of the last years titled Rec is realized in similar premise to original and contains a good cast as Leticia Dolera and Diego Martin . This exciting terror picture displays horrific scenes drama  some brief touches of humor  action suspense and is quite entertaining .

It packs tension shocks  thrills  chills and lots of gore and blood  but the original is far superior . In a clever twist that draws together the plots of the first two movies this third part of the saga also works as a decoder to uncover information hidden in the first two films .

	schema:reviewBody "Seriously all you need to know is that a priest prays away an oncoming horde of zombies. I can't even begin to comprehend how a movie like this gets made. They do away with the handheld camera setup which really is the core of the rec movies. I mean it's called REC for crying out loud. The characters are flat the setup is bizarre  a wedding? Why? and a bunch of the main characters dress up in knights armor to fight zombies. Knights armor. Why? No reason whatsoever. I literally cannot think of a sequel that so completely destroys everything about the franchise that came before it. At this point I'm just venting because IMDb requires ten lines of text for a review when really all you need to know is that a flipping priest prays away an oncoming horde of zombies. What. The. Eff. Oh also the main character is a bride and she cuts off the bottom of her dress with a chainsaw. What?".

They do away with the handheld camera setup which really is the core of the rec movies. I mean it's called REC for crying out loud. The characters are flat the setup is bizarre  a wedding? Why? and a bunch of the main characters dress up in knights armor to fight zombies. Knights armor. Why? No reason whatsoever. I literally cannot think of a sequel that so completely destroys everything about the franchise that came before it. At this point I'm just venting because IMDb requires ten lines of text for a review when really all you need to know is that a flipping priest prays away an oncoming horde of zombies. What. The. Eff. Oh also the main character is a bride and she cuts off the bottom of her dress with a chainsaw. What?";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm pretty sure this movie will polarize viewers more than REC and REC2 did a while back. It's bound to be a 'love it or hate it' scenario with just a few cases of inbetweeners and I was well aware of it even before the theater lights went off. That said I faced this without prejudice beyond having enjoyed thoroughly the two previous chapters and even then I knew about the tonal switch in this new one so I went in prepared for what I thought was going to be both a big departure from the former installments and a silly romp with a lot of concessions to the box office. I'm glad to be able to tell now that I was partly wrong. Let me elaborate.The movie takes some time to take off. It may seem aimed to viewers already familiar with the material so it takes advantage of this by using that time to set the lighter tone of the story and introduce us to the new characters and the group dynamics associated with them. I'd say however that this movie may work even for new viewers and doesn't need any previous knowledge of the franchise to be enjoyed given it's selfcontained nature story wise. Fans of the saga will appreciate every bit and turn in its fullest but there's no need to be and 'academic' in order to enjoy the big picture. Which is very enjoyable IMHO. Anyway the first act works very well. You could swear you're looking at real people on a real wedding thanks in part to some fantastic set pieces and a bunch of very capable actors that are very evidently enjoying themselves. We are presented also to the first glimpses of humor there. To those amongst you worrying about this very public and discussed aspect of the story fear not. I hardly found it over the top and more akin to 'Shawn of the Dead' exploiting certain aspects inherent to the absurdity of this fictitious situation in a 'real' world scenario than to silly romps  la 'Scary Movie'.Now about the horror. Yes there's less in the classic sense of the word. The element of surprise is lost now if you've already seen REC andor REC2 so that's normal. There's jumpy scares and the like of course but even those have a certain air of selfawareness around them. The filmmakers know their trade as evidenced by their former works and experience easy to see when they confront those unavoidable conventions with impeccable timing and good cinematography specially in the exterior shots. There's tense parts however that are equally well resolved and the general sense of flow is successfully achieved with sparse dull moments if any at all. The story flows at a good pace maybe too good and that's my biggest complaint.I think maybe a bit too much story was put to rest in the cutting room. Not enough to disfigure the final results but enough to be noticeable. There's no loose ends or not any that I saw right away and I tend to see those during my first viewing of a movie if they're blatant but there's a number of secondary characters cut off from the story too soon often offcamera leaving evidence of some more screen time being lost somewhere. Maybe it was me sympathizing too much with them a sign of good filmaking and acting by the way or maybe it was a concession to the pace and flow of the movie that forced the hand of the filmmakers. That said I hope there's an extended version of this movie lurking somewhere as I'd love to watch it on a future if only to enjoy more bits of Carmen Contreras'the grandma excellent work.About the cast I found it suited perfectly to my own surprise. I had certain reservations concerning the actors playing the main characters Diego Martn and Leticia Dolera but those prejudices were based on biased visions of each one's previous works and were swiftly put to rest after watching the very first scenes of this movie. They really carry the story and do a great job out of it. Martn does a great job playing the groom with a knightinshiningarmor complex displaying a great comedic timing and a full set of subtle quirks than enriches his character with little nuances that turn a potentially dull role into something much more human and likable. On the other hand Leticia Dolera does great as the bride showing lots of versatility when confronting the more emotionally complex situations she's given to work with and also fitting the more physically demanding scenes as well. If you enjoyed her previous work specially in 'Mad Dogs' then you'll love her turn here. I know I did and my wife too and we were both biased against her before watching her work here so that speaks volumes. The rest of the cast is also excellent with no weak links. Maybe the youngest actors struggle a bit with their lines but it's barely noticeable given their limited screen time and nonetheless adequate.In short 'REC3Genesis' turned out for me as a great escapist movie paired in quality if not in tone with its two older sisters. The script is fun well constructed for what it is the dialogue flows with the action there's mild scares gore great direction and cast and works well both as a selfcontained story and as a part of the saga. For a fun night in the movies you can hardly go wrong if you're a fan of the genre andor the two previous installments. Chances are even if you're none you won't feel bored or intellectually offended for what's on offer here and this in my humble opinion is more than you can ask for in those days of remakes and ad nauseam repeated formulas. Just my two cents.".

	schema:headline " My bloody waggish wedding";
	schema:reviewBody "REC scared the hell out of me five years ago. I was really terrified with the idea of being locked in somewhere with a horde of infected people but I also became a huge fan o it. REC is so original and unique in the found footage genre and in the nonHollywoodian films that Hollywood couldn't spent one year without copying it. Anyway REC was even more exciting and I just couldn't wait for its next two installments the Gnesis and the Apocalipse. Then my soawaited REC Gnesis came months ago and I left the theater amused and confused. When announced it was supposed to be a prequel telling the origins of the infectionpossession and that is just what this film is not about. Plus the events take place exactly on the same night of the the two first films but Gnesis shows something totally different from what we saw before. A dark claustrophobic premise became something like Shaun of the Dead mixed to any soap opera romance by its own creators what is even more disappointing. Not that Gnesis should be claustrophobic but the idea could be better explored as in its previous films. Although it disappointed fans Gnesis is a good deal of fun gore and features original elements that might be iconic among the horror universe. Leticia Dolera is really good and sexy in the role of Clara the zombie slayer that fights for her happiness and her love in her special day in a funny Spanish chainsaw massacre. Diego Martn is Koldo the encouraged armed groom. Both agonize as they're obligated to lacerate their own family while looking for each other. The whole aspect and boldness of the infected is completely different from REC and REC but it's creepier now. The acting of Dolera and Martn is wondrous just as the special effects now in a higher level of action and gore. On matters of continuity it leaves more questions than answers. Primaly because it's not a prequel. The genesis mentioned on it is actually under another context nothing about the outbreak origins which kind of betrays the saga or the first impression the title transmitted when it was first announced. And yes the film has some level of comedy but not as Shaun has. When you consider Gnesis another chapter of the franchise it has almost nothing to do with REC. But when you watch it ignoring everything you have seen before it's not so bad. I'm not that sure it belongs to the REC saga but it's still a horror movie. And a very good one.".

	onyx:emotionText "REC scared the hell out of me five years ago. I was really terrified with the idea of being locked in somewhere with a horde of infected people but I also became a huge fan o it. REC is so original and unique in the found footage genre and in the nonHollywoodian films that Hollywood couldn't spent one year without copying it. Anyway REC was even more exciting and I just couldn't wait for its next two installments the Gnesis and the Apocalipse. Then my soawaited REC Gnesis came months ago and I left the theater amused and confused. When announced it was supposed to be a prequel telling the origins of the infectionpossession and that is just what this film is not about. Plus the events take place exactly on the same night of the the two first films but Gnesis shows something totally different from what we saw before. A dark claustrophobic premise became something like Shaun of the Dead mixed to any soap opera romance by its own creators what is even more disappointing. Not that Gnesis should be claustrophobic but the idea could be better explored as in its previous films. Although it disappointed fans Gnesis is a good deal of fun gore and features original elements that might be iconic among the horror universe. Leticia Dolera is really good and sexy in the role of Clara the zombie slayer that fights for her happiness and her love in her special day in a funny Spanish chainsaw massacre. Diego Martn is Koldo the encouraged armed groom. Both agonize as they're obligated to lacerate their own family while looking for each other. The whole aspect and boldness of the infected is completely different from REC and REC but it's creepier now.

But if you are a true fan you'll understand why.The movie tells the story of Clara and Koldo a couple that is about to get married and how the infection reaches their wedding party. The director Paco Plaza utilizes for this film the same first person shaky camerawork during its first part pretitle screen. That puts you close to the characters specially the groom and the bride and you quickly empathize with them. The acting is also extremely good and convincing and that helps a lot to make the found footage even more believable.After the title screen the movie shifts its style to a normal feature film. The decision was definitely made due to the huge limitations imposed by the POV approach. Now with total freedom the director can follow more than one character at the same time and moreover play a little with the horror genre by mixing it with black humor with clear references to the cult classic Evil Dead II like for instance in the way the bride fights the infected in the underground scene. These homages are thrilling and most importantly work perfectly with the story and the movie as a whole. Presenting a perfect mix of comedy and horror the movie also has some hilarious moments such as the how the groom finds his weapon of choice in a small church.The references to the first two films are also cleverly shown during the projection without stopping the movie to give explanations which would compromise its pace. As a result this entry is certainly the best in the series and builds a lot of expectation for the final part of the Rec series.".

Finally we were going to learn of the origins of the infection! We were going to learn about the Medeiros girl who she was how she came to be the first infected what the Vatican had to do with everything the experiments that were conducted how the enzyme was isolated... We were going to learn SO MUCH COOL STUFF about how the infection happened!Except NO. THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED.What happened instead was a random story about a random couple that got married and the uncle of the groom was randomly bitten by some random dog that was apparently randomly infected with the virus. Cue random outbreak of infected people and the film randomly going from handheld camera filming style to 35mm motion picture film gauge. Cue the bride brandishing a chainsaw and going all Bruce Campbell from The Evil Dead trilogy on the zombies while her husband stumbles about in St. George's heavy knight armour like he's Sir Lancelot I'm not even kidding. With lots of tongueincheek humour that made me feel like I was watching a modernday Grindhouse movie. And a priest that stops the zombies at the end by reading a bible over the PA system. No explanation of how the virus got out. No explanation of how the virus started. No information about the Medeiros girl. Nothing at all really related to the previous two movies apart from vague insinuations that led nowhere. Nothing explained at all. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Zippo. Zero.The ONLY good thing about this movie is that the two main characters  the bride and the groom both of whom I couldn't stand  die at the end. Had one or both of them survived I would have felt even more pssed off and ripped off than I already did. I couldn't even appreciate the reasonably well done gore because of how pssed off I was at this film. My rating 1010.".

The first twenty minutes of the film followed the conventional found footage way of story telling but later it got changed to the normal track. The script was awesome and so was the acting. The guy who played Koldo deserves special mention his emotions were apt and terrific. The other characters including the female protagonist did good jobs. And a couple of oneliners in the midst of all those gores would bring the house down with people laughing. The comic timings were so awesome. The film featured some good gore also but i being a gore fan felt that the gore and the violence should have been more. Though the scare quotient was nearly zero the movie was outstanding but do not expect the same way of storytelling they used in the two previous films. On the whole it was an awesome experience bringing the series to a completely new level of a more serious film making. Cheers to the entire crew for such a fantastic one. I would rate it 810.".

And after that they were able to turn things big time again.First of all they dropped the handcam thing after the first 15 minutes and they made up a story so surreal with scenes and characters that even Tarantino would love. By the end of the movie we won't learn anything new but the use of minor things makes the whole thing quite brilliant like the man in the Sponge Bob costume the bride with the chainsaw the groom in the armor with the shield... I must admit that there were many times when I just couldn't stop myself from giggling about some scenes.In conclusion the story is like a fairytale turned into a zombie movie and there's no one expecting for a happy ending.

	schema:reviewBody "'REC 3 GENESIS' Three and a Half Stars Out of FiveThe third film in the popular Spanish horror series that runs concurrent to the events of the original film with a set of entirely new characters. This one revolves around the zombie outbreak happening at a wedding reception and is played out pretty tongueincheek rather than the more serious tone the original two films took. I haven't seen the original film or it's sequel but I have seen it's American remake 'QUARANTINE' which I've heard isn't nearly as good as the Spanish original. Fans of the original two films for the most part have been quoted as being fairly disappointed with this third entry primarily because it's so different but as a standalone film it's received rather high marks from viewers. That's why I thought it couldn't hurt to see it before the other two films and for the most part I was pretty entertained. The film begins as a 'Found Footage' style film like the original two films but then it changes to the traditional thirdperson view about twenty minutes in which is another variation from the original two films. It revolves around the wedding of Koldo Diego Martin and Clara Leticia Dolera. Everything is going beautifully except Koldo's uncle appears sick and drunk and says he was bitten by a dog. When he falls from the balcony on to the dance floor at the reception family and friends rush to his assistance. That's when he starts biting and vomiting blood on other guests. Other infected zombies storm on to the dance floor and chaos ensues. Koldo and Clara are separated and spend the rest of the film trying to reunite as everyone keeps dying and becoming infected around them. I found the film to be kind of refreshing it was slightly different than any zombie film I've seen before. It sort of played out a little like a 'DIE HARD' film set at a wedding reception with a zombie outbreak. I liked the humor and I liked the changing of film styles from action and horror to comedy and romance as well as handheld to thirdperson. I also liked the gore and I thought they found pretty cool and somewhat original ways of offing zombies. I really liked the religious tieins as well. It's subtitled 'GENESIS' because a priest explains that the zombie outbreak was predicted in the Bible under 'Genesis' and he finds a way to fight zombies using prayer which is pretty cool. It's directed and cowritten along with Luiso Berdejo and David Gallart by Paco Plaza who also codirected and cowrote the first two films and I think he did a pretty good job of breathing new life in to a tired genre. Nothing too impressive but fun nonetheless.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpwww.youtube.comwatch?v6qTKOxmDvq0".

	onyx:emotionText "'REC 3 GENESIS' Three and a Half Stars Out of FiveThe third film in the popular Spanish horror series that runs concurrent to the events of the original film with a set of entirely new characters. This one revolves around the zombie outbreak happening at a wedding reception and is played out pretty tongueincheek rather than the more serious tone the original two films took. I haven't seen the original film or it's sequel but I have seen it's American remake 'QUARANTINE' which I've heard isn't nearly as good as the Spanish original. Fans of the original two films for the most part have been quoted as being fairly disappointed with this third entry primarily because it's so different but as a standalone film it's received rather high marks from viewers. That's why I thought it couldn't hurt to see it before the other two films and for the most part I was pretty entertained. The film begins as a 'Found Footage' style film like the original two films but then it changes to the traditional thirdperson view about twenty minutes in which is another variation from the original two films. It revolves around the wedding of Koldo Diego Martin and Clara Leticia Dolera. Everything is going beautifully except Koldo's uncle appears sick and drunk and says he was bitten by a dog. When he falls from the balcony on to the dance floor at the reception family and friends rush to his assistance. That's when he starts biting and vomiting blood on other guests. Other infected zombies storm on to the dance floor and chaos ensues. Koldo and Clara are separated and spend the rest of the film trying to reunite as everyone keeps dying and becoming infected around them. I found the film to be kind of refreshing it was slightly different than any zombie film I've seen before. It sort of played out a little like a 'DIE HARD' film set at a wedding reception with a zombie outbreak. I liked the humor and I liked the changing of film styles from action and horror to comedy and romance as well as handheld to thirdperson.

I'm guessing its because they deviated from the originals that were excellent in their own right but so what? That storyline was played out they knew it so they came up with something different. I have a feeling it WOULD be a hit if it wasn't under the Rec title. Seriously its worth watching. It was suspenseful but doesn't take itself too seriously. Unlike the previous 2 movies Almost reminded me of Army of Darkness.I also loved the ending  I thought the bit with the hearing aid was brilliant as was the tiein at the very end when you hear an extraction team going in quick and easy. One last point to detract from all the haters  even though it took on a totally different style it still perpetuates the storyline from the first two movies. I suppose some people were hoping that the third installment would dive even deeper into the info released in the second flick but honestly that would have been boring as heck. Think the Excorcist sequels  the Damien sequels  etc. Instead they moved the story along in a different and entertaining way and kept the loop open for another potential final movie in the series. I only hope the jeers don't prevent them from making a inclusion.".

There was mention of the Depression Germany and the rest of the world was in and all five of the principal players were affected by it one way or another. John Barrymore Lionel Barrymore Greta Garbo Wallace Beery and Joan Crawford all check into the Grand Hotel one day and their lives are never the same. Greta Garbo is the temperamental Russian ballerina Grusinskaya and her artistic tantrums are getting less and less tolerable in many ways because of the Depression. John Barrymore is the aristocrat now living in genteel poverty. His world ended with World War I but the Depression reduced him to being a sneak thief. Lionel Barrymore is the terminally ill bookkeeper who now just wants to spend his last days living it up. He's just going to ignore the Depression. Wallace Beery is the Prussian industrialist who's used to high living having married the boss's daughter but his firm as so many others is about to go under unless he can pull off a merger. Lionel Barrymore is one of hundreds who work for him and know what an extremely little man he is that Beery is really lacking in any real ability for business. Finally there's Joan Crawford who's a working class girl hired as a stenographer by Beery who has other things on his mind for Crawford.Whether in Germany or America Joan Crawford is the eternal shop girl. To her credit she does not attempt any kind of a Teutonic accent and her performance rings true. This is in complete contrast to Susan and God where she was consciously trying to imitate Gertrude Lawrence from the stage. This was the Depression in America too and many could identify with her.No one epitomized class and old world elegance like John Barrymore he was not better on film than here in Grand Hotel. He hates the life that poverty has reduced him to. Using his old world charm as a facade for being a thief tears him inside. Meeting Greta Garbo gives him a last chance at redeeming his life.Garbo's performance is one of her best as well. I'm not sure any other actress could have made you sympathize with the temperamental ballerina. In the hands of anyone less skilled the audience would have sympathized with the management of her ballet company who want to can her. When John Barrymore enters her life he's like the audience she entertained over the years rolled up in one person who still cares about her the individual. It's a last chance for happiness for her as well.Wallace Beery had a funny thing not happened to him in Grand Hotel which I won't reveal might have been quite comfortable with the regime to come in Germany. Beery is the only one in the film to attempt any kind of Germanic speech and he does succeed in his portrayal of the hateful industrialist Preysing.My favorite in Grand Hotel has always been Lionel Barrymore. Lionel may very well have been the most talented in the Barrymore family. Playing the gentle terminally ill Kringelein is light years different from Mr. Potter in It's A Wonderful Life or Captain Disko Troup in Captains Courageous. Three very different roles yet Lionel Barrymore imprints his personality on every one. A meek little man he's got courage enough now courage that comes when you have absolutely nothing to lose.Grand Hotel is now 75 years old. The style of acting you see here is old fashioned indeed no one could remake Grand Hotel today in the same style. It's melodramatic but it works. It's a fascinating look into the last days of the Weimar Republic as seen from the balcony of a suite at the Grand Hotel in Berlin.".

	schema:reviewBody "GRAND HOTEL MetroGoldwynMayer 1932 directed by Edmund Goulding from the stage production by Vicki Baum marks one of MGM's most prestigious projects. Other than being one of those rare films from the 1930s to be frequently revived if not overplayed on television over the past decades it has stood the test of time solely due its impressive allstar cast. Of the five major leading actors feature billing goes to Greta Garbo MGM's most important boxoffice star to date. Unlike other Garbo films GRAND HOTEL is not all Garbo. She shares screen time with other topnamed MGM performers ranging from John and Lionel Barrymore Wallace Beery and Lewis Stone. The only other major actress to appear in this production is the youthful and downtoearth Joan Crawford who in fact is on screen more than the legendary Garbo. While many might consider Crawford the best of the two female stars Garbo who's acting style is somewhat different from the others should be observed and studied. Her role as Grusinskaya the Russian ballerina is performed two ways that of a lonely depressed dancer striving for success then after encountering the Baron John Barrymore becomes full of joy and laughter. Watching this transformation on screen is like seeing the two sides of Garbo.Edmund Goulding directs this 113 minute drama at a fastpace starting its opening with overhead camera shots of numerous switchboard operators connecting the incoming calls followed by the brief introduction of the central characters conversing on the telephone in the hotel lobby Senf Jean Hersholt the head hotel clerk awaits the news of his wife who is about to give birth to their child Otto Kringelein Lionel Barrymore a bookkeeper diagnosed with an incurable disease who quits his job to enjoy his remaining days to the fullest Preysing Wallace Beery a nononsense industrialist staying at the hotel to negotiate a business deal with important clients Suzette Rafaella Ottiano the maid to the famous Russian dancer Grusinskaya who expresses concern about her employer Baron Felix Von Greigern John Barrymore an adventurer traveling with his Dachshund dog desperately in need of money to pay off a heavy debt planning his latest robbery by stealing valuable jewels from the famous ballerina and Otternschlag Lewis Stone a scarred doctor who walks about the hotel lobby observing the goings on and reciting to himself quietly Grand Hotel people come people go and NOTHING ever happens! Things start to happen as Flaemmchen Joan Crawford a stenographer with ambition is hired by Preysing as his personal secretary. She soon makes the acquaintance of the handsome Baron and the poorly dressed Kringelein. Later that evening after the lonely and unhappy Grusinskaya Greta Garbo leaves the hotel for the theater the Baron sneaks into her room from the outside window to rob her. After she returns the Baron still there hides himself only to take notice that Grusinskaya unhappy intends on taking her own life. He suddenly appears telling her he's one of her biggest admirers. In spite of telling the Baron that she wants to be alone the Baron remains and confesses everything. How will the Baron be able to get money he so desperately needs? As for the other guests will Preysing a married man with two grown daughters who has made Flaemmchen his mistress after working hours succeed with his business negotiations? Will Flaemmchen continue to get something out of life by not being particular on how she does it? Will Grusinskaya marry her beloved jewel thief Baron or will she go on with her career? Will Kringelein find the happiness he deserves before he succumbs? What will his hotel bill be after checking out from most expensive hotel in Germany? Will that kill him before his illness does?While GRAND HOTEL could have told its stories in separate installments it's done as one film focusing on separate characters through different time frames. Of the central characters only Senf the hotel clerk Hersholt is the least important appearing only in a few scenes unrelated to the plot. Lewis Stone's role is also secondary but memorable especially with his opening and closing lines. Wallace Berry is cast against type sporting glasses a short haircut mustache and the only American actor speaking with a German accent. Lionel Barrymore sporting a derby oversized clothing thick mustache and glasses is almost unrecognizable as Kringelein. In fact he almost comes off best over all the major actors. Although playing a tragic figure he does have a classic drunken comedy bit along with a poignant scene where after winning a large sum of money playing cards discovers that his wallet containing all his money is missing.Fortunately GRAND HOTEL does not play like a filmed stage play. The art deco and luxurious sets are a sight to behold. And why not? The Grand Hotel happens to be the most expensive and luxurious hotel in Berlin. GRAND HOTEL obviously registered well upon its release. It won the Academy Award as Best Picture of 193132. In later years GRAND HOTEL has become imitated and spoofed many times. MGM remade GRAND HOTEL as WEEKEND AT THE WALDORF 1945 modernizing the story to contemporary New York City with World War II background featuring its top marquee names of the day Ginger Rogers Lana Turner Walter Pidgeon and Van Johnson. It was later adapted into a Broadway musical in the 1990s. Both screen versions are available on video cassette DVD and Turner Classic Movies cable television. For a good time with a film classic check in the GRAND HOTEL and see what the stars are doing for the weekend. ".

The actress indeed has a stronger presence than Garbo and she's simply terrific. Lionel Barrymore and John Barrymore are equally impressive. Lionel is particularly good in balancing his characters tragedy and comedy. The supporting cast is adequate.The cinematography is amazing as it gives us a marvelous glare of the grandness of the Grand Hotel the overhead shot of the operators who're connecting the incoming calls and then focussing on the different characters who're all either desperate for money happiness or nothing as they are satisfied with what they have e.g. the head hotel clerk. Everyone is shown to be busy with their own individual life and this is further stressed on in the final scene.In addition to that the set designs are spectacular reflecting the indifferent atmosphere and the beauty of the hotel. The reference to the War is also put in a very subtle way as the film was made in the 30s through the Baron's story and the scar on the doctor's face. Some might be bored in the beginning due to the slow pace but just bear with it the film does get better and one will indeed understand why it stood the test of time. A grand classic it is indeed!".

In fact this seems to be one of the first films to have relied in the prominent names it gathered to portray the different characters in the movie.By today's standards the film is dated but for a discriminating film fan Grand Hotel is a classic because of the star turns one witnesses. Also today's fans have to make concessions for the style of acting that was prevalent at the time. The movies have begun talking not long before this film was made and the stars of those silents were still doing their acting in front of the camera as though no one was going to hear them talk. In fact most of the complaints in comments submitted to this forum would have been different if this was 1932 and the film had just come out.The best advice for anyone new to this film is to sit back relax and enjoy the trials and tribulations of the people seen at Berlin's Grand Hotel.The biggest surprise of the film is the shortness of Greta Garbo presence in the film in which for some unknown reason she looms large above the rest of the players. As the Russian ballerina Grusinskaya Ms. Garbo played one of the best characters of her career. Her way of acting is still imbued with what was expected of her.John Barrymore as the Baron Von Geigern the impoverished nobleman is key to the story. The moment he meets the great Grusinskaya he is lost forever. Lionel Barrymore is excellent as the poor Otto Kringelein who thinks he is going to die real soon. Joan Crawford is the stenographer Flaemmchen who seems to arise passion among all the men she meets. Ms. Crawford does excellent work in a role she discarded later on in favor of more dramatic appearances.What makes Grand Hotel the timeless classic it became is the magnificent camera work by William H. Daniels a man who knew how to get the best out of Greta Garbo in their many films together. Also the music which is from Franz Lehar's The Merry Widow serves as a nice distraction in the background.The most famous phrase in the film I want to be alone seems prophetic in retrospect as the divine Garbo had about eight more years in the movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "Some seventyodd years after its release in 1932 GRAND HOTEL today holds an interesting attraction more for the presence of its two leading ladies than from its cinematic power although there will be some purists who will state that because the images of Joan Crawford and Greta Garbo have been immortalized in their own respective canons that in itself is cinematic power. I personally won't argue preferring to stick to my own personal views instead of following the herd.I've seen GRAND HOTEL twice now and I'll grant it that despite its soapopera like story lines there seems to be something a little deeper going on which is only alluded to in the sidelines the delicate tightrope which Flammchen Joan Crawford walks on as she is courted by Presyling Wallace Beery and later on decides to stay by Otto Kringelein's Lionel Barrymore side. This was most probably unintentional since sources state that the screenplay follows the story closely but today's values would have Flammchen behave much differently. I find her character to be the moral opposite of Barbara Stanwyck's amoral Lily Powers in BABY FACE another woman who uses her sexuality to advance to the top. Joan Crawford's Flammchen doesn't actively use her charms as sort of glide by while positively glowing and stealing all of the light from Garbo and one can sense that were she of a much different nature all of the men in GRAND HOTEL would have a dangerous young woman to deal with and Barrymore's end would be similar to J. Howard Marshall's demise in the hands of a much smarter less cokedup Anna Nicole Smith. She'd more than likely wind up owning the hotel herself in no time.But not to digress. The plot moves along in a nice pace thanks to Goulding's direction never does it linger on too much on one specific character though at least for me anytime Garbo was on screen the story came to a crashing halt. I'm going to get a lot of flack from rabid Garbo fans but I don't get her allure her mystery the essence that made her so intriguing. At twentyseven she already looks ten years older thanks to her severe nature. Her face is constantly in a frown moody full of angst reflected in her throaty voice. Her performance is so atrociously mannered I can see Jennifer Jason Leigh easily outdoing her but better more authentic anyone who recalls her exacting yet eccentric portrayal of Dorothy Parker can easily see her becoming and improving Garbo. I never got to see what her character with the unpronounceable name was all about no true trauma just this deathwish to be left alone. Then she capriciously takes on with the Baron von Geigern a dashing yet shady John Barrymore who is more interested in her jewels but tells her he could love her he outacts her at every turn with subtlety and genuine charm even when his part seems underwritten. In short Garbo for all her mystique is the sore thumb of GRAND HOTEL.I much prefer the events surrounding Crawford and the older Barrymore. Lionel Barrymore the horrible villain from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE plays a meek former bookkeeper who is at the end of his life and wants to enjoy his stay at the hotel. His wish is quite simple he wants to enjoy his last days a diametric opposite to Garbo who wants to be alone and she says it three times. He teams up with Crawford enjoys a dance with her and falls for her even though she's much too young. All the time I got the sensation he knew the character of Kringelein a man who has been pushed around by Preysling and is still not quite free of his micromanaging shadow.

	onyx:emotionText "Some seventyodd years after its release in 1932 GRAND HOTEL today holds an interesting attraction more for the presence of its two leading ladies than from its cinematic power although there will be some purists who will state that because the images of Joan Crawford and Greta Garbo have been immortalized in their own respective canons that in itself is cinematic power. I personally won't argue preferring to stick to my own personal views instead of following the herd.I've seen GRAND HOTEL twice now and I'll grant it that despite its soapopera like story lines there seems to be something a little deeper going on which is only alluded to in the sidelines the delicate tightrope which Flammchen Joan Crawford walks on as she is courted by Presyling Wallace Beery and later on decides to stay by Otto Kringelein's Lionel Barrymore side. This was most probably unintentional since sources state that the screenplay follows the story closely but today's values would have Flammchen behave much differently. I find her character to be the moral opposite of Barbara Stanwyck's amoral Lily Powers in BABY FACE another woman who uses her sexuality to advance to the top. Joan Crawford's Flammchen doesn't actively use her charms as sort of glide by while positively glowing and stealing all of the light from Garbo and one can sense that were she of a much different nature all of the men in GRAND HOTEL would have a dangerous young woman to deal with and Barrymore's end would be similar to J. Howard Marshall's demise in the hands of a much smarter less cokedup Anna Nicole Smith. She'd more than likely wind up owning the hotel herself in no time.But not to digress. The plot moves along in a nice pace thanks to Goulding's direction never does it linger on too much on one specific character though at least for me anytime Garbo was on screen the story came to a crashing halt. I'm going to get a lot of flack from rabid Garbo fans but I don't get her allure her mystery the essence that made her so intriguing. At twentyseven she already looks ten years older thanks to her severe nature. Her face is constantly in a frown moody full of angst reflected in her throaty voice. Her performance is so atrociously mannered I can see Jennifer Jason Leigh easily outdoing her but better more authentic anyone who recalls her exacting yet eccentric portrayal of Dorothy Parker can easily see her becoming and improving Garbo. I never got to see what her character with the unpronounceable name was all about no true trauma just this deathwish to be left alone. Then she capriciously takes on with the Baron von Geigern a dashing yet shady John Barrymore who is more interested in her jewels but tells her he could love her he outacts her at every turn with subtlety and genuine charm even when his part seems underwritten. In short Garbo for all her mystique is the sore thumb of GRAND HOTEL.I much prefer the events surrounding Crawford and the older Barrymore. Lionel Barrymore the horrible villain from IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE plays a meek former bookkeeper who is at the end of his life and wants to enjoy his stay at the hotel. His wish is quite simple he wants to enjoy his last days a diametric opposite to Garbo who wants to be alone and she says it three times. He teams up with Crawford enjoys a dance with her and falls for her even though she's much too young. All the time I got the sensation he knew the character of Kringelein a man who has been pushed around by Preysling and is still not quite free of his micromanaging shadow. There is not a shed of ego in his performance. One can imagine seeing Crawford reach out to the older gentleman and actually making his days happier and is a fitting ending to her own storyline as she is lecherously pursued by Wallace Beery and romanced by John Barrymore. If anything her character is the most sympathetic of the five main characters and the symbol of the emerging modern woman of the Thirties ambitious but girlish efficient but not a workaholic smart and independent despite struggling to make ends meet.GRAND HOTEL hasn't aged well.

	schema:reviewBody "Grand Hotel remains surprisingly effective even today and as some reviewers have suggested is a precursor to Robert Altman's style of filmmaking in which many characters interact and bounce off one another in unexpected ways. The action moves at a quick pace as the scene constantly shifts between the characters. Director Edmund Goulding even utilized wipes to change the scene which must have seemed very hightech back in the early 1930's.The narrative form is fluid allowing each character to nicely develop his or her storyline in relation to the others. A story like Grand Hotel could easily become staid and setbound especially considering it was taken from a play but the interesting sets exquisite costumes and the countless players keep the excitement level high.The performances are certainly firstrate as one would expect from the Alist cast. I do realize that many of today's viewers find Greta Garbo's aging Russian ballerina to be an exercise in overindulgence but I do enjoy her immensely! And who here today actually knows for certain how an aging Russian ballerina would act out when alone in her hotel room or with her entourage? Have today's critics spent time with Garbo's contemporary Pavlova and found her by example to be much more subdued and controlled? It is not too much of a stretch to believe that Garbo's Grusinskaya may have existed in the actuality of 1932.And what fun it is watching her as she goes through every emotion imaginable! Her great voice was always one of her best tools and she certainly uses it to advantage here throwing away lines that other actresses would have played up and viceversa. And the tight close ups of her beautiful face are breathtaking! I will only mention one scene specifically when she futilely attempts to telephone her lover the Baron in the middle of the night. Alone on the screen she pleads for him to pick up at times excited and joyful quickly turning into desperation and despair and back again. She cradles the telephone receiver as if it were her lover.Another knockout performance comes from the young Joan Crawford who in this huge production proved to the world she was an excellent actress who could hold the screen with any seasoned pro. As the shapely stenographer Flaemmchen Crawford is absolutely stunning as beautiful as Garbo and a sexuality that certainly made guys in the audience take careful notice. And the profile of her extraordinary face was surely as great as John Barrymore's more famous one! She lends a distinct eroticism to her role as she expertly delivers her character's suggestive dialogue often with an resigned air of cynicism or jaded pessimism.Of the male characters Wallace Beery definitely commands attention! His portrayal of the desperate industrialist Preysing is both repellent and charismatic. As a man who exudes power and slowly begins to lose control his performance is expertly crafted and layered. And I'd be remiss not to mention the Barrymore brothers who round out the cast superbly. John charms both the men and women on screen with natural ease while Lionel whimpers and whines like no other ever could. Both their characters are heartbreaking each in his individual way. Even lesser characters like Lewis Stone's horribly scarred doctor in makeup that truly is disturbing and Rafaela Ottiano's maid have their moments in the spotlight.Minor spoiler aheadOne scene that I found poignant was the bell boy quickly escorting the Baron's poor pet dachshund out the hotel lobby by its leash. They pass a janitor sweeping the floor with a large push broom who without reason shoves the small dog along with the broom causing it to stumble. The poor thing wondering what hit it turns around as it scoots along only to have the janitor sweep a cloud of dust into its face. A truly sad small moment as the viewer is left to wonder what will become of the dog now that it has lost its status as the beloved pet of a nobleman.End of minor spoilerYes Grand Hotel still remains splendid entertainment!".

	schema:reviewBody "Edmund Goulding's 1932 film Grand Hotel about 48 hours in a plush German hotel has a dream cast. Grusinskaya Greta Garbo is a Russian prima ballerina in town for several performances who is lonely a drama queen and suicidal. She meets Baron von Geigern John Barrymore a hotel thief who inadvertently is in her room having been in the process of stealing some jewelry when she is about to commit suicide and stays the night with her convincing her not to end things. The two fall in love of course much to the disappointment of Flaemmchen Joan Crawford a woman that von Geigern was romancing the day before. Flaemmchen is a stenographer and her boss German tycoon Preysing Wallace Beery is having a hard time with a merger he is trying to transact. One of Preysing's employees at a factory he owns is bookkeeper Otto Kringelein Lionel Barrymore. Otto is staying at the hotel because he only has a short time to live so he takes his entire life savings and decides to live the rest of his life in luxury. Throughout the 48 hours that the action takes place friendships are made loves are found and lost and a murder changes the lives of all of the main characters.Grand Hotel won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1932 and it is easy to see why. The film is an epic without having an enormous cast or exotic locales. From the films that I have seen of this decade this is one of the first examples of an intertwining narrative structure. We are used to seeing this now think Altman in particular where characters are all somehow connected even though they may not even know each other. Another fine early example that I can recall was a decade later with Tales of Manhattan. The acting is incredible though Garbo's REALLY overthetop performance was a bit much. Realizing that she was a drama queen as a profession I excused a lot of it but it got to a point where I was really snickering to myself after awhile because she was acting just like Gloria Swanson later would in Sunset Boulevard. One explanation could be that this was still a really early stage of the talking picture and silent films solely relied on gestures and facial expressions to convey emotion. I was very impressed with the performances of the Barrymore brothers I've always loved Lionel Barrymore and was stunned by Crawford's talent as well as beauty.Grand Hotel is rife with melodrama but it was not hackneyed or maudlin. I am actually quite surprised it isn't on the IMDb top 250 list I found it to be that good. I am a big fan of Douglas Sirk's melodramatic films of the 1940's and 1950's and Grand Hotel is a great predecessor of that genre. 710 Shelly".

	schema:reviewBody "I still like this film. It has some grievous overacting by Garbo as a ballerina on the skids. But the film works for all that. Grushinskaya has passed her prime as a ballerina and her world weariness masks her awareness that her days of international greatness are over. She has nothing to look forward to  in fact her position is not that different from Anne Bancroft in THE TURNING POINT who can teach ballet but has no family life to comfort her like her old friendrival Shirley MacLaine does.She momentarily does get a shot for happiness in retirement she meets Baron Geiger John Barrymore and finds he would be able to satisfy her. And he finds she would be fine for him. But his problem is he is broke and owes his criminal partners for the money that set him up in this great hotel in Berlin. He has to pay them back  he was going to steal Grushinskaya's jewels but he won't do that now.GRAND HOTEL is like that every time you watch it. It was written in the aftermath of World War I and keeping that in mind you see the fractured bodies and lives that are colliding in the hotel. Lewis Stone for example is the man who makes the famous statement about nothing ever happens at the conclusion of the film. His Doctor Otternschlag is the hotel doctor and is not very observant by the time he makes the comment a murder has occurred in the hotel and he is unaware of it. His face is scarred by a gas attack in the war. The war has probably made the doctor relatively quiet  and seeking quiet as much as possible. Hence his blindness. Wallace Beery is Preysling the textile manufacturer who is there for a big business conference and is facing bankruptcy  as was all of Germany which had terrible inflation in 1923 due to war reparation and debt. Geiger's Prewar cushion of wealth and position were swept away with the Hohenzollern dynasty in 1918. He was unlucky enough to survive his world and most of his friends. And the small fry in the film Kringelein Lionel Barrymore and Flaemchen Joan Crawford find their futures in considerable doubt too. Lionel is dying we are never quite sure of what but it sounds like it's industrial related  he works for Preysling's firm and Crawford is aware that secretaries are a dime a dozen and needs to better herself  even if it means sleeping with the likes of Preysling. One can also add Senf Jean Hersholt who has to stay at his hotel job while his wife is facing a dangerous childbirth which is worrying him to death.The collisions between the characters is fascinating too as the Prewar standards of social class is up in the air now. Preysling is aware of his feet of clay but he is still known as a big textile manufacturer to the public. So he is not deeply impressed by John Barrymore's Baron but every time they confront each other the Baron's superior breeding outshines Preysling's pompous bluster. Kringelein too is confronted by Preysling who thinks the bookkeeper's appearance at that expensive hostelry suggests embezzlement. Kringelein not only shows that he is not in a position to be threatened by police or discharge but adds that Preysling's blunders are such as to have merited being fired if he hadn't been boss. Preysling does make a kind of headway with Flaemchen but it is only on a cash basis  she really is far friendlier to the Baron and Kringelein.GRAND HOTEL had been a major Broadway stage success when it was acquired by MGM. Preysling was originally played by Siegfried Ruman later Sig Ruman and the Baron by Albert Van Dekker later Albert Dekker. Neither ended up in the MGM production though both had distinguished film careers later on. The producer of the film was Paul Bern who would be found dead in his home in 1932 just before the final cut was made on the movie. This is not the spot to analyze whether Bern was a suicide officially he was or was murdered by his wife Jean Harlow or some other person a previous wife who killed herself a day or so afterward but it led to Bern's friend and mentor Irving Thalberg completing the film as producer. Neither man's name is on the credits. However Bern's hand is on the film  including the casting. He would have been facing a great producing career if he had lived.The most notable thing about the leads is that except for Garbo's Swedish accent  here as a Russian ballerina only Beery tries a German accent. It comes and goes unfortunately but Beery's lost bull in the china shop performance is good enough not to be harmed by it. Preysling is a weak man who married the boss's daughter to get ahead but lacked the brains to keep the firm going. In the end he has to lie to try to survive his conference with rival Tully Marshall. Unfortunately he cannot control his passions and anger.It is said on this thread that Buster Keaton was supposed to play Kringelien. Presumably his alcoholism prevented it. But Lionel Barrymore gives a good accounting as the dying man. Yet Buster actually liked the idea. He tried to create interest in a comedy to star himself Edward Everett Horton and Marie Dressler called GRAND MILLS HOTEL set in the infamous flop house in Manhattan. The same blending of the film's plots would have occurred. It never got beyond the drawing board. Laurel  Hardy would have been in the Tully Marshall and Wallace Beery roles as button manufacturers who are trying to make a contract. Pity it might have been a good comedy.".

	onyx:emotionText "I still like this film. It has some grievous overacting by Garbo as a ballerina on the skids. But the film works for all that. Grushinskaya has passed her prime as a ballerina and her world weariness masks her awareness that her days of international greatness are over. She has nothing to look forward to  in fact her position is not that different from Anne Bancroft in THE TURNING POINT who can teach ballet but has no family life to comfort her like her old friendrival Shirley MacLaine does.She momentarily does get a shot for happiness in retirement she meets Baron Geiger John Barrymore and finds he would be able to satisfy her. And he finds she would be fine for him. But his problem is he is broke and owes his criminal partners for the money that set him up in this great hotel in Berlin. He has to pay them back  he was going to steal Grushinskaya's jewels but he won't do that now.GRAND HOTEL is like that every time you watch it. It was written in the aftermath of World War I and keeping that in mind you see the fractured bodies and lives that are colliding in the hotel. Lewis Stone for example is the man who makes the famous statement about nothing ever happens at the conclusion of the film. His Doctor Otternschlag is the hotel doctor and is not very observant by the time he makes the comment a murder has occurred in the hotel and he is unaware of it. His face is scarred by a gas attack in the war. The war has probably made the doctor relatively quiet  and seeking quiet as much as possible. Hence his blindness.

The long shots with lots of figurants in the lobby of Grand Hotel are very impressive. The beauty of Greta Garbo who has a very theatrical performance and Joan Crawford are amazing even for the present standards.

Then a young stenographer Flaemmchen Crawford hired by the industrial magnate Preysing Beery who is negotiating a merger deal and is the former employer of Mr. Kringelein. None of them are satisfied with their status quo Grusinskaya is grievously rattled by the fading appeal of her dance as the turnout is ebbing away and the thought of suicide sneaks in while the chivalric Baron must abase himself to theft in order to pay back his debt but sadly that kind of deal doesn't go along with his blue blood and when he resorts to his last straw  gamble luck is not on his side when Otto's beginner's luck foreshadows his doomed nobility. But the ablaze passion between Grusinskaya and Felix appears so genuine and powerful it might save both from their plights they are planning to catch a train together but the twist of fate cannot let that happy ending happen. Here Garbo histrionically alternates between frowning in angst when dreads for her future and flitting about hyperactively when a budding romance resuscitates her life. John Barrymore revels in posing as suave and earnest a heartstealer in every sense their illdestined romance is the quintessential melodrama no matter how dated it comes across by today's standard. Flaemmchen is charmed by Felix's debonair appearance too but he returns with an avuncular affection calls her the funny one and promises a dance only. She succumbs to reality a pretty girl who needs money when the one she loves cannot love her back she moves on grants tacit consent to become Preysing's mistress but eventually after a heartbreaking incident fate offers her a better option and she does't hesitate to take it. Crawford is my pick of MVP in this movie at her utter prime she blends her magnetism perfectly with the worldly wisdom her acting is less mannered and occasionally sparks with certain flair of selfassurance a true flapper of its time. As for Otto he is supposedly to be a sympathetic character but myself find Lionel Barrymore's allovertheplace acting quite annoying wanting any trace of subtlety needed to counterbalance the haphazardlypaced narrative together with Beery's hateful Preysing an outrageously repulsive character becomes the nadir of starpower vehicle Beery won BEST LEADING ACTOR at the same year for THE CHAMP 1931 though.Director Edmund Goulding THE RAZOR'S EDGE 1946 710 is an important name in the Golden Age Hollywood  although never won any substantial accolade for his directing work plus his filmography being too comprehensive to sum up thus it is difficult to extract his own directorial touch to be categorised as an auteur  his adroit skill in manoeuvring a large and elaborate set the outstanding fluidity of shifting his camera within a confined interior and magnanimously permitting enough space for his stars to enjoy the spotlight is undeniably a key factor is this polished hit of its era.".

Drake to adapt the novel to the stage. Titled GRAND HOTEL it proved a great success on the Broadway stage and with its fame as both novel and play the studio made the property the focus of its powerful array of contract talent. It was smash with both critics and audiences and won the Academy Award as Best Picture of 1932.Although the 1930s was notable for social dramas audiences of the Great Depression wanted an escape from the hardship of their lives and no expense was spared to create the glittering and very highgloss image moviegoers craved. Designed by legendary art director Cedric Gibbons who mixed Deco and Moderne styles to tremendous effect each set was built specifically for the film and no detail was overlooked Adrian's costumes were also meticulous in their combination of highfashion and romance. No detail was overlooked and in terms of production values alone few films before or after have bested GRAND HOTEL.But if GRAND HOTEL is distinctly of its era in terms of visual style it is also distinctly of its era in terms of performance and it is here that we run into a bit of trouble. Most actors of the silent era relied on a mannered performance style that compensated for the lack of sound. The arrival of sound forced them to invent a new performance style and some proved more adaptable than others. In many respects GRAND HOTEL is a study of the struggle to invent this new way of acting some of the performers are excessively large some are in transition between silent and sound modes and some are distinctly modern in their approach.In terms of story GRAND HOTEL presents several overlapping and interweaving plot lines. Celebrated ballerina Grusinskaya Garbo is performing in Berlinand is a deep depression that threatens her career. Baron von Geigern John Barrymore is in desperate need of moneyand has agreed to steal Grusinskaya's famous pearls.

These characters along with Grusinskaya's maid Rafaela Ottiano the hotel doctor Lewis Stone and various hotel employees including Jean Hersholt collide repeatedly over the course of a few daysand none will emerge entirely unscathed from their encounters.John Barrymore was noted for his largerthanlife performances on the stage and he brought that same quality to many silent films less fortunately he also carried into the sound era and his performance reads as excessively large. Although Garbo was a great star in the silent era she quickly adapted to the new demands of sound in such films as ANNA Christiebut when faced with Barrymore's overthetop performance she responds in kind and the result is visually beautifully but incredibly mannered and their scenes are not greatly aided by their dialogue which is itself very much in the grand manner. Although they are indeed fascinating their performances are distinctly out of synch with the rest of the film where a more natural style of acting is the norm.While Wallace Beery and Lewis Stone are quite good and while Lionel Barrymore is unexpectedly effective and much less mannered than his brother John it is really Joan Crawford that points the way toward the new acting style. Crawford herself had worked in silents and scored notable successes in such films as OUR DANCING DAUGHTERS but she has made an easy leap to the sound era and never overplays her hand Flaemmchen is among the best of her early performances and Crawford herself thought it among the best of her overall career. She wasn't wrong.With the acting styles all over the map GRAND HOTEL requires a modern viewer to make constant mental shifts consequently the film sometimes feels more than a little uphill. Even so there are plenty of compensations Garbo at the height of her beauty Lionel Barrymore's multilayered performance a Crawford classic and always always the lush look and feel of the movie. Although I think it will most appeal to film buffs there is no denying the thing has power even though that power has become somewhat obscured by the passing years.GFT Amazon Reviewer".

	schema:reviewBody "The only production of Grand Hotel I've ever seen that actually worked that in fact was deeply moving was the Broadway musical from the early '90s. Of course it didn't do so well being head and shoulders above both the original play and this allstar MGM romp.There is a reason why this is the only film to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards  and nothing else.If it ain't on the page it ain't on the stage actors have maintained since oh Euripides.Here what's on the page is clich after clich  pretentious conceits that were already old and tired by 1932.What's fascinating is certainly not Goulding's hackneyed direction but the various actors' more or less successful attempts to breathe real life into cardboard roles.At the top of that list is Lionel Barrymore. In retrospect and considering his entire filmic career he was a far more versatile and better actor than John. One always gets a vivid character and not Lionel Barrymore playing one. Watch him in You Can't Take It With You for instance when he had to work on crutches because of his advancing arthritis. Amazing. Next Joan Crawford. Thirdbilled and even with added Garbo scenes to keep Crawford from walking off with Grand Hotel she still does.Crawford and Lionel Barrymore not only make their clichd lines and characters wholly believable they literally walk off into the sunrise together at the end as clichs often do.Wallace Beery is wonderful and dimensional and even heartbreaking as Preysing. He apparently only accepted the role because he was promised he would be the single star with a German accent. John Barrymore next does the best he can playing a Baron who wears more eye shadow than Garbo. Oh wait Barrymore ALWAYS wore more eye shadow than his leading ladies. Whether a carryover from his theatrical makeups during his stage career or a misguided attempt to give his puffy alcoholic's face some screen definition it's hard to say. What's easy to say is that he's occasionally effective here and affecting but mostly selfconscious. Why is that man wearing all that eyeshadow? leads to an awareness that one can almost count beat by beat his stagy timing of even so simple a gesture as gently chucking Crawford's chin or his vain attempt to make a mediocre script sound like iambic pentameter. In Bill of Divorcement with Katherine Hepburn in this same year he still wears more eye shadow than she and is still given to the odd singsong stage as opposed to film line reading. But he's much better. Then again so is that play.Then there's Garbo. Truly a stunning film actress an immortal phenomenon and as always photographed by the brilliant William Daniels breathtakingly beautiful. But please out of courtesy to her talent and legend don't compare her performance here with any of her others Camille say or Ninotchka or Anna Karenina. Director Goulding allowed her favorite mannerisms to get the best of her the constantly dancing eyebrows in closeups the tiltback of the head to gaze soulfully at ceilings were cuecards pasted up there?.Lewis Stone gets nothing to do but embody a oneman Greek Chorus over and over about to paraphrase People come and go. But nothing ever happens in the Grand Hotel. Adrian's costumes and Cedric Gibbons' art direction provide as much drama and character as the script. Possibly more one finds oneself admiring the detailing in a hotel room door or the sweep of a moderne upholstered chair in Lionel Barrymore's suite during his ecstatically played and largely silent drunk scene at the expense of what's happening between the predictable characters.Watchable? Certainly. A revelation? Yes when Crawford and Lionel Barrymore are on screen. Great? No. It's a pretentious novel turned into a pretentious play turned into a pretentious film  pretending to be profound timeless and enduring.Instead of the Grand Clich that it is.".

Although I loved the film I was forced to wonder if in the hands of a less capable actress whether it would have had the same captivating power. Somehow I think not. Cate Blanchett's restrained portrayal of Annie exudes compassion and tenderness and is integral to the success of the film as a whole. Her sensitivity as an actress is important in relation to the subject matter  ESP and the occult  as these areas generally attract much scepticism. Blanchett through her unique skill as an actress manages to make the more fantastical elements of the story not only plausible but intensely moving. She is luminous to watch reminding me of the also magnificent Meryl Streep in terms of her quiet beauty her range of expression and her adept skill at accent mimicry. Who could believe that she is Australian?In short 'The Gift' is well worth seeing primarily for Cate Blanchett but also for the supporting actors Keanu Reeves very impressive and effective Hilary Swank underused and the magnificent Giovanni Ribisi  who is both explosive and reticent as Buddy Cole. Also demanding attention is the imaginative screenplay and the hauting beauty of the miseenscene which manages to be both beautiful and eerie at the same time. Overall 'The Gift' is a resounding success due mainly to the heart of the film  Cate Blanchett's resonant performance.

Honed on his Evil Dead series Raimi lets a scene begin slowly and allows the viewer to sense the dread and feel the suspense build.  There are visual tricks interesting camera techniques and the fine performances by a very talented cast that propel this story forward.  Among this cast that really stands out is Keanu Reeves. People have always complained that Reeves brings down a movie.  At least some of the people I know.  I prefer to think that Reeves is an underrated actor.  In the role of Donny Barksdale Reeves brings a certain menace to his character that usually isn't scene in his other roles. Barksdale isn't a creature of the night or a space alien but a flesh and blood creature that is capable of true evil.  When you watch him look at his eyes and you'll see a true menace lurking behind those dark brown eyes. Cate Blanchett shows that she can master just about any accent that's out there.  She sounds like she's a native of the south and she has a quiet courage about her.  Most notable when she's squaring off against Reeves.  All in all The Gift is a wonderfully atmospheric thriller.  It has brains and doesn't insult the viewers.  It will keep you hooked up until the very end and there are quite a few surprises throughout the film.  Highly entertaining and very spooky at times.".

It's something she can't explain she knows only that it's inherited which she learned from her grandmother and that it's real.  And though it's helped her maintain her home she soon finds that it doesn't always make for the most pleasant of situations as when she must advise a young woman Valerie Barksdale Hilary Swank on how to cope with her abusive husband Donnie Keanu Reeves or attempt to help a troubled young man Buddy Cole Giovanni Ribisi come to terms with some sensitive aspects of his life.  Then when a client comes to her to ask for help when his daughter disappears not only does it take her to the dark side of the human experience she discovers that certain individuals including local sheriff Pearl Johnson J.K. Simmons do not believe that her gift' is real.Stylistically crafted and delivered Raimi's film will keep you engrossed and on the edge of your seat until the very end.  He successfully blends reality with just a touch of the supernatural that makes for riveting suspense while keeping it within the realm of believability.  The relationship played out between Donnie and Valerie is anything but unique you've seen this before many times in many films but within the context of this story it's fresh and it works.  The doubtful sheriff and the cynical jaded defense attorney Gerald Weems Michael Jeter are fairly stereotypical but that can be easily overlooked in light of the overall story and especially due to the credibility of the Annie character which is well developed and never presented as anything beyond what can be readily accepted as true to life.  As the central character Annie anchors the film and enables the circumstances in which she is involved to be perceived as real it's the strength of the film and it's what makes it all work so well.What also makes it work is the strong performance by Cate Blanchett who makes Annie so real and accessible displaying her gift' with restraint and avoiding the possible pitfall of taking it too far over the edge which could easily have made it suspect.  Instead she brings a depth to the character that draws you into her world and allows you to empathize with her which would have been impossible had she invested Annie with even a touch of the charlatan.  With consummate skill Blanchett creates a well rounded character which demonstrates that as an actor she definitely has a very real gift' of her own.Ribisi also does a memorable turn as Buddy with a striking performance in which he creates some disturbing moments that are almost painful to watch his is a character study of a soul in distress seeking solace and resolution and even as he attempts to sort out his life you are able to sympathize with his plight as you share Buddy's experiences.  And it's through Buddy as well as Annie of course that the audience is able to make that necessary and very real connection with the film.  With films like Saving Private Ryan' and now this one Ribisi is on his way to establishing himself as one of the premiere character actors in the business today.Playing somewhat against type Reeves proves that he can be a good bad' guy giving possibly one of his best performances ever as Donnie.  He very credibly conveys that sense of explosiveness lying just beneath the surface that makes his character menacing and dark which in turn makes Donnie psychologically as well as physically threatening.  It's a good job by Reeves who deserves credit for taking on a role that is so disagreeable and insensitive.The supporting cast includes Greg Kinnear Wayne Katie Holmes Jessica Kim Dickens Linda Gary Cole David and Rosemary Harris Annie's Granny. A taut thriller that is emotionally involving The Gift' delivers what it promises early on which is exceptional as many films of this nature often fail to actually follow through after a tremendous opening act.  Rest assured this one does and has it all suspense credibility and some memorable moments all courtesy of Raimi a good story and a superb cast. And that's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 910.".

	schema:headline " Evil Dead Simple Plan and now The Gift solidify Raimi as a great director.";
	schema:reviewBody "Sam Raimi has a bit of folklore to him at least in t horror movie circles. His story with Evil Dead is one that tells us that if you really believe in what you are doing and have an undeniable passion for it you can succeed with an indie.  Evil Dead was that film for Raimi.  Now that he has bigger budgets and better casts one could expect him to fail but with terrific films like A Simple Plan and now this one he proves that he does possess a gift as a film maker.  The Gift takes him back to his roots as a horror director and he doesn't disappoint.  The Gift is a tight tense film with some questionable weakly written court room scenes but take that away and you have a very effective thriller.The Gift has an all star ensemble cast that takes everything they are given and shines with it.  Cate Blanchet is awesome to watch as the small town clairvoyant that some people look upon with utter reverance and others disregard as nothing more than a Satan worshipper.  Keanu Reeves is very effective as a wife abusing husband and Hilary Swank Katie Holmes Greg Kinnear Giovanni Ribisi and Gary Cole are all very good in their roles. I especially liked Reeves as the wicked wife beater.  I grew to hate his character and not just because he was a wife beater but because he was such a smug I'm above the law wife beater.  I like seeing the smaller and perhaps more challenging roles Reeves is taking in between his billion dollar turn as Neo.When a local town aristocratic beauty disappears all fingers point towards Reeves as the murderer.  He was having an affair with the girl he has a violent temper and he has scratch marks all over him from her and most importantly she was found dead in his swamp on his property.  That is pretty compelling evidence against him.  Also Annie the clairvoyant had visions about her whereabouts being located on his property.  But soon after his impending incarceration Annie begins to have other thoughts.  She thinks the wrong man has been put away and now she fears that the real killer is going to come after her.What The Gift benefits from besides great performances is tight direction. Raimi shows us here why it is that he got his start as a horror director. There are at least half a dozen scenes that are tense and frightening. When Annie is having her visions of death and sees dead women in trees and in bathtubs and such there are collective gasps of fear in the audience. And when she is visited by ghosts or visions of people you feel the heart race a little faster.  This is not to say that the film is flawless because it's not.  The flaws come from the writing of the court case where there is so much heresay and such that any good lawyer would have jumped all over the defense's case.  When a man is being tried for murder and your defense is questioning how you came to know where the body was they are two different issues.  Why does it matter if an elephant told you where the body was or if you happened to fish it out of the pond with a crane.  The point is that the body was there and it was on the accused's property and the accused had scratch marks on his arm from the deceased.  That in my book is a pretty simple case.  I was disappointed with how Thorton wrote the court room scenes but that is about all I was disappointed with.The Gift is not one of the best horror films I've ever seen but it is an enjoyable one and if I had to compare it to another similar one to it I would have to say that this was better than What Lies Beneath.  I think Zemekis is a great director but Raimi just has that certain intangible quality about him.  He can make suspense out of something when perhaps there is none there.  This is worth seeing and if you are a horror fan or just like a few thrills in your film this'll keep you entertained.8 out of 10 a good creepy horror film with a few genuine scares and a plethora of great performances.".

	schema:headline " A compelling genuinely intriguing very wellacted mysterythriller";
	schema:reviewBody "Cate Blanchett's performance alone make this solid thriller worth watching. I saw her in this movie and I became baffled as to why she wasn't considered for an Oscar nomination.  She carries this film on her shoulders and never once budges.  Not only does she totally get rid of her Australian accent and perfectly don a Southern accent but she gives a deep powerful performance as the innocent widow Annie Wilson who is looked down by many in her community but simply wants to share her psychic gifts with her willing clients.  Blanchett communicates great emotion with a simple facial expression.Of course I also have to give it up for the multitalented supporting cast. Though most of them with the exception of Hilary Swank couldn't really nail down the Southern accent they are absolutely terrific.  The only actor I felt was miscast was Katie Holmes.  Not only is her accent phony and overthetop but she just seems too young and innocent for the role. Giovanni Ribisi on the other hand is a revelation.  I knew ever since his breakthrough performance in Suburbia that he had great promise as an upandcoming actor but in The Gift he delivers his most powerful performance uptodate.  I would even argue that he deserved an Oscar nod. He constantly stirs up sympathy in his audience despite his mental instability and momentary outbursts of anger.  I was also extremely impressed with Keanu Reeves who delivers a genuinely haunting performance. It's times like this where I just can't fathom why many people still insist on picking on Keanu regarding him as dull and cardboard.  Personally I thought he was great ever since his emotional performance in Permanent Record.  But he better demonstrates his versatility as an actor as the abusive Donny.  He made his debut as a villain in the throwaway thriller The Watcher but I found him much more haunting in this role.  Plus he sports a rugged look totally shedding his prettyboy image.  Greg Kinnear is good and subtle and Hilary Swank continues to flaunt her brilliant acting abilities as the vulnerable wife of Donny who constantly takes beatings from him yet still maintains her love for him.The story is very intriguing revolving around a cast of colorful characters.  This isn't a scary movie as it somewhat looks in the previews but it is full of mystery and thrills without cheaply going for shock value.  There is a nifty twist at the end which is credible and not thrown from left field but the plot isn't packed with surprises.  We're simply going along on an emotional journey through the mind of our protagonist Annie and that's how the tension is created.  Sam Raimi creates a haunting mood and Billy Bob Thornton wrote a fine script.  The story is easytofollow and not as mindbending as some of these other supernatural thrillers.  Just keep in mind that this is not a horror movie. But it's a good mystery and a good mood piece and a damn good film altogether.My score  7 out of 10".

	schema:reviewBody "Sam Raimi is a very gifted director. Whether it's genre driven films such as the Evil Dead series or the recent SpiderMan he has a very good sense of the films he's making. Of his more serious recent films such as A Simple Plan and For the Love of the Game I think The Gift his last serious effort before SpiderMan stands out as the best. The film has a few faults however so I just want to get those out of the way. Some of the characters aren't developed enough so we lose interest in them quite quickly. Also the outcome is quite obvious early on in the film so a few more twist to maybe keep the audiences guessing would've been appreciated. Other than that however we have a pretty well made picture so these minor flaws don't overshadow an otherwise brilliant production. First and foremost this is a character driven piece lead by the incredible Cate Blanchet. She is quite the chameleon in her movies. She can go from playing Queen Elizabeth to a southern fortune teller without skipping a beat. Her talent is something that most performers should strive for. She's very efficent in her part here. She's very likable and she makes you feel for her character. Giovanni Ribisi is also very good in the film. He could've played it like the stereotypical crazy person but he brings something new to the role. We feel for him because he brings his struggle across so well when he's on screen. Hillary Swank is good also but her character is majorly underdeveloped. She falls into stereotypical battered wife mode but I did like her performance. I just wish she was given more to do. Keanu Reeves was such a shock in this film I never took him seriously as an actor until I saw this. He literally scared me at certain moments in the film. He brings such a realistic intensity to the role that he becomes more frightening. Greg Kinnear is ok in this film His character suffers from lack of development as well. I'm also tired of him playing the nice guy in films. It's getting a little old. His southern accent also isn't very consistent. Kept coming in and out. It's hard for me to buy he and Katie Holmes as an item but I guess it worked for the filmmakers. Speaking of Katie Holmes props to her for taking on a more adult role. SPOILER. It's not even the fact that she shows us her breasts but it's the fact that she's playing against type and does it fairly well. She has minimal screentime but she makes an impression. Especially in her final scene of the film. END SPOILER Overall I thought The Gift rose above the standard supernatural thriller. To me it's more a Character piece and fairly decent whodunit. I suggest you all see it because it's a really good film.".

	schema:reviewBody "A widow with ESP Cate Blanchett lives with her son in a small Southern town helping people by trying to read their futures and living on donations. There are folks who don't like that kind of devlish stuff 'round here. Katie disappears. Blanchett who is one of those psychics who cannot control their visions so that she can only get glimpses of things that have happened or might happen has a vision of Holmes' body at the bottom of a pond. She reveals her vision to the Sheriff good performance by Dr. Emil Skoda I mean J. K. Simmons. Well he's one of the local empiricists and doesn't believe her but takes her out to a pond resembling the one seen in her vision. Sure enough. They drag Katie's remains out of it. Where was Tom Cruise when she needed him? I won't go on with the plot. It gets twisted around a bit and the end won't come as a great big surprise if you've seen a couple of other thrillers with metaphysical overtones.It was written by the coauthors of the far superior One False Move. But this is a pretty weak effort. We hear New Age lines from a bunch of smallminded townies. A man and a woman are attracted to one another but when he comes on to her she backs hesitantly away and says I don't think this is a good idea right now. The guy is fallingdown drunk so it's hard to see what the idea was in the first place. She's gone the man tells the woman but I have to learn to live with that just as you have to learn to live with the loss of your husband. Real MEN don't talk like that. And later I'm so sorry I wasn't there for you when you needed me. The director Raimi is efficient without being in the least original. The music cues us about looming threats. When Blanchett is worried a shadow crosses her curtain  but it turns out to be a friend! As the climax approaching to heighten the tension there is a windy thunderstorm full of rain and strobe lightning. Ho hum. At the end when all is being revealed the rain is replaced by fog. One blow from a flashlight conks a fullgrown man out for the duration just because the script calls for it.Blanchett is about to be murderized at the pond but she is saved by a disturbed young man whom she had earlier tried to help. The young man Giovanni Ribisi is supposed to be in a psychiatric hospital but I escaped he tells her. He doesn't tell her how he managed to find her and her wouldbe murderer in the middle of the woods in the middle of the night in the fog. Well not that it matters because it turns out that Ribisi has actually been dead for a couple of hours anyway. This takes us beyond the possibility of ESP and into the realm of the frankly supernatural. This raises certain interesting questions but the film doesn't address them. It's satisfied to be another everyday thriller with parallel universe harmonics.All of that makes it sound like a movie to avoid but it's not. The reason it's not is that mysteries are kind of interesting. Whodunnit you know? And the movie is saved by Cate Blanchett's sterling performance. She makes the movie.She isn't exactly beautiful. She's lean and narrow shouldered. Her nose is long and pulpy and her epicanthic fold is overdeveloped by Western tastes. But faces have characteristics or traits. Angelina Jolie's primary trait is sexuality. Gene Tierney's was staggering beauty. Agnes Moorehead's was sliminess of a particularly feminine sort. Blanchett's primary trait is perceptivity. Not intelligence in any academic sense but an ability to figure things out to see through them to discern patterns and form Gestalts. This trait is put to good use of course in a role that calls for psychic abilities but she showed the same ability to use her skills in Elizabeth too where instead of hesitancy and anxiety the role called for a growing self confidence.Her accent alone is fascinating. Her Commonwealth speech is quite thoroughly transformed into Southernness here. It's not the hillbilly speech of the upland South and it's not from the low country either. Its closest analog is probably Texas or Oklahoma. She has even the slightest of marks down right. I didn't really think anything OF it. And the vowel is prolonged and drawn out in a manner only found in the American South. The same speech sound is heard in the vowel in druuuunk. Sorry. Bit of regional linguistics there.Oh  I ought to mention wardrobe too. A fine job. They've given Blanchett exactly the right unpretentious floppy clothes that an ordinary lowermiddleclass Southern widow of no sophistication might wear. Example In one important scene she wears this fuzzy white Vnecked sweater  angora or cashmere or something. I don't know anything about women's clothes but I know what I like. Underneath this sweater though there is a rough white T shirt that leaves a cartoon alligator's face peeping over the sweater's V neck. Exactly the proper degree of sloppiness. Yet in another scene at a party her hair is draped around her long face is lustrous curls and when she reaches down to remove a tight shoe we can't help noticing how sleek her ankle and her feet are and neither can Kinnear the guy she's with.But without Cate Blanchett's superior performance this would be no more than a routine thriller. With her it rises rather above the routine and is worth catching.".

Keanu Reeves was very convincing as a backwoods wife beater and Hillary Swank played her part as the long suffering wife to a tee.

	schema:reviewBody "Sam Raimi is an interesting dude. A few things I appreciate here.I like that it isn't the type of story that simply piles on deceit we have an emotional center from which to see. The story is about a woman widowed mother of three who hasn't come to terms with the loss of her husband. Maybe deep inside she feels she should have done more to keep him from going to work that day that she squandered her gift of vision. She's a fortune teller a caring soul genuinely trying to help neighbors with their emotional turmoil but we get the sense that she has allowed hers and her kids' to go unaddressed. When her eldest who has school trouble and is distant owing to the loss takes the bold step of coming to her room to ask about their father she sends him back to bed so completely unlike her denying both him and her the same comfort of clarity that she freely offers to others. This moment is pivotal to what this is. There's anger bubbling inside that clouds her intuition about emotional turmoil in her own home.The horror film proper is about this anger unfurling outside. There is an abusive redneck who victimizes his girlfriend. Another woman who goes around her fiancee's back betraying love is found murdered. Flashes of premonition abound.More could have been done to draw out connections. Although the premise is powerful a bit too much of the film is spent in turning a plot. But that's my own preference for a cinema that wanders visually through context. It doesn't stop me from appreciating that horrible murder garish visions and the like they all point back to a human being trying to cope with suffering unsure about what's coming.It would be nothing without Cate Blanchette of course. She soars here near the start of her career. It might be simply that I've gone without the company of a great actor for some time it felt like one of the most resonant works I've seen in a long time. The way she hesitates before easing in her fragile poise guarded with grace.The tendency is to celebrate actors within confines of an 'acting craft' that echoes its origins in theater. The type of roles that Oscars and sundry awards are given to tends to solidify this view. How revealing that Gena Rowlands was only Oscar acknowledged once and for a 'mentally ill' role. It keeps us from seeing them as makers in their own right giving rise to a whole landscape of urge. Were we to be in Cate's presence we would be in the presence of a master.One last thing that brings me back to Raimi. We think of classic Hollywood as something that forever went away with its generation of stars. But it survives as a way of positing. Jaws is a Capra town being whimsically toyed with by an unseen beast. This one here in the way we are eased into a world in the placement of the camera in the narrative light is very much in the language of classic Hollywood.Sam Raimi is an interesting dude. Come to think of it I lament that he didn't create his own world to explore the way Lynch has or his buddies the Coens.".

Because of this the creative and intense scenes in which the protagonist has symbolic dreams or psychic premonitions are all the more effective and the visual effects are almost unnoticeable even after all these years.The acting in this film is overall fantastic one of the strongest reasons why this movie works for me is that i was completely engaged. I was afraid that Cate Blanchett's character or her children could get hurt by Keanu Reeves who's unbelievably threatening in this film and gives one of his best performances. Not to mention Giovanni Ribisi J.K.

It made everything appear natural and affright natural.Furthermore I know that the ending wasn't that perfect. There seem to be many aspects in the story left behind leaving the viewers ask what happened to this and that. However I don't know why I enjoy the ending that much and that is how an ending should be enjoyed by the viewers.The screen portrayal of nearly all individuals was quite good and that ain't surprising 'cause they all are awarded by different awarding bodies.The over exposure of the trees however is I believe something that is not needed because it just kills the runtime. The time occupied by showing the trees should have been used for something else that contributes to the development of frighten from the audience and development of the plot as well.Overall I'd give it a score of 8 out of 10.

	schema:reviewBody "I really wanted to like this even more as it is it's a pretty good flick with a lot of intheorypluses but doesn't come through on quite enough of them to elevate it to greatness or even reallygoodness.The potential pluses include 1  A solid cast. 2  Sam Raimi in the big boy chair. 3  A supernatural story. 4  Katie Holmes unleashing the Cruise missiles at last.1  First the cast The Good  Cate Blanchett Greg Kinnear The They'll do  Keanu Reeves Hillary Swank Giovanni Ribisi and the Maybe she'll get 'em out? Katie Holmes.2  Sam Raimi almost goes back to his roots of horror with this one I love when he does straight horror but he is a very fine director of socalled mainstream films as well moreso when ignoring the Spiderman series. He doesn't seem to worry about the studios or the box office as much and allows his creativity free reign.3  I love good supernatural stuff. The plot of The Gift revolves around the disappearance of a young woman from a small backwoods town in the US and how the various townsfolk are somehow involved or impacted.The primary character is Cate Blanchett as a hard working penniless mother of three named Annie who happens to have eerily accurate visions of the future. The strength of Cate in the role is that she is a good actress and makes some of the later visions a little more credible than they might otherwise be  and she also has no issue with wearing some of the dodgiest tracky dacks ever seen on TV.Annie gives readings for many local people including several regulars who fortunately are professional actors Giovanni Ribisi as Buddy and Hillary Swank as Valerie among them. Valerie has the good fortune of being married to full blown ignorant redneck Donnie played with spottybearded abandon by Canoe Reeves. Donnie has no issue with threatening Annie for urging Valerie to leave him and obviously does a lot worse to Valerie behind closed doors.Buddy is a local bloke working at a dinky mechanics workshop he is obviously a very troubled individual with serious inner demons and wears his insecurity on his sleeve. As Annie seems to be the only person who believes in him and takes an interest in his affairs Buddy sees her as somewhat of a personal saint.As mentioned Annie has three young kids is a widow and doesn't appear to have a high disposable income see trackie dacks so her girl buddy drags her out for a rare evening of relaxation at the local lodge. There they encounter local school principal Wayne played by Greg Kinnear and his partner Jessica played by Katie Holmes. Annie and Wayne seem to take a shine to each other which is unfortunate as he is engaged to Jessica. Annie also finds out over the course of the evening that young Jessie is somewhat the local slut and Wayne appears oblivious to her saucy fraternising.Anyway so Annie gets home to pick up the boys from the babysitter and finds out someone was in the house doing menacing things. She immediately assumes that it was Donnie following up with some of his earlier threats.The morning comes and it comes to light that Jessie has gone missin' the night previous. Her father and Wayne and a local cop who is more than a little sceptical consult Annie for a reading which initially fails due to distractions. The remainder of the film takes a great many twists and turns on the way to clarifying what happened to Jessica and who is ultimately responsible.Among the red herrings and dead ends are many of the signature Sam Raimi LOUD moments indicating things or bad guys may or may not be there the suspicion and blame of prominent characters and Buddy has a couple of memorable moments that help to illustrate his insanity.The ending was a little preposterous and hokey it almost appeared that they run out of interest and just tacked on a that'll do ending to get the film in the can. In any case it was less than satisfying and a little disappointing seeing as how things were developing nicely for a while.4  And Katie gets 'em out in a flashback. Without doubt her finest acting moment.Final Rating  7  10. Worth a look a surprisingly low key effort from Sam with a couple of gonzo performances from Ribisi and Reeves.If you liked this review or even if you didn't check out oneguyrambling.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Get a load of the talent involved in the making of The Gift Evil Dead creatorSpiderman director Sam Raimi called the shots Best Writing Oscar winner Billy Bob Thornton cowrote the script and future Oscar winning actresses Cate Blanchett and Hilary Swank led the great cast that also featured the always reliable Giovanni Ribisi Keanu Reeves giving one of the best performances of his career and Katie Holmes's tits she might not have won any Oscars but she's the owner of a magnificent pair of Golden Globes!!!. On top of all that regular Raimi collaborator Christopher Young provided a marvellously eerie bluestinged score that perfectly complemented DoP Jamie Anderson's excellent atmospheric cinematography. With credentials like those it's no big surprise that the film is such a hugely enjoyable experience.Raimi plays his horror perfectly straight for a change brilliantly blending tense supernatural scares emotional drama supernatural mystery and even courtroom drama to make The Gift one of the most mature and wellrounded films of his directorial career. The film's only weakness is that the finale is perhaps a little too predictable the villain's identity rather easy to guess and the ghostly denouement inevitable but with such expert handling and excellent acting throughout this is pretty easy to overlook. In fact The Gift is such a hauntingly effective film it makes me wonder why Raimi bothered producing a remake of overrated Asian horror The Grudge when he already had such a truly great ghost story under his belt.8.5 out of 10 rounded up to 9 for IMDb.".

This movie was nothing less than pure 100 genius. I had no idea Billy Bob Thorton was part writer on this which also explains why it is so damn good. Everyone in this movie showed their acting abilities. Even the kids were great even the dog was great. This is how much I enjoyed this movie. If you like a murder mystery than check this flick out.

	schema:reviewBody "There's a lyrical quality to this film that makes the brutality of the oppression it depicts seem almost tangible and Before Night Falls  directed by Julian Schnabel is photographed in a way that gives much of it something of a documentary feel and indeed some archival footage is included which defines the drama and adds to the overall impact of the film.  And quite a story it is.  The true story of writer Reinaldo Arenas Javier Bardem who was born in Cuba in 1943 it touches on his childhood but concentrates on the '60s and '70s during which time Arenas was considered a counterrevolutionary by the Cuban government because of his writing as well as his homosexuality.  Schnabel pulls no punches as he presents an incisive picture of the suffering inflicted upon Arenas and others through the wanton mistreatment and discrimination of Castro's regime.  Extremely well crafted and delivered it's a film that makes a powerful statement about many of the things so many take for granted.  Like freedom of speech and assembly.  For as the film points out in postrevolution Cuba a gathering of more than three becomes a criminal offense a group of people getting together for a poetry reading become criminals of the State and the punishment for expressing one's own thoughts can be at the very least torture and imprisonment.This is the environment in which Arenas grew and matured as a person a poet a writer still he was irrepressible when it came to his work and managed to create and have some of it published but only by smuggling it out of Cuba in one instance to France where his book was named Best Foreign Novel of the year.  It's a ruthless uncompromising world Schnabel lays bare with his camera and it's that realistic recreation of that very real time and place that is one of the strengths of this film.  But what really drives it and makes it so compelling is Bardem's incredible portrayal of Arenas.To say that Bardem's performance was worthy of an Oscar would be an understatement along with Ed Harris in Pollock' it was quite simply one of the two best of the year 2000.  In order to bring Arenas to life it was necessary for Bardem to capture all of the myriad complexities of the man and the artist which he did and to perfection.  It's a challenging role and Bardem more than lives up to it with a detailed performance through which he expresses the physical as well as the emotional aspects of the character  His mannerisms his walk the body language that says so much about who he is how he copes with living in a seemingly hopeless situation.  By the end of the movie because of Bardem you know who Reinaldo Arenas was and you're not likely to forget him.The most poignant scenes in the film are those in which Arenas' words are being recited as the camera creates a visual context for them looking out through the window of a moving car or bus at the streets towns buildings and people as Arenas describes them.  These scenes fill the senses and are virtually transporting and it is in them that the true poetic nature of Arenas is made manifest.  It's beautiful imagery and the contrast between the beauty of the words and the ugliness of the reality against which it is set is powerful.  All of which is beautifully conceived and executed by Schnabel an excellent piece of filmmaking.In a dual supporting performance Johnny Depp is effective as Bon Bon a queen' Arenas meets during his incarceration and also as Lieutenant Victor who oversees the prison.  Each character is unique and it's quite a showcase for Depp's versatility.    Rounding out the supporting cast are Olivier Martinez Lazaro Andrea Di Stefano Pepe Sean Penn Cuco Michael Wincott Herberto Pedro Armendariz Jr. Reinaldo's Grandfather and Vito Maria Schnabel Teenage Reinaldo.  A film that is not necessarily entertaining and at times unpleasant to watch because of it's stark realism Before Night Falls' is nevertheless thoughtprovoking riveting drama that is thoroughly engrossing.  And it proves that beauty can indeed be found in the least likely of places.  But it also makes you realize that it is up to each individual to care enough to seek it out and to hopefully have the wisdom to realize it once it is found.  And that's the real beauty of a film like this it affords you the opportunity to do just that.  I rate this one 1010.".

	schema:reviewBody "Incredible central performance from Javier Bardem ties the film together and makes you really care what happens. Great supporting players Sean Penn has one incredible scene early on who had us convinced he was Cuban. We didn't at all recognise him. Johnny Depp plays two small parts but two very memorable ones. Growlyvoiced Michael Wincott played the bad guy in The Crow and Along Came a Spider and The Doors' manager in The Doors is memorable. Andrea di Stefano is great as a central antagonist of Reinaldo as is the nowHollywoodfamous Olivier Martinez who plays a touching platonic friend to Reinaldo.Beautifully photographed and directed in an admirable manner that draws attention to style every now and then in a poetic way very fitting for a biopic about a poet and at other times just utilises style to tells the story very well and seem not to be fussing about style at all.There are scenes here where the sound effects track stops and this gorgeous cello music by Carter Burwell composer of Being John Malkovich Meet Joe Black Man who Wasn't There with another beautiful score plays while we watch Bardem sitting in a club while people dance around him and the music tells us he is far away. It is a wonderful scene akin to Kurosawa's use of music in the brilliant burning of the first castle scene in Ran.The way the camera tells this story was so marvellous and slick though using rough camera work to tell moments of uneasiness importantly this is not overused as it was in the recent Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind that i knew the filmmaker had been influenced by American filmmaking but throughout i had no idea the guy actually WAS American! The TV program misleadingly told us it was a Cuban movie which it is not  it is an American production with Spanish Cuban and American actorsI'm even more shocked considering this is the guy who made Basquiat which i always thought was more a telemovie and more about art than about moviestyle. Julian Schnabel i now learn was a neoexpressionist painter in the 80's! Basquiat about an artist perhaps was a movie where he was making the transition between artlanguage and movielanguage. Before Night Falls uses traditional storytelling to be sure but it has such a spellbinding cinematic quality i felt sure its director was one with cinema on the brain. Perhaps Schnabel has caught the bug after all.".

But this is far more than a simple piece of political agitprop instead it's a beautifully constructed movie about the artistic temperament but with plenty of the same quality itself visually the movie is consistently striking and yet of a piece. There's also a fine performance from Javier Bardem in the lead role. What the film doesn't do very much is follow it's characters in real time for anything longer than the duration of a snapshot this slightly distances the viewer from the mechanics of the drama and in consequence at times it feels slow. Instead it communicates through images and fragments of the writer's own poetry and the scene where the hot air balloon rises through the roof of a ruined church is so perfectly created it's a work of art in itself.

	schema:reviewBody "Julian Schnabel is primarily a visual artist and secondarily a film director and his mastery of visual media dominates this patient and precise bio of the late Reynaldo Arenas a novelist and poet who was imprisoned and later exiled from his native Cuba for his controversial writings and his open homosexuality.Most of the objections to this film have to do with the faithfulness with which Schnabel treats the memoir of Arenas also titled 'Before Night Falls' which despite its beauty is undoubtedly biased in its presentation of history. Furthermore Schnabel seems to downplay Arenas' contempt for Fidel Castro and the postrevolutionary totalitarianism of his regime under which countless poets writers artists and practitioners of alternative lifestyles deemed 'counterrevolutionary' by the regime were jailed tortured murdered and in some cases expelled from Cuba. Schnabel presents Arenas as far more of a victim than an active voice of dissent which is in a certain sense unfaithful to his legacy. It feels as if Schnabel may have had some reservation about being overcritical of Castro and by default of Communism both of which are sympathized with by many artists and leftists worldwide including the family of the film's star Javier Bardem a Spaniard whose parentsinfluential figures in Spanish cinemaare longtime outspoken CommunistsSocialists.Both actor and director have publicly avowed that the film means to critique totalitarianism in general more so than Castro or Communist Cuba in particular which seems like a bit of a copout. Nevertheless art despite its inherently political nature should strive to be apolitical and this film does so effectively with its blending of gorgeous image and fine subtle performance particularly by Bardem as Arenas. Bardem has the face of a classical statue and his deep set eyes broken Roman nose and expressive mouth are mesmerizing. With the right role he could and should be a major star in the US as he has been for some time in his native Spain. Every move he makes is compelling to watch and he creates a sympathy for Arenas few other actors could manage. His narration of Arenas' poetry and prose is patient and soulful adding much to the already gorgeous shots of rural and urban settings the film employs archival footage from Cuba but was filmed in Merida and Veracruz Mexico in the Yucatan the region of Mexico closest to Cuba.Because the film is based on a memoir it proceeds episodically following the young Arenas from his boyhood to his early accomplishments as a poet and novelist through his imprisonment and later his escape to the United States during Castro's 'purge' of undesirables in 1980 the same means by which Tony Montana escapes Cuba in 'Scarface' when criminals and homosexuals were invited to voluntarily expatriate to Miami so that the demand for basic resources in Cuba under the USled embargo could be relieved somewhat. The film spends considerable time reflecting on Arenas' sexual initiation and his gay lifestyle which is slightly problematic in that it suggests that Arenas was persecuted solely for being homosexual which is at best a halftruth. Though Arenas himself was probably persecuted less for his lifestyle than for his public criticism of the regime it is probably not inaccurate in its portrayal of the turn against art life and experimentation taken by Castro's brutal totalitarian ethos. In any case Arenas ultimately makes his way to New York with his friend Lazaro Olivier Martinez where in 1987 he began to suffer symptoms of AIDS. He died in 1990 after which his memoir and several letters condemning Castro and the failure of the US to rescue the Cuban people from his tyranny were published to wide acclaim.The film should not be overly criticized for its historical errors and omissions because it is primarily a showcase for Schnabel's artistry as a director and Bardem's astonishingly charismatic performance as Arenas. The film is also graced by fine performances by Martinez as Lazaro who rebuffs Arenas' sexual advances but later becomes his dearest and most trusted friend Johnny Depp in dual roles as a jail house transvestite who helps Arenas smuggle his manuscripts out to the world and as a sadistic prison guard Sean Penn as a farmer who encounters the young Arenas on the road to Havana and Michael Wincott as Herbet Z. Ochoa a poet and essayist forced to publicly renounce his art by a Communist tribunal.".

	schema:headline " Many praises for a movie about freedom and artistic expression";
	schema:reviewBody "Before Night Falls is a brilliantly devised and executed account about the famed Cuban novelist Reinaldo Arenas.  The film documents his childhood as a peasant his support for Castro's rebels as an idealist youth and as a man his struggles not just as an independent thinker but also as a gay man living in Communist Cuba. Throughout the film we respond to his hopes fears and claustrophobia as we witness the persecution of a true artist.As a student of Latin American History and Literature I was pleased with the way the film handled the historical context of Arenas' time. The political context of Before Night Falls shouldn't come as any surprise. The artistic social and political invisibility of gays in Cuba under the Cuban Revolution represented a dark stain on the revolutionary record. In 1965 Fidel Castro told Lee Lockwood in Castro's Cuba Cuba's Fidel that we would never come to believe that a homosexual could embody the conditions and requirements of conduct that would enable us to consider him a true Revolutionary a true communist militant. A deviation of that nature clashes with the concept we have of what a militant Communist must be' In the mid1960's the infamous UMAP work camps Unidades Militares de Auyuda a la Produccin sought to rehabilitate what they perceived as alleged antisocial elements. This is an event that is accurately depicted in Schnabel's film. The purges and denunciations of homosexuals continued into the 1980's. Today in Cuba discrimination against gays still represents a major problem. The revolution dealt with gender and racial discrimination but not with discrimination against gays. This is all documented with stunning use of archival footage and reference accounts from Arenas' autobiography.Any review of the film would be incomplete without mentioning Javier Bardem's work. I have seen a lot of movies and few performances are even in the same league as Bardem's. I was fascinated with how he carried this film with a performance that must have been very difficult for him to adjust to. The supporting work by Johnny Depp should also be praised. His dual performance for me accurately identified how many within Castro's army may have used their positions as a front to deny their own sexuality as well. Overall I was very impressed with this film and I highly recommend it".

	schema:reviewBody "BEFORE NIGHT FALLS directed by Julian Schnabel is the best movie made since SCHINDLER'S LIST and just might surpass it. There is hardly anything I would change about this movie it is in my mind as perfect as they could have made it. The only thing that could have been better was going deeper into Bardem's character but I don't think that they really needed to because like in OUT OF AFRICA the character is not gone into very deeply but the performance of Meryl Streep or in this case Javier Bardem makes you feel like you know Arenas. The tiniest nuance is played out beautifully by Bardem who had to learn  Cuban Spanish and English with a cuban accent as well as gain a lot of weight and probably hours of thought put into his performance. The writing is amazing going from one event to the other more about the author and what happens around him than an actual basic plotline. The music is terrific and well chosen and Burwell's original score is the best original music in film history. The cinematography is innovative and excellent audiences have seen few examples of the photography used in this film. And to top it all off Julian Schanbel does a perfect job of directing showing Arenas's life with a beautiful new narrative technique while at the same time showing the contrast of the Revolution and it's events and the beautiful Cuban country. As in the memoir by Arenas  the film is seen through Arenas's eyes and it is like the whole world is gay in a sense and it's fabulous. I also love how when showing the documentary footage and Bardem read excerpts of Arenas's writing it was spoken in Spanish being true to the author's work while the beautiful Burwell music played. Granted this film is not for everyone in fact I expect ninety percent of people to detest it but to me it is an amazing movie that is one of the few to get a ten out of ten from myself.Absolutely fabulous but if you like a basic clear plotline with rising events climactic end action and humour that comes out as jokes and not just funny situations and such you won't like it. In fact as I said I expect most people reading this not to like it but to me it may be in my top five should've won best picture.".

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS   SPOILERS Before Night Falls' is a compelling film that works on several different levels simultaneously  as a biography of the late Cuban poet and novelist Reinaldo Arenas as a scathing indictment of Castro's repressive Communist regime and as a celebration of the human spirit flourishing under even the most adverse of circumstances.  What it doesn't quite do though is dig very deeply into the mind and spirit of its main character.  We are fascinated by the atmosphere and events that define this life story.  We just don't feel like we get to know very well the man at its core.The film which spans five decades from 1943  1990 stars the brilliant Javier Bardem as Arenas a homosexual writer caught in a culture openly hostile to both homosexuals and writers.  One of the theses that the film posits  one taken directly from Arenas' writings  is that governmental repression often has the paradoxical effect of actually ENCOURAGING the very elements it is trying to stifle.  Thus for a while at least Arenas is allowed to express fairly openly his homosexual nature.  In fact it is even pointed out to us that a number of high government officials are allowed to flagrantly display their sexuality with little or no consequences.  Yet at the same time the government has set up concentration camps filled with gays and other political prisoners.  But it is not so much for his sexuality that Arenas is eventually incarcerated and tortured  it simply provides a convenient excuse  but for his radical antiCastro ideas as reflected in his poetry and novels.  For it is ideas that most threaten any totalitarian regime and Castro's is certainly no exception.The movie is so ambitious in its scope and time frame that it occasionally loses us along the way.  Every now and then we are not quite sure who is who where we happen to be or what exactly is happening in the story. This is partly the result of Julian Schnabel's rather impressionistic directorial style providing us with quick cuts of imaginings andor memories that flash through Arenas' mind.  The problem is that we can't always tell which is a memory and which a mere fanciful vision.  For instance in one scene a desperate Arenas in an attempt to evade the authorities sails out for Florida in nothing more than an old inner tube.  The way the scene is shot we are led to believe initially that he has made it safely to America's shore only to discover later that he is still on Cuba.  It is a minor point but the style often leaves us feeling unnecessarily disoriented at times.On the other hand the style also contributes a strangely dreamy otherworldly feel to the film.  This matches perfectly the rather exotic nature of Arenas himself a man who seems to be torn between accepting his homosexuality and fighting the demons that come along with being a societal outcast.  When Arenas finally makes it to the land of freedom' as part of the Mariel boat lift of 1980 fate deals him another cruel blow in the form of AIDS.  Yet Arenas' words live on a testament both to the cruelty and brutality of life under a dictatorship and to the strength of spirit reflected in any artist who tries to overcome it.As Arenas Barkem gives a riveting performance going far beyond the subtle effeminate mannerisms that define the character's surface.  Yet strangely enough even though the film runs well over two hours and there is almost no scene in which Arenas is not present we never feel like we really get to know him very well.  Perhaps it is because in his romantic relationships in particular Arenas remains such an inscrutable enigma.  Apart from his sexual orientation we often can't tell what makes this character tick. This is why Barkem's performance is so indispensable to the film.  The richness he provides in his every word facial expression and gesture makes Arenas a very real and very recognizable figure.  Without Barkem Before Night Falls' would be much less compelling than it is.And the fact is that for all its imperfections Before Night Falls' IS a very compelling film in terms of style performance atmosphere and theme. Despite the dissatisfaction we may feel with the film at times the truth is that the story itself is so gripping that our interest never flags for a moment.  And if for no other reason than for the uncompromising glimpse it affords into the hitherto unexamined world of Castro's Cuba the film cries out to be seen.".

Yet Arenas' words live on a testament both to the cruelty and brutality of life under a dictatorship and to the strength of spirit reflected in any artist who tries to overcome it.As Arenas Barkem gives a riveting performance going far beyond the subtle effeminate mannerisms that define the character's surface.  Yet strangely enough even though the film runs well over two hours and there is almost no scene in which Arenas is not present we never feel like we really get to know him very well.  Perhaps it is because in his romantic relationships in particular Arenas remains such an inscrutable enigma.  Apart from his sexual orientation we often can't tell what makes this character tick. This is why Barkem's performance is so indispensable to the film.  The richness he provides in his every word facial expression and gesture makes Arenas a very real and very recognizable figure.  Without Barkem Before Night Falls' would be much less compelling than it is.And the fact is that for all its imperfections Before Night Falls' IS a very compelling film in terms of style performance atmosphere and theme. Despite the dissatisfaction we may feel with the film at times the truth is that the story itself is so gripping that our interest never flags for a moment.  And if for no other reason than for the uncompromising glimpse it affords into the hitherto unexamined world of Castro's Cuba the film cries out to be seen.";

Even his death due to Aids is not clear in the movie. Maybe readers of this writer may find points in the script to be sympathetic with Reinaldo Arenas but for an outsider of his biography and books the plot does really show him as a homosexual writer persecuted by a dictatorial regime.

	schema:reviewBody "A film with strong and powerful moments. The movie uses some documentary footage and exposition about the revolution in Cuba and the problems that people went through but the real story is about a writer and his struggle to find peace and recognition.It took some time for me to get invested. It bothered me a bit because the movie is narrated by the writer and you see his life since he was young. So you would expect you to be invested right away. But for me it took some time in first act getting in to the story because here and there stock footage would pop up and it would take me out of it. Once the main character ends up being accused for something he didn't do the film picks up and his journey becomes riveting.I like the vintage look of this film the colors makes it feel like the film was made in the 60's and 70's. Johnny Depp is funny playing two roles but the actor stealing the show is Javier Bardem who is fantastic in this performance. The movie does a good job in making you understand his motives and ambitions. Even though I didn't care much about his relations you still understand the fact that it's just how he is personally and he doesn't try to force you to like him. He just appears like himself and doesn't try to be someone he isn't. Which makes the audience respect him.The scenes in a prison were really hard hitting especially when he is forced to be in a tiny tiny cell. That most be horrifying and Bardem completely made you believe what kind of a traumatic affect it would have on someone. Brilliantly made.In short a fantastic performance all the way through especially towards the finale but the film is a bit unbalanced and some of the most interesting parts of the story pass by too soon. It stays a little too long on the writer's romantic life in the beginning and unfortunately that aspect wasn't as compelling as I think the filmmakers were hoping it would be. Everything about the writers escape and the prison scenes are however great and I would still recommend checking it out.".

It's actually nice to see a movie pointing out that when it comes to homosexuality socialist regimes are no more tolerant than fascist ones or countries ruled by religious fundamentalists but the point about Reinaldo being oppressed by the state due to his sexual orientation seems hammered home too often where we see scenes of suspected homosexuals being rounded up .

I've never heard of Bardem before seeing this movie and have no idea of how difficult it is for a Spanaird to play a Cuban but I'll take everyone's word that this is a great performance . I didn't even realise that Johnny Depp played two roles in this movie but I was swept away by his role as the interrogator  so much so that I forgot it was a famous Hollywood star acting and I can't fault the performances in the movie But apart from the over emphasis on the homosexual aspects I do have a problem with the script and directing . The story is fairly episodic and disjointed and there's scenes that I didn't understand . For example Reinaldo just manages to walk out of prison which I found a bit too incredible to be taken seriously and while he's on the run he writes letters to the UN and International Red Cross  And leaves them hidden under stones ! So if a dissident is on the run in any country in the world if he leaves a message begging for help under a stone an international organisation will find it and take up his case .

	schema:reviewBody "Spanishborn actor Javier Bardem gives a staggering performance as Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas in Julian Schnabel's Before Night Falls is based on Reinaldo Arenas' memoir and relates his imprisonment in Cuba and subsequent exodus to the United States. Born a peasant in the 1943 Arenas had the great misfortune of being a gay writer in a country that considered art and homosexuality to be counterrevolutionary. After almost fifteen years of living in both jail and freedom Arenas was eventually sent to America in 1981 as a part of the Mariel boat lift which later became infamous for being made up of several psychotics and habitual criminals. Ten years later at the age of 47 Arenas dies of AIDS.Fidel Castro sparked a revolution against Batista in the 1950's. By 1959 Castro was basically in full power of Cuba and controlled the country with the Communist party under his dictatorship. The country soon became a total authoritarian state and civil liberties were disregarded. Youths rebelled against this with song with poetry and soon became a distinctive development in Cuban music and culture. Anyone who did not follow orders from Castro's army or who did not live the normal lifestyle set down by Castro were sent to camps to be reeducated. Reinaldo Arenas was one of these rebels.The beautiful cinematography was joined with an amazing cast of international stars including dual roles by a hysterically memorable Johnny Depp Pirates of the Caribbean and Finding Neverland Sean Penn I Am Sam and Mystic River who convincingly played a Cuban Michael Wincott Along Came a Spider and Olivier Martinez Unfaithful as Arenas' platonic best friend. Bardem's acting ability does a beautiful job at holding together a movie that at times seems very disjointed and longwinded. Schnabel seems to have tried to film the movie to fit the feeling and fluidity of Arenas' poetry but succeeded in making a beautifully visual film that needs a little more editing for the final cut. Nevertheless Schnabel does a very good job in telling the life of a 47yearold man in only 130 minutes and successfully painted the picture depicting the influences of Arenas' writing. The language choices made the movie a bit confusing as the actors spoke English with Cuban accents so heavy that it was hard to understand what was being said. It was equally annoying when characters would start speaking Spanish in the middle of a scene with no subtitles to aid the viewer. It is no surprise that Bardem was nominated at the Oscars for Best Actor.This movie is no masterpiece but is definitely worth seeing especially if interested in postWWII Cuba. It provides an interesting look into the Communist politics that deal with homosexuality in the past recent decades. The scenery and music transport the viewer to another world and Bardem does an equally impressive job in making the story feel real.8 stars out of 10.".

	onyx:emotionText "Spanishborn actor Javier Bardem gives a staggering performance as Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas in Julian Schnabel's Before Night Falls is based on Reinaldo Arenas' memoir and relates his imprisonment in Cuba and subsequent exodus to the United States. Born a peasant in the 1943 Arenas had the great misfortune of being a gay writer in a country that considered art and homosexuality to be counterrevolutionary. After almost fifteen years of living in both jail and freedom Arenas was eventually sent to America in 1981 as a part of the Mariel boat lift which later became infamous for being made up of several psychotics and habitual criminals. Ten years later at the age of 47 Arenas dies of AIDS.Fidel Castro sparked a revolution against Batista in the 1950's. By 1959 Castro was basically in full power of Cuba and controlled the country with the Communist party under his dictatorship. The country soon became a total authoritarian state and civil liberties were disregarded. Youths rebelled against this with song with poetry and soon became a distinctive development in Cuban music and culture. Anyone who did not follow orders from Castro's army or who did not live the normal lifestyle set down by Castro were sent to camps to be reeducated. Reinaldo Arenas was one of these rebels.The beautiful cinematography was joined with an amazing cast of international stars including dual roles by a hysterically memorable Johnny Depp Pirates of the Caribbean and Finding Neverland Sean Penn I Am Sam and Mystic River who convincingly played a Cuban Michael Wincott Along Came a Spider and Olivier Martinez Unfaithful as Arenas' platonic best friend. Bardem's acting ability does a beautiful job at holding together a movie that at times seems very disjointed and longwinded. Schnabel seems to have tried to film the movie to fit the feeling and fluidity of Arenas' poetry but succeeded in making a beautifully visual film that needs a little more editing for the final cut. Nevertheless Schnabel does a very good job in telling the life of a 47yearold man in only 130 minutes and successfully painted the picture depicting the influences of Arenas' writing. The language choices made the movie a bit confusing as the actors spoke English with Cuban accents so heavy that it was hard to understand what was being said. It was equally annoying when characters would start speaking Spanish in the middle of a scene with no subtitles to aid the viewer. It is no surprise that Bardem was nominated at the Oscars for Best Actor.This movie is no masterpiece but is definitely worth seeing especially if interested in postWWII Cuba. It provides an interesting look into the Communist politics that deal with homosexuality in the past recent decades. The scenery and music transport the viewer to another world and Bardem does an equally impressive job in making the story feel real.8 stars out of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "Julian Schnabel's second effort after his masterful Basquiat is another portrait of a fallen artist struck down in his prime but instead of the world of art we journey into the realm of literature. Reinaldo Arenas is mostly unheard of in this country but this film's greatest asset will be to encourage people to seek out his work in order to on some tangential level gain access to the man.  As with his earlier effort Schnabel mixes his painterly past with the auspices of the biopic to create one of the most fascinating portraits of a writer put to film. I was privileged to see this film during the last New York Film Festival and this film although linear in telling following Reinaldo from practically cradle to grave we are presented with expressionistic episodes of his life as he becomes initiated to sex finds his calling when he proves adept at writing and his most important and ironically fatal decision to engage in homosexual liaisons at a time and place where the practice was looked down upon and ultimately his work and life suffered for it. Never demeaning or lurid Reinaldo's life is looked upon with a untarnished and honest eye where his rich prose overcame his meager surroundings. A remarkable achievement on every level from the use of archival footage integrated into the narrative to the use of an up to the minute soundtrack the beautiful Lou ReedLaurie Anderson cello track Rouge' during a Cuban club scene in a period piece Before Night Falls is one of the best films of the year.".

	schema:reviewBody "People's revolutions begin with the best of intentions such as removing unjust rulers but often have an unfortunate tendency to go awry exchanging one dictator for another. Cuba is an excellent example of this axiom in 1959 a small band of revolutionaries led by a young lawyer named Fidel Castro ousted Fulgencio Batista the US backed dictator.  Castro would have been welcomed with open arms by the US had he not embarked on a campaign of nationalization which led to Cuba's regional isolation and eventual alliance with the Soviet Union.  In keeping with communist doctrine Castro the liberator became Castro the jailer and began purging the freethinkers and anyone who was different.  If you happened to be a gay author and poet yours was a dismal future indeed. Reinaldo Arenas grew up poor and free enjoying the liberation that only a child of the land can experience.  His carefree world was shattered when a teacher discovered the boy's artistic bent and communicated this to Reinaldo's grandfather.  His reaction was to banish the boy and run away to the city.  Undaunted Reinaldo continued to nourish his talents and in the newfound postrevolution euphoria explored his sexuality.  His ideas and sexual persuasion soon attracted the unwanted attention of an increasingly repressive regime which would ultimately lead to his internment reeducation and exile.For the second time in as many months I find myself having a hard time reviewing a movie.  According to the trade journals Before Night Falls made fifty film critics' top ten lists not a difficult feat given the dearth of decent films in 2000 has won numerous awards and is one of the best films ever made.   In light of these rave reviews I keep asking myself one question  Did I miss something? Spanish actor Javier Bardem Jamon Jamon who infuses his portrayal with the appropriate emotional sensitivity and resolve brings Arenas to life. For Arenas being forbidden to write was akin to being forbidden to breathe he could not and would not cease his writing even if it meant imprisonment and torture in a Cuban gulag.  Like his passion for writingis sexuality it was again not a matter of choice which Bardem makes very clear.  Johnny Depp adds another interesting character or more appropriately characters to his pantheon of performances in a dual role as a talented transvestite and a brutal military commander.  His characters emphasize the duality of relationships in police states where your best friend may be an informant and you trust no one as many horrified East Germans discovered in postwall Germany.   Equally impressive was Andrea Di Stefano as Pepe Reinaldo's parttime lover and all around bad influence.   The technical aspects of the film are more ambiguous.   Director Julian Schnabel's decision to splice in grainy film footage from post revolutionary Cuba was as bold as it was ingenious.  The scenes which contain little dialogue contribute a tangible realism to the film and convey the initial jubilation and eventual stifling repression of the newly liberated country.  Music is also used very effectively to establish mood with some surprising nonLatin choices Lou Reed's Rouge substitutes for dialogue in a nightclub scene and speaks more about betrayal than any words could.   I do however have several reservations about the film.At times the direction and editing is erratic.  This in turn disrupts the continuity of the film and makes several scenes difficult to follow.   For example while I realize that the film is about an author and poet the inclusion of his poems is done haphazardly and serves little purpose.  More importantly while the poems are read in Spanish the bulk of the dialogue is in English.  This wouldn't normally be a concern except that several of the cast members have very thick accents and do not speak English well.  It would have made more sense to have Spanish dialogue throughout and use English subtitles.  As it was I regularly had to strain to understand portions of dialogue and almost missed several key elements.Schnabel's film paints a beautiful and sometimesugly picture of one man's constant struggle against statesponsored repression and discrimination. The story is especially poignant when you remember that events unfolding before you are true.   In spite of excellent performances and interesting direction choices the directing is also inconsistent at times and several poor editing choices cause the film to drag in places.  Before Night Falls is a very good film that should have been great.".

Arenas himself is being watched. He manages to write another novel and have it smuggled out to be published in foreign countries and is jailed for his efforts. In prison Arenas continues to write and to see that his work is delivered to people that can publish it. No matter what Castro's people do to him no matter how they treat him no matter what threats they make there are two things about Arenas that remain constant his art and his sexuality.When Arenas is released from prison he desperately wants to escape Cuba so he can write and live in whatever way he chooses. The last part of the film is primarily concerned with Arenas' escape attempts. It's no secret that Arenas got away he died in New York City not in Havana. It's what his life becomes after his escape that's supposed to be interesting.You can rack up another name on the list of people who got screwed at the Oscars by the hopelessly mediocre bizarrely beloved Gladiator in 2000. Javier Bardem's performance in this film was easily and without doubt the best of the year. He holds the audience's attention with such grace and he makes it look so easy  it's the kind of performance that should be burned into the minds of everyone who loves film.If you look closely you'll catch an unrecognizable Sean Penn in a blinkandyoumisshim cameo that actually ranks among his most unusual screen moments. Johnny Depp also puts in a brief appearance as a drag queen in prison and in an exceptional oneonone scene with Bardem as the prison's sadistic warden.Bardem's performance is supported by wellcaptured images of Castro's Cuba. The cinematography stands out here almost as much as Bardem's performance does. Director Julian Schnabel keeps the action compelling moving things along at the pace you'd expect from a biopic  until the last twenty minutes or so of the film when he inexplicably slows the pace to a crawl. Once Arenas leaves Cuba all the momentum of the movie seems to just stop. Even Bardem so fascinating for almost two hours nearly becomes uninteresting in the last part of the movie.It's a small price to pay for two hours of excellence however.".

Consequently we're left with a tedious mess of a film that rambles on for too long and often seems to forget whatever point it was trying to make.The plot is taken straight out of Arenas' book Before Night Falls and follows Arenas from childhood where his teacher notices his writing abilities through his joining up with Castro's rebels his days in college and his adulthood spent being persecuted and ultimately imprisoned for his homosexuality. Eventually he escapes to New York City only to contract AIDS and be smothered to death by his friend.It's not an uplifting story to begin with but much could be done with the telling to make it satisfying as is the case with films like Sophie's Choice. Instead we get a confusing muddle where fantasy and reality are intertwined to the point where you can't tell which is which. Characters are not well developed even Arenas is still something of a cipher by the end of the film and the supporting players are not given any depth at all. Apparently the writers thought the story would tell itself and therefore do nothing to help it along. The end result is a script which fails to engage the viewer.Likewise the acting is equally stilted. While visually pleasing Javier Bardem does nothing to make Arenas an appealing or even interesting character. The supporting players do little to differentiate themselves so it is often hard to remember who is who and who they are in relation to Arenas. Sean Penn's cameo was horrible with an embarrassingly bad Spanish accent. And while Johnny Depp plays his parts with gusto they do little to add much to a film that was already a lost cause by the time he appears on the screen.A person's life story could make a very interesting film particularly when the person has had as much adversity to overcome as Reynaldo Arenas. Unfortunately this offering does little to draw you into the story settling instead for a confusing sequence of facts which ultimately goes on for way too long.

For an example there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the nos button and his Lamborghini takes off in the air and flies over a SLR McLaren to win. And after the bit where Eddy Griffin got in a fight with one of his girls an Imus comment would work in this case the girl asks to pull over and get out of the PLANE and of course they do in the middle of the desert. After this wonderful scene I couldn't take it anymore. So I only got to see half of this monstrosity. This is the first movie I had ever walked out on. Afterwards I had to stop for some drinks to kill all of my corrupted brain cells.I gave it a 1 because 0 is not an option.

The casting was terrible the acting unspeakable and the story filled with holes. Script? who needs script? I was surprised that the movie wasn't as verbally vulgar as I thought it would be however I got enough shots of TA to last me a lifetime. The movie was like listening to a 19 year old street racer with ADD who decided to buy a car instead of go to college tell a story. Being so poorly scripted I thought the two brothers in the film were lovers at first. The scenes at the racetrack along with the main female actor in the film kept making me think of Herbie Fully Loaded. This is the kind of film is what Grindhouse modeled itself after...only the writers thought they were being serious.".

The casting was terrible the acting unspeakable and the story filled with holes. Script? who needs script? I was surprised that the movie wasn't as verbally vulgar as I thought it would be however I got enough shots of TA to last me a lifetime.

Unfortunately I would have to say that this was probably the worst movie I have seen this year. Don't get me wrong the cars were nice and the girls were OK but the way they put the movie together was just plain crappy to put it nicely. The story just never made you care about the cast and the movie seemed just pieced together.

Its all about these rich punks getting their rocks off while showing only traces of feigned remorse for all the innocent road users they cause injury or death too.I can't give the film a 1 Star rating because it didn't compel me to actually walk out of the theater.

There is no way no possible way this movie would ever attract outside funding on any level whatsoever. Also Eddie Griffin is PARTICULARLY forgettable and unfunny. He is this strange representation of mediocre celebrity that is featured routinely on VH1. No one really thinks Eddie Griffin is talented no one really thinks he is funny and no one really thinks he's that popular. Therefore no one in the business really understands his appeal or why he has a career. He should've disappeared long ago. At least Lindsay Lohan can blame her career's existence on the fact that many men over 30 would like to date her  which is entirely why she has a career  she is unequally untalented.

Mindnumbingly boring impossible race sequences and a terrible waste of expensive beautiful cars which almost acquire negative points for having appeared in this movie. Sure she's hot but who's that desperate for an on screen female? I feel like the director sat there with a hat full of dialogue and plot snippets and shook an 8 ball every time they switched scenes. No serious person who races or knows anything about it would watch this movie and enjoy the race scenes.".

Halicki had done for his films GONE IN 60 SECONDS the original one and THE JUNKMAN both of which are favourite movies of mine as well. The fact that they are all exotic cars in this movie was to be expected and the race sequences involving the various cars are all handled excellently by director Andy Cheng.Nadia Bjorlin Nathan Phillips and Eddie Griffin are all great in their roles even though their characters are little more than stereotypes. The plot DOES have predictable twists although I WAS surprised as I had never heard mention of it anywhere when one of Bjorlin's opponents is the racer who killed her character's father thus allowing her in the race to get revenge but ultimately REDLINE is just good harmless mindless fun. I mean you can't expect EVERY movie that comes out to be Oscar material. I just like to have a good time when I'm watching a film which is why I give REDLINE a positive six out of ten.

The weak plot goes 100 for this movie.I most say I was hurt to see the car damage with the corvette and Shelby cobra. However if you like beautiful cars and an rush of excitement go see this movie right away.Despite the shuffled plot and unusual filming orientation I enjoy this movie a lot. I would recommend it to viewers if the can look past the plot and enjoy seeing fast cars and a rush.I thought it was amazing the War hero would get into fights almost everywhere like he was some kind of Jackie Chan. He would even take on bigger pumped up men and toss them like flies.I did enjoy seeing the Ferrari Enzo the Mercedes SLR and the Yellow Koenigsegg CCR at the end. All nice rides everything from Ferrari's Mercedes Lambo's Ford GT's Ford Shelby Cobra's Corvette's Old school cobra and so on.I still give it 7 out of 10 for the rides.".

	schema:reviewBody "A HUNDRED YARDS TO THE STATION  A HUNDRED SECONDS TO GET THEREAND A HUNDRED BULLETS SAYING.... THEY'LL NEVER MAKE IT!So goes the explosive text on the poster for Columbia Picture's 3.TEN TO YUMA 1957. An iconic western 3.TEN TO YUMA has quite deservedly taken its place in the pantheon of classic fifties westerns alongside Shane The Searchers High Noon et al. From a story by the tireless Elmore Leonard it was beautifully written for the screen by Halsted Welles and produced for the studio by David Heilwell. With stark monochrome cinematography by the great Charles Lawton Jr. the picture was arguably the best directorial effort to come from master craftsman Delmer Daves.Glenn Ford heads a superb cast as notorious outlaw Ben Wade who with his gang holds up the Butterfield stagecoach kills the guard and relieves it of its strongbox contents. Van Heflin is Dan Evens the struggling small rancher who  with his wife Leora Dana and two small sons try their best to eke out a living on their dried out small holding. But without rain or the money to buy water rights for a nearby stream to water the cattle Dan finds it difficult to carry on. But then luck comes his way. Wade is captured by the posse and the Sheriff offers 200 to anyone who will take Wade to Contention City and transport him by train on the 3. ten to Yuma prison. Dan immediately accepts the job and so begins a tension filled few hours as Dan holds his captive in a Contention hotel room to wait for the train. And all the while staving off the efforts of Wade's men to free their boss as well as contend with Wade trying to psych him out with tempting bribes to let him go. Excitement reaches fever pitch when its time to leave the hotel and go for the train. But then just as Wade's men are closing in for the kill and in a surprise move Wade capitulates and actually helps Dan to get him aboard the moving train.Performances are excellent! Ford has rarely been better! As Ben Wade he is roguish cool and throughly likable. Heflin is great too! His Dan Evens looking almost like an extension of his Joe Starrett from Shane four years earlier. And Looking gorgeous is the beautiful Felicia Farr in a splendid cameo as the girl in the saloon. There is a lovely moment at the bar in the empty saloon when Wade is trying to seduce her Ye know ye look kinda skinny  but I don't mind a skinny girl if she's got blue eyes. Poignantly scored and beautifully directed  the scene in closeup as he kisses her is both amorous and heartfelt and played out by two superb actors.Providing a wonderful atmosphere to the movie is the music of composer George Duning. Duning was composer in residence at Columbia Pictures and scored most of their prestigious productions like BellBook  Candle The Devil At Four O'Clock and his best known work Picnic 1956 in which he pulled a master stroke by combining the tune Moonglow with his own love theme to great effect for the evocative scene where William Holden dances with Kim Novak. His music for 3.TEN TO YUMA boasts a lingering central theme. It is given lovely renditions throughout especially for solo guitar and distant solo female voice. Then with added lyrics by Ned Washington it was turned into a brilliant ballad and sung over the titles by the inimitable Frankie Laine.Fifty years after 3.TEN TO YUMA an unfortunate revisionist remake was produced. It improved on the original NOT one iota and only served to emphasize how good the Delmer Daves classic really is!".

It accomplishes this by keeping to the Aristotelian unities a single theme about a single protagonist on a single day. Yes there is an obvious parallel to High Noon.Though cast as a villain for the only time in his career Glen Ford's natural likability shines through in the role of gang boss Ben Wade. Van Heflin's Dan Evans is Everymanno hero but spurred to heroism by desperate circumstances and devotion to family. In contrast to Heflin's homeliness is the godlike physical perfection of the young Richard Jaeckel as the outlaw gang's secondincommand smart dangerous utterly amoral yet loyal unto death to his boss.There is not a bad performance anywhere. But I must single out Felicia Farr as the lonely barmaid who gives Ford a last quick good time and craggyfaced Ford Rainey as a town Marshal with a plan.With its mix of deep focus shots and closeups of the actors' faces the cinematography was the obvious inspiration to Sergio Leone in his spaghetti western series.".

But I must single out Felicia Farr as the lonely barmaid who gives Ford a last quick good time and craggyfaced Ford Rainey as a town Marshal with a plan.With its mix of deep focus shots and closeups of the actors' faces the cinematography was the obvious inspiration to Sergio Leone in his spaghetti western series.";

The artistry is almost out of place in this exciting but preposterously noirish western. There doesn't seem to be anything else in Lawton's repertoire maybe parts of Two Rode Together? as good but director Daves' respect for good pictorials is evident in most of his efforts. It's a great collaboration and a pretty good picture that's not as great as the sum of its parts.  Most of the other comments rightly comment on Glenn Ford's cool acting.

The job of guarding him is taken on by reluctant guard. This temporary guard is a civilian who takes on the job only because he desperately needs the money to save his farm and family.Typical of Leonard stories the main characters have strengths and weaknesses not at first evident but when these traits become evident they are significant factors in the outcome of the story.It is an intelligent movie which is great to watch.

	schema:reviewBody "Van Heflin plays rancher Dan Evans whose family and livelihood is at breaking point due to a devastating drought. Needing money fast Evans gets thrown a financial lifeline when a reward is offered to escort a recently captured outlaw Ben Wade Glenn Ford on to the 310 train to Yuma prison. But as Wade's gang closes in to free the shackled outlaw and the clock starts to tick down Evans finds himself torn between a sense of social duty and an easy option courtesy of Wade's mind game offer.Based on a story by Elmore Leonard this is a tight and tense Western that harks to the wonderful High Noon five years earlier. Directed by Delmer Daves 310 to Yuma sees two of the Western genre's most undervalued performers come together in perfect contrast. Heflin's Evans is honest almost saintly but ultimately filling out his life with dullness and too much of a safe approach. Ford's Wade is the other side of the coin ruthless the opening sequence sets it up handsome and very selfconfident. This coupling makes for an interesting storyone that thankfully delivers royally on its setup. As Wade's gang closes in led by a sleek and mean Richard Jaeckel Wade toys with Evans offering him financial gain and gnawing away at him about his abilities as a husband the tension is palpable in the extreme. Nothing is ever certain until the credits role and that is something that is never to be sniffed at in the Western genre.The comparison with High Noon is a fair one because 310 to Yuma also deals with the man alone scenario. A man left alone to deal with his adversaries and his own conscience money or pride indeed. Daves' direction is gritty and suitably claustrophobic with close ups either being erotically charged watch out for Felicia Farr's scenes with Ford in the saloon or tightly wound in room 207 of the hotel where Heflin  Ford positively excel. His outdoor work aided by Charles Lawton Jr's photography also hits the spot particularly the barren land desperate for water to invigorate it. While the piece also has a tremendous George Duning theme song warbled and whistled by Ford in the film by Frankie Laine. Great acting great direction and a great involving story essential for fans of character driven Westerns. 8.510Footnote The film was very well remade in 2007 with two of the modern era's finest leading men Russell Crowe  Christian Bale in the dual roles of Ben  Dan respectively. One hopes and likes to think that they remade it purely because it was such a great premise to work from. Because Daves' film didn't need improving it was and still is a great film showcasing how great this often maligned genre can sometimes be.".

However due to drought and debt threatening his farm he takes the job of escorting the leader of the gang to Yuma and prison when he is caught.  The sheriffs fool the gang into thinking that Wade has been taken by coach and Evans and Wade stay in a hotel room until the train to Yuma.

The story is clever but really picks up once Wade is captured  in both Evans' home and in the hotel room the dialogue becomes clever and meaningful.  The story is kept tense with Evans getting increasingly sweaty despite being very talky.  Wade works Evans in a Machiavellian flow of dialogue that visually gets to him throughout.  However once it is clear that honour is important over money the countdown to the tense walk to the train station is on.Heflin is great as the farmer who takes a stand only to see pride swell up in his family in a way he respects the criminal for taking risk and being brave in contrast to his middle road lifestyle.  Ford is effortlessly brilliant as the criminal blessed with charisma and charm with a dangerous streak underneath  in one key scene he sets out Heflin's character when he easily casts a spell charming Heflin's wife and sons.  However beneath the dialogue he is slightly jealous of the farmer's settled life and this adds spice to the relationship between the two.Overall this is a fantastic western but if it was set in the modern day it would be a brilliant cop thriller or in space a brilliant scifi.  The key is the central relationship between the two men  here it is perfect and the tension that builds towards the fateful walk to the station is gripping.".

This firstrate adult Western draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as the noisy action .

He's witness as a dangerous gang Richard Jaeckel among others led by notorious gunfighter named Ben Wade  Glenn Ford attacks a stagecoach and killing the passengers . Later on  Ben separates from his band and he goes to a Saloon where meets with gorgeous Emma Felicia Farr. But the sheriff immediately surrounds the parlour and captures Ben . Railroad official Robert Emhardt asks for paid volunteers to join a posse to transport Ben Wade towards Yuma and Dan accepts . Meanwhile other volunteers unite posse as the drunk Henry Jones . After that and numerous dangers Dan Evans must hole up in a Motel while waiting for the train to take them to Yuma prison and overcome the murderer's several ploys to gain his breakout . The brave farmer agrees to hold trapped gunfighter until the train to Yuma prison arrives overcoming several risks and avoiding his freedom .Good adult Western with exciting battle of wits between an obstinate farmer and an astute killer who begins to psych him out . Stylish fast paced  solid meticulous and violent look with several shot'em up. This well acted movie is gripping every step of the way . This classic western is plenty of suspense as the dreaded arrival hour approaches and the protagonist realizes he must stand alone but his fellow town people for help  nobody is willing to help him such as High Noon. The narration is almost adjusted in real time  from the beginning until the final showdown and is approximately developed in ninety and some minutes . Screenwritten by Halsted Welles and based on a short story by Elmore Leonard . Elmore is a veteran novelist and screenwriter  specialist on noir plot and Western and working from Tall T Hombre continuing with Rosemary murders Get shorty Jackie Brown until nowadays . Splendid and evocative cinematography in white and black by Charles Lawton Jr . Memorable musical score fitting rightly to action Western by George Duning with sensible song at the main titles and the end by Frankie Laine. The motion picture is stunningly directed by Delmer Daves and results to be one of the best western of the 50s and 60s . It's recently remade by James Mangold with the welldrawn characters played by Russell Crowe  Christian Bale and Gretchen Mol as wife  though contains various changes as excessive violence and a little bit overlong because the first version runtime is only 92 minutes and recalls much the classic directed by Delmer Daves.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the best westerns ever made a good blend of subtle psychology and action with some taut editing. There isn't one moment of film wasted in this one.I also believe that this is Van Heflin's best screen performance. His Dan Evans is an everyman in the west. A rancher struggling to get by and support his family he happens to be a dead shot and together with that and his need for money he agrees to take outlaw Ben Wade to Yuma Territorial Prison.Glenn Ford's Ben Wade is a complex man. He's an outlaw and a killer the first few minutes of the film establish that. But he's tired. He can easily get away. But the sight of Felicia Farr at that saloon makes him pause and linger when he should be skedaddling with the rest of his gang. They shouldn't have been stopping at the saloon in the first place. But Ford needed some quiet time and his acting does convince you of his need for a breather.Anyway Ford's nabbed and stage line owner Butterfield played by Robert Emhardt offers a reward and Heflin needs the money. The only other one aiding Heflin is Henry Jones playing Alex Potter the town drunk. He's a comic character when they stop at Heflin's ranch Jones inquires of his two sons where Heflin might keep a jug handy. You laugh but Delmar Daves is very subtly setting you up for later heroics.Ford and Heflin are together most of the film and they have good chemistry. Ford works on Heflin he'd just as soon offer a bribe to get out of his fix and Heflin comes close to taking it.The best scene in the film is when Heflin's wife Leora Dana comes after Heflin. She finds him hold up in a hotel with Ford handcuffed to the bed just after a shootout in which Henry Jones was killed. They talk Heflin's not sure he's coming out of this and Dana tries to tell him to give it up. Earlier Robert Emhardt has also told him to give it up. But Heflin's sticking to his duty now. The comical town drunk has just been killed in a very brutal fashion for standing up for law and order and he couldn't look himself in the face if he shirked his responsibility. Remember Heflin is no John Wayne type hero. He's your everyman citizen taking on responsibility for his community's safety. He and Dana play this beautifully and if you don't get an emotional response you are made of stone.Van Heflin had already gotten an Oscar for Johnny Eager. But I think his performance here is even better. Why he was overlooked in the Academy sweepstakes in 1957 is beyond belief. It's Heflin's film and it's a great tribute to a very underrated actor.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've liked this movie for a long time. Watching it last night though it finally occurred to me to wonder about the character played by Glenn Ford. I don't really understand what motivates him or his gang.Some people have commented that the closing scene is unbelievable but I think that's only true because we never get a fix on Glenn Ford's character. Is he a psychotic killer or is he a gentleman thief?The psychotic killer label is supported by his actions in the opening scene of the stage coach robbery. He didn't even try to talk himself out of that situation even though the driver was one against twelve and couldn't carry out his threat without being gunned down instantly. It's also supported by the fear that his name strikes into the hearts of all the townspeople. A man doesn't generate that kind of fear by simply robbing stage coaches. Obviously he and his gang have done a lot of killing.The gentleman thief label is supported by his complete lack of bullying characteristics. In every other situation of the movie except that opening scene he uses his charm to try to get around people. He doesn't attempt to run roughshod over them. That completely contradicts the image of a guy who shoots first and asks questions later.As for his gang they show an extraordinary amount of loyalty to him and each other which makes the shooting during the stage coach robbery that much more unconvincing. Why would they be loyal to a leader who didn't even try to save one of his own? Maybe that was just an anomaly. Ford tells us later in the movie that his gang will always go to extraordinary lengths to save one of their own and they do just that to try to free him. Yet at the end he chooses to save the life of Van Heflin rather than go with his gang. Okay so he decided that Van Heflin was a good guy worth saving even if it did get his second in command killed. I don't mind that. What bothers me is why is he so confident that having turned his back on his gang they are going to try to rescue him again in Yuma??? If I'm in that gang he's made his choice and he can swing for it.".

The film's simple theme of good vs. evil evokes similar stories from the old Gunsmoke TV series of the 1950s.The film gets off to a powerful start with a stark BW image of a distant stage coach moving across a barren desert landscape as Frankie Laine wails with affectation the mournful theme song. It's one of the most striking opening scenes in cinema history.While the dialogue and acting are more than competent it's the visuals that really distinguish this film. The overall BW imagery provided by cinematographer Charles Lawton Jr. is almost in the same league as the BW imagery from cinematographers Gregg Toland and Stanley Cortez.Apart from the thin story my only significant quibble with the film is its finale which I found to be unrealistic and unsatisfying.

	schema:reviewBody "Wherever possible I like to see the original version of a film before I see its remake. Set to attend a screening for James Mangold's '310 to Yuma 2007' the following night I quickly decided to rent Delmer Daves' 1957 original which was adapted from a short story by Elmore Leonard. Unsurprisingly given its source the film's plot is extremely simple unconcerned with the need for a large cast of characters and complicated story lines. After a fatal gold robbery infamous outlaw Ben Wade Glenn Ford is captured in a small town and a group of honest volunteers agree to transport him to Contention to board the 310 train to Yuma Prison. One of these volunteers is Dan Evans Van Heflin a povertystricken smalltime rancher with a thirst to proves his worth to both his wife and two sons. Meanwhile Wade's loyal gang ride in hot pursuit of their leader intent on rescuing him and avenging his capture. As the tension mounts and loading Wade onto the 310 train begins to seem impossible the other volunteers rationally retreat from their task with only Evans staying true to his word.It's only recently that I've begun to concern myself with the Western genre but '310 to Yuma' seems an ideal example. The story's brilliance lies in its own inherent simplicity the interactions between the two main characters form the picture's emotional core and it's the incredible depth of these interactions that allow the film to rise above its Bmovie foundations. In one case at least the minimalism of the film's production allows for the perfect atmosphere in the story's climax as Wade's bandits begin to surround the hotel room in which their leader is being held. Even before the gang rides into town the streets have become almost completely vacant Contention has become a ghost town. It seems likely that this was partly a result of the film's low production budget  money spent on extras was probably considered money wasted  but the escalating sense of foreboding created by the chillingly empty streets is perfect as though indeed everybody in town figures that a storm is blowin' up.Both Glenn Ford and Van Heflin do a very good job considering the film's straightforward plot and it is their believable characterisations that prove the picture's greatest asset. At first glance Ben Wade appears obnoxious sarcastic and detestable but reveals more likable trait  and even a streak of nobility  as the film progresses. Likewise Dan Evans is portrayed as a conservative man whose logical unwillingness to take risks might easily be misattributed to cowardice one who only agrees to escort Wade in order to claim the muchneeded 200 reward. However as the situation continually progresses towards guaranteed disaster and all the other volunteers back down regretfully Evans refuses to surrender. In his captor's inflexible perseverance and unflinching integrity Wade discovers a man that he himself respects and admires and the mutual understanding  however tentative  that the two men develop proves crucial in the picture's final moments.".

I liked the facts that Heflin's wife actually looked careworn rather than being the glamourpuss we see out in the desert in other Westerns.

For modern students of cinematography the 1950s Western genre may initially seem somewhat arcane but movies like this demonstrate how movies of that era reach for a higher plane not just in terms of the craft but philosophy as well. This effort is almost perfectly constructed and worthy of a student's close analysis. It could have been 10 minutes longer to develop the characters of Ford and Heflin emphasise some of the sexual tension and to develop the relationship between protagonist and antagonist. Perhaps some back story should have been implied too between the gang and its leader civil war loyalty ? And incidentally I was amazed and pleased how briefly intensely and satisfying was the connection between Ford and the barmaid.An amazing scene of just a few minutes  which surely must have shocked adult audiences of 1957 and passed over the head of children.".

Heflin post Shane has transformed from a lifelong farmer to an exlawman now failing farmer who has gone soft. He's apparently unarmed and with his two sons when they happen upon a stage robbery facilitated by his own herd that turns into murder. He stands by what else could he do? rationalizing his lack of action to himself and his boys. When his wife hears of it his manhoodself image is really low. The film is about his attempt to restore his manhoodreputation in the face of ridiculous odds. Some parallels to High Noon.Alone in the bridal suite with his gun on Ford shotgun wedding? it is the captive who will try to manipulateintimidate the hero into giving up.I'm not going to say much more. I liked the film particularly Ford  Heflin although the ending is not entirely believable. Saw the film again near seven months later and I enjoyed it more than I had remembered. A tip of the cowboy hat to Richard Jaeckel and one helluva friendly barmaid. The remake due in September 2007 doesn't interest me cause you can't improve on Ford and Van Heflin!Recently reread the Elmore Leonard short story and I'm surprised to find the film is better than the story.".

His wife later talks of the pride his sons feel in him as the 'man who captured Ben Wade'. Towards the end of the film money is not the reason for his wanting to bring Wade in. When the town drunk has been killed van Heflin's farmer realises that morality justice and honour demand that the job be finished despite others' protestations and Wade be made to face trial.I do not agree that the ending is really a weak point. When I first watched the film I misheard Ford's Ben Wade character to say 'I've broken out human before' instead of 'I've broken out of Yuma before'. I genuinely think that some sort of strange bond has developed between the captive Ben Wade and that in a split second decision of human compassion Wade recognises the worth of his struggling farmer guard whose life has been that of loving struggle to support his wife and family. He therefore acts to save him. It could then be argued that the theme of honour and redemption has extended to include Ben Wade's outlaw.".

Solidly edited director Delmer Daves and cameraman Charles Lawton Jr. achieve a very claustrophobic atmosphere for a western by keeping it off the streets and opting to shrink the drama down to the hotel bar and a room with a view in which Lawton capitalizes on with disconcerting angles and fractured imagery and establish a disorienting tension. Catching the train in the film's climax offers up some other outstanding craftsmanship on those mentioned above.As in Shane Heflin's unassuming looks and demeanor work superbly to his advantage as a Joe nondescript filled with incertitude but with a determination to dig down and see it through.

Oh it's all there ... if you are in the neighborhood theater in 1957. All that's needed is the popcorn. However Glen Ford just doesn't quite measure up to the same character as portrayed by Russell Crowe in the 2007 epic. This reference to Mr. Ford may be a little unfair. He was one of our better actors but was to a point restricted by the company that had him under contract during the 50s Columbia Pictures. In 1957 Columbia was just beginning to get into the game of making motion pictures with bigger and better budgets although it didn't see fit to present this film in color which may have been a good lootsaving decision for Harry Cohn and his tight fist Mr. Cohn was the head of the studio at the time. The blackandwhite format presents a perfect atmosphere thanks to the good direction of the talented Delmer Daves. Van Heflin still underrated today for the great performances he gave us during his relatively short film career is top notch in this western.

	schema:reviewBody "I would consider myself to be a movie buff and I live and grew up in Massachusetts. I must tell you that Ben Affleck has done an outstanding job in his directorial debut. In casting his brother Casey you may think that it's just nepotism or giving his brother a break. No. He is the absolute perfect person to play this role. Because they know the area they have made one of the most authentic movies I've ever seen. And it's not just some Boston movie either. I heard a woman as I was leaving saying it's just like The Departed. No it's not it's much better and the fact is I loved The Departed. But that was flashier. As great as it was you could tell people were acting. Not here. They seemed exactly like the degenerates and handful of decent folk I see every day of my life. The woman who plays the girl's mother I don't know who see is but I've met her about 1000 times.As far as the story goes I'd never spoil it for you but it's complex not confusing. There is a lot going on and it's so real. I don't know what's happened in this area but people have become so lousy. So lousy that if you're a good person you just don't know what can be done anymore. There seems to be no answer sometimes and this film is set in that world. If you have the brains and heart to try you don't even know what will come of it.Who should see this? Intelligent people. People who want to come out of a movie thinking about what they just saw. People who want to see an incredibly well made film. And anyone who ever liked Ben Affleck even for half a second. He should be very proud of this movie. As far as content there are loads of curse words some drug use but no nudity that I can remember and there is some gun violence but nothing too bad. Put it high on your movie going list.".

	schema:headline " Ben Affleck crafts a disturbing emotional adaptation.";
	schema:reviewBody "After a decade of critically disgraced performances and brutal public humiliation year after year Ben Affleck took a well deserved break from the Hollywood scene. This year he came back but instead of taking the spotlight by starring in a film he went behind the scenes and opted to direct his first feature film. Taking an example from another actor turned director a little independent man named Clint Eastwood he decided to adapt a novel written by Mystic River author Dennis Lehane. On the surface Gone Baby Gone tells the story of a missing child and the two private investigators who are hired to find her. The story transforms into a highly disturbing tale of selfish terrifying characters and the fact that no matter what people never change.In deciding who to play the leading role of the intelligent reserved moral and slightly naive Patrick Kenzie Ben looked no further than his brother Casey. Initially this may seem like a bad idea with lots of sibling tension on the set but the decision couldn't have been a better one. After years of undertheradar brilliance Casey gets to show his acting genius in the leading role of a powerful emotionally drenching work. I love the fact that everyone is finally getting to see what a true wonder this young actor is with talent greater than the majority of actors I've ever seen no matter what their age. He's getting a large amount of critical recognition for his flawless turn in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford but he is almost as exceptional in this one. Counterbalancing Kenzie is his mature and equally intelligent partner and lover Angie Gennaro played by the beautiful Michelle Monaghan. The two of them grew up on the streets of Boston and therefore are pursued to use their relationships with the criminals involved to help find the men who kidnapped this little girl. This leads the audience on a highly engaging and very disturbing journey through the lowest forms of scum in the Boston population and a climax that is just as surprising as it is haunting.The second half starts with another missing person's case and Kenzie discovers something that forces him to bring back Detective Remy Bressant Ed Harris a character who he didn't end on the best of terms with in the first act. In an act of high tension and in the face of an ultimate evil Kenzie makes a decision that he immediately regrets and is the first time he really matures in the film and falls into a moral crisis as he witnesses the true personalities of those around him and reevaluates everything in his life. A conversation with Bressant soon after this act provides a stage for Ed Harris' remarkable display of talent in one of his career best performances. However a revelation Kenzie makes during this conversation leads us into an even darker world of corruption within the police back to the victims of the original crime and a lesson that sometimes the most morally righteous can people can do terrifying things if they believe it is for the greater good.Another stirring revelation leads Affleck to the film's second big twist that I didn't see coming from a mile away. He finds moral corruption again 'for the greater good' in the most unexpected place and is led to one of the most arduous and unimaginable decisions I've ever seen put on film. I won't spoil anything but it's safe to say that this was the first and only time I've ever put myself in the shoes of a character on screen and wondered what I would do in his situation. It's a decision I don't think I could ever make and one of the most painful scenes of the year. Watching Affleck's expression and the pain in his eyes is truly gutwrenching. In his decision we eventually see that even in the most emotionally straining situations and no matter how much they say they will people never change. I found that to be the final moral of the film and the ending was haunting cathartic and emotionally painful as we see Kenzie living with the fact that maybe his decision was the wrong one but he still tries to do the morally just thing in the end.Ben Affleck has come back strong to the Hollywood scene by avoiding public humiliation and realizing that the film would be miles superior if he directed instead of starred in it. There is one minor flaw in this feature and that is that it felt to me like three different films. There are two clear cut endings but the film picks back up afterwards on the road to the final conclusion. With each new story comes depth and disturbance from the characters and overall plot so one can easily ignore this very minuscule flaw. His casting was flawless from the stunning magnificence of Casey Affleck to the Oscarworthy Ed Harris to the critically praised grieving mother Amy Ryan. Gone Baby Gone is certainly one of the best films this year and I hope it's not forgotten come awards season particularly in the form of it's reborn director and flawless leading man as well as the rest of this multitalented cast. A deeply disturbing and thoroughly engaging picture that is sure to stay on my mind for days.".

This movie had a particular touch that gave a genuine and authentic feeling to it. Ben Affleck has a way of writing about life on the streets in Boston that just grabs you. Good Will Hunting was a fine example of that but Gone Baby Gone displayed his directing abilities as well. This movie appeared that it could fall apart any second but yet the story held up and managed to get its message out. Ben Affleck seems to be very creative and knows how to get your attention right when he want you to.I had not expected Casey Affleck to play as well either because there were so many compliments made toward his performance I expected something totally different. Yet he also brought this authenticity in his acting like Ben did in his directing. Youn could just see the look in his eyes that he was totally into it he was it. He gave a great portrayal of a detective that should have earned him an Oscar nomination. Also a great supporting cast was put in place with Morgan Freeman Ed Harris and Amy Ryan. All of them gave engaging performances as well. Amy Ryan especially with her performance as the mother of her girl who is the centerpiece of this story. I believe if it was not for her this movie could have very easily fallen into an ordinary movie. What really made up the movie was the message. After all what is a movie without a message. This movie did not try to pretend to be deep or try to impress. It did what it had to do asking the a very tough question. Is the right thing to do always the right decision to make and do the ends justify the means? I advise you not to miss this movie and definitely watch this with a friend or family member.".

	schema:reviewBody "Every once in a while amid the dross that reviewers have to sit through comes a movie that hits like a sucker punch to the gut and haunts you long after you've left the theater. Such is the case with Gone Baby Gone.Based on the book by Dennis Lehane Mystic River Gone Baby Gone marks the directorial debut of Ben Affleck who also penned the screenplay in tandem with Aaron Stockard and easily puts him at the front of the line for Oscar contention.Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan star as a pair of private investigators based in the rough working class Dorchester district of Boston. The two are hired by the family of a missing fouryearold girl to assist the police investigation because of their street connections and ability to get people to talk who otherwise would never open up to a cop. As they navigate through the neighborhood's seamy underbelly of pimps drug dealers and crack whores they uncover an everexpanding mystery that takes on the added dimension of provoking the question of just what is right and what is wrong firmly pitting both story and viewer in a struggle between situational ethics and moral absolutes.Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris round out an impressive cast but it's the younger Affleck who takes this movie on his back and runs with it easily surpassing his director brother in terms of acting breadth and range. This is no slight to Ben however. It's been a long time since I was this impressed with a directorial debut and even longer since I was given cause to reflect upon the values that we hold dear as individuals and a society and the moral foundations upon which they are based. Gone Baby Gone manages both and wraps it up in a hardhitting detective story that serves as much to satisfy the baser urges of bar fights and gun play as it does tackling bigger issues.It's also one of those rare movies in which it can easily be said that the less you know about the story going in the richer the experience. There's no clear twist ending to give away but rather a layered story that unfolds like a Russian stacking doll with a moral dilemma at its core.One thing I do feel comfortable revealing however is that this movie comes about as close as any can to being a bonafide lock come Academy Award time. Congrats Ben you may well have redeemed yourself from your JLoGigli reputation at last.".

This means that in order to keep up with my statement of seeing almost everything I go to see movies a minimum of five and a maximum of seven days per week and some days I attend several movies this is not an exaggeration meaning that I do get to see 250 to 300 movies every year.Today 102007 I was trying to decide what to see and Gone Baby Gone was not in my menu as even though I go so often to the movies I had not seen any trailer for this movie nor heard anything about it. Perusing the newspaper the synopsis attracted me and I decided to see it. As Gone Baby Gone progressed I found myself being really pull into the story living it together with the characters through the splendid direction editing and camera work. As the movie ended I thought to myself This is why you go see so many bad and regular movies so you will not miss the occasional good one and the rare excellent movie.Gone Baby Gone is easily the best movie I have seen this year. And that includes most of the art foreign or indie movies that I also attend religiously. Unless something out of this world comes out in the next six weeks this is my candidate for the Oscar to the best picture and Ben Affleck should also be nominated for best Director.".

	schema:headline " Gone but Never Forgotten";
	schema:reviewBody "In his directorial debut Ben Affleck has completely morphed himself into an emerging artist and even more challenging director. Gone Baby Gone might be the most innovative and moral challenging film of recent years. This is the story of young Amanda a little girl who mysteriously disappears from her home and the activity and dangers that befall upon the people involved in her finding.The film stars Affleck's brother Casey as Patrick in his most challenging and engrossing performance to date. Not since Sean Penn in Mystic River has a role been so subdued yet immensely victorious and depth defying in choice of delivery and spot on emotions. Casey Affleck has paved the way for himself in roles that demonstrate the actor's showcase and give the performer range. It's a bit odd what to make of the younger Affleck in the upcoming awards season. He fairs a better shot for his earlier raved performance in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford for a nomination but his performance in Gone Baby Gone is far more superior. Especially with upcoming prospects such as Daniel DayLewis Johnny Depp and other big name talents it'll be a tough road ahead for him.Ed Harris who's been long overdue for Oscar recognition is purely haunting in his role as Remy a hardnosed cop looking for young Amanda. In one scene in particular Harris shines and gives his best portrayal since The Hours. Although his character is a bit onedimensional Harris elevates the material and turns it into his show and steals frame after frame in a role easily lost in a picture like this.Morgan Freeman in a role we have not seen him in before plays Captain Jack Doyle the head of the missing persons unit with personal experience in the loss of a child. Freeman although absent for most of the narrative sugar coats the top acting talent in the picture. Freeman's agenda into more range projects in his older career is reaffirming his Oscar win in 2003 for Million Dollar Baby but now with the more rewarding films worthy of consideration.Michelle Monaghan who's a bit of an unknown face plays Angie Patrick's significant other who's personal fears interfere with her involvement in the case. To be honest Monaghan gets lost in the shuffle and while the audience empathizes with her throughout the latter of the film she's placed into a role easily overshadowed by stronger characters. Perhaps being the only strong woman role would have gave us something to awe at but not with the guns at full blaze at the hands of Amy Ryan.Ryan plays Amanda's mother Helene definitely not the most likable of characters but tragic in character arc. It's like a full on tennis match going back and forth with Ryan and audience the viewer is hating her one moment and then needing to hold her the next. Helene is multilayered and grasps her own importance of parenting and the whole film it becomes a fallen angel lost in the fire. That is the tragedy of the film a film not only about the loss of a little girl but the loss of innocence and the torment that betrayal guilt and corruption can weigh on our souls.Ben Affleck is completely in control of this film which he has lacked in his performances often. He knows what the mission is of this picture and would gladly take a spot amongst some bigger older talents among Oscar prospects this year. Along with Coadapting the film with Aaron Stockard if Oscar is feeling like inviting Affleck to the Kodak the screenplay category seems like a better fit especially with an already win for Good Will Hunting. Other possibilities for consideration is wonderful cinematography by John Toll and a great musical score by Harry GregsonWilliams.Comparisons to Mystic River are all about being done by the same author how could we expect no less. Mystic River had more of the message of the domino effect of one's actions on others Gone Baby Gone brings it to a new level. This film is about a society a society who has lost the importance of innocence and the beauty of life. It focuses on the beauty of children and rest assure when the film is over if you're not yearning to be a better parent of embrace a child as a blessing there is probably emptiness in your chest. This film is marvelous beautiful and spectacular. A mustsee film of the year and a pleasant surprise coming from Ben Affleck.Grade ".

The close ups are a recurring theme throughout the movie. It's because this is not just a film about a child kidnapping. It is a film about people and that is what lifts this film above so many others.Director Ben Affleck shows confidence and style in his first film. After this he does not need to perform in any more films. He is a much better writer and director than he is an actor.All the performances in the film are superb. Casey Affleck has to carry the film and he does a great job. He is a stoic deadpan detective. But unlike the Noir detectives of the past he is not a loner. He has a lot of friends and he has his girlfriend played by Michelle Monaghan help with the investigation. He uses his connections to find out things the police cannot.Beyond that the less you know the better.If you like crime dramas that also work as character studies you should run out and see Gone Baby Gone.".

	schema:reviewBody "People everywhere cringe at the thought of their child being abducted. Anyone who has watched any of the primetime news channels in the last several years can see that every major news network devotes huge amounts of time to abduction and kidnapping stories. This is a clear reflection of the heart and conscience of a global society today. Every single human has a family and knows from a primal understanding that all children are innocent and are dependent on 2 parents and their extended families to protect them teach them and guide them down a path toward independence in the world.This movie raises one of many important questions in a long overlooked subject .children's rights.I was happy to see that when facing a tough decision of how to end the movie Ben Affleck decided to choose for the rights of the child. In a discussion after the directors screening I attended Ben said in real life you never know if it's right or wrong but you have to take a side and live with the consequences. Casey Affleck said any other choice would be crazy and irresponsibleyou can't take kids. Amy Ryan said lets help the parents who need help its about breaking the cycle. Clearly working on this film has raised these actors  director personal awareness on the issue of child abduction. As I am sure this movie will for all who see it.As the father of an abducted child and a person who has devoted most of my life to this work since my daughter was abducted I have to say that this film .from beginning to end handled such a challenging subject with a sensitivity and completeness. I am very impressed and Ben has made me a believer in his work. Ben Affleck and Aaron Stockard definitely did their due diligence in real research. There are many important aspects of real world abductions handled well here.and it is all in a Hollywood movie that contains the kind of action and drama and intrigue that filmmakers seem to have to use to get the tickets sold.I was especially impressed with the coming of age of the character Casey played Patrick a guy who didn't exactly know where he fit in his community until he decided I'm gonna bring her home. With a certain naivete' in the world  he is driven to stand by his principles. The line I believe the government when they tell me something explains him well. But eventually he has a moment of clarity and growth and says I must have remembered it wrong. This is the moment of his acceptance that the government corrupt police and anyone .is fallible and has shortcomings. We all have personal and political agendas that if backed into a corner will defend right or wrong and the rest of the world can't change that. Its a moment that defines the rest of his life.Amy Ryan does a great job playing her character a bad rolemodel for a parent. Those stereotypes on Jerry Springer exist in real life and they have children. Many are not able to put the children first in their lives for whatever the reason. All of us probably live near one.My hat is off entirely to Ben Affleck and all. Children seem to be able to survive incredible events and trauma. They seem to rebound against all odds without obvious damage sometimes. In the end all will be revealed. But for now . We are left to ask ourselves and those around us .When that child grows up and finds out that he or she was abducted or when that abducted child says they stole me...... Who will stand up and answer for and apologize to her for not helping to return her to her lawful parents? Definitely go see the movie Patrick Braden October 2 2007".

His career has never lived up to the promise of his performance in that film a quiet and subtle display and has been overshadowed by the success of his friend and coOscarwinner Matt Damon. With Gone Baby Gone Affleck moves back behind the camera directing and writing whilst his brother Casey who really impressed in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford takes the lead.The film is a gritty thriller at first with a quite masterful opening which is engrossing and effective. The sense of location is evident from the start and both Afflecks demonstrate their talents. Casey is an interesting screen presence and Ben is an unfussy director with an eye for location and images.The film is served well be the stellar cast. Ed Harris is very good as is Michelle Monaghan and the Oscar nominated Amy Ryan is fantastic whilst Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman which is nice. They do make the film easy to watch even though the subject matter focussing on child abduction is difficult to deal with.However although the subject matter is treated well throughout most of the film its fatal flaw is that it lets itself go in the third act. The plot twists and turns three times toward the end to lose nearly all credibility and then loses any that it had left by landing on a truly unbelievable conclusion. Its focus on character is not lost but it is still a disappointment to see such a tightly played drama unwind at the end.Nevertheless this film has much promise. Its subject matter should be a consideration for anyone who is thinking of seeing this but it is an intelligent and interesting film which is worth watching mainly because of what it might be the precursor of.".

The story is original supported by an outstanding screenplay with several plot points and a polemic conclusion and the performances are great.

Despite being well done and telling a captivating story it just isn't what I want from a story or a movie in general. Patrick Kenzie Casey Affleck and Angie Gennaro Michelle Monaghan are called in as private detectives by a family to investigate a missing child report. Jack Doyle Morgan Freemanand Detective Remy Bressant Ed Harris represent the reluctant yet cooperative police department that works hand in hand with the private detectives. The story evolves as a mystery leading the viewer along as everyone sifts through the lies and coverups. While this story is quite emotional and disturbing at times the final message is a bit anticlimactic. It comes across more as a social statement directed towards an American subculture than it does being a plausible series of events. In the end it just all seems pointless. It isn't a bad movie it just isn't how I'd want to spend 2 hours of leisure time. Casey Affleck does a great job at keeping the story on track. Michelle Monaghan plays a convincing girlfriendassistant. Ed Harris  Morgan Freeman never skip a beat on making you feel distressed about the little girl being lost. The ending just made me not care about how well it was acted and composed. Ben Affleck's role as director and screenplay writer seems to be invisible just as it should be.

The Boston area where the story is set and its inhabitant is staged like a Freak Show for people living in better areas to shudder and be happy to not live there  a tad too much paint I would say. The movie seems to convey several doubtful messages that child molesters are never stopping their doings anyway  teaming up even that selfjustice is excusable and what is worst  that stealing kids from bad mothers is justified. I haven't read the book but the movie doesn't seem to want to motivate the private detective's Michelle Monaghan feeling concerning stealing the child. The usual corrupt cops topic doesn't require any additional comment really. As a last comment I wouldn't have been surprised if Jennifer Lopez had taken a role in this movie to make it a truly Bennifer experience of a movie.".

It was apparently meant to be a film about dilemma that was primarily designed to make the viewer reflex on its message and think about their' own moral decision making. What would you do type of thing. By the time the moral of the story came  I no longer cared. The film was a huge disappointment. First of all the story is confusing and disjointed. Ben Affleck directs like he acts  like a teenager with A.D.D. The characters were uninteresting unmotivated and miscast. Casey Affleck Patrick Kenzie as a private eye looks more like Dookie Howser than Mike Hammer. He tries so hard to master the Boston accent that he is difficult to understand  not that he has anything interesting to say. So little time is spent on character development that the viewer doesn't really care about who any of these people are or what happens to them. Michelle Monaghan literally sleep walks through her role as Affleck's girlfriend and partner muttering a few phrases occasionally so you won't mistake her for a mannequin but so uninspired that one wonders who she was cozy with to get the role. I think you can all figure out how Casey Affleck got the lead role. Ed Harris who is a good actor does his best with the uninspired dialogue but his efforts are wasted on a part that no one could have saved. Most disappointing of all is Morgan Freemen's role as Jack Doyle. Morgan appears as an aging police official  who looks to be about 80  who for some reason lost a 12 year old daughter. OK that's possible but improbable. While his name appears prominently in the advertisements for this debacle Freeman's character shows up in about 5 minutes of the actual film. In conclusion the acting is second rate the characters inadequately developed and the story poorly told. Gone Baby Gone should have been titled Bad Baby Bad it stunk.".

If you really do want to see this movie trust me you don't then read this after you've seen it.. This movie started out pretty raw and it does tug at your heart strings since it has issues with kids in it. At first I thought it was some sort of shock movie. One of those for lack of a better story pushing the sock value you've seen them before.I got to hand one thing to Ben. First time I was left watching a detective story thinking that the protagonist was a total frigging idiot! Give me Philip Marlowe or Sam Spade! This guy is a detective with an IQ of a rock.The story has a few holes it in that make it fall apart. It got worse and worse about 34 into the movie.1 He just shot the pedophile killer in the head and killed him. I didn't shed any tears for the guy okay the guy deserved it. But then it doesn't explain how he got away with this murder. It left me thinking that okay they must have made up a story with Remy to make it all self defense...Then the movie reaches it denouement thinking there was some terrible conspiracy for money only to find that the bad guys were not so bad after all. Then the detective does what does not make any sense at all and gives up the child back to the drug addict mother. Just after the three cops basically gave up their careers two of them their lives one directly not to mention several other people that either lied or gave up 130k in interest of the child. Makes even less sense when he commits murder in a previous scene and gets away with it but then he's morally inclined to take the child way from new loving adoptive albeit illegal parents. Not to mention sending the good retired Chief and wife to prison.. And then a few more final scenes that points out that he was even more of an idiot and that what other people were telling him.Now all of this nonsensical line would have made sense every movie need not have a happy ending after all but Casey Affleck just didn't bring it. Just maybe it would have made some sort of melodramatic sense if he could have pulled it off right.No offense to the other reviewers but Ben must have paid them well.I'm off to watch The Maltese Falcon to wash the bad taste out of my mouth before I pluck my eyes out after watching this movie..".

I guess Germans must have liked this humor back then but these 90 minutes have not aged too well. Zrtliche Chaoten or Lovable Zanies was directed by Franz Josef Gottlieb and stars Helmut Fischer and Michael Winslow Police Academy next to Gottschalk. The comedy is very similar compared to the Krger movies. There is some slapstick some voicerelated humor some drag and also a romance story as usual. Which of the 3 is the child's daddy? If there is anything one could care about in this film then this is it. Despite the weak script though it was somewhat fun to see Pierre Brice Ottfried Fischer and famous goalkeeper JeanMarie Pfaff in cameos. But these were not enough to make this a rewarding watch and it is embarrassing that they even made a sequel one year later. Oh well at least they kept it at 2. I don't recommend Zrtliche Chaoten. Not a funny film by today's standards.".

	schema:headline " French cinema comingofage erotic film";
	schema:reviewBody "I like David Hamilton's artistic photographs of nude women at the border of womanhood sometimes erotic though never pornographic. Someone else liked them too because my David Hamilton books were stolen. In one book were seen a few pictures of a young boy obviously nude intimate with a young woman older than he also nude. Though discrete there was strong sexual connotation. New territory for David Hamilton which proved to be either stills from the movie Tendres Cousines or perhaps photos taken on set.The art of still photography unfortunately does not automatically translate to cinematography. Soft focus becomes outoffocus and discrete angles become confusing perhaps because in motion they cannot be considered. You either see it or miss it and there's no time to observe to comprehend. The movie is supposed to be a farce and funny things do happen but it doesn't hang together perhaps because the story develops so slowly and one may wonder just what's going on. Eventually the 14yearold Julien has intercourse with his cousin but it's soft core with no genital contact shown on camera. Since it's a farce we have a disappointing virgin and an embarrassing caught in the act gag and having caught them Julien's father even gives him a cigarette to complete the experience. In fairness the film is in French and conforms to French cinematic forms which may just be too subtle for most Americans even with English subtitles to help us Phillistines along.It's been suggested that this film is child pornography and that certainly results from today's climate where sexual exploitation of children is clearly a serious problem. Nobody in their right mind wants to endorse or appear to endorse the sexual abuse of children so there's practically no room left for children to be seen in even the mildest erotic context without immediately activating alarms over sexual violence and exploitation. Guys will think Lucky Julien! even as they agree that sex and children in the movies is a bad thing all the while still wishing they could have been a Julien at that age. Women too may have similar thoughts but all such considerations must be pushed out of one's conscious mind. Hysterically the worst assumptions have become automatic and matters of children and sex are rigorously avoided. Too bad since sexual awakening is a real human experience. Afer all children do grow up and become sexual beings as Julien does. It's a fit literary subject cinema included but taboo under the threat of sexual violence against children. David Hamilton I think was taking a risk to make a movie on this topic even in 1980. He was somewhat successful at exploring this sensitive topic and unfortunately we're unlikely to see better in the near future for fear of the child pornography label.".

	schema:reviewBody "Most reviews say that this is the weakest point in Hamilton's short movie career. This movie is a bit different from the rest and considering it the best or the worst depends on what you expect from a movie and what you expect from Hamilton.Knowing Hamilton as a photographer you can be slightly surprised. While Bilitis looks like his books in a movement with all those young girls discovering themselves and relations with each other on the edge of lesbian with a plot connecting these scenes Laura concentrates on few characters what enables developing relations among them malefemale artistmodel but though we see beautiful photos many of them better than his average their number is reduced for the sake of the plot. Tendres cousines is different from both it is only Hamilton's movie that looks more like a film than like a collection of moving photos. Because of that it can be acceptable to wider audience than Hamilton's fans looking like an erotic comedy but not German softcore type  Schulmdchen report fans would be very disappointed. You won't laugh a lot but you can smile and that's something you don't often get from Hamilton. Unlike all other Hamilton's movies the age of female varies. Unlike other movies main character is a boy. Unlike his usual works this one isn't put out of place and out of time. We have characters that live their life have their destiny and don't lead us only from one photo to another from one nude girl to another.Unfortunately Hamilton again gets lost with a script in his hands. Girls on beaches under shower in lowlight rooms in gardens under tents in front of mirrors regardless of the amount of clothes  this is his territory he can shoot minutes and hours and whatever he does you'll always feel the artist's eye and hand behind it. But when he has to present us average everyday life he stops being Hamilton and becomes average director who just follows the script. Hamilton is best known for his nudes but they are just a part of his work. And in Tendres cousines we have a reverse situation his girls are not in the best shots. Nature garden house remind us on Hamilton's work often neglected part of it while girls even when nude don't have anything special in the way he presents us. Maybe Hamilton was confused having a boy in front of camera maybe he was thinking about a line that censorship would accept maybe he was really trying to make something new and no one dared to tell him he shouldn't but he neglected what he was mostly praised for.".

If it belongs in the latter category than the cinematography is a grainy mix of shots which resemble traditional paintings and also of downright ugly shots which could probably be attributed to the films low production values.

These tend to be relatively explicit chock full of nudity  and even hint at incest.  Of course the movie is probably intended to show a case of what can happen during puberty and what can lead adult or almost adult women the women in the movie by the way are gorgeous to have sex with a boy that young. Or it could just be an attempt at a teenage Emmanuelle. Nevertheless it surprises me that this movie was not banned in the U.S. as child porn  not that it necessarily should be but Americans tend to be extremely sensitive to the problem of teen exploitation .

In fact the story revolves around Eva a woman Tilda Swinton who apparently didn't want to have a child ... at least not at this time and certainly not THIS child. If you have seen The Omen you probably gave thanks that you didn't have a child like Damien. At least we knew Damien was the spawn of Satan. Eva's son Kevin is instead a good old fashioned psychopath. One who has an inherent need to cause pain and misery for his mother.What a pair Eva and Kevin make. From day one Kevin seems to sense his mother's lack of joy in parenthood. And he seems to have a genetic disposition of making her pay. As with many psychopaths his above average intelligence makes him even more dangerous. He is tricky enough to keep his dad John C Riley clueless as to his nature while causing much doubt in the dad's mind as to the stability of his wife.My favorite part is actually how director Lynne Ramsay structured the storytelling. It goes beyond nonlinear and actually bounces throughout three key periods Kevin as a babytoddler Kevin as a 68 year old Jason Newell and Kevin as a teenager Ezra Miller. Each age is progressively more frightening and disenchanting and the film begins with what is an undetermined catastrophe. This event is slowly revealed over the course of the movie though we witness events leading up to it as well as the resulting fallout.There are a few scenes where Eva is scrubbing the exterior of her house in an attempt to remove the red paint that was purposefully splattered. As a viewer we understand that she has blood on her hands and she seems resigned to the fact that she is now a social outcast even a pariah. We spend much of the movie in Eva's jumbled thoughts as she tries to piece together what has happened and why. Of course there is no answer. The title explains what was missing all along. There was no communication and no willingness to confront the problem ... a psychopathic son. To say they all paid the price is an understatement.This film has a very limited audience though my claim is that Ms. Swinton was quite deserving of an Oscar nomination. She wears defeat like a mask and lives in isolation better than most could. Even the music is offbeat and unusual in its use ... thanks to Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood. As filmmaking this is high art. As storytelling it's a bit muddled and quite a downer.".

Swinton is absolutely magnificent as always as the mother desperately trying to cope with raising a psychopathic child but equally impressive are the performances of the actors who portray the developmental stages of Kevin from early childhood to the brink of adulthood. What elevates this film is the visual and musical narrative that accompanies the initial timeskipping introduction and then the more linear progression of Kevin's growth to its final terrible conclusion. Interestingly the emotional crescendo of the film occurs not near the end when Kevin carries out his horrific violence but rather in the middle of the film at moments when we observe the impossibility of living a normal family life with a child who is incapable of feeling or expressing the human emotions that bind us together.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is quite simply one of the best films of the year. Even the book's author Lionel Shriver a woman praises the film calling it 'a brilliant adaptation'. Being a firsttime dad the story fascinated me. What happens if you don't love your own child... and they know it? Tilda Swinton not normally a favourite of mine is exceedingly good as Eva the mum uninterested in maternity. Gravid when she least wants to be she's careerminded out pops Kevin her little Damien. You know from the moment she refuses skintoskin things are not going to bode well. She has no idea how to deal with a baby. Her idea of subduing him is to stand next to a pneumatic drill to drown out his relentless screaming. Kevin grows up knowing he is unloved and demonstrates this through devilish behaviour towards Eva. Gradually Eva if not embraces motherhood then at least gets better at it. Perhaps this is due to her giving birth to her second child a girl who Kevin of course hates with a passion. Or maybe the idea of being a mum sinks in along with the realisation that a career is not the most important thing in life.Eva's betterments do nothing to placate Kevin he gets worse. Eva's attempts to complain are met with ridicule by the father John C. Reilly who thinks she is delusional. Years of unintentional but sometimes intentional neglect take their toll on Kevin and the film's tragic conclusion seems inevitable.The origin for Kevin's behaviour has polarised audiences. Did Eva create a monster by failing to form a bond early on? Should she have sought help from professionals if she felt she wasn't coping? Or was Kevin simply a bad seed an innately evil child who no one could have cured? Now that I've had the chance to reflect I think it's unfair to judge son or mother. I'd be surprised if Ramsay wanted audiences to do that. What would be the point? The film is a starkly brilliant exploration of a failed relationship and the consequences that has on a family and an entire community. If Swinton can win an Oscar so easily for her role in 'Michael Clayton' she should be celebrating her second win now. It's one of those performances which needs months of detoxification and psychoanalysis to move on from. Her acting is matched by newkidontheblock Ezra Miller who plays her lovelorn son. He brings to his role a controlled ferocity we are not used to seeing. His portrayal works apart from his firstclass acting because he's not the stereotype. To look at him you would say he was handsome and ingenuous. But looks are deceptive. It's hard for people to be repulsed by films nowadays but there are scenes which will shock. So rare is it to see this kind of film. They vanish as quickly as they appear. I implore you to see this if you can. You'll be moved if not entertained.www.moseleyb13.com".

	schema:headline " We need to talk about WriterDirector Lynne Ramsay";
	schema:reviewBody "I had been looking forward to this movie. Many film critics raved about it and it stars Tilda Swinton who had some role in getting the movie made. Tilda is a great actress and only appears in outstanding movies right? The subject sounded fascinating parents desperately try to compensate for the sociopathic behavior of a child who grows up to do something terrible. It is a great crucible for a story and gives us a chance to peer into the mind of such a person. It's a story that properly told should bring tears to any parent's eye.Sadly this movie was a major disappointment.It wasn't just bad. It was boring. The first half drags.WriterDirector Lynne Ramsay has this annoying habit of jumping between different timelines but the jumps are unconnected. This is not just confusing but she kept repeating the same scenes laboring the same points. It became tedious. I think Ramsay is trying to be arty but art is supposed to convey feeling. Instead this was boring and incoherent.After dragging through the first half the movie finally progresses but never lives up to its title. The parents never do talk about Kevin. Apart from checking his hearing as a toddler they never seek medical or psychological help or talk to a social worker. We never see a single teacher who over ten years you think might have noticed something. Relatives or friends who might comment on his behavior and could provide a better narrative than Tilda merely looking stonefaced are completely absent in this movie. Yes despite Eva Tilda's character being a travel author and adventurer she somehow has no friends. And even when Kevin pours caustic soda in his sister's eye and sticks the family pet down the waste disposal unit the parents still don't seek help. No family is this stupid particularly when the safety of another sibling is at stake.Books that sell tend to have solid stories so movies adapted from them don't have a problem with plot holes. Ramsay instead omitted many of the book's explanations and introduced the plot holes on her own accordShe has the townspeople vilifying Eva to the point she can't walk down the street without being slapped. But Eva lost her husband and daughter too. I don't think an entire town would be that heartless. If everyone hates her and she is that miserable there then why doesn't she just move? She goes from being a wealthy author in a huge house to living in a miserable shack with a menial job. Why? There is no explanation. I've assumed for this review that Kevin is a sociopath but you wouldn't know from the movie because they never go anywhere near these subjects.Ramsay appears to be squeamish or chose not to sensationalize the violence because there is very little blood and almost no violence. Those scenes where something does happen are so heavily edited you might not even realize it. The school massacre at the end of the movie is so heavily edited it looks like Kevin is standing in an empty stadium shooting arrows into thin air. At the end she finally does show Kevin's father and sister dead at which point I wondered why she edited the earlier violence to the point of incoherence. If you are making a movie about violence then be prepared to show it. If for whatever reason you choose not to then at least don't include the violent scenes with the violence cropped out of it. People either look or they look away. If they look they look at what is going on. By trying to do neither Ramsay's result simply ends up looking like bad camerawork like a wildlife documentary not filming the lion but the patch of grass 30 feet to the right of them.The book apparently gives a lot of background which Ramsay left out. In the book Eva resents baby Kevin for bringing an end to her adventurous lifestyle but the movie only hints at this. The truth is this happens to all parents and we deal with it. Likewise that baby Kevin's constant crying shows there something is wrong with him. Again this affects all parents. Again we deal with it. Why doesn't Eva ever talk to her mother who is supposedly just a phone call away? These sort of errors make me wonder if Ramsay has any children of her own or consulted parents when she was writing the movie.Some have praised the acting but I wouldn't. Tilda usually a great actress wears the same stonefaced expression. Ezra Miller looks mean and sneers but it would be unfair to blame the actors because they are given nothing to work with. I'm not sure if John C. Reilly is necessarily miscast as Eva's husband but there is no chemistry between Tilda and he.Except for the minor role of Kevin's sister the characters in this movie do so many stupid things it is impossible to empathize with them. This film is a missed opportunity. It had good source material a great actress and an intriguing concept. Ramsay should have spent more time on the story and less time choosing outofplace songs to play over Ms. Swinton's driving scenes.This movie's fatal shortcoming isn't that it is bad because even bad movies can be entertaining. It's problem is that it is boring. Special credit to film critic Mick LaSalle of San Francisco Chronicle who called this movie for the bore it is. Most other movie critics were taken in by it and praised it as art.".

	onyx:emotionText "I had been looking forward to this movie. Many film critics raved about it and it stars Tilda Swinton who had some role in getting the movie made. Tilda is a great actress and only appears in outstanding movies right? The subject sounded fascinating parents desperately try to compensate for the sociopathic behavior of a child who grows up to do something terrible. It is a great crucible for a story and gives us a chance to peer into the mind of such a person. It's a story that properly told should bring tears to any parent's eye.Sadly this movie was a major disappointment.It wasn't just bad. It was boring. The first half drags.WriterDirector Lynne Ramsay has this annoying habit of jumping between different timelines but the jumps are unconnected. This is not just confusing but she kept repeating the same scenes laboring the same points. It became tedious. I think Ramsay is trying to be arty but art is supposed to convey feeling. Instead this was boring and incoherent.After dragging through the first half the movie finally progresses but never lives up to its title. The parents never do talk about Kevin. Apart from checking his hearing as a toddler they never seek medical or psychological help or talk to a social worker. We never see a single teacher who over ten years you think might have noticed something. Relatives or friends who might comment on his behavior and could provide a better narrative than Tilda merely looking stonefaced are completely absent in this movie. Yes despite Eva Tilda's character being a travel author and adventurer she somehow has no friends. And even when Kevin pours caustic soda in his sister's eye and sticks the family pet down the waste disposal unit the parents still don't seek help. No family is this stupid particularly when the safety of another sibling is at stake.Books that sell tend to have solid stories so movies adapted from them don't have a problem with plot holes.

Swinton with her facial expressions and perfect body language is so incredibly affective and riveting as the desperate mother both while Kevin is growing up and when we see her life after the massacre. I have difficulty finding the words to express the emotions that her performance stirs as you see how much she suffers while not understanding how a mother could give birth to a child she doesn't love.Kevin played by three young actors who look so incredibly alike it's almost creepy is so compelling whether played by a toddler named Rock Duer a child named Jasper Newell or teenage Ezra Miller the mere presence of any incarnation of him on screen will make your skin crawl.The film is so very affecting because most cannot imagine a situation such as this yet the film is not supposed to be presented as a horror film. There is no supernatural evil at work here. I am sure this happens in real life hopefully with not such a shocking and truly gruesome outcome. You watch in horror as the lack of emotion from the mother is frightening yet when you see the actions of this child you cannot help but have empathy for Eva even though she almost comes across as unwillingly abusive at times. The film is set up in somewhat jarring flashbacks which really should have received an Oscar nomination for editing as you see a completely broken Eva dealing with the aftermath of her son's actions as she reflects on the upbringing of a child who grows into a person without feeling.No Kevin is NOT the feelgood movie of the year. In fact it is a difficult film to watch. You should not go see this film if wanting to leave the theatre with a smile on your face.

	schema:reviewBody "We Need to Talk About Kevin is certainly a movie that will be every  parent and wouldbe parent's worst nightmare. This movie gained a lot  of praise at the Cannes Film Festival and attempts to explore the  themes of society parenting and psychology.  Eva Khachaturian Tilda Swinton is a middleaged mother hated by her  community and struggling with the aftermath of a tragedy. Her  sociopathic teenage son Kevin Ezra Miller has committed a school  massacre and she has to deal with the results of the sins of her child  and explore how Kevin turned out this way in a dual narrative.  After being unable to make her version of The Lovely Bones Lynne  Ramsey turned to adapting this Lionel Shriver novel instead. She  delivers a haunting slowmoving film that looks at the personal and  social impact of the tragedy through one person's eyes as well looking  at the struggles of raising a troubled child. Ramsey made sure there  was a grim somber tone and kept a minimalist view of the world yet  still adds her own visual flair with intense slow close ups and red  imagery throughout the film to symbolise blood on Eva's hands.  There is a deliberately disjointed narrative throughout the movie  cutting from the present to the past as we examine Eva's inability to  bond with her son. Ramsey took the bold step to avoid showing any of  the actual massacre and most violence is committed off screen. We do  not need to see it to understand its impact on people. Nor did we see  Kevin's preparations for the massacre We Need to Talk About Kevin is  Eva's story not Kevin's.  But there is a major problem with Ramsay's approach to the story she  seems to ignore the entire concept of nature vs. nurture. Eva being  portrayed as a bad mother is outweighed by the way Kevin is shown as  practically the product of Satan's loins. Throughout the film Kevin is  always pushing his mother's buttons and made out to be evil from the  day he is born. There is no subtlety in his portrayal even with basic  things like reaction shots. We Need to Talk About Kevin should have  been more ambiguous because the whole point of the film is to raise a  debate. The audience is not meant to have a clear answer.  Swinton's performance was highly praised and she is worthy of an Oscar  nomination as her character Eva who starts off both as a woman at a  real low end and her struggles with a child she does not want. She is a  disaster of a mum to Kevin as a young child a child who tests her  patience. Swinton was able to bring real depth to her character. When  she does make the effort the damage is already done. Throughout the  movie Swinton plays a tragic and lonely figure who is isolated in some  form a character who is a shell of her former self.  Kevin is strongly played by two actors Jasper Newell plays Kevin as a  little brat pushing his mother with his behaviour and playing Eva and  his father John C. Reilly against each other. As a teenager Erza  Miller portrays Kevin with a sociopathic and nihilist outlook. He has a  sharp mind but enjoys inflicting pain on others including his little  sister wonderfully played by the young Ashley Gerasimovich. He is a  character who believes in nothing and takes a destructive path as a  sinister air is always around him.  Reilly plays Franklin as a normal suburban dad someone who wants to do  the right thing for his children. It was a wonderfully natural  performance of a man who just sees Kevin's behaviour as being typically  boyish. He is very deserving of a Best Supporting Actor nod for such a  believable performance.  There is a permanent chilling sense throughout the film thanks  Ramsay's low key direction and the power of the performance. This is a  film that should stick in your head but We Need to Talk About Kevin  should not have been so clearcut.".

And throughout I was anxious that because I had never had a child myself I didn't know what I was talking about and readers who were parents would catch me out.' As adapted for the screen by director Lynne Ramsay and Rory Kinnear this story becomes a terrifyingly realistic exploration of the subject of inherent evil and the manner in which we deal with it. The film is particularly timely as we read almost daily of youngsters killing classmates in schools across the country. But first the storyEva Khatchadourian Tilda Swinton is trying to piece together her life following the incident. Once a successful travel writer she is forced to take whatever job comes her way which of late is as a clerk in a travel agency. She lives a solitary life as people who know about her situation openly shun her even to the point of violent actions toward her. She in turn fosters that solitary life because of the incident the aftermath of which has turned her into a meek and scared woman. That incident involved her son Kevin Khatchadourian Ezra Miller as a teenager and Jasper Newell as a 6 year old and Rock Duer as a toddler who is now approaching his eighteenth birthday. Eva and Kevin have always had a troubled relationship even when he was an infant. Whatever troubles he saw Franklin John C. Reilly Eva's complacent husband just attributed it to Kevin being a typical boy. The incident may be seen by both Kevin and Eva as his ultimate act in defiance against his mother.Ramsay tells her story in bits and pieces of a collage of moments from the birth of Kevin to his incarceration. For some this kind of nonlinear story telling may be disconcerting but for this viewer it seems like a close examination of the mind of a mother who simply cannot believe she has birthed and is raising a child who is the epitome of evil. The fact that we are aware of something hideous that has happened from the beginning does not get in the way of watching the slow maturation of Kevin  first as a constantly screaming infant to a maliciously bad little boy to a viciously cruel and evil teenager with whom his mother cannot connect except for one very telling instance when she reads the young Kevin 'Robin Hood' and his arrows at which point Kevin shows a degree of affection for Eva. That moment proves in retrospect to be the nidus for the horror that lies ahead. Yet to say more about the story wound diminish the impact one the viewer. Tilda Swinton is extraordinary in her role as is Ezra Miller. The film. At least for this viewer is a powerfully disturbing one and a very fine insight into how evil deeds can happen. Grady Harp".

The mix of present and past just makes the movie unbearable boring. There are no real surprises at all. After the first 20 minutes it was perfectly clear what would happenhas happened. Then the situations with mother and young Kevin are just ridiculous. I'm working with children and have experience with more than difficult ones I don't expect a movie to be authentic in any way but Kevin's behaviour is just clich nothing more there is no deeper personality it's just black and white. Summing up the content I would say the movie has no point at all there is absolutely no tension the people harassing the mother after the killing pure nonsense. None of the characters is more than onedimensional this movie doesn't work in any way. At least this is my opinion and I wouldn't have written a review if there wasn't this incredibly high amount of stars something I don't understand in any way. Yes and I know giving one star seems to be just an angry reaction but that's not true I would even give this movie zero or minus stars if possible Because in relation to the money spent on it the usually pretty talented actors in other movies etc. wasted on this piece of crap  sorry but I think there is not a better fitting expression  this movie is beyond any proportionality.".

	schema:reviewBody "They certainly did need to talk about Kevin. I'm fine with difficult subject matter and ambiguous storytelling. But this film just seemed lazy in its search for answers. Tilda Swinton plays a mother that is haunted by something in her past. Her son is in jail the whole town hates her and her husband is no longer around. No prizes for guessing what is going on here. She tries to live a normal life but the town just wont forget the past. She looks at her past to see how her son turned into such a monster. The film angered me by dong nothing of note. Swinton is a terrible mother as she never seeks help for her son. I've seen kids misbehave but this film takes it so far. It comes across as some cheap Hollywood horror film. There is no way a sane woman wouldn't reach out or get out. Even when her daughter's safety is put at risk she does nothing. Then we have Reilly as the father. He believes nothing his wife says which makes me question why they are married in the first place. Even when Kevin acts out in front of him he he does nothing. Swinton also lives in the worst town in the world. The people are so horrid you'd probably want to massacre their offspring yourself. I understand the anger but this entire town is filled with vicious human beings. I was able to connect with one character in this entire film the boy in the wheelchair. Other than that you have a film of unbelievable stupid and cruel people. The acting is great and it's shot beautifully. I've already read up about the book which seems more cohesive and the narrative obviously works better than it does in this film.".

The young actor who plays Kevin as a teenager is very handsome with striking almondshaped eyes as if he had an Asian grandparenthe looks nothing like either of his ostensible parents.

	schema:headline " Gripping tale of guilt grief and shame";
	schema:reviewBody "'We need to talk about Kevin' is a tale of guilt grief and shame of a mother Tilda Swinton whose son Kevin Rock Duer Jasper Newell and Ezra Miller has committed an atrocious massacre at his school. Based on the acclaimed novel by Lionel Shriver 2003 and directed by Lyne Ramsey who has been missing from the movie horizon of recent years a powerful and excellently constructed piece of cinema is upon us.The storey encompasses the mothers' outlook on life before during and after the event. The use of a nonlinear time frame allows the film to be constructed in such a way that to those unfamiliar with the original text will be led in one direction of thought as to the characters progression only for the film to turn on its heels and lead you in another direction. The casting and acting is of paramount importance in a film where the primary relationship between two characters forms the basis of context for the others. Swinton offers an excellent drawn out confused guilt ridden mother whereas Ezra Miller as Kevin gives us an unflinching look into the abyss of a sociopath.The casting of as the father John C. Reilly for me was the only flaw simply due to his recognisable and somewhat comical appearance which when compared to the subtlety and nonobtrusive nature of the remaining cast and extras stands out although his performance was strong.Ramsey's use of symbolism and carefully inserted mise en scene gives those with a more discerning eye glimpses of the details of the emotional frailties evident in the novel but which are often so hard to convert when any literary text makes the transformation into the medium of film we all know the saying 'the book was much better'. But here the both Lynne Ramsey and Roy Kinnear develop an excellent screen play that will satisfy both those who have read the book and those who have yet to. The sequencing of opening shots in most scenes allows a strong sense of atmosphere to develop even before the characters have entered the scene or dialogue has even commenced.The overall impact of the film rides through peaks and troughs. With some sections brilliantly gripping and others making you wish away the remainder of the film. In general the film does carry a strong and unsettling momentum until the final credits. For those looking for an action soaked gore fest will be left waiting as will those looking for the docudrama styled film similar to Gus Van Sants' Elephant 2003. The film won't be for all or maybe even for that many but those who enjoy carefully layered cinema creations will be drawn to this title like a moth to a flame and with good reason.".

For two painful hours I was watching a freak tormenting his mother. Why? Who knows. We don't really see the characters developing the son is mean throughout the film the mother is putting up with it. It becomes annoying. Instead of trying to create boundaries and discipline her son she is too much of a pushover. Some reviewers blame her for not enjoying early motherhood but for me she was way too passive later on. A normal person will not have a 6 year old in diapers. Nobody talked about Kevin not enough not with each other not with the right people. Why didn't she seek a therapist's help? Didn't she have any friends? I stopped caring for her. And I never felt anything for the kid who was not slow but just manipulative psychopath. Also after the tragedy why didn't she move to another place where she wouldn't be recognizable? Doesn't make sense. And the flashbacks reveal the ending too early. 4 stars because I want to be fair to the people who worked on the film but had no say in the storycharacter development.".

The behaviour of Kevin as he progresses from toddler to teenager kudos for the superbly similarlooking actors involved is bad he seems to hate his mum love his dad and unless you're living on another planet you know he's going to turn into a Columbine high school type of assassin.So what is there to appreciate? The endless flashbackflashforward mode of storytelling works well because you know from the surroundings and from Tilda Swinton's demeanour costume and house which stage of Kevin's development you're watching. The acting is fine though I'm not convinced it takes all that much to play a whole film showing you're a malevolent devilspawn Kevin or a longsuffering endlessly patient mother Swinton.The big question is why should this interest any viewer? Well you could argue that you watch the whole development of the Kevin character except that he's a pathological piece of garbage from his earliest moments in the pram. You could watch the evolution of the mother except that Tilda Swinton doesn't evolve she just puts on number 3 face for the whole movie so you feel the occasional sense of relief on the rare occasions she does number 2 and smiles a bit face number 1 is reserved for other movies.The end result is tedium or fascination depending on your point of view. With apologies to all who tried so hard to make this a vivid fascinating account of the psychological background to seriously dysfunctional teenagers there's nothing in this film that is novel revealing gripping or inspirational. It's not a sleeper but it's light years from anything that will make you want to watch it again 2 months 2 years or 2 decades from now and that's a pretty good criterion for judging whether to see a film or spend the time on better things.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is praised as an attempt to understand the development of a sociopath who ends up committing a high school massacre. In this respect it succeeds mainly due to some good acting. But in other respects the film is disappointing we found it pretentious unconvincing and irritating.First there are too many scenes involving dubious eruptions of various red fluids supposedly to depict the mother's guilt feelings about recent bloodshed. These took up about 14 of the film starting with the long dream sequence at the start and annoyingly recurring every 5 minutes in the first half of the film.The opening dream sequence attempts some kind of surrealist street party vision. Unlike your average street party everyone is swamped in a sea of tinned tomatoes. They revel ecstatically in the the gunge especially the mother who is finally carried Christlike through the seething mess.Unfortunately this scene is unconvincing. The main emotion evoked is despair about the shocking waste of tinned tomatoes. Subsequently the flow of the film is far too frequently interrupted by scenes of mother painstakingly cleaning up loads of red stuff on her car  house as apparently dispatched by angry neighbours to make her feel even more guilty. Apart from the boring nature of these scenes it seems rather pessimistic to assume neighbours would act in this way since she was only the mother not the killer.Another mistake is that the ultimate deathly rampage around which the film is built turns out to be fairly tame by American standards. Unlike well known cases where the protagonist gains access to an arsenal of firearms the film portrays a watered down version in which his only weapon is a bow and arrow. A better film would have acknowledged the problem of firearms even if this was not the main theme. This bow and arrow plot line leads to further problems because the flow of the film in the final minutes is disrupted by questions about how a massacre could actually be accomplished with a bow and arrow. The final killing episode is confusing.There are other poorly depicted scenes in which the viewer is left wondering about issues that are not really worth wondering about. Such as Mother is inside the house on halloween. She is fearful of halloween troublemakers so we expect bricks to come through a window or something but no its eggs breaking on the fridge. So she left the windows open? No the windows were shut... Who cares.And another 10 minutes are wasted wondering what happened to little sister's eye. There's a strong suggestion big brother did it but we never know.From Tim  Brian Masque Haunt Film Club".

	schema:reviewBody "Paycheck 2003 is very underrated John Woo's solid action futuristic thriller that combines spectacular action sequences with a spellbinding mystery that keeps you guessing from beginning to breathtaking end. It is my John Woo's fourth personal favorite action film of his that I absolutely love to death. I know a lot of people don't like this movie because it is John Woo's movie and it is rated PG13 I love it. I love Ben Affleck his made some of his movies that are favorite mine like are Reindeer Games The Sum of All Fears Daredevil and of course this one Paycheck. Watching this movie I must say Ben Affleck can act and he gave one of his convincing acting performances I have seen. I have been from the beginning against his role Bruce Wayne  Batman which I thought they should have left Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy alone but now after I have seen him in this movie I must say if you gave Ben Affleck a good script he will acted terrifically.This flick is outstanding and Ben Affleck's character is well written and decent. Paycheck is a film that I feel is underrated I enjoyed the storyideas the 'writing your own future and then living the future you wrote after your memory has been wiped' aspect the cast I am a fan of Ben Affleck the 'SciFi' MacGyver aspect the action bits which were there. I love the story I love Ben Affleck's character that he is a computer engineer who is working for company's and after he is done they erasing his memories he later accepts the job by friends company signs a three year contract and starts working on something big. Three years later he thinks he won 92.000.000 but he is later doublecrossed and chased by FBI and ruthless mercenaries. He finds an envelope with 20 subjects who helps him out of the trouble. The film is filled with mystery around with what is all about. On the end of the film we found out it is about a time machine who can write a future and tells what will happened in your own future which Michael Jennings build. Now Michael has to race against time to go back where he started working on machine and destroy it before Jimmy Rethrick Aaron Eckhart re writes his future by destroying the world. About the cast a lot of actors in this film practically everyone in the main cast is connected to Batman in some weird way. Ben Affleck is the star of this movie and will be the next actor to portray The Dark Knight himself in Batman v. Superman Dawn of Justice this month. Aaron Eckhart plays the villainous Rethrick but in The Dark Knight he played Harvey Dent s TwoFace and if I may say he was incredibly underrated. Aaron played outstanding villain in this flick. Uma Thurman plays Rachel in Paycheck but we all of course remember her as Poison Ivy in the 1997 clunker Batman  Robin. Also Batman's love interest in The TDK trilogy is called Rachel. Uma Thurman was very likely in here and I liked her very much. I more remember her as the Bride in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol. 1  2 Mad Dog and Glory and of course I mentioned a failure Batman  Robin. Colm Feore played my favorite character Henry Taylor in 24 Season 7 he was outstanding as Rethrick's henchman Wolfe. I had no clue Michael C Hall  Dexter Morgan him self was in here as an FBI agent he was just awesome. The last one is Paul Giamatti who was Jennings friend he wasn't also annoying I love him! He only had three scenes and he acted perfectly. Honestly I dare to say Paul Giamatti is far way better actor than Rob Schneider is.Paycheck is written by short story of the same name by science fiction writer Philip K. Dick. I have enjoyed the action scenes the acting performances the chase on motorcycle was my favorite scene in the film. I love this movie and it is John Woo's fifth favorite action film of mine. This movie get's a solid perfect 10 score by me.".

	schema:reviewBody "Philip K Dick wrote many stories which seemed to have great film potential. I never thought of this as one of them.I have seen Ben Affleck in a number of films and felt that he was good in a few OK in most and positively annoying in some.I saw the horrible misleading trailers.The soundtrack was simply bad.So needless to say I went into Paycheck with very low expectations.... and I was pleasantly surprised.Affleck plays a talented reverseengineer who sees the possibilities in new technology and is able to carry it through to fruition. He takes on topsecret jobs and has his memory erased upon the completion of each. He decides to take on a project big and profitable enough to allow him to retire comfortably for the rest of his life. He completes the project goes through the memory erasure and then starts to discover what he has done and pursued by corporate hit men and the police tries to recover his memory. Uma Thurmond a biologist he had fallen in love with is one of the memories he wants to recover and also a target. Paycheck is more of an action film than a sci fi flick. The plot serves the action as do the somewhat onedimensional characters. And there is so little chemistry between Affleck and Thurmond that the romantic subplot is almost just a distraction. Despite these flaws I spent an evening being thoroughly entertained by this rehashing of the usual technologyrunamok  knowledgeispower story. This film is very Hollywood and uses a lot of slick and clichd camerawork but nevertheless tells a good story and does it well enough.".

Uma Thurmond a biologist he had fallen in love with is one of the memories he wants to recover and also a target. Paycheck is more of an action film than a sci fi flick. The plot serves the action as do the somewhat onedimensional characters. And there is so little chemistry between Affleck and Thurmond that the romantic subplot is almost just a distraction. Despite these flaws I spent an evening being thoroughly entertained by this rehashing of the usual technologyrunamok  knowledgeispower story. This film is very Hollywood and uses a lot of slick and clichd camerawork but nevertheless tells a good story and does it well enough.";

Paycheck is no exception hardly a surprise when you note it's from once beloved Hong Kong filmmaker John Woo who's quickly reaching Michael BayRoland Emmerich levels of notoriety in the U.S. with each regressive film.To be fair Paycheck isn't unenjoyable and it even gets off to a pretty good start. Set sometime in the near future there's not much of a noticeable difference with our present time except for a few elaboratelooking gadgets and computers. Ben Affleck stars as Michael Jennings a reverse engineer who's hired by major corporations to build products superior to all rival companies. Afterwards his memory is erased by a partner of his Paul Giamatti and he's given a large paycheck for his time and troubles usually the whole process takes about three months.His latest offer comes from an old friend of his Aaron Eckhart who promises an eightfigure deal at the end of the transaction. The catch is that the whole procedure will take three years. Despite some reluctance he agrees to the deal and when the three years pass by Jennings thinking he's a rich man is shocked to discover he gave up over ninety million dollars in favor of an envelope containing twenty everyday household items. Now he finds himself on the run from both the FBI and the company that hired him and must set out to discover what he built during those three years he's missing.Uma Thurman also stars in the movie as Jennings' girlfriend during that threeyear span but she factors so lazily into the picture she's obviously only in the film so that a Jennings can have a love interest and b he can also have someone to talk to about every little discovery he makes. Then again function b could have worked just as well with Giamatti but everyone knows a sexy chick is a better sell I have to put quote marks around sexy because Thurman looks positively haggard for almost every minute of screen time she's present I can't help but feel the much hotter Kathryn Morris would have done better in the role.There are two concepts in this movie that specifically intrigue me some moderate spoilers here the first one is choosing deliberately to erase your own memory but the notion is forgotten after the first halfhour. I was quite curious to know exactly what the process is like to the subject. Take for instance the fact that he lost his memory over the threeyear span. Does the last thing he remembers feel like a threeyear old memory or an event that happened just a second ago? Instead all we get is a halfhearted actually not even that much attempt at a sorrowful romance because he can't remember his girlfriend and she's not very happy about that.The other major scifi concept the ability to see into the future isn't explored with much more interest and it leads to a number of baffling questions. You see quite a few spoilers here it's revealed Jennings sent himself those twenty items because they can come in handy at a specific moment that'll help him survive or escape from a dangerous situation.But the thing is Jennings couldn't have known each item would come in handy unless he used the device he built at least twenty times because there's no way he'd know a motorcycle would come in handy if he never had say the bus ticket to escape from the FBI meaning he used the device to see what he needed to escape the FBI but still foresaw that he'd be killed in even more future events. That would mean this guy was originally destined to die or get caught in well over ten different scenarios i.e. he had the bus ticket to escape but if he didn't have the motorbike keys he wouldn't have gotten further and so on and so forth but this is never really addressed.By John Woo standards there's surprisingly only a modest amount of action in the film but at least the material is competently handled even if it's not entirely believable. What might work in movies that establish their characters as supercops with impeccable aims doesn't come off quite as well in action scenes that feature scientists beating up a large number of armed goons. But if you suspend disbelief the action scenes are pretty fun especially the motorcycle chase and the laboratory battle and coupled with the relatively fast pace keep the movie perfectly watchable despite the poor script and mediocre acting I never got into specifics but this is Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman we're talking about.When all is said and done Paycheck is a wasted opportunity and is never as memorable a mixture of science fiction mystery and action as Minority Report but it's likely to do the trick for undemanding fans of any of these genres. If you expect more well you'd do best to remember this is John Woo we're talking about not Steven Spielberg.".

Yet another of the many recent adaptations of a Phillip Dick story Paycheck' begins in the present day a strange choice on the part of the filmmakers actually for in this film's view of 2004 the technology for memory erasure seems to be in full swing and widely accepted perhaps the producers didn't want to have to deal with the expense or bother of creating futuristic designs for their sets and costumes.  The majority of the story however takes place in 2007 after Jennings wakes up' from a threeyear stint working on a secret project about which he can remember nothing.  The trouble is that things haven't quite worked out the way Jennings planned as he finds himself the quarry of both the FBI and the organization for which he was working.

In fact a number of scenes actually elicit a few unwanted giggles so ludicrous and overthetop are the setup and execution. Director Woo past master of action spectaculars is clearly working on autopilot in this film.   There isn't much to say about the acting either.  Although Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman  as the woman Jennings fell in love with during the three years but whom he can no longer remember  do their best with the characters assigned to them neither is given much chance to expand beyond the stereotypical confines of their respective roles.When it comes to all those involved in this film I suspect that Jennings isn't the only one here working solely for the paycheck.".

After every job his memory is wiped back to the moment he started the job.  When he is offered a massive payday to do a threeyear job for friend James Rethrick he accepts.  Next thing he knows it is three years later and the job done. He goes to collect his money but finds that he has waived his right to it and replaced it with a package full of strange objects.  When he is set up with the FBI he goes on the run and realises that the objects are all clues or aids in his mission  a mission that he himself has arranged.There's nothing quite like a good action movie that allows you to accept whatever the plot is as it presents good solid action.  This film almost manages it and it is ironic that the concept from Dick is what weakens it. The plot is a bit of a stretch but once you accept it you can move on  like FaceOff once you get the idea and accept it you can enjoy the action. However with Paycheck you are only left alone for 10 minutes before you have to accept the stretched plot all over again.  Every time an item perfectly fits a situation you have to accept the whole concept over again.  The problem is that the items are far too specific.  With the lottery number strip it works however with the paperclip and the bullet it is too much of a stretch and took the enjoyment off the action a bit.Happily it is only a bit.  The plot as an idea works pretty well but has been done better elsewhere Bourne Identity and Total Recall for example it is presented too full of holes that appear with the slightest picking.  It would have been much better if the items had been bigger in terms of meaning rather than very specific e.g. the lighter and hairspray bigger clues and so on would have been better.  However the action is still pretty good not quite classic Woo but full or good touches.  The film has a good steady pace to it and it keeps it up for the majority  very quickly getting through the set up and jumping to three years hence.  The action is enjoyably slick and makes good use of effects true some of the set ups in the scenes is stretched and some of the stuff about the weapons is just dumb a fired bullet with it's casing a bullet being fired by a thick piece of metal etc however if you can accept the plot then I imagine accepting that Woo often takes style over substance shouldn't be a problem.The cast is soso despite having a surprising amount of famous faces. Affleck is better than usual because he is quite ordinary he plays an everyman pretty well and it is easy to see him as a normal' guy.  Eckhart is reasonably good but he has limited screen time. It's good to see him in big films like this as he is an interesting guy but I hope he doesn't just turn off his skills.  Giamatti is in the film briefly and is OK comic relief but Thurman has been miscast.  She does most of the film pretty well but her early scenes as an expert biologist are laughable she is so inept!  The support cast features a really good turn from Feore as well as good roles from Morton and the wonderful Hall  although the roles are practically cameos.Overall this is an enjoyable little action movie but it is ironic that the story is both interesting and the film's weak point.  The items are too specific and each time Jennings uses one it forces the audience to accept the unlikely premise all over again.  Worth seeing for enjoyable action delivered by a director who recovers some of his form here.".

	schema:headline " Minority Report meets The Bourne Identity meets... hack producers and plain bad writing";
	schema:reviewBody "First let me debunk the myth that this is an awful movie as I keep reading  because it has some interesting albeit unoriginal notions and it often executes them well. More importantly it will generally keep you interested by navigating futuristic concepts in a fastspinning pace that will unable you to yawn or look at your watch. Secondly in spite of its technologicallyridden science fiction premise Paycheck does not fall prey to the fatal style over substance crime because it at least tries which is more than I can say for its peers Equilibrium The Island etc.So the effort is at least there and 13 into the film you feel that things are really wellsewn together when the plot starts unfolding. Then it completely falls apart. This is understandable because it's pretty offthewall Michael Jennings is an expert engineer hired by highprofile corporations for a reverse engineering technique which usually takes about 34 weeks depending on the task  then his memory is wiped clean and he receives a big paycheck. Well this process tears on him and when the opportunity for a bigbudget 3yearlong job presents itself as the last job Michael takes it. He also meets a girl during this time called Rachel an unusually roughlooking Uma Thurman. With a clean slate post the completion of the job Michael discovers that he has declined the paycheck and left an envelope for himself filled with clues as to what happened in the past  and what lies ahead in the future.It may sound intriguing but because this was originally written as a SHORT story by Philip K. Dick all the characters are completely unexplored flat and downright uninteresting. It does not help that Ben Affleck botches through the story with his usual puzzled look that only ever seems to fit in Kevin Smith productions. Thurman also inhabits a truly badlywritten role here and the banter between her and Affleck is selfreferential in the most cringeworthy way they quote their sappy first meeting etc. They also mostly resort to meaningful glances to convey their love. That's the central performances for you and sadly the ONE character that could have saved the others from the mud is Michael's buddy Paul Giamatti. Unfortunately he fades quickly and is later only ever used as a comedic sidekick to make up for the lack of clever things to say.If you do not mind halfhearted acting from the leads and perhaps you are only interesting in seeing this because it's a John Woo movie then you will also be disappointed because there is little of Woo's dynamic adrenalinepumping Mexican standoff laden martial artsspinning action in this story. I remember one motorcycle chase that took me back to MI2 and strangely also The Bourne Identity in which Matt Damon is being chased while on the search for his identity postamnesia but it was lacking in oomph there is also a brief Woolike faceoff on the subway tracks between Affleck and the key henchman but this is the most daring John Woo will allow himself to get  the rest of the time he blindly follows the standard formula for modern scifiaction fare. In other words Affleck looks at an item in the envelope has a startling revelation sets out knowing exactly what to do and when to do it being effortlessly aided by conveniently appearing objects and doors  then some henchman interrupts him.I think this is one of those films that continuity spies could OD on because the plot really is thinner than an Olsen twin. For example how could Michael be such an expert genius engineer if he keeps on erasing any technical information post completion of a work task? He'd have to start from scratch every time. You just have to look past the stupid goofs the flat characters the mediocre acting and the safe action if you want to enjoy Paycheck 2003  but then... there is not much left. 5 out of 10".

Secondly in spite of its technologicallyridden science fiction premise Paycheck does not fall prey to the fatal style over substance crime because it at least tries which is more than I can say for its peers Equilibrium The Island etc.So the effort is at least there and 13 into the film you feel that things are really wellsewn together when the plot starts unfolding. Then it completely falls apart. This is understandable because it's pretty offthewall Michael Jennings is an expert engineer hired by highprofile corporations for a reverse engineering technique which usually takes about 34 weeks depending on the task  then his memory is wiped clean and he receives a big paycheck. Well this process tears on him and when the opportunity for a bigbudget 3yearlong job presents itself as the last job Michael takes it. He also meets a girl during this time called Rachel an unusually roughlooking Uma Thurman. With a clean slate post the completion of the job Michael discovers that he has declined the paycheck and left an envelope for himself filled with clues as to what happened in the past  and what lies ahead in the future.It may sound intriguing but because this was originally written as a SHORT story by Philip K. Dick all the characters are completely unexplored flat and downright uninteresting. It does not help that Ben Affleck botches through the story with his usual puzzled look that only ever seems to fit in Kevin Smith productions. Thurman also inhabits a truly badlywritten role here and the banter between her and Affleck is selfreferential in the most cringeworthy way they quote their sappy first meeting etc. They also mostly resort to meaningful glances to convey their love. That's the central performances for you and sadly the ONE character that could have saved the others from the mud is Michael's buddy Paul Giamatti. Unfortunately he fades quickly and is later only ever used as a comedic sidekick to make up for the lack of clever things to say.If you do not mind halfhearted acting from the leads and perhaps you are only interesting in seeing this because it's a John Woo movie then you will also be disappointed because there is little of Woo's dynamic adrenalinepumping Mexican standoff laden martial artsspinning action in this story. I remember one motorcycle chase that took me back to MI2 and strangely also The Bourne Identity in which Matt Damon is being chased while on the search for his identity postamnesia but it was lacking in oomph there is also a brief Woolike faceoff on the subway tracks between Affleck and the key henchman but this is the most daring John Woo will allow himself to get  the rest of the time he blindly follows the standard formula for modern scifiaction fare. In other words Affleck looks at an item in the envelope has a startling revelation sets out knowing exactly what to do and when to do it being effortlessly aided by conveniently appearing objects and doors  then some henchman interrupts him.I think this is one of those films that continuity spies could OD on because the plot really is thinner than an Olsen twin. For example how could Michael be such an expert genius engineer if he keeps on erasing any technical information post completion of a work task? He'd have to start from scratch every time. You just have to look past the stupid goofs the flat characters the mediocre acting and the safe action if you want to enjoy Paycheck 2003  but then... there is not much left. 5 out of 10";

Ben Affleck does a very credible job playing a man that finds the secrets of new technology out for big paychecks and then has his memory erased. He is offered a huge amount to do just that but lose three years of his life in terms of what he remembers. Well the film picks up quickly after the three years and Ben Affleck has been played foul by his employer or someone. The science fiction aspect is very involved but presented in a pretty comprehensible style. The film chronicles Affleck's collection of simple every day items that have been sent to him by  himself  and each has a purpose he must soon discover. Director John Woo mixes lots of gritty sometimes overblown action sequences here and thereespecially at the end but they only enhanced the suspenseful nature of the film. The film works primarily because of its thoughtful engaging script and the adequate acting of Affleck Aaron Echhart Colm Feore sultry Uma Thurman and always humorous Paul Giamatti. The profoundalbeit somewhat lost in the actionlesson in the film's end resonated strongly for me and had me thinking about my future and OUR future here on planet Earth. If a film can do that it can't be all that bad in my book. The film is based on the science fiction writing of Philip Dick a great mind and perhaps a soothsayer to what lies ahead for all of us.

Ben Affleck plays Michael Jennings a pretty suave computer engineer who hires out to various technology companies seeking to improve their product. His work is so promising that they require that his memory be erased I suppose so as not to leak trade secrets. With the expectations of a lavish paycheck Jennings is willing to give up three years of his life to work on a top secret project. Except when the project is complete and the memory erased he runs into the snagbeing out of cash and on the run from a fleet of wild gunmen hired by the company.It's a good story and one reminscent of a good 50s episode of the Twilight Zone. You'll even notice some old noir camera effects such as Jennings staring into a mirror with the camera at a cocked angle as he tries to figure out his dilemma. The story is also reminscent of Memento in that a person with no memory who has left himself clues must solve the mystery.I was reluctant to find good in this movie before I had even seen it because of two reasons Ben Affleck and John Woo. John Woo though working with a good story lays on thick those couple of minute action scenes with everyone coming so darn close yet so far away from getting their heads chopped off by flying cars and all that mess. It really wasn't pivotal to the story nor to the mood but understandably it is the director's trademark. Ben Affleck was pretty much inconsequential in his role as Michael Jennings playing the same charming nice guy character he always portrays in nearly every role he's been in. Uma Thurman as Jennings girlfriend and Watson to Jenning's Sherlock got some cheers from the theater as most of her quick kung fu leg work and perfectly timed reactions manages to knock out a few of their armed adversaries. But despite the flack that Affleck gets or misdirected Woo's which is pretty much any John Woo film...at least according to Homer Simpson this is a pretty good science fiction story. Especially given that somewhat undermined but valid examination of the technology race and what it could mean for the future of mankind.".

To protect his client's confidentiality Jennings agrees to have his memory erased but after a highly paid topsecret assignment for the shady James Rethrick Aaron Eckhart Jennings is awoken to discover that he has forfeited his paycheck. In return he receives an envelope of seemingly meaningless items which may well later become integral to his survival. Jennings must discover what he has been working on in the past two years before his memory was erased and why he's been accused of murder but time is not on his side and he must piece together the clues he left for himself before the Feds or his former employer catch up with him. Paycheck starts promisingly as an intelligent story with intriguing fastpaced action but unfortunately the chase becomes relentless and the action tedious as the characters remain underdeveloped and the script underwritten. Based on the work of scifi writer Philip K. Dick Paycheck doesn't live up to other cinematic adaptations of his works such as Blade Runner or Total Recall and Dick's warped and paranoid futuristic world is unrealised in John Woo's underdesigned future. This film is ultimately a disappointment which falls short of the intriguing story promised by its trailer but nevertheless it is a better than Affleck's and Woo's respective disappointments with their previous projects Gigli and Windtalkers. On the other hand Uma Thurman has taken a backward step after her success with Kill Bill by playing such as diminutive role as Rachel the 'plant biologist' even if that is an asskicking bitch of a plant biologist. This film is at times completely unoriginal borrowing and in some cases completely ripping off other recent films such as Memento Minority Report and Die Another Day. Paycheck is ultimately rescued by its chase scene into which Woo crams cars motorbikes helicopters and a few well placed discarded pipes topped off with a few explosions Woo shows us why he's still one of the best action directors and although this film isn't bad enough to demand your money back its not one to remember either. 35".

Then Affleck the reverse engineer is hired for a topsecret assignment and when he's finished his memory is wiped clean.  After he remembers nothing he's being chased by everyone and he can't remember why. Ok the movie NEVER explains Ben Affleck's character! They make him out to be the smartest person in the world that every company needs to build them something.  They stick in a random scene looked like a Daredevil outtake of him stickfighting in a gym to give him some credibility when the action starts.  So now he's the smartest guy in the world and he fights like a superhero.  So aside from not explaining anything the movie is so far fetched and ridiculous at times it's funny. Last but not least I figured I'd be ok since John Woo directed this movie.  Boy was I wrong.  The action was weak very little gunplay although the chase scene was decent.  With all of John Woo's trademarks this movie had nothing. no good gun fights no dramatic slowmotion shots no flying boats no action.  Although there was the slowmotion shot of the birds flying towards the camera.  This movie is not worth the price of admission.".

Like other later John Woo films it is a lot less bloody than his Hong Kong films and his earlier Hollywood films.Ben Affleck plays Michael Jennings an engineer who makes a living hiring himself out to companies for a set time then having his memory wiped so that he can't recall any classified information. After one such contract he is shocked to find that before having his memory wiped he had declined his payment of almost 100000000 he has no idea why he would do something so insane nor does he know why he has an envelope which appears to contain junk rather than the personal items he was expecting to get back. Before he has time to figure out what is going on he finds himself in FBI custody. He manages to escape though using some of the apparent junk in the envelope. He still doesn't know why he is being chased or how he knew what to give himself. As he struggles to come to terms with what is going on he meets up with the girl friend he has forgotten about and teams up with her to return to the site where he'd been working.As one would expect from a John Woo film the action is done in a very stylish way the acting is also decent. There where a few parts I wasn't so keen on during the main fight seen a robotic arm is used to disarm an assailant in an overly cute way and the final scene seems tacked on and unnecessary. Over all though its an exciting film that can be watched by most ages.".

This movie has everything that one can expect from a scifiction action thriller which carves it way beautifully during its course. The reviews have unnecessarily demeaned and underrated this movie and has spread badword which is not at all deserved by the movie. The movie revolves around a protagonist Micheal Jennings an reverse engineerBen Affleck who does Technical Jobs for various organizations and whenever he's done with his work his memory is wiped out within that period and he gets a handsome paycheck in lieu of his services. The Twist comes in the movie when a billionaire James Rethrick Aaron Eckhart offers him a new assignment that would take 23 years of his life and memory. The movie comes to a leap where in it has been shown that the assignment is finished and Jennings comes into the real world only to find out that he has given up all of his paycheck in exchange of some offerings i.e 20 Items which would help him in situations to come. The main plot here is that he was working on Machine that enabled him to see his future and he saw that he will be killed by Rethrick. So to survive he beautifully engineers his way out of this situation where FBI Cops Rethricks men all are running behind him. This movie do have some lapses but it scores on strong vision of director good performances and gripping plot. This is a breathe of fresh air for a scifi fan and should be appreciated.".

I saw this movie at the 10 PM showing at our local theater tonight along with my wife and maybe at the very most 15 other people and not counting the one couple that left out in the first 20 min of the movie saying what a yuk movie. Those two things should have told me something right there!!  I can really say this is one of the most boring and dull movies I have seen lately to be a so called Action movie. It did indeed have a few minutes of actual very exciting chase scenes that could actually make you think it truly was an action type film in those precious few minutes but it was short lived and so late in coming it was too late to salvage the boring beginning of the story. I actually had to nudge my wife several times during this movie just to keep her awake long enough to know anything about what was going on in this complicated nightmare of an action movie. That itself is indeed a very rare occurrence as she loves movies as much as I do and unless a movie is absolutely terrible would never doze off in a movie. I am also not going to be a Ben basher but I must say this is not a movie seemed to really be best suited for him as the leading role. He just seems to lack the excitement of a true action actor.  Uma was also a really bad choice as well for the leading lady for this movie in my opinion. Her face looked like it had been cooked in a deep fryer around her cheek area and she looked like she was about 1520 years too old for the part. What was up with all that?  I hardly even recognized her at the first of the movie had it not been for the short blonde straggly hair and her voice. This movie really was so boring during the first half of the movie that most people would have been asleep by the time the real good stuff even started what little of it there even was of it. I kept thinking it was going to improve early but it was almost to the end of the movie before anything of notable mention even began to transpire. I really wished several times during the movie I had made a different choice for a flick to see for my weekend out but maybe next time I will not go with my instinct to see an action movie just because it was played up to be just that. Like I said before save your money on this loser and wait until it hits the cable box and don't even waste the cost of a PPV as it won't be a longlived feature there either. At it's very best I would rate this movie a 4 out of 10. Kars".

	schema:reviewBody "Paycheck is a very poor film. It has a weak story and was poorly written and plotted. It also has unremarkable actor direction or action. Paycheck is based on a short story by Philip K. Dick. Some of his stories have turned into good films such as Blade Runner Total Recall and Minority Report but also some turkeys have also been made like Next and this film. I have only read one Philip K. Dick novel The Man in the High Castle which was a good read.The story of Paycheck is Michael Jenkins Ben Affleck is an engineer and offered the chance to work on a secret project for millions of dollars.

This first problem with the film was that Jenkins was working a machine that could see into the future and he used it to see into his future and therefore the audiences knows he is in no real danger. The second problem is that is there is no explanation throughout the film. In the film they show that in the future there was going to be a war between a multinational company and the United States. There is no reason to this or any other plans from the villains which leaves massive plot holes. An good writer would have learnt not to do this from day one.

Ridley Scott Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg all had grant epic visions about the world Dick would have set his books whilst Woo choose to set the film in a contemporary world that did not fit with the story. The scifi element was played down but the action in the film was poor which was Woo's speciality. Woo hasn't made a good film since Faceoff in 1997. The casting was also poor for this film. Ben Affleck is a poor actor and I have enjoyed watching his acting career decline from Armageddon to Pearl Harbour to Daredevil to Jersey Girl and Smoking Aces'. He has now turned to directing which will be interesting. Uma Thurman was pregnant during filming and this was clear. She is also a very hitandmiss actress and I believe that it was only Quentin Tarantino that has got the best out of her.

Paycheck is based on a short story by Philip K. Dick.

The Rounders  The TV Series ran in the 1966 and 1967 seasons not a bad run considering the two leads were replaced by younger less seasoned actors including Patrick Wayne as Howdy Lewis not only do we see Glenn Ford and Henry Fonda as the stars of this rollicking epic but as a bonus Peter Ford and Peter Fonda sons of the stars appear in uncredited roles.The production if it can be said to have a weak spot suffers from Disney Disease  that bogushomespun touch which afflicted Disney's Wonderful World of Color's series of outdoor documentaries in which announcers with wrinkly familiar old voices narrated carefullyedited wildlife documentaries in which little baby animals hardly ever got caught by predators. Fortunately the screenwriter played off of this ambiance for laughs so that the overall feel is something like Mister Roberts Goes West. Fonda Howdy Lewisand Ford Ben Jones work well together on screen as a pair of itinerant halfclever cowboys who seem always to get the worst from every deal they make with Jim Ed Love. Both actors spent time with the novel apparently and their performances benefited from the extra work. This compensates for clumsy special effects clumsily faked double takes from the plughead horse who is the bane of Howdy's existence for example.But The Rounders' main failing is also its saving grace  an artlessness which makes the show much more enjoyable to me anyway than if it had been a little more polished. It earns a solid eight out of ten points for a great offbeat Western comedic style. The Rounders may just be the last good OLD Western movie the genre lay in a restless unquiet coma with brief flashes of lucidity and a few unlamented electric westerns until Clint Eastwood and a handful of other talented directors brought it back to vibrant life. But The Rounders is a valedictory for all of those great westerns and all the notsogreat ones that were worth having anyway that Henry Fonda Glenn Ford Chill Wills Edgar Buchanan Denver Pyle and all the rest of those guys gave us.".

All of this including the small town parade rang really true. I absolutely fell in love with the horse all over again he should have had top billing.

A very risqu scene for the time takes place as Ford and Fonda cleverly hide the girls bare derrires using their cowboy hats as they manoeuvre their way through a crowd. Chills Wills Edgar Buchanan and Denver Pyle along with other characters help to round out this very amusing western comedy.

There's wonderful scenery and a terrific music score by Jeff Alexander that underscores the humorous and the pastoral moments equally well.The cast is fantastic. Ford and Fonda are very well matched as Ben and Howdy. Chill Wills is hilarious as smooth talking Jim Ed Love. Edgar Buchanan is marvelous as Vince the friend with two eligible daughters Joan Freeman Kathleen Freeman and a stash of homemade booze. Denver Pyle Doodles Weaver and in the last quarter of the picture Sue Ane Langdon and Hope Holliday as a couple of cute strippers stranded in Sedona all add to the fun.

Filmed in MetrocolorPanavision the vistas are superbly photographed by Vogel with Arizona locations including Coconino National Forest Red Rock Crossing San Francisco Peaks and Village of Oak Creek. The stunt work is high quality well shot by the wily Western movie veteran Kennedy while Alexander's musical compositions have the desired jolification. Rounding off is a splendid and comforting support cast that sees Denver Pyle joining Buchanan and Wills for further Western genre reassurance. 710".

Filmed in MetrocolorPanavision the vistas are superbly photographed by Vogel with Arizona locations including Coconino National Forest Red Rock Crossing San Francisco Peaks and Village of Oak Creek. The stunt work is high quality well shot by the wily Western movie veteran Kennedy while Alexander's musical compositions have the desired jolification. Rounding off is a splendid and comforting support cast that sees Denver Pyle joining Buchanan and Wills for further Western genre reassurance. 710";

Did you take a good look at the blaze faced roan each time it was ridden casually versus when it was a bucking bronco? I'm sure it was two different horses. The mild mannered horse was a solid brown color and when it was going berserk it always had a dusty gray look to it. At first I thought that was the idea having him kick up enough dust to make it look like it was affecting his coloration. But then about the middle of the story Ben Glenn Ford and Howdy Henry Fonda are making their way up to the high country and Howdy remarks how different the horse's disposition can be at different times almost like two different animals. To which Ben replies You could say that with a wry smile. That's what clinched it for me.Well as for the rest of the story this was a bit of a slow mover for me. Having been long time partners I didn't get a real good sense of Ben and Howdy being buddies very much any charisma between Fonda and Ford just didn't seem to come across. A lot of it seemed tired to me making it appear more like a B Western with big names rather than an A list production. In fact it wasn't much of a Western either come to think of it but a story about aging horsemen who use their skill and experience to make a buck before blowing it at the end of each season.Even more lamentable was that scene with the pair of valley girls the duo tries to help out when their car breaks down. I guess the script called for them to play it dumb because they sure played it dumb. Following that 'hats behind the behind' scene I'm kind of grateful the girls didn't get to do their Snakes of Love act I can only imagine what that was all about.Well far be it for me to suggest you shouldn't watch this flick because if you're a Fonda or Ford fan I guess you could find this somewhat entertaining. This is where I get to paraphrase Fonda's character when he'd say something like 'Whatever suits you would just tickle me plum to death. I'll have to leave it at that.".

Sure it's corny at times and melodramatic at others but who cares? It's a delicious soap opera with fun performances a strange musical number and clever usage of public domain music check out the rockin' version of The Old Gray Mare!.Of the many cast members the standouts are Marianna Hill as the French girl Gaby and the divine Gail Hire as Holly McGregor.  Ms. Hire was described by one critic as a juniorgrade Paula Prentiss.  I was going through a major Paula Prentiss phase at the time I saw the movie so I was completely captivated by Ms. Hire's Prentissian performance although her voice reminds me of Barbara Stanwyck's.But really this film is just brilliant.  I love the dialogue the interactions of the characters and that they all live at the Holiday Inn. The use of the Inn creates a sense of community and along with the presence of the Prentissian Ms. Hire links this film with Where The Boys Are.A mustsee film!".

Too Hawks loved cars studied Mechanical Engineering at Cornell raced cars after college and made the racing film The Crowd Roars 1932 giving him the opportunity to work with Cagney and wrangle a Deusenberg for himself from the Deusenberg company in exchange for product placement. In a sense both films are indulgences which never translate into a coherent picture.RL7000 comes off a bit more like a Roger Corman film than a Hawks film probably due to budgetary constraints. We see lots of young unknowns dancing loud music interludes of unevenlyacted drama interspersed with bouts of frenetic action. Caan is a good brooding Bradoesque study though he squints and smirks to distraction Marianna Hill looks great and seeing cars like Cobra Daytonas is pretty enjoyable for mid60's sports car fans. Ultimately the film has problems because Hawks doesn't get what he wants out of the actors. All of his other films have very strong acting Hawks could always get great performances from Wayne Grant Bogart as well as the veteran character actors he used. He didn't have such luck with most of the primary cast of three men and three women. Their bonding as lovers and as male and female groups is integral to the credibility of the film and it just doesn't happen.Another possibility explaining the film's weakness is that this is the only one of Hawk's final six pictures Rio Bravo to Rio Lobo without writer Leigh Brackett on the team.One also senses that Hawks tried too hard to be hip perhaps in reaction to the fact that some critics had complained that his previous picture Man's Favorite Sport? seemed oldfashioned. Thus the plot is periodically suspended for some truly bizarre song and dance numbers even by mid60's standards. It seems inconceivable that Wildcat Jones was given us by the same Hawks who gave us the immortal Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend number.I want to like this movie since I do subscribe to the school that a great director can never make a truly bad film. I also happen to love Man's Favorite Sport? which often critically lumped in with RL7000 as the two offthetrack films between a pair of WayneHawks collaborations before and after. Furthermore there are some vocal critics who love the film such as Robin Wood. So I guess I need to watch it a few more times and hopefully can write a better review next go around.".

But I also noticed that Marianna Hill Gabby seem like she was a substitute for Brigitte Bardot and Laura Devon Julie as Nancy Sinatra.I like the movie even though it was full of clichs and all too typical of most racing movies. I like looking at the race footage. I remember many of the races and knew the full background of the races and accidents shown in the movie. I like the movie because it showed real production based race cars racing. The same makes and models my neighbors owned. If you like NASCAR this is a movie worth seeing.

But I also noticed that Marianna Hill Gabby seem like she was a substitute for Brigitte Bardot and Laura Devon Julie as Nancy Sinatra.I like the movie even though it was full of clichs and all too typical of most racing movies. I like looking at the race footage. I remember many of the races and knew the full background of the races and accidents shown in the movie. I like the movie because it showed real production based race cars racing. The same makes and models my neighbors owned. If you like NASCAR this is a movie worth seeing. If you are looking for AFI top 100 films this is not the movie for you.";

It's corny at times and melodramatic at others but it's fun and highlighted by some truly bizarre dance numbers including clever usage of public domain music be on the look out for the rockin' rendition of The Old Gray Mare.The picture is generally considered to be one of Hawks' worst films if not THE worst but it's redeemed by the dynamic chemistry between James Caan and Marianna Hill who plays a French girl. Caan displays the intensity and talent that would make him one of the better actors of the early 70s. And Hill's performance on par with other memorable Hawks discoveries Lauren Bacall and Angie Dickinson makes you wonder why she didn't become a bigger star before fading into obscurity. Particularly notable are Hill's two lusty dancing sequences at the nightclub and later at the Holiday Inn Pepsi machine as Caan observes her from afar.If you're not familiar with the incredibly gorgeous Marianna Hill she played Dr. Helen Noel on the original Star Trek episode Dagger of the Mind from 1966 1st season. Believe it or not Hill was arguably the MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN to appear on the series which is saying A LOT in light of the fact that Star Trek is highly noted for it's overabundance of stunning beauties. She appeared in NUMEROUS television shows throughout the 60s and 70s e.g. Batman Kung Fu Bonanza Mayberry RFD etc. and also quite a few films like Elvis' Paradise Hawaiian Style 1966 Clint Eastwood's High Plains Drifter 1973 and even STARRED in the underrated atmospheric horror flick Dead People aka Messiah of Evil 1973.BOTTOM LINE Hill and Caan redeem Red Line 7000 and make it a mandatory purchase or viewing. The film should have focused exclusively on these two characters and gotten rid of everybody else ! yet even with its weaknesses Red Line is still more intriguing than the more popular mid60s race drama Grand Prix. Unfortunately the film is only available used on VHS for WAY too much money. Hopefully it will be released on DVD some time soon! Allow me to close by repeating MARIANNA HILL IS IN THE FILM!".

	schema:reviewBody "Clearly Howard Hawks was not at the top of his game when he made Redline 7000 1965 with James Caan John Robert Crawford and Skip Ward. This tirescreecher ranks as one of the worst movies that the director ever helmed. This rubbermeetstheroad NASCAR saga pits racers against racers both on and off the asphalt and racers against women. Although he has the leading role James Caan hardly qualifies as the leading man. John Robert Crawford runs a close second as a rival NASCAR driver raised in poverty who refuses to follow in the footsteps of his humble father and grandfather to eke out a living off the land. Finally Skip Ward is an internationally acclaimed driver making his transition from the European to the American racing circuit. Little about these three protagonists is charismatic and they behave like louts. The women who fall in love with them love them unconditionally no matter what they have done. One driver loses a hand but he recovers to drive another day with two metal clasps on his left hand. Another driver comes close to killing a rival when he jams him up against the wall of the racetrack and the car soars off the track to crash beyond the course with an explosion. Things might have been marginally better if Hawks had cast celebrity Hollywood actors rather than these unknowns. John Robert Crawford never made another movie after Redline 7000. Morever the racers aren't somebody that you'd want to share a drink with because they aren't that likable. The relationships that they share with the nubile dames are as melodramatic as a soap opera. Spinout scenarist George Kirgo spent most of his career toiling in television rather than the movies. He has penned dialogue that is neither quotable nor catchy. Interestingly another scripter who worked on this movie was Steve McNeil whose sole cinematic credit is Hawks earlier effort Man's Favorite Sport. According to Hawks a movie was good if it had five strong scenes. Redline 7000 doesn't have a good scene. The pacing is off too. Star wattage registers at the dim end and the virtual anonymity of the cast serves to heighten this quality. They spent most of their time on interior sets reciting dialogue that is pretty dull. Most of the NASCAR racing footage looks like it was shot with a regular camera. The characters and most of the situations amount to clichs. It is still difficult for me to believe that Howard Hawks helmed this halfbaked hokum.".

The dialogue is uncomfortable and often downright bad and the whole soap opera plays out rather disappointingly. Like most racing films it shows great promise but winds up well off the pace.

It starts out with the 1964 Daytona 500 and it was so neat to see the cars on the pace lap before starting the race which in real life was rather dull unless you're a Richard Petty fan... The only problem is that the racing footage is far and away the strength. Most of the rest of it is garbage! The best part of the nonracing football is a young lady in a club singing a song about a racing driver complete with the sound of a racing car at the beginning. To me this movie was dull between shots of the racing footage. One part I remember is one of the women on top of a guy in bed saying Tell me what a sexy woman is! I find it rather odd that she doesn't know what one is... Like I said the racing footage is good but you can get films of races for that. Don't waste your time on this turkey. You have better things to do!".

	onyx:emotionText "I saw this film several years ago. The racing footage is great. It starts out with the 1964 Daytona 500 and it was so neat to see the cars on the pace lap before starting the race which in real life was rather dull unless you're a Richard Petty fan... The only problem is that the racing footage is far and away the strength. Most of the rest of it is garbage! The best part of the nonracing football is a young lady in a club singing a song about a racing driver complete with the sound of a racing car at the beginning. To me this movie was dull between shots of the racing footage. One part I remember is one of the women on top of a guy in bed saying Tell me what a sexy woman is! I find it rather odd that she doesn't know what one is... Like I said the racing footage is good but you can get films of races for that. Don't waste your time on this turkey. You have better things to do!";

Here goes John J McLaughlin wrote this Hitchcock screenplay based on Stephen Rebello's book Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho which was based on the filming of the Psycho screenplay from Joseph Stefano which was loosely based on Robert Bloch's book which was based on the real life crimes of Ed Gein. Whew! It's kind of interesting that Alfred Hitchcock is hot again. His Vertigo recently displaced Citizen Kane as the alltime greatest film. HBO is still running their recent production of The Girl which is based on Hitchcock's making of The Birds and his unhealthy connection to Tippi Hedren. And now we get this Hollywood production supposedly based on the master of suspense. I saw supposedly because this film plays like it was written by the heirs of Alma Reville Hitch's long time wife and collaborator. We all knew she worked on his films and contributed ideas but the film wants you to believe she was the real genius behind the public genius.The movie is entitled Hitchcock and is based on the making of Psycho but in fact it's more the story of Alma and her husband. While there is nothing wrong with that story ... in fact it is quite interesting and entertaining ... it's just kind of false advertising.Helen Mirren portrays Alma and instead of the mousy woman who usually faded into the background we see a fairly strong and talented woman who goes toetotoe with Hitch in her best scene. Sir Anthony Hopkins dons some facial appliances and a fat suit and does a solid job of capturing the odd creepy leering disturbed insecure genius we recognize as Alfred Hitchcock. He comes across as louder and more inmotion than what we have previously seen. And while director Sacha Gervasi makes it clear that Hitch is not a normal guy he doesn't dwell too much on the blond fixations.The emphasis on the skills and importance of Alma would be fine were it not so exaggerated. Surely every great director and writer and artist has a muse andor support system and there is no question Alma was a very talented lady but her strength here bordered on distracting to the overall picture. Especially needless was the storyline of Alma being attracted to screenwriter Whitfield Cook Danny Huston who wrote Strangers on a Train for Hitchcock.The Hitchcock humor is allowed to shine through and his battles with Paramount Studio head Barney Balaban Richard Portnow and the censorship board Kurtwood Smith are excellent. Hopkins finds the humanity under the fat suit and is especially good in his work with Scarlett Johansson as Janet Leigh and Jessica Biel as Vera Miles. I also got a kick out of James D'Arcy as the affected Anthony Perkins and all his quirky mannerisms.Though this barely qualifies as a story on the making of Psycho it was chilling to watch the addition of Bernard Herrmann's iconic score added to the shower scene. In fact Danny Elfman does a nice job of subtly adding a Herrmanntype score to this film. I'm not sure if the film will play well with real Hitchcock aficionados but if you can forgive the Alma slant it's actually quite interesting and entertaining and kind of a sweet film at its core.".

	schema:headline " Best When It Focuses on Psycho Rather than Hitchcock's Marital Relations";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1960 famed director Alfred Hitchcock released Psycho the film to which his name would be more associated than any other film in his heralded career. In the new biofilm Hitchcock Psycho is the backdrop for the story between the proclaimed 'Master of Suspense' and his wife and muse Alma Reville.Directed by Sasha Gervasi Anvil The Story of Anvil the film stars Sir Anthony Hopkins as the oddshaped director and Dame Helen Mirren as his wife Alma. We pick things up in 1959 and Hitch's Just call me 'Hitch'. You can hold the 'cock' introduction to the story of serial killer Ed Gein. Hitch had just released North by Northwest starring Cary Grant and he was fascinated in the story of Gein that was the inspiration for Robert Bloch's novel Psycho.Hitch aggressively pursued the optioning of the story and began to adapt it as a theatrical release. But Paramount Studios to which Hitchcock was employed was not eager to bring the gruesome tale about a transvestite and his murderous relationship with his dead mother to the big screen. Even with Hitchcock's clout he had already released over 40 theatrical films by 1959 was not enough to sway studio bosses and Hitchcock eventually had to finance the film himself and mortgage his home in an effort to get the film into production this risky move proved lucrative as Hitchcock earned an estimated 15 million by fronting his own money for 60 of the gross profits.The film takes us through all aspects of the production of the film from financing through casting from fights with the ratings board through the limited release of the film in only 2 theatres nationally.But at the heart of the film is the relationship between Hitch and his wife Alma. Hitch is hardly represented as a caring and understanding sort. Hopkins plays him as an arrogant demanding sod who wanted to control over his leading ladies as her secretly admired his blonde actress hires unprofessionally in his private office. He was a heavy eating heavy drinking auteur that never won an Academy Award despite such revered films as Rebecca The Birds and Vertigo having been crafted by his immense talent.Alma on the other hand is portrayed as the 'wizard behind the curtain'. She helps guide Hitchcock through his film journey's doing rewrites on scripts and providing directorial and production support. All the while Alma is always pushed out of Hitchcock's limelight. And with Hitch's increasing jealousy over Alma's time spent with writer Whitfield Cook Danny Huston coupled with the financial burden of financing the film the relationship between the two hits troubled water.Director Sasha Gervasi works off a screenplay by John J McLaugnlin based on the book Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho by Stephen Rebello and a good portion of the film is fascinating stuff. It's like watching a liveaction movie about a makingof feature you would watch on a Bluray disc. From the casting interviews with Anthony Perkins played dead on by James D'Arcy and Janet Leigh Scarlett Johansson to how Hitchcock didn't want to use music during the infamous shower scene but was convinced by his wife and the editors or how upon first cut of the film or how the test audience which consisted of suits agents and censors loathed the film and its violent content the peak behind the closed set doors was captivating viewing.Unfortunately when the film sways away from the production it is less involving. Hitch and Alma had a collaborative and sometimes combative relationship but their affection for each other was the least interesting part of the film yet the most consuming.There is a great supporting cast that includes Jessica Biel as actress Vera Miles Ralph Macchio and Toni Collette and the look and feel of the era seems captured earnestly. But the movie is squarely on Hopkins' shoulders who at times looked odd though the makeup effects. There are times that he loses himself in the role we loved Hitch acting like a Maestro outside the theatre as he listened to the audience's screams. But there were a few times that we could have imagined Hannibal Lecter uttering the scripted lines.Our overall response to the film is warm and it deserves a recommendation. Back in 1959 there were no documentarians or a team of staff videotaping behindthescenes action for a potential Bluray special feature. So it was nice to travel back in history and have documented some of the events that lead to one of the most popular horror films ever made. And for that we are grateful.www.killerreviews.com".

It's like watching a liveaction movie about a makingof feature you would watch on a Bluray disc. From the casting interviews with Anthony Perkins played dead on by James D'Arcy and Janet Leigh Scarlett Johansson to how Hitchcock didn't want to use music during the infamous shower scene but was convinced by his wife and the editors or how upon first cut of the film or how the test audience which consisted of suits agents and censors loathed the film and its violent content the peak behind the closed set doors was captivating viewing.Unfortunately when the film sways away from the production it is less involving. Hitch and Alma had a collaborative and sometimes combative relationship but their affection for each other was the least interesting part of the film yet the most consuming.There is a great supporting cast that includes Jessica Biel as actress Vera Miles Ralph Macchio and Toni Collette and the look and feel of the era seems captured earnestly. But the movie is squarely on Hopkins' shoulders who at times looked odd though the makeup effects. There are times that he loses himself in the role we loved Hitch acting like a Maestro outside the theatre as he listened to the audience's screams. But there were a few times that we could have imagined Hannibal Lecter uttering the scripted lines.Our overall response to the film is warm and it deserves a recommendation. Back in 1959 there were no documentarians or a team of staff videotaping behindthescenes action for a potential Bluray special feature. So it was nice to travel back in history and have documented some of the events that lead to one of the most popular horror films ever made. And for that we are grateful.www.killerreviews.com";

As Alfred decides his next film will adapt the lurid horror novel Psycho by Robert Bloch  but the novel's inspiration haunts his dreams  including the series killer Ed Gein Michael Wincott  then Alma finally loses patience . The film mainly deals with filming Psycho  Hithcock masterpiece and his most accomplished and perfect movie . Psycho was not only Hitchcock's biggest successful moviebut was a phenomenon in its own right  the picture is a magnum opus of the terror genre and its immediate impact and its future influence was enormous and cannot be over emphasised . It also concerns on the relationship between Hitch and his wife Alma Reville  perfectly played by Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren respectively . Helen Mirren had met the real Alfred Hitchcock when he approached her for a part as a murder victim in his penultimate film Frenzi 1972  Mirren turned down the role a decision she later regretted. Although many reviewers criticized the film for inventing an intimate relationship between Alma Reville and Whitfield Cook the facts are documented by more than one Hitchcock scholar as exemplified by Patrick McGilligan in his biography of Alfred Hitchcock. There are developed various scenes about Psycho shooting as when Marion Scarlett Johansson as Janet Leigh leaves her fiance and heads with her car toward California  when is caught in a storm she leaves the highway and enter to Bates hotel . The hotel with twelve rooms and 12 showers is managed by a strange young named Norman James D'Arcy as Anthony Perkins who seems to be submitted by his overbearing mother . The shower images are well recreated  these scenes are one of the most studied copied and analysed sequences in cinema history and has obtained a notoriety what exceeds of the movie itself. The character of Ed Gein was included in the original screenplay. In subsequent drafts the role of Gein was either eliminated completely or reduced in importance. Terrific acting by Anthony Hopkins as Hitch and sensitive performance by Mirren as Alma  in fact  this movie is a perceptive homage to a great screenwriter  and Hitch's supporter  Alma Reville . The movie has a fine support cast playing notorious characters who had an important role on Hitch films such as Jessica Biel as Vera Miles  Toni Collette as Peggy Robertson  Michael Stuhlbarg as Lew Wasserman  Ralph Macchio as screen writer Joseph Stefano  Wallace Langham as Saul Bass  Paul Schackman as Bernard Herrmann and Spencer Garrett as George Tomasini . Nice production design  as scenes set in Alfred Hitchcock's Paramount suite of offices were filmed in Hitchcock's actual office on that studio's lot. Colorful as well as evocative cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth . Lively and atmospheric musical score by Danny Elffmann . The picture was well directed by Sacha Gervasi  it was shot in 36 days with exquisite taste and intelligence by the master Hitchcock who makes an impeccable control of every scene and maneuvers your emotions infusing with a deliciously wit and ironic".

	schema:reviewBody "While I enjoy watching historical biopics I don't like the ones that mess with the facts especially when the subject matter is a favourite of mine. Hitchcock has long been a favourite director so I awaited with interest this film which depicts him as he devises and shoots the legendary PSYCHO.Unfortunately what Hollywood ultimately delivers is nothing more than an exercise in feminist revisionism and that's all down to Helen Mirren who play Hitch's wife. Apparently Mirren refused the role at first as it lacked 'meat' and 'importance' thus a number of spurious  and ludicrous  angles were added to the movie to better accommodate her. According to this film Hitch's wife directed part of the movie inspired her husband and came up with the best ideas all of which is complete nonsense of course and a bit of an insult to the great director himself.Aside from that the film isn't bad so it's a pity that the huge flaws stopped me from enjoying it it's more fantasy than realist. Anthony Hopkins is a nice fit for Hitchcock but I found his prosthetics to be too distracting and unrealistic and after all there's only one Hitch. The supporting cast is better with Scarlett Johansson as Janet Leigh Michael Wincott as Ed Gein Kurtwood Smith as a censor and Michael Stuhlbarg as an executive really standing out.".

	onyx:emotionText "While I enjoy watching historical biopics I don't like the ones that mess with the facts especially when the subject matter is a favourite of mine. Hitchcock has long been a favourite director so I awaited with interest this film which depicts him as he devises and shoots the legendary PSYCHO.Unfortunately what Hollywood ultimately delivers is nothing more than an exercise in feminist revisionism and that's all down to Helen Mirren who play Hitch's wife. Apparently Mirren refused the role at first as it lacked 'meat' and 'importance' thus a number of spurious  and ludicrous  angles were added to the movie to better accommodate her. According to this film Hitch's wife directed part of the movie inspired her husband and came up with the best ideas all of which is complete nonsense of course and a bit of an insult to the great director himself.Aside from that the film isn't bad so it's a pity that the huge flaws stopped me from enjoying it it's more fantasy than realist. Anthony Hopkins is a nice fit for Hitchcock but I found his prosthetics to be too distracting and unrealistic and after all there's only one Hitch. The supporting cast is better with Scarlett Johansson as Janet Leigh Michael Wincott as Ed Gein Kurtwood Smith as a censor and Michael Stuhlbarg as an executive really standing out.";

Also incorporated into the storyline is the love story of Alfred and his wife. And the strain the picture was putting on it.I had high hopes for Hitchcock. Alfred Hitchcock may not be my favorite director but he was most defiantly light years ahead of his time and undeniably a genius. On top of that Psycho is one of my favorite films ever made. So far this film was shaping up to be fantastic it appealed to me in all the right ways trailer was good Anthony Hopkins as Hitchcock and it was about the making of Psycho. To which aspiring filmmakers as well as the average movie goer can really appreciate. So why only a 710?Well the film delved too deeply into the love story I personally think. The film is very enjoyable and to that aspect of the film I don't mind as much as you may perceive but withholding that aspect and indulging on the actual making of Psycho could have really benefited this film. It's not the film Hitchcock or Psycho fans will love it will be a film where you walk out and remark that was good but not a very solid good. And normally I would be inclined to agree with you but for some reason I still did like this film.It contains fantastic acting including Hopkins albeit certain scenes he may have overacted a tad bit it's interesting and is enjoyable. In addition it also contains great references albeit not very subtle the complete opposite of subtle to Psycho and a few other Hitchcock films which work to its advantage in my opinion. I also rather liked the inclusion of Ed Gein and the conversations that took place between him and Hitchcock.Basically this film will appeal to everyone. But unfortunately it isn't the film it could have been or should have been but ultimately it is enjoyable funny and above all entertaining. If you're a fan of Hitchcock and Psycho though don't get your hopes up too high.".

Alfred Hitchcock Anthony Hopkins the famous Hollywood director looks for his next project after North by Northwest and when he decides to adapt the novel Psycho he does not take any other considerations. Of course his wife Alma Reville Helen Mirren is his right hand person and after some convincing decides to help him making his new film. While making the film we see all the problems during the production which included financing marriage issues and also relationships between cast members of the film.The film does not focus much on the production of Psycho which especially present when the film tackles the famous shower scene which took seven days to film and that scene in the film felt like an afterthought for how short it was. The film presents Hitchcock as a very flamboyant man as he strolls across rooms but also how he talks to everyone around him. The relationship between Alma and Alfred is great but some other plots that come from their conflict just did not work well for me. I was not convinced in how this hard production affected Hitchcock because the only thing that seemed to affect him was the many hallucinations he had of the famous murdered Psycho was based on this was very boring to watch in the film for me. Makeup is important to making Hopkins look like Hitchcock and it is awful making him look like a fish at times and was the most horrible thing of the film.Anthony Hopkins plays the legendary director Alfred Hitchock and his performance overall was bad for me. He is the centre point of the film so the film fails mainly due to the performance Hopkins gave. From his choice of voice but also posture it is not what I imagined Hitchcok being and along with many other actors in the film he just does not work. Helen Mirren plays Hitchcock's wife Alma Reville and she is best in the film. Mirren provides her usual fire to the character and as a strong women who does not feel defeated Mirren gets to say what she wants and when her character finally tells Hitchcock how it is Mirren performance in that scene comes to a high. Scarlett Johansson plays Janet Leigh and she along with every other supporting character is wasted. She has the most screen time of the supporting players but still she is not given much to do but be pretty for Hitchcock to watch and put through a scare.This film along with HBO's The Girl are really bad attempts at making a film about Hitchcock because they try to make him the villain to the level where we cannot like him for the decisions he makes. Toby Jones was a better Hitchcock but Hitchcock was a better film due mainly to the performance given by the great Helen Mirren.MOVIE GRADE D MVP Helen Mirren".

	schema:reviewBody "Hitchcock is a mix between a Hitchcockian thriller a comedy a biopic and a romantic drama. And I'm pretty sure that explains the negative reactions to the film. I agree that it's a strange mix but it works with what they are going for. Wanting to focus on the marriage between Alma Reville and Alfred Hitchcock a romantic biopic can be dry so staying true to the spirit of the legendary director the film throws in some wry humour and frames it all with the tone of a thriller.It's 1950 and Alfred Hitchcock wants to make Pyscho. Studios are wary his wife is losing patience and the battle to get it made could be worse than the subject matter. His longtime actress Vera Miles Jessica Biel is being relegated to supporting status and isn't happy about the lack of respect from Hitchcock. Meanwhile Hitchcock is ready to cast his new film and is going to turn Janet Leigh Scarlett Johnasson into a star. One would assume his wife would feel maligned from that but she's off trying to forge her own career with screenwriter Whitfield Cook who Hitchcock thinks is a hack.The film's main purpose appears to just be entertaining. Which is all good but the rather poor reception is because it could have used some depth into the interesting innerworkings of Hitchcock. At times it comes off as a superficial caricature but the man was a legend because there was so much more to him. Anthony Hopkins appeared to be exactly like Hitchcock both physically and linguistically. He got his sly and comedic mannerisms and phrasing perfect. Which fits the entertaining and humorous frame for the picture.Personally I think director Sacha Gervasi used the right cues to make it feel like a Hitchcockian thriller. Throwing in references of his desire for the gruesome throwing in references to The Birds and making us think there might be a wicked twist coming. The twist is just that Hitchock could be just a comedy  the material is ripe for that.".

Which is all good but the rather poor reception is because it could have used some depth into the interesting innerworkings of Hitchcock. At times it comes off as a superficial caricature but the man was a legend because there was so much more to him. Anthony Hopkins appeared to be exactly like Hitchcock both physically and linguistically. He got his sly and comedic mannerisms and phrasing perfect. Which fits the entertaining and humorous frame for the picture.Personally I think director Sacha Gervasi used the right cues to make it feel like a Hitchcockian thriller. Throwing in references of his desire for the gruesome throwing in references to The Birds and making us think there might be a wicked twist coming. The twist is just that Hitchock could be just a comedy  the material is ripe for that.";

If this was meant to pay homage to the Master of Suspense a documentary would have been better than a selfish rather dubious portrayal. It isn't a portrayal it's a parody.Anthony Hopkins usually a great actor focuses so much on perfecting Hitchcock's distinctive voice and mannerisms that it kills the artifice. Hopkins looks like he gained weight for the role but I never once thought I was watching Hitch. I was always conscious of Hopkins playing Hitch  playing him rather badly. Hitch's wit is compromised because Hopkins delivers his lines very theatrically. Hitch never uttered his witty quotes quite as emphatically he did so matteroffactly and it was up to you to detect the wit. The film has the same central pitfall as Spielberg's Lincoln the plot is too thin. Here the entire film is about Hitch's battle to get his most famous and most successful film Psycho made resistance from Paramount forced him to finance it himself. Toni Collette adds nothing in her unrewarding role as Hitch's secretary. Then again neither does Michael Wincott as Ed Gein's phantom meant to represent Hitch's inner voice.The biggest insult to Hitch's memory is that the film doesn't even agree that he was a genius. It implies all the way through that his tolerant and assertive wife Alma Reville Helen Mirren was the true genius. It says she did the directing  both of Hitch's films and of Hitch  while Hitch succumbed to alcoholism and comfort eating. The film becomes a story of the great man in front of the even greater woman. As much as I enjoy watching Mirren I am noticing a decline in her standards. Maybe she knows she has nothing left to prove. I get the impression when watching her on TV interviews with much younger guests that she's in denial about her age. In a scene she shares with Scarlett Johannson who is delightful as Janet Leigh Mirren is supposed to act jealously as Hitch fawns over her. Her envy is so credible that you realise she might not be acting in that moment.This is a tawdry and cynical reminiscence of Hitch's insecurity about becoming a fading star despite dazzling audiences with a string of classics including North by Northwest Vertigo and Rear Window. Hitch felt enormous resentment for not ever winning a competitive Oscar and being recognised for his genius why wasn't this story shown? Why is he being denied his due credit even in death?".

	schema:reviewBody "Going into Sacha Gervasi's Hitchcock I was contemplating the recent wave of interest in the man Alfred Hitchcock and his work. But that's just it is the interest in Hitchcock recent or has it always been present? With the new HBO biopic the fact that Vertigo is now considered what one could call the official best movie ever made and the wealth of buzz Gervasi's film has received within the last few months can we assume that the interest of Hitchcock is a simple trend or did he bring something to the table that has been and will continue to be eternal? All I can say is the film had me at good evening and held me to the final good evening. This is a luscious engaging and darkly satisfying portrayal of the master of suspense as he fights the uphill battle of filming producing and releasing Psycho the iconic sixties horror film that revolutionized the genre with its cutting edge suspense and at the time gruesome and famous shower sequence.Anthony Hopkins does not play but embodies the title character showing beneath the invaluable publicity media attention and film reviews that he is a sensitive selfdoubting and struggling auteur who is subject to the idea that since he has made so many films when will his downfall begin? Right after the premiere of North by Northwest in 1959 people questioned if the man had the energy and the power to continue making films at the unheard of speed he was previously doing. He could've easily just quit while he was ahead.But he didn't he managed just a year later to make and produce one of the finest examples of subversive horror that the film industry ever knew. This was a price he vigorously paid for having to mortgage his own home and almost lose his marriage in the process. He begins reading Robert Bloch's Psycho and gets the idea to adapt it into a feature film despite knowing the battle it would be to get it financed distributed and entirely released to the public. He takes the risk and shoots the film into production.Meanwhile Alma Reville Hitchcock's wife portrayed whimsically and poetically by Helen Mirren begins a stable friendship with writer Whitfield Cook Danny Huston who gives her pleasure reassurance and attention. While their gettogethers remain genial and sexless Hitchcock himself doesn't know that and because of it assumes that his wife is having an affair but hardly has time to think what with perfecting sequences involving actress Janet Leigh Scarlett Johansson and dealing with the heavyhanded MPAA representative Kurtwood Smith.Hopkins is worthy of an Oscar nomination along with Mirren delivering a splendidly macabre witty and brash performance of the man so many admire. Rarely this year have we been blessed to see an actor get so into character with a realistic performance of an iconic figure with one of the notable exceptions being Daniel DayLewis in Lincoln and have so much fun doing it. Mirren on the other hand has a more serious role giving us a warmly and delightfully devoted woman who tries to feel every emotion her husband does. She finds this incredibly difficult especially when Hitchcock begins having conversations and interactions with serial killer Ed Gein in his dreams.In some cases Hitchcock feels a bit too broad in some cases not perfectly emphasizing parts in the man's life such as previously marriage difficulties if any and sometimes almost teeters back and forth between goofy satire and cheeky homage. Yet it's the performances the smooth and sometimes beautifully redvelvet cinematography the oldHollywood vibe and the depiction of how confined and strict the censorship regulations were that make this film truly a fun worthwhile endeavor.Starring Anthony Hopkins Helen Mirren Scarlett Johansson Jessica Biel Michael Stuhlbarg Toni Collette Ralph Macchio Kurtwood Smith and James D'Arcy.

	schema:reviewBody "I was lucky enough to see this in the theater in the United States when it first came out. I had seen a few Shahrukh Khan films on tape thanks to a friend and when I noticed Devdas in the online movie listings I decided to go have a look at what would be my first Hindi film in a theater. I was the only Anglo in a packed house and I aroused as much curiosity as I felt.I was completely blown away by Devdas from the first moment of the opening credits to the last bitter tear on Paro's cheek. Every shot every frame of this film is like an artist's canvas. Aishwarya Rai is breathtakingly gorgeous Madhuri Dixit's quiet beauty increases with each scene and Shahrukh has never looked so good. All the supporting actors are incredible particularly Jackie Shroff as Chunibabu and Kiron Kher as Paro's mother.The sets and the costumes are fabulously opulent...almost too fabulous in fact and at times threaten to overwhelm the story. But I was far too enthralled in the theater to do anything but gasp in openmouthed wonder and enjoy.The story of Devdas a famous Indian novel written in the 1920's by Saratchandra Chattopadhyay has been made into film numerous times by Bollywood. It is about the spoiled son of a wealthy man who is loved by Paro his lower caste neighbor and childhood playmate. Devdas is a weak aimless sort who is blown about by destiny never taking action until it is too late. He is unable to recognize his love for Paro until she has been married off to an older man and is lost to him forever. He then turns to the bottle and to the prostitute Chandramukhi for comfort and forgetfulness.This story will probably be hard for westerners to relate to...there is no corresponding literature of the west that I can think of...perhaps Romeo  Juliet is closest. Bhansali's version differs in many respects from previous versions and from the book in that Devdas is a more forceful presence who declares his love for Paro only to be kept apart by scheming family members. In the novel however it is Devdas' own flawed character that keep the lovers apart. He is simply too weak and indecisive to know what he wants until it is taken away forever.Having seen the earlier Dilip KumarBimal Roy version and read the novel I can say that Shahrukh Khan truly made the character his own and breathed a new life into Devdas making him more lovable and more a victim of fate than of his own tragic weakness. In the novel and in the earlier Bimal Roy film Devdas has almost no personality at all...he moves through the story like a mere shadow and we only see his character reflected in the love of the two women who worship him.Much attention has been given to Aishwarya Rai for her performance which I agree was outstanding. She is almost inhumanly beautiful in this film. When I saw this in the theater I was in half love with her myself.But it was Chandramukhi who haunted me after the film was over. Madhuri Dixit deserves much much more attention than she has received for her wonderful performance which has been relegated to a supporting role when actually her role is every bit equal in importance to that of Paro. Chandramukhi is the only character in the film who is completely unselfish in her love...her love is the purest of the three because she loves with no expectation of being loved in return. While Devdas and Paro are busy destroying each other's chances for happiness Chandramukhi's love is always uplifting and positive.Besides the awardwinning performances Devdas swept all the Bollywood popular awards in 2003 and the fabulous sets and costumes Dedas has one of the best music scores I've ever heard and dance numbers to match. I wished the opening number Mere Piyar performed by Rai could have gone on forever and toward the end Dola Re Dola performed by Dixit and Rai is a treat. Some viewers felt that the upbeat drinking song Chalak Chalak performed by Khan Shroff and Dixit was out of place in such a dramatic story but it is my favorite number in the movie.There are so many things to recommend this film I could go on but I will just call it a masterpiece of Indian cinema and leave it at that.".

Aside from its theme the film making process was awesome including the costumes the cinematography the direction camera angles. Imagine the number of hours the extras worked their beep off to dance in sync. Even the soundtrack was perfectly tuned to help set the mood of the movie and hearing Paro Aiswarya Rai's character sing for her love lost for Devdas Shahrukh Khan on her wedding day was enough to make you burst into tears.The actors chosen were perfect for their roles as they portrayed it with such heart wrenching gut you could almost feel their sorrow along with them. I was particularly surprised how Aishwarya Rai pulled off her biggest acting role todate thereby quashing any doubts on her previous beauty queen title. Shahrukh Khan once again proves why he is the reigning king of Bollywood playing a heartbroken alcoholic pining for the love of his life who's been married off to another man. Madhuri Dixit was equally wonderful as the beautiful courtesan who played her role with such empathy that I couldn't help but feel sorry for her and wished Devdas would eventually reciprocate her feelings for him. Jackie Shroff has never disappointed and was excellent in his supporting role as Devdas 'brothel' companion. All in all the cast ensemble of this movie is one of the best in cinema history.This movie is also a perfect and spectacular introduction to first timers of Bollywood movies into the lives and culture of IndianAsian people in general. How in this modern and civilised world old traditions and values still hold dear in certain communities and whilst it is not the most favourable of beliefs it is the age old cultural practices that makes one culture unique to the other.Yes no movie is perfect but Devdas almost does it so watch it with an open mind. Being Asian myself I dare be bold and say this is better than 'Gone With The Wind'.".

I thought it was simply wonderful rich vibrant and full of colour. I couldn't recommend it enough for someone who wants to see what all the fuss is about Bollywood. The story is Romantic and timeless a spin on Romeo and Juliette if you will. The story unfolds through song and dance sequences that feature beautiful women who do not need to expose themselves to be erotic. The humour in the film for me came when Devdas started speaking like an English gent in the middle of an argument with his father...very amusing view on the Western world! Anyway as I said I would encourage anyone with an open mind to have a look at this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "DEVDAS 2002 is a beautifully mounted romantic melodrama based on a popular Indian novel published in 1917. When I first read about the film and its enthusiastic reception at Cannes I had high hopes that this might become the first Bollywood film to cross over to arthouse audiences in the U.S. While watching it however it became clear that the classconflict narrative would be a tough sell these days with its supremely overwrought tale of parental disapproval family honor unrequited love and two beautiful women's complete and utter devotion to an irredeemably dissipated man who is left with nothing. It's also more deeply rooted in Hindi culture than the other Bollywood movies I've seen and would most benefit a viewer who had more than a passing knowledge of it. In comparing DEVDAS to MOHABBATEIN 2000 and TAAL 1999 the other Bollywood musicals I've seen I would cite a few Hollywood parallels. DEVDAS is like a Jeanette MacDonaldNelson Eddy MGM musical of the 1930s e.g. MAYTIME 1937 with which it shares some surprising similarities to MOHABBATEIN's SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS or TAAL's BYE BYE BIRDIE. When I saw MOHABBATEIN I also thought of WEST SIDE STORY and GREASE.I enjoyed MOHABBATEIN and TAAL much more but I was still gripped by DEVDAS and its high romantic expression of love through song dance and incredibly rich poetic dialogue. It's a powerfully oldfashioned film which is not necessarily a bad thing.".

Whole scenes are missing!!!! Luckily I watched the Hindi version first. It is far superior in that it is complete plus it looks better. I did need the English version to iron out some of the plot  although a couple of the scenes that I needed translated had been cut.

It was also a parable of class and almost feudal divisions something which the Indian subcontinent is still struggling to get over.This is where the production values of Devdas destroyed the essence the story for some reason perhaps because he had a budget that was unprecedented in Indian cinema director Bhansali decided to go opulent in every facet of the the production. Paro's family who in the text is a working class family lives is a mansion on their own right in the film. I found it hard to empathize sympathize with any of the character's logic about lower class versus upper class because the production made them all more wealthy than 99.9 of the population of India! It puts an elitist spin on the entire film and I really didn't appreciate it.Devdas is not a story that deserves opulence it is a dark personal tale. It's spaces are small and internalized almost claustrophobic. The character of Devdas is continually drawn inward and he brings everyone he loves down with him into his abyss. What we are given instead is a wide open canvas something more fitting for an epic battle between nations not hearts.Some might argue that Devdas is an exercise in escapism but what the novel was about was escapism in an entirely different spectrum. Alcoholism is indeed escapism but in the worst possible way. So is class discrimination. If Bhansali really wanted to create an opulent epic worthy of his budget and production team he should have chosen a subject such as the Taj Mahal or the life of the Nizam. What he's given us is a high gloss finish on a rough and tormented subject a very ill fit indeed.And on a side note I found it funny that the entirety of Chandramukhi's village was lit by 10000000 candles.

	schema:reviewBody "I owned this film for 8 months but did not see it because of all the negative hype on the board. Then I took the plunge. First off let me say that I was not a great Saratchandra admirer. His stories except SWAMI mostly portrayed women as weak minded subservient maybe true to the time but not to be admired and men as weak and mostly well bred but not well educated. I had no real recollection of the story as written. And not being a great Dilip Kumar fan I never watched the old version. So I have no comparisons to draw no plot line differences to talk about.I came away moved by the tragic love story that unfolded. It was not flawless most Bollywood movies are not.Negatives  the sets were beautiful but over the top ditto for the costumes. The duo dance was a great way to compare Aish vs Madhuri dancing skills both were pretty even matched for me but in the story line it was quite silly and should not have been there. There was no real need for the the two to meet but this was Mr Bhansali's directorial license. Chandramukhi's kotha and environs were lifted straight from Pakeezah which was a very stylized movie and not authentic.Positives Shahrukh Khan gave a very restrained performance the silent tears accompanied with an anguish that only his eyes portrayed was a real departure from the screwedup face crying. He was very very good in the drunk bits very good in the anguished bits. It is remarkable how much this actor is accused of being typecast when every other year he pulls out an amazing performance  Dil Se 1998 Asoka 2001 and Devdas 2002 are all departures from his usual typecast romantic hero image. Recent roles in Swades and KANK are even more varied. The detractors will keep saying he overacted or he portrayed no emotions for me this was a truly great role as an anguished lover. Mr. Khan  your best actor award for this role in Devdas was well deserved.Madhuri  what can one say about this truly great icon? She was amazing you felt her pain her caring her selfless love the moments between her and Shahrukh sizzled. And her dancing was brilliant.Aish  was a bit wooden at times but not always. She had a chemistry with Shahrukh that was understated until she was beyond his reach but come on  the woman looks amazing is there any doubt that a hundred Devdas types are dying for her?? She was better as the movie progressed to the more serious part.The movie went into an emotional downward spiral a third of the way in and I sat there moved and almost crying for these tortured souls the rest of the two hours.The movie was eye candy in the sets and costumes department. The two leading ladies were stunning Shahrukh was easy on the eye yet there was something that did detract from this being a great film. Upon much thinking I have come to the conclusion that it was the over the top beauty of everything that really made everything a little unreal for me. How could such perfect people have such imperfect lives? In essence the little black mark on the lip was missing and that left me a little dissatisfied.If Mr. Bhansali had stated that this was an adaptation from the original novel people would forgive him the fact that Devdas in his version is a mature man and knows his mind although fails to act decisively on it and the fact that an aristocratic lady visits a courtesan's establishment and the two dance together.If you do not compare with what did or did not come before this was an intense emotional experience anchored by great performances from Shahrukh Madhuri and yes even Aish.".

	schema:headline " Devdas is full of glamour THAT DOES NOT PROVE A MOVIE'S GREATNESS!";
	schema:reviewBody "This new version of Devdas is the most degrading horrible piece of junk I have seen in my entire life. And I say this because I have watched Bimal Roy's version and it is one of my favourite Hindi movies of all time. I agree that this Devdas had brilliant colour cinematography and this aesthetic glamour but does this make a movie great? NO!!! This new version showed nothing but glamorous sets costumes and props and that is why it is the most expensive Indian movie ever made. BIG DEAL! I think the money used here could have been used to make a story about kings and palaces where its feature would have been more realistic.There was nothing that caught my attention in this movie. I found loads of flaws...right from the beginning and I can ensure that Bhansali did NOT do his research on the Bengal of that time. I believe he is confused with the time...very confused. If one thinks of it Zamindars in Bengali villages did not have enough money in those days to send their sons to universities in Britain the real Devdas went to Calcutta. If you see the sets the houses furniture all the props are English style not Indian. In fact his house looks like a Roman mansion and not to forget that elaborate looking binocular was also very western. We must admit that those days Zamindar families did not have soo much money to waste to get every single prop from western exporters. So that is probably the biggest flaw these anachronistic additions.Another thing is did anyone notice Paro's house? I don't know what her mother was saying about them having a small humble house. Both mansions look like palaces. I even doubt that Zamindars in Calcutta had such elaborate houses in those days...and Zamindars in villages???? PLEASE...I even wonder whether Kings had palaces like that. Chandramukhi's 'Kotha' was also like a palace and Chandramukhi herself was dressed like a queen. There was no space in Calcutta for such large kothas!Costumes were Indian but altogether too elaborate and not Bengali...and props were soooo western. How the hell do those two things complement each other? Okay now let me move on to the acting. I though Shahrukh was his usual. His crying style was the same with his typical stammering and I thought all the other good actors were very melodramatic in their approach to the story. Nobody acted well...and Jackie Shroff just made my blood boil when he constantly said Bondhu. There were some Bengali additions in the dialogues and they looked so fake.And the dialogues were excessively corny. In Bimal Roy's Devdas Dilip Kumar says this wonderful dialogue when he lies in Chandramukhi's kotha soaking in alcohol 'Kaun kambakth peeta hai bardash karne ke liye mein to peeta hoon ke bas saans le sakoon' Which fool drinks to endure pain? I drink just so that I may breathe and in Bhansali's Devdas this dialogue has been transformed into a corny humorous issue 'Kaun kambakth peeta hai bardaash karne ke liye mein to peeta hoon ki yahan beith sakoon'which fool drinks to endure pain? I drink just so that I may sit here. Whatever emotional weight dialogues possibly could have contained despite of the pathetic acting Devdas 2002 lacks this entirely.Perhaps some of you are asking how I can state that Bengal was not like what when and that everything is anachronistic but I am Oriya and I come from a village. We Oriyas and Bengalis have the same dresses and houses and villages are alike. Oriyas and Bengalis are very similar and watching Roy's Devdas I could see the similarities. Everything was portrayed so realistically and I didn't have to question how reliable everything was. However this new Devdas is shrouded with glamour and glitz and doesn't even consider it important to understand the humility of things in rural Bengal.Paro's marriage was shocking in the new movie. She marries in a Maharashtran style with 'paan patte'! And she seems so shrewd and backbiting after she gets married. Did anyone also consider that how shameful it was for a respectable woman to visit a 'kotha'? And the new Paro walks into Chandramukhi's sparkling kotha and Chandramuki touches her feet...OH PLEASE! The worst is when they dance together. Paro and Chandramukhi had never met in their lives in the original tale. It is impossible that at that time women in their in law's houses were allowed to do dances in front of a large crowd let alone in front of their family. Even to speak of such things was out of the question.There was nothing at all that was nice about the new version of Devdas. I think it humiliating that India even considered sending this for Oscar consideration and I salute the Academy for shunning such a crappy movie. At least there are some award givers who know quality movies when they see them.Let's face the hard reality. Around 40 years ago India had the best directors ever Raj Kapoor Bimal Roy Guru Dutt Satyajit Ray etc etc and they also made brilliant movies such as Devdas 1955 Saraswati Chandra Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai Jaagte Raho Mother India Baiju Bawra etc. Now we are losing that respect we once had. All the current Bollywood movies are crap and so I don't waste my time watching them. Even Hollywood had fallen into a time in which Bollywood is now but Hollywood is catching up nowadays and has got some real good movies such as the LOTR Trilogy. Bollywood has the same cliched stories about love at first sight and the obstacles in getting a happy ending such as parent problems or other stuff. There are no social issues addressed or dealt with. Everything shown on the screen is this glamour which has really destroyed people's minds. A friendly chat with an unknown stranger proves how influenced young people are by Bollywood movies nowadays. The first question they will ask you is how old you are or if you have a boyfriendgirlfriend. And this is only a small indication of how destructive Indian cinema has been for the past few years.The new Devdas has no tacit feelings between Paro and Devdas or Chandramukhi and Devdas. Their love is physical that's obvious. And the people complaining that there was no chemistry between them should rethink. Devdas and Paro or Chandramukhi and Devdas had a lot of emotions and feeling unexpressed in the original story. The love the three possessed was spiritual and not physical. That is why Paro loved Devdas for so many years without having seen him. Roy's Devdas was so excellent in portraying these tacit moments. There was not a moment when Devdas even held Paro's hand let alone kiss her forehead as shown in the new Devdas no matter how much he loved her. There was always that spiritual respect between the characters. And Chandramukhi was no less. She gave up her life in the kotha because she had been influenced by Devdas's love. I see no change in the Chandramukhi in Bhansali's Devdas. Paro in the original gave all her jewellry to her step daughter and lived modestly wearing only what she needed. Her husband even asked her why she roamed around like a 'sadhu' saint. However in the new Devdas Paro is dressed with as many jewels as her body can hold as though the camera would have hated her without them. She shows no signs of a modest living let alone being helpful to the poor.I think the movie was an all together crappy piece of rubbish. There was no emotion no tacit feelings and no story Bhansali moved so far from the original and the director just let the glamour dominate the film. Unfortunately most of the youth of nowadays find that appealing and therefore whatever movie is new and has lots of glamour seems to be the best movie for them. However if you analyse this movie there is nothing to find except for miles and miles of junk. Shahrukh in no respect even came an inch close to Dilip Kumar's acting. No wonder Dilip Kumar is called the 'Tragedy King'. The 1955 Devdas had an excellent cast an irreplaceable ensemble of brilliant actors. If I had been the casting manager for the new Devdas and had all the actors who acted as the possible final choices I would have considered the project 'dead'. And it is dead. Bhansali had no chance of making a better movie than the 1955 one so he shouldn't have attempted to waste so much money to make another crappy movie. 11 Filmfare awards is unbelievably high for this piece of junk but I know why it was given so many just because Bollywood has no good movies anymore so they have no other nominees anyway.Indian cinema needs to change and revive itself. It will die otherwise. Glamour is not what films should project on the screen. There should be a story that can be related to that can be called real and believable. We don't have that anymore. To the people who love this movie I think you should watch Bimal Roy's Devdas. I know it is old and is in Black and White but movies should never be judged by those standards otherwise films such as 'Citizen Kane' and 'Casablanca though it is not a great favourite of mine' would never be called irreplaceable classics. The new Devdas has nothing more to offer than glamour that is not possible to achieve in the real world. It is a put on image that spoils minds and makes one dream of everything that is full of money. I know this quote is cliched but it may be the perfect time to put it in use 'All that is gold does not glitter'. Unfortunately people's minds have been ignorant to this quote. The truth has become 'Everything that is gold or more beautiful always glitters whether it is attainable in real life or not'. But if there are proper movie critics left in this world they will surely know what makes a good movie and Devdas 2002 is not even close to one.My overall rating for this movie...110. I have to give it credit for the cinematography and a small credit for the music and songs.".

I drink just so that I may breathe and in Bhansali's Devdas this dialogue has been transformed into a corny humorous issue 'Kaun kambakth peeta hai bardaash karne ke liye mein to peeta hoon ki yahan beith sakoon'which fool drinks to endure pain? I drink just so that I may sit here. Whatever emotional weight dialogues possibly could have contained despite of the pathetic acting Devdas 2002 lacks this entirely.Perhaps some of you are asking how I can state that Bengal was not like what when and that everything is anachronistic but I am Oriya and I come from a village. We Oriyas and Bengalis have the same dresses and houses and villages are alike. Oriyas and Bengalis are very similar and watching Roy's Devdas I could see the similarities. Everything was portrayed so realistically and I didn't have to question how reliable everything was. However this new Devdas is shrouded with glamour and glitz and doesn't even consider it important to understand the humility of things in rural Bengal.Paro's marriage was shocking in the new movie. She marries in a Maharashtran style with 'paan patte'! And she seems so shrewd and backbiting after she gets married. Did anyone also consider that how shameful it was for a respectable woman to visit a 'kotha'? And the new Paro walks into Chandramukhi's sparkling kotha and Chandramuki touches her feet...OH PLEASE! The worst is when they dance together. Paro and Chandramukhi had never met in their lives in the original tale. It is impossible that at that time women in their in law's houses were allowed to do dances in front of a large crowd let alone in front of their family. Even to speak of such things was out of the question.There was nothing at all that was nice about the new version of Devdas. I think it humiliating that India even considered sending this for Oscar consideration and I salute the Academy for shunning such a crappy movie. At least there are some award givers who know quality movies when they see them.Let's face the hard reality. Around 40 years ago India had the best directors ever Raj Kapoor Bimal Roy Guru Dutt Satyajit Ray etc etc and they also made brilliant movies such as Devdas 1955 Saraswati Chandra Jis Desh Mein Ganga Behti Hai Jaagte Raho Mother India Baiju Bawra etc. Now we are losing that respect we once had. All the current Bollywood movies are crap and so I don't waste my time watching them. Even Hollywood had fallen into a time in which Bollywood is now but Hollywood is catching up nowadays and has got some real good movies such as the LOTR Trilogy. Bollywood has the same cliched stories about love at first sight and the obstacles in getting a happy ending such as parent problems or other stuff. There are no social issues addressed or dealt with. Everything shown on the screen is this glamour which has really destroyed people's minds. A friendly chat with an unknown stranger proves how influenced young people are by Bollywood movies nowadays. The first question they will ask you is how old you are or if you have a boyfriendgirlfriend. And this is only a small indication of how destructive Indian cinema has been for the past few years.The new Devdas has no tacit feelings between Paro and Devdas or Chandramukhi and Devdas. Their love is physical that's obvious. And the people complaining that there was no chemistry between them should rethink. Devdas and Paro or Chandramukhi and Devdas had a lot of emotions and feeling unexpressed in the original story. The love the three possessed was spiritual and not physical. That is why Paro loved Devdas for so many years without having seen him. Roy's Devdas was so excellent in portraying these tacit moments. There was not a moment when Devdas even held Paro's hand let alone kiss her forehead as shown in the new Devdas no matter how much he loved her. There was always that spiritual respect between the characters. And Chandramukhi was no less. She gave up her life in the kotha because she had been influenced by Devdas's love. I see no change in the Chandramukhi in Bhansali's Devdas. Paro in the original gave all her jewellry to her step daughter and lived modestly wearing only what she needed. Her husband even asked her why she roamed around like a 'sadhu' saint. However in the new Devdas Paro is dressed with as many jewels as her body can hold as though the camera would have hated her without them. She shows no signs of a modest living let alone being helpful to the poor.I think the movie was an all together crappy piece of rubbish. There was no emotion no tacit feelings and no story Bhansali moved so far from the original and the director just let the glamour dominate the film. Unfortunately most of the youth of nowadays find that appealing and therefore whatever movie is new and has lots of glamour seems to be the best movie for them. However if you analyse this movie there is nothing to find except for miles and miles of junk. Shahrukh in no respect even came an inch close to Dilip Kumar's acting. No wonder Dilip Kumar is called the 'Tragedy King'. The 1955 Devdas had an excellent cast an irreplaceable ensemble of brilliant actors. If I had been the casting manager for the new Devdas and had all the actors who acted as the possible final choices I would have considered the project 'dead'. And it is dead. Bhansali had no chance of making a better movie than the 1955 one so he shouldn't have attempted to waste so much money to make another crappy movie. 11 Filmfare awards is unbelievably high for this piece of junk but I know why it was given so many just because Bollywood has no good movies anymore so they have no other nominees anyway.Indian cinema needs to change and revive itself. It will die otherwise. Glamour is not what films should project on the screen. There should be a story that can be related to that can be called real and believable. We don't have that anymore. To the people who love this movie I think you should watch Bimal Roy's Devdas. I know it is old and is in Black and White but movies should never be judged by those standards otherwise films such as 'Citizen Kane' and 'Casablanca though it is not a great favourite of mine' would never be called irreplaceable classics. The new Devdas has nothing more to offer than glamour that is not possible to achieve in the real world. It is a put on image that spoils minds and makes one dream of everything that is full of money. I know this quote is cliched but it may be the perfect time to put it in use 'All that is gold does not glitter'. Unfortunately people's minds have been ignorant to this quote. The truth has become 'Everything that is gold or more beautiful always glitters whether it is attainable in real life or not'. But if there are proper movie critics left in this world they will surely know what makes a good movie and Devdas 2002 is not even close to one.My overall rating for this movie...110. I have to give it credit for the cinematography and a small credit for the music and songs.";

Never have I walked out of a movie before no matter how terrible but Devdas pushed all the right buttons and I could just not bear it anymore. But enough about my personal and emotional quandries with Devdas.A record budget of about 500 million Indian rupees or just over 10 million US dollars twice as expensive as Lagaan cannot save this movie from its lack of anything entertaining or meaningful. Besides the incredible art direction of Nitin Chadrakant Desai which produces some very colorful and magical sets this movie is an utter failure. Sadly Indian audiences are embracing this film around the world and it will one day be considered a dare I say it classic.Binod Pradhan's cinematography will no doubt get showers of praise but he fails to do much more than make things look pretty. He fails to grasp our vision and make us say wow. Instead he lays back and lets Desai's art direction do all the work for him. A more capable cinematographer like the brilliant Santosh Sivan or the newer Yunus Pathan could have done much better and actually succeeded in captivating my imagination. Devdas is a cinematographer's dream but instead of embracing and taking control of a dream Pradhan sits it out on the sidelines.The main draw other than the music and dancing is the star studded cast. Not a single one of them deserves praise except Madhuri Dixit. Her portrayal of a whore who falls in love is the only glimmer of hope in a sea of stars who are heartthrobs and nothing more. Madhuri does as much as she can with her role playing the only character with any sort of multidimensionality and true feeling in the movie.Shahrukh Khan should be tranquilized or cryogenically frozen after making two of the worst movies ever Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham and Devdas. Some of his early work was respectable but when you play the same character 100 times and show no aspiration as a true actor you loose respect from my end. He is becoming a worse actor with time which is extremely unusual. His facial expressions and tone of voice lack the power and respect they once commanded. Maybe people will realize one day that he is not an actor but he is a showpiece. Deeply in love with the glamour and popularity that his millions of fans bestow upon him Khan has failed to mature ever since he made it big in Bollywood.His female counterpart Aishwarya Rai has a liking for being the trapped and overly dramatic type. Often touted as one of the most beautiful girls in the world her acting career has never shown any real promise in my limited exposure to Hindi Cinema. The other superstar Jackie Shroff should have a muzzle put on him for this movie. His loud drunken role is annoying and simply stupid especially since he is one of the worst drunks I've ever seen.Some of the song and dance sequences are fine standalone pieces but they fail to find their proper place in Devdas. Composer Ismail Darbar has never been at the level of someone like A.R. Rahman and here he shows exactly why. Director Sanjay Leela Bhansali dooms this film by putting the pieces together to a movie that has nothing aside from its aesthetics.The musical sequences pop out of nowhere and almost always destroy the undertone of the movie. Maybe Leela should take a look at Farhaan Akhtar's brilliant Dil Chahta Hai to learn how songs should play along with the feel of a movie instead of interrupt it.In the end if you are a person who likes a movie filled with stars or if you are just very easily entertained I guess you can check this one out. Otherwise beware and stay away or you will regret setting your eyes on this display of what a movie should not be.".

The story follows a man's downfall into depression alcoholism and his ultimate selfdestruction when his childhood sweetheart marries a man she does not love because of a thoughtless mistake on his part. While Devdas Mukherjee Khan struggles to overcome his grief at losing Paro Rai the one woman he loves he meets Chandramukhi Dixit a courtesan who falls in love with him at first sight. Running slightly over three hours subtitled version Devdas is at heart a basic story of boy loves girl boy loses girl another girl loves boy and a tragic end for one or all of them. Although typical in Bollywood Hindi cinema the plot is very engaging and simple but later made complex due to the marvelous performances by Khan Rai and Dixit.At first the focus of the viewer is solely on Devdas and Paro's relationship but when Chandramukhi enters the scene the viewer is conflicted by who heshe wishes to see Devdas end up with. While Paro is beautiful innocent and pure in her love for Devdas Chandramukhi is sensual and elegant. The latter also gives off an air of sadness and loneliness that seems to stem from her life as a courtesan which endears her all the more to the viewer.With his previous hit Hum Dil de Chuke Sanam Straight from the Heart 1999 Bhansali delivers another visually stunning film with Devdas. The songs are exquisite and very catchy and the dance scenes were a wonder to behold. Elaborate costumes and striking sets only added to the beauty and mystique that was the world of Devdas.The only things I could make negative comments on would be the picture quality the subtitles and Shahrukh's acting. The quality of the picture was often grainy and did not seem as clear as it should have been. There were a few instances when the subtitles either went by too fast or needed to be read more than once in order to understand the meaning some of them were very weirdly worded. Shahrukh did appear to struggle a bit in his performance and overact in some scenes but overall he did a nice job.A film that can be enjoyed by families and viewers of any age and nationality Devdas is what most Americans expect to come from India gorgeous breathtaking and having the ability to take a simple love story and turn it into a complicated plot line that will have almost anyone become a romantic even a secret one.".

Devdas was no doubt a movie that can indeed be called a milestone in Indian cinema unfortunately not for the reasons it should have been. It may have been the most expensive and detailed movie ever but it ignores the fact that a movie is all about entertainment and this Devdas unfortunately was not. Depicted from the Bimal Roy movie of the same name this Devdas was too full of glitz and glamour and each scene was too colorful and overdone. What Sanjay should have done was to stick to his HDDCS strategy whereby if the set was glitz then the characters were dressed in a simple manner and vice versa. In the case of Devdas both the sets and characters were so glitzy that they did not give each other the opportunity to stand out.  Looking beyond that the story is well known and was excellently portrayed by the leads. Khan was excellent as expected and would be the only actor that could do the role any justice. Ash proved that she can be stunning and act at the same time. Jackie was on par with Khan. Madhuri hmm this movie went on to show that she should not be forgotten or cast aside just yet.Although an Ash fan myself the funny thing is when I think of Devdas I automatically think of Madhuri and how stunning she looked. This movie would definitely be a jewel in her acting portfolio. This was her movie as Paakeezah was Meena Kumari's and  Umrao Jaan was Rekra's.The story is well known and does not require any indulgence but one should point out the excellent dialogues as well as the background music as well as mindblowing choreography to Dolare.One can hope that Sanjay does not overdo his next venture and then maybe the Oscars may beckon.".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't watch very many adult films but this was well worth sitting through for performance dialogue and concept alone. Lonely middle aged Justine Jones Georgina Spelvin decides to end her own life by slitting her wrists in the bathtub. When she awakens she finds herself bargaining for her place in the hereafter with the pleasant but stern Mr. Abaca John Clemens an afterlife social worker or sorts. He tells her she's already sealed her fate by committing suicide but since she lived a virtually sinfree existence otherwise he'll let her experience lust and sexual pleasure for a brief period of time before her stint in hell commences. Miss Jones then enters a doorway for a series of sexual adventures starting with learning the basics of human sexuality from 'Teacher' Harry Reems. The scenes following involve the expected couplings a straight scene a lesbian scene and two scenes with multiple partners  as well as a few more imaginative solo scenes of Justine learning how to pleasure herself with a water hose a bowl of fruit and a snake. Some of these sequences are given distinction through sound and setting. For instance there's no music accompanying the lesbian scene just the sound of howling wind a simple yet effective otherworldly touch. The water hose scene takes place in a filthy grimy bathtub which is a reflection of how sex can be temporary escape no matter how ugly and miserable your surroundings. By the time her introduction to the joys of sex concludes Justine has won back her will to live and is pleading for a second chance but finds herself trapped in a distinct and disturbing version of personal hell.No the sex scenes aren't especially erotic but who said every film incorporating hardcore sex had to be erotic? In fact the first twenty minutes of this film are virtually sex free. And no Georgina Spelvin looks nothing like today's porno stars. She middle aged and doesn't look like she just emerged from a Barbie Doll cloning factory. She can also act. This film simply would not have worked with a bad actress in the lead as the role requires someone capable of showing a variety of different emotions depression frigidity innocence discovery and ultimately anguish and despair. Spelvin does this role justice and it's easy to see why she went on to an acclaimed and respected career in the adult industry.This film probably isn't for everyone out there but it's worthwhile to the right kind of audience particularly those who think there can be more to hardcore films than a series of sex scenes carelessly and cheaply strung together for an easy profit.".

	schema:reviewBody "After DEEP THROAT's devastating success shook people's perceptions of porn as some sort of ghettobound form of entertainment its director Gerard Damiano in turn twisted those same people's expectations by radically changing course and creating what is still one of the most thoughtprovoking adult films of all time. Though it has been the inspiration for a Swiss softcore reworking Erwin C. Dietrich's DER TEUFEL IN MISS JONAS and a mostly forgotten gay porn adaptation THE DEVIL AND MR JONES duh ! not to mention five official sequels and a recent remake Paul Thomas' glossy THE NEW DEVIL IN MISS JONES with Jenna Jameson and Savanna Samson as the Horned One and Miss Jones respectively the original has lost none of its power to shock over more than three decades. Of course much of this is thanks to the truly amazing Georgina Spelvin delivering one of the most aweinspiring acting and sexual performances the world has ever witnessed. A former chorus line dancer named Michelle Shelly Graham spelling varies according to source she entered the adult industry at a relatively advanced age  in her late thirties  and went on to prove that experience she'd been married and a mom before entering a same sex relationship with porno performer Judith Hamilton can make a real woman far more sexually interesting than any prettier and younger girl could ever hope to be.The movie opens on Spelvin as Justine Jones a lonely spinster pushing forty wordlessly preparing her suicide by slashing her wrists in the bathtub as Linda November's soothing vocals wail the absolutely haunting I'm Coming Home on the soundtrack. As life's blood drains from her slumping body she's suddenly transported to the office of Mr Abaca character actor John Clemens who played leading lady Tamie Trevor's husband in Danny Stone's HIGH RISE without any memories of her prior actions. It turns out she's at some sort of halfway house between Heaven and Hell where it'll be determined where she should go. While she has lived a spotless life of chastity I haven't even done that the taking of her own life makes her ineligible for an eternity in Paradise. She's not expected at either place for a few days anyway so Abaca grants her the opportunity to experience every form of sexual perversion in the netherworld so she'll at least deserve her damnation. Guided along by the Teacher THROAT's Dr Young himself Harry Reems in a solemn performance as far removed from that zany character as can be imagined Justine discovers most erotic variations known to man oral straight and rectal penetration in groups of two and three of both men and women and her gleeful responses to each new experience provide most of those scenes' turnon value. Real life lover Hamilton also with Spelvin in Gary Graver's excellent 3 A.M. supplies the Sapphic action with the howling wind adding an eerie touch. The only other female Sue Flaken from Lloyd Kaufman's hard to see XXX musical THE NEW COMERS aka SEVEN DELICIOUS WISHES playfully fights Spelvin for oral dominance over the massive member of Marc Stevens who made a memorable Jacob Marley in Costello's PASSIONS OF CAROL the latter returning for the legendary sandwich scene with Georgina and Levi Richards of A DIRTY WESTERN notoriety. Rumor has it that both studs were so nervous that the actress had to convince them the actual shooting was just a rehearsal encouraging and talking them through the whole act ! Inevitably Miss Jones winds up in Hell a whitechalked dungeon of never ending boredom the only escape of which is obsessive lunacy as demonstrated by Damiano's cameo turn as Georgina's cell mate trying to focus on an imaginary fly while the woman tries to tempt him with her fleshy wares. Deep and downbeat a reason the film has generated as many detractors as it has followers DEVIL IN MISS JONES is a rare adult film that once seen can never be truly erased from memory. Plot liberally borrowed from Sartre's HUIS CLOS aka NO EXIT acting and production were unlike anything experienced by audiences at the time illustrating Damiano's huge gamble that pretty much generated the whole subsequent Golden Age deal roughly encompassing the remainder of the '70s and the first half of the '80s. Time has not dulled its effect one iota. Spelvin's dramatic intensity still makes you feel Justine's despair at having wrongheadedly perhaps ? lived a life of sinfree purity and her sexual performance scorches anything in its path. Anyone genuinely interested in the history of porn cinema should start his studies right here. The only downside being that this masterpiece will spoil you for life !".

Plot liberally borrowed from Sartre's HUIS CLOS aka NO EXIT acting and production were unlike anything experienced by audiences at the time illustrating Damiano's huge gamble that pretty much generated the whole subsequent Golden Age deal roughly encompassing the remainder of the '70s and the first half of the '80s. Time has not dulled its effect one iota. Spelvin's dramatic intensity still makes you feel Justine's despair at having wrongheadedly perhaps ? lived a life of sinfree purity and her sexual performance scorches anything in its path. Anyone genuinely interested in the history of porn cinema should start his studies right here. The only downside being that this masterpiece will spoil you for life !";

I've heard this film described as 'deep' and while it definitely is deep considering its genre  it's still not exactly Shakespeare but would you want it any other way?. That being said the film does do something for both the proverbial 'heads' and that's not something that can be said for every porn film.

The plot is still rather thin but here we focus on Justine Jones  a woman so bored with life that she decides to commit suicide. She then finds herself in purgatory where it is decided that she will be able to return to Earth providing she live according to a deadly sin  and naturally she chooses lust...One of the first things I noticed about the film was that its star  Georgina Spelvin  isn't exactly your average porn star and indeed this is actually mentioned at one point when her 'teacher' describes her body in a none too favourable light. I can't say that this odd casting choice really helps the film it does give it some sort of realism as the title character is an 'average woman' but I'm sure most people would have preferred a more buxom lead. That being said the lady certainly doesn't disappoint when it comes to doing what most men would want her to do as she gets put to good use with everything from men and women to fruit and snakes. The sex is sleazy and dirty and the film never holds back when it comes to showing everything. Indeed you certainly do get your 'moneys worth' when it comes to The Devil in Miss Jones. The film was apparently one of the pioneers of 'porno chic' and while I'm not exactly well qualified to say whether or not that is true looking at the film I'm sure it probably is. The film could have packed more of a punch with better production values I think but even so this is a must see porn flick and comes highly recommended!".

	schema:headline " One more film from The Golden Age of Porn that shows the movement and the genre's true potential";
	schema:reviewBody "One can hardly talk about America's Golden Age of Porn and not mention Gerard Damiano arguably the most influential director of the period alongside Radley Metzger. Damiano really helped kickstart the possibilities of pornography in America with Deep Throat in 1972 solidifying the wealth of humor dialog and eroticism that could all be simultaneously conveyed and explored rather than just relying on the strengths of one or another. Deep Throat despite trailing Mona the Virgin Nymph the first theatrically released pornographic film in America by two years went on to become one of the most successful and wellknown pornographic films ever made and its cultfollowing in addition to the strength of the humor in the film itself still carry with it today.Following up such a monstrous success narratively and commercially would be a struggle for many but judging by the level of confidence The Devil in Miss Jones carries itself largely in terms of the storyline and the way the actors handle themselves it seems that Damiano once again had a clear idea and vision of what he was doing with this film. The story concerns Justine Jones Georgina Spelvin a lonely and depressed older woman unmarried and severely lacking any excitement in her life. One day whilst in the bathtub Jones comes to the consensus that the only solution to her sorely lacking existence is suicide just before slitting hit wrists and subsequently dying in the water.Miss Jones awakes in purgatory where she meets an angel by the name of Abaca John Clemens. Although Miss Jones has lived a life of purity and solace her suicide prevents her entrance into Heaven. Frustrated that this one fact prevents her from entering the pearly gates Miss Jones convinces Abaca to let her at least earn her place in Hell by returning to Earth to embody the sin of lust. Abaca accepts this plea begrudgingly so and what entails is Miss Jones' new life of immediate sexual gratification as she engages in sexual intercourse with everyone from a sexual teacher Harry Reems who shows her the excitement pain and pleasure can have to a filthy threesome with two men.The Devil in Miss Jones may be an even filthier film than Deep Throat but that is no bother seeing as just as with a Metzger film the strengths come from not just the eroticism but the delicate balance of storytelling approach and cinematography. To begin with Damiano captures the film in a lowlit manner very akin to the kind of cinematographical style we frequently see in erotic thrillers. Furthermore the film doesn't cop out at the consistent sex scenes though the film practically feels like one long forty minute sex scene following its tame twenty minutes of suspense adding a real layer of contemplative ideas to a film that could've otherwise been entirely vapid. The idea of willingly want to enter Hell and working to have yourself epitomize the idea of lust in the most graphic way possible is an intriguing almost existential idea that one would expect an epic to take on rather than a lowrent 1970's pornographic film.The sex in the film is also very erotic capitalizing on a certain rawness and intimacy that is achieved through the aforementioned cinematography and repeated closeups of the intercourse taking place.

	onyx:emotionText "One can hardly talk about America's Golden Age of Porn and not mention Gerard Damiano arguably the most influential director of the period alongside Radley Metzger. Damiano really helped kickstart the possibilities of pornography in America with Deep Throat in 1972 solidifying the wealth of humor dialog and eroticism that could all be simultaneously conveyed and explored rather than just relying on the strengths of one or another. Deep Throat despite trailing Mona the Virgin Nymph the first theatrically released pornographic film in America by two years went on to become one of the most successful and wellknown pornographic films ever made and its cultfollowing in addition to the strength of the humor in the film itself still carry with it today.Following up such a monstrous success narratively and commercially would be a struggle for many but judging by the level of confidence The Devil in Miss Jones carries itself largely in terms of the storyline and the way the actors handle themselves it seems that Damiano once again had a clear idea and vision of what he was doing with this film. The story concerns Justine Jones Georgina Spelvin a lonely and depressed older woman unmarried and severely lacking any excitement in her life. One day whilst in the bathtub Jones comes to the consensus that the only solution to her sorely lacking existence is suicide just before slitting hit wrists and subsequently dying in the water.Miss Jones awakes in purgatory where she meets an angel by the name of Abaca John Clemens. Although Miss Jones has lived a life of purity and solace her suicide prevents her entrance into Heaven. Frustrated that this one fact prevents her from entering the pearly gates Miss Jones convinces Abaca to let her at least earn her place in Hell by returning to Earth to embody the sin of lust. Abaca accepts this plea begrudgingly so and what entails is Miss Jones' new life of immediate sexual gratification as she engages in sexual intercourse with everyone from a sexual teacher Harry Reems who shows her the excitement pain and pleasure can have to a filthy threesome with two men.The Devil in Miss Jones may be an even filthier film than Deep Throat but that is no bother seeing as just as with a Metzger film the strengths come from not just the eroticism but the delicate balance of storytelling approach and cinematography. To begin with Damiano captures the film in a lowlit manner very akin to the kind of cinematographical style we frequently see in erotic thrillers. Furthermore the film doesn't cop out at the consistent sex scenes though the film practically feels like one long forty minute sex scene following its tame twenty minutes of suspense adding a real layer of contemplative ideas to a film that could've otherwise been entirely vapid. The idea of willingly want to enter Hell and working to have yourself epitomize the idea of lust in the most graphic way possible is an intriguing almost existential idea that one would expect an epic to take on rather than a lowrent 1970's pornographic film.The sex in the film is also very erotic capitalizing on a certain rawness and intimacy that is achieved through the aforementioned cinematography and repeated closeups of the intercourse taking place. Spelvin is both an energetic performer and a capable actor and she conveys her character's desperation and subsequent sexual drive very convincingly especially during the spinetingling final sequence which has the ability to evoke arousal and sadness.And that dear reader is the key here. In just two months of taking one day out of my schedule to examine a pornographic film of yesteryear I've seen ideas such as incest loneliness rejection and allegory examined in films where I'm sure few people expect it.

She is one of the most bland porn stars I have ever laid eyes upon I do not see the appeal but then appeal is something that varies individual to individual. She not only looks bad to me but she sounds bad to the scene she says hurt me over and over brings to mind one of those ladies that has smoked to much during their life and are now aged and unappealing and their voice matches. Not the voice or the look of a porn star just makes this adult film fizzle rather than sizzle. Like I said this is my individual tastes I prefer the girls in Debbie Does Dallas and the Little Girls Blue films as they have a cuteness none of the females in this one posses. There is one scene with another girl as Miss Jones wants to experience all the lust she missed out on before her untimely death at the hands of herself and that girl is somewhat okay and this scene is okayish but beyond this scene most of the scenes simply make one ill rather than aroused. Well it did me once again an adult film is going to be more a matter of taste than any other film genre what makes one person excited may not be what makes everyone excited. So to this film as it does not arouse or make me excited instead it turns me off sex. Not the case for everyone however as it has a rather nice score for an adult film so read the other reviews to get a more complete view of things.".

	schema:reviewBody "Devil in Miss Jones 1973 12 out of 4 Tired of life Justine Jones Georgina Spelvin decides to end it all by slicing her wrists in the tub. She's soon sent to a middle man where she opens up about wishing she had experiences more lust in life as she died a virgin. The good man is willing to send her back so that she can take part in various sexual acts. Of all the films from the original Classic Age of Porn this one here probably features the best all around story. It's rather strange because I'd say it also features the least attractive woman and yet this here is probably the most erotic of any of the films. How all of that happened is rather strange but that pretty much makes this movie one of the more unique and at times disturbing adult movies. I think a lot of credit should certainly go towards Spelvin as she fits the role very nicely and her somewhat unattractive nature makes us believe her in the part of someone who never really experienced life. I still wouldn't say she gives a good performance but for the story trying to be told here she fits the role just fine. Her teacher in the film is legend Harry Reems and he gives his typical decent performance. The rest of the cast members are pretty much here and there but none really stick out. The sexual side of this film is perhaps the strangest aspect as the scenes range from erotic to strange to just downright disgusting at times. Some of them are even bad including the scene where Spelvin gets to experience another woman. The stuff with the fruit and snake really wasn't needed but her scenes with Reems are at least memorable well shot and manage to be at times erotic. What makes them erotic is how Spelvin portraits the desire that she's felt her entire life but never got around to acting on any of them. This here is what works in the film even if the story begins to take a back seat in the second half of the film. This here is certainly not one of the greatest films ever made but it is a rather smart one and one that deserves its label of a classic for the genre.".

Subtle however is not synonymous with boring as unfortunately many people accustomed to a nonstop barrage of sensedulling special effects and violence have come to believe.  This film is as far from boring as it gets.What I walked away from this story with is a reaffirmation of a force bigger than ourselves that takes our lives in a new direction  one that we often consciously choose to reject.  Macon Leary as superbly played by William Hurt has been sleepwalking through life for years.  His profession says it all he writes books for business travelers who have to visit exotic places but want to feel as if they never left home.  Thus the title The Accidental Tourist.He is separated from his beloved wife Sarah played very well by Kathleen Turner.  She could no longer live in with the waking death their life had become since the senseless murder of their young son years before.  But he still wants nothing more than for her to return and resume that life. Even after a quirky dogtrainer played by Geena Davis in her welldeserved Oscarwinning performance enters his life and his heart he believes his future can only be with Sarah.I don't want to give away the entire story but I will say that the entire supporting cast Macon's family Ed Begley Jr. Amy Wright David Ogden Stiers his editor Bill Pullman and a scenestealing Welsh Corgi contribute richly and completely to the overall power of this story.Some of the best dialogue I've ever heard on relationships why they work and why what we want so dearly to work just doesn't work anymore is in this film.  Don't be lulled by a false sense of security.  This powerful line is what this film is all about and it is placed perfectly as all the memorable lines are.  Give it a chance and an open mind because this film is the real deal.  In my estimation The Accidental Tourist is American cinema at it's best.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a wonderful film by Lawrence Kasdan about a man who withdraws from his relationships with other people and the world after a terrible family tragedy. William Hurt plays the character of 'Macon' a man who writes books for people who don't want to travel and has become as grey and dull as his suit. His wife Sarah the vibrant Kathleen Turner separates from him and after an accident he goes to live with his family who live a life organised by his sister Rose Amy Wright and settles into a dull routine. Even his dog seems to be turning against him then he meets Muriel Geena Davis when boarding his dog and she not only teaches the dog new tricks but also shows Macon that his ways can be changed too. William Hurt gives a truly marvellous performance as a man who has given up on life and has become almost catatonic. This is a film that gets better with each subsequent viewing containing much food for thought especially for anyone that wishes for a 'safe' and 'planned' life. The wonderful dreamlike score is by John Williams and it was nominated for an Oscar amongst many nominations for this film. Thankfully this outstanding movie is now available on DVD and in the correct viewing format.".

Even his dog seems to be turning against him then he meets Muriel Geena Davis when boarding his dog and she not only teaches the dog new tricks but also shows Macon that his ways can be changed too. William Hurt gives a truly marvellous performance as a man who has given up on life and has become almost catatonic. This is a film that gets better with each subsequent viewing containing much food for thought especially for anyone that wishes for a 'safe' and 'planned' life. The wonderful dreamlike score is by John Williams and it was nominated for an Oscar amongst many nominations for this film. Thankfully this outstanding movie is now available on DVD and in the correct viewing format.";

	schema:reviewBody "William Hurt gives one of the most intensely interior performances on record. He is indescribable moving. His emotional paralysis becomes the palpitating centre of this gorgeous Lawrence Kasdan film. I saw the film when it first come out on a big huge screen that allowed me the strangely unique privilege of entering a man's soul. In the surface nothing. Less than nothing William Hurt floats through his daily existence surrounded by his quirky family his wounded distant ex wife but first and foremost his impenetrable loneliness. The character never utters a word who could confirm that and yet is there ever present if you look deep deep into his eyes. The scene in which he almost lets himself go in Geena Davis's arms is as cathartic as anything I've ever seen in any modern American movie. A couple of days ago I saw it again on a normal TV screen and all of the above wasn't there. Still a gorgeous film a funny melancholic romantic comedy but what about the interior masterpiece of William Hurt's performance? Gone. Did I imagine the whole emotional ride? Possible but unlikely. I took my VHS copy to a friend's house with a phenomenal home entertainment centre and a massive screen. William Hurt's performance was back. His is a performance conceived and designed for the big screen. One hundred per cent cinematic. The TV screen is far too small to allow us into a man's soul. If you haven't seen it I urge you to see it but in a big screen the biggest you can find. Now let me leave you with this little tip. Look into William Hurt's eyes when he is in the taxi in Paris and sees the boy who reminds him of his own son walking down the street. It is the best performances by an actor in one of my favourite film moments of all time.".

That is the majority that's expecting to be entertained in the Hollywood style of film making. With that I mean those strong performances we all want to see from characters as Hoffman in Rain Man or Hanks in Forrest Gump. Or vast visuals filmed in the broadest scope or action packed sequences. Not in The Accidental Tourist. What you do get is William Hurt in what I think is one of his best roles as Macon Leary writer of travel guides and Geena Davis in an exquisite role as the pet store owner. I've admired actors for the way they can portray mentally or socially challenged people Rainman Forrest Gump Of mice and men etc.. These parts tend to win the Oscars. But I'd rather give one to Hurt for his portrayal of Macon Leary because this character doesn't show obvious signs of any handicap. Actually Macon is very plain. What can be more difficult than acting out a role of a person who's personal qualities don't jump at you right away? The Accidental Tourist is a movie of high quality and should be given a fair chance.".

She's perfectly cast as the kitschy freespirited dog trainer and was well deserving of her Best Supporting Actress' Oscar win. There's some genuine support from the supporting players including Bill Pullman Amy Wright and David Ogden Stiers. But they don't receive much limelight nor do they demand it. At the halfway mark the movie turns into more of a muchly familiar dilemma of choosing between two women. Either moving on with your life or hanging onto memories while you still can. This has been used many times before but it is handled very well here. With terrific performances a compelling script and a good narrative The Accidental Tourist' hits a bullseye in all categories.

	schema:reviewBody "In Baltimore Macon William Hurt is a writer of travel books called what else The Accidental Tourist. His premise is that his advice will help people travel without being extremely homesick. Alas Macon is hurting at this time due to the untimely death of his only son. As his wife Sarah Kathleen Turner has moved out also too grief stricken to continue their marriage Macon is left with his son's upset dog as a companion. He occasionally visits the family home nearby where his single sister Rose takes care of her two bachelor brothers. One morning panic ensues. Macon is starting a journey to Europe and he is refused dog boarding at his usual place as the canine bit someone last time. In a quandary the writer spies a vet's office which also boards. Although he has no appointment the unusual clerk Muriel Geena Davis takes the dog. But oh when Macon returns he finds that Muriel wants to train his dog and has set her sights on going out with Macon too! The writer tries to discourage her in every way but the lady prevails. Soon Macon is constantly at her urban apartment where she barely makes ends meet as she is also a single mother to a son Alexander. Muriel however is an eccentric woman who makes Macon smile but who is the subject of ridicule to his brothers and exwife. In fact Sarah makes another play for her former hubby. Meanwhile Macon's editor Julian Bill Pullman has been courting sister Rose. Will Macon abandon Muriel who dearly loves him for a return to his former wife? This lovely film is a lifeaffirming masterpiece. We love we lose we grieve and we reconnect. Love also comes when we least expect it at times. As the writer Hurt is excellent with a carefully nuanced performance. Turner Pullman and the others do great work too. In her Oscar winning role Davis gives the performance of a lifetime as the funny offbeat Muriel. Then too the setting in Baltimore is most interesting as well as a spell in beautiful Paris. Costuming is most noteworthy here as Muriel's outfits are sublimely ridiculous while everyone else is sedately classically clad. Finally the dazzling story based on a book by Anne Tyler and the wonderful direction by Kazdan combine for a unique film experience. Do NOT leave it to accident to view this great one. Make plans and soon.".

In her Oscar winning role Davis gives the performance of a lifetime as the funny offbeat Muriel. Then too the setting in Baltimore is most interesting as well as a spell in beautiful Paris. Costuming is most noteworthy here as Muriel's outfits are sublimely ridiculous while everyone else is sedately classically clad. Finally the dazzling story based on a book by Anne Tyler and the wonderful direction by Kazdan combine for a unique film experience. Do NOT leave it to accident to view this great one. Make plans and soon.";

The screenplay is excellently written full of witty humour and biting satire the film editing is admirable and the performances are excellent. Geena Davis won an Oscar for her role but it is in fact William Hurt who stands out the most in the cast in an unflinching but somehow amazingly poignant role. On the down side the film is slow a bit too meandering and the final quarter is not really all that interesting but overall it is an involving very worthwhile watch.".

Also i can read the deep love for Muriel on his smiling face when he met Muriel at the gate of the hotel at the end of the movie. I can't agree with some people who think this movie lacks energy. it might appear to lack but u could have felt the passion in their hearts if u can understand them. this remind me of another movieOnce Upon A Time In America which is also said to lack energy but i can feel the great passion in Noodles and Deborah's heart when they quietly meet in the bar after Noodle was released from the jail. only a few words from Deborah can make me feel that! Just as sometimes the clothes do not make the man sometimes the movie is not what it appears! there is seldom any good movies from which we can not feel the passion!".

Instead Dr. Harold Ramis shows up unexpectedly summoned by Nicholson anda bad joke about HMO's laterthe boy is cured.In Accidental Tourist William Hurt plays the writer of travel books for people who hate to travel. He gives them tips on how to travel in their own portable cocoon. Yet his life is shattered before the film begins when his son is gunned down at a McDonalds in a random shooting. This withdrawn man withdraws even more finishing off his marriage. Yet when Geena Davis forces her way into his life he begins to connect again. But she has a chronically sick boy. She explains almost blithely at one point the number of things that could kill him or put him in the hospital. There is a wonderful moment when Hurt finds the lonely boy walking home from school being ignored by his friends. They chat a moment then Hurt's voice over which frequently quotes from his travel books in ironic contrast to the story says Business travelers should never take along something they couldn't bear to lose. As the voice over says that the little boy's hand slips into Hurts and they walk home together.It's a small wonderful moment. There are no miracle cures from super doctors. Instead there is the acceptance that love requires risk that you have to accept the possibility of loss. It's a deep mature moving film wonderfully acted that also manages to be funny without sacrificing any of its depth. It is Lawrence Kasdan's best film and deserves renewed interest.PS The similarities between As Good As It Gets and The Accidental Tourist cannot have escaped James L Brooks attention. After all he cast Kasdan in a cameo as Nicholson's shrink. Yet as far as I know I have never seen a critic comment on the similarities.".

I didn't like the fact Kathleen Turner's character left her husband for selfish reasons which seems to be okay according to the script. You didn't give ME enough support when our kid was killed so I am leaving. Wow another plug for making marriage into a joke.".

I was first very moved with the story then amazed by the performance of the actors and I loved the musical score from John Williams. What I love in this film is the mix between melancholy and humor together with the very smart analysis of human relations. Geena Davis offers such a strong contrast with the personality of the Leary family's members ! The scene where I laughed most is the moment when Macon Leary's sister and brother are unpacking the shopping in the kitchen. The brother hands the goods to his sister by... alphabetical order ! So I wanted to know more and I bought the Anne Tyler novel. That was the second very good surprise  the film is so faithful to the book in its words and in its spirit. I recommend the book very warmly as a prolongation of the vision of the film. A bit like two other favorite films  The World according to Garp and the Empire of the Sun. Accidental Tourist is very much in the same mood as The big Chill and Grand Canyon that I really love. But I was disappointed by the following films of Lawrance Kasdan. But Accidental Tourist is a must. Unfortunately it is not released in France the DVD is available only for the zone 1. Let's hope it will be available soon !".

But it's not completely clear where there's any plot left to fill a third part. What this film does is overlay the previous stories with an additional layer of romanticism and complexity but there's a certain lack of focus to the plot with almost all of our favourite characters already dead by the end of the second film although in flashback there's a rebirth for the great Tony Leung absent from part two. Indeed the film works almost entirely by encouraging us to feel differently about scenes we have already witnessed.

	schema:reviewBody "Where Scorsese's recent version of Infernal Affairs all the loose ends pretty much got tied up during the film whereas with the original we were left with an open but much more emotionally impacting conclusion. The first sequel was a prequel so part III was left to pick up afterwards while also going back over the original film and filling in more detail. In doing this it marks itself out as one that is aimed at the fans rather than being just out for money. The downside of this is of course that if you are not a fan you might find this hard to follow along with and if you have not seen the first film then just forget it totally. Personally I thought the first film was an enjoyable cop thriller but I didn't think it was brilliant or developed characters that well but the tension was great. With the third film the focus was very much on the characters rather than the tension  with the fate of Ming being the modern thread that holds the film together.If you are into the characters and the parallels with the original film then it is worth seeing because it does do it pretty well. It does ask you to pay attention but it rewards you if you do and have been. There is action but mostly it is the Ming's ongoing struggle with who he is that the film pays most attention to. I quite liked this but must confess that this film still didn't do a great job of bringing out the characters that well and it is more the events and revelations that kept me interested rather than an emotional buyin with the characters. Lau is perhaps partly to blame for this because I thought he was buttoned a bit too tight  it was understandable in some regards but the third film should have been the point where he shows more of a breakdown which he does but again it is events rather than emotion. Leung is good again but his scenes don't seem as relevant or as interesting within this film  again it is probably to do with the lack of emotional buyin I felt with his character his performance is natural and engaging though. Outside of these two the rest of the cast are pretty good. Again I didn't think much of the use of Chen but Wong and Tsang are both solid in their small returns.Overall then an effective and enjoyable film if you love the series and the characters an interesting one if you have seen the first two films and a pointless one if you are looking to join in at the last minute. Tying up the loose ends of the series the film isn't tense enough or emotionally impacting enough to be worth a look unless you are really already into the characters but it is an interesting way to bring things to an end  with restraint and tragedy rather than excess.".

Tying up the loose ends of the series the film isn't tense enough or emotionally impacting enough to be worth a look unless you are really already into the characters but it is an interesting way to bring things to an end  with restraint and tragedy rather than excess.";

	schema:reviewBody "I've watched Infernal Affairs I II  III in a year time. I loved the first one very much. It gave me a very unexpected feeling. It's simple but strong in impact. Though one could mention a lot of flaws in the plot I just couldn't resist its charm. The second one made me disappointed because it lacked the kind of impact the first one gave me. Now after watching the third one I realise why there needs to be a second one in totally different style than the first one. It's a preparation for the audiences adapting to the change in the third one.I like this third one. Without the second one probably I would have been like the other audiences critising the change of style from the first one. It's this kind of change it's made the film more solid full of human feeling. The first one indeed was touching only the surface of the hole. This third one is more into the content of it  the heart of the people.I love particularly the part describing Andy Lau's psychological sufferings and changes. The shadowing effect he had with Tony Leung should deserve a credit for script writing directing and editting. The interlacing of stories between that happened before and after Tony Leung's death has been editted great. I feel sorry for people who don't read this or who don't like it. It's certainly the best part of the film which should earn a credit rather than negative critics.I would conclude that the first one is like spicy cuisine which is strong in taste and quick in making one like it immediately if you can stand it. The third one is somehow a French cuisine where you have to be patient taste it slowly together with the wine before you appreciate the marvellous cooking skills and feel the heart of the Chef.".

The Scorcese remake has borrowed everything from the IF series but learned nothing. I enjoyed the Departed so I thought id watch IF  mainly because the ending of the Departed left me feeling let down. Looking back im embarrassed to have enjoyed it its completely inferior to the originals. Watch them and you will see why.SPOILERS FROM IF I AND II NOT III!This is the total opposite of Infernal affairs I and totally different to Infernal affairs II  where the first film was all action too fast too see the plot this is slowalmost plodding at one point I found it annoyingly slow but its worth it because it really brings out the true nature of the characters from the other films. The action flicks around in time and is often a little confusing. However it is masterfully done I would say much better than in Pulp Fiction which is the first example that comes to mind. Someone used a food analogy previously  I would say this is the dessert and its best savoured slowly to end what has been a great meal.I thought IFII was greatly influenced by the first and second Godfather film and in a way IFIII has common elements to the second and third  flicking through time to see how the story has emerged and tying up the loose ends with style.Without spoiling the plot this film shows how Yans rise through the Triads isn't as smooth as it appears to have been in the previous two films and also shows a darker side of Sam Wong and if possible Ming. Mary and Keung's characters are also developed much more. There are a few interesting twists and a smattering of violence to keep you on the edge of the seat. The real centre piece of this film is the emotional artistic element though. Some of the locations and shooting is breathtaking. The climax of the film occurs after Yans death and is one of the most moving movie moments I've experienced. The final scene is a master stroke... nothing short of genius.Only reason not to give this ten is that in places its a little slow... also there is less action and when there is action it somehow feels like its only been put in to keep action fans happy. Other than that its fantastic there has never been a finer end to a trilogy I hope that it is a lesson to the movie makers of Hollywood who only make trilogies if they involve toys and video game licences. I expect they are so busy counting the revenue from the Departed they don't care though. Their loss is our gain! Watch Infernal Affairs! Don't buy into the Hollywood money making machine!".

	schema:reviewBody "MINOR SPOILERSOne has to see the first Infernal Affairs before seeing this movie otherwise it would just be too confusing.This sequel to IA is about Ming the undercover triad member who becomes a cop to infiltrate the police force. Throughout the movie Ming's state of mind is disintegrating into fear and paranoia because he feels guilty for causing the death of Yan who is the undercover cop sent to infiltrate the mob triad. Ming tries so hard to make up for what he has done his bad past spying on the police and for Yan whom he still feels a special bond.Ming is losing his mind that poor fool and hard as he tries to redeem himself well it's not gonna happen.There are a lot of flashbacks in this movie which I warn the viewer is a little confusing at first. One has to pay utmost attention to this movie in order to understand everything. This movie also talks about Yan's life before his death. Yan is being treated like crap by his mob boss and the only thing that saves him from mentally falling apart is the unwavering support of the police chief and the pretty police psychologist who kinda has a crush on him. Andy Lau is disturbingly brilliant as Ming. Watching this man's mental state falling apart is not easy. At one point he even develops a split personality. Tony Leung as Yan is sympathetic amusing and he has some rare funny scenes with the psychologist.The rest of the actors in this movie give outstanding performances. The twist in the end of the movie is terrific and ..... sad.After viewing the first movie I can't help but feel bad that these two men Ming and Yan were caught up in their bad circumstances and were totally used by their bosses. They were screwed over real bad.This last IA movie continues the theme of two men unable to live their true lives but are trapped in their masks undercover forever.The IA movies both first and third are great psychological thrillers. There's not a lot of violence and it's more of a character study. I recommend all viewers to see IA 1 and IA 3 I didn't see IA 3 so I can't recommend it. They are the most memorable Chinese gangstercop film I've seen in a long time.I give IA 3 a sold B".

Ming tries so hard to make up for what he has done his bad past spying on the police and for Yan whom he still feels a special bond.Ming is losing his mind that poor fool and hard as he tries to redeem himself well it's not gonna happen.There are a lot of flashbacks in this movie which I warn the viewer is a little confusing at first. One has to pay utmost attention to this movie in order to understand everything. This movie also talks about Yan's life before his death. Yan is being treated like crap by his mob boss and the only thing that saves him from mentally falling apart is the unwavering support of the police chief and the pretty police psychologist who kinda has a crush on him. Andy Lau is disturbingly brilliant as Ming. Watching this man's mental state falling apart is not easy. At one point he even develops a split personality. Tony Leung as Yan is sympathetic amusing and he has some rare funny scenes with the psychologist.The rest of the actors in this movie give outstanding performances. The twist in the end of the movie is terrific and ..... sad.After viewing the first movie I can't help but feel bad that these two men Ming and Yan were caught up in their bad circumstances and were totally used by their bosses. They were screwed over real bad.This last IA movie continues the theme of two men unable to live their true lives but are trapped in their masks undercover forever.The IA movies both first and third are great psychological thrillers. There's not a lot of violence and it's more of a character study. I recommend all viewers to see IA 1 and IA 3 I didn't see IA 3 so I can't recommend it. They are the most memorable Chinese gangstercop film I've seen in a long time.I give IA 3 a sold B";

	schema:reviewBody "You know how the 3rd installment in The Godfather trilogy is handsdown the lower rank installment compared to the previous 2? Well it's the same here this is a very bland and boring sequel that tried to milk the story as much as it could. I thoroughly enjoyed the first Infernal Affairs and the second one was okay. But this third one just added in bunch of elements and characters to milk the story into a franchise. With the ending for the first one I know it can be very difficult to expand the story. But they went for it anyways and the results are disastrous. So what this is is a prequel and a sequel to the first one. So they can bring back some of the deceased character that don't have all that much to do within the screen time. Chen Wingyan was one of my favorite character as the ballsy undercover cop. But in this he has almost nothing to do so it focuses in on his relationship with his friends which was already settled. And more on the romance between him and his psychiatrist. And let me tell you the romance between the two is boring to sit through and just seemed like a muddled mess. The psychiatrist is just there for plot device when it comes to the ending. I did like the cat and mouse game between Lau Kinming the mole from the previous one and Superintendent Yeung Kamwing whole plays Lau's rival as his equal. When it comes to his methodical planning and clever ways to out think his opponents. I think they should have played more with this instead of skimming over it. Because it sort of reminded me of the confrontation between Walter White and Gus Fring. I wouldn't be surprised if Breaking Bad borrowed some of the cat and mouse elements from this film. However some of the dialogues are so corny despite the characters trying to deliver it in a cool fashion. Overall this is a incoherent and boring finale to tie up loose ends.510".

The trouble is we keep slipping back into the past so we can see how this guy ties in with it all. To be honest it's a bit of a mess but here's a brief summary while I can still remember it summary haters and those that don't wish to know about the plot take some bad guys out while I write the next paragraph.Lau Kin Ming has now been cleared of any wrongdoing in the death of the undercover cop Chan Wing Yan. He can now concentrate on finding other moles in the Police force. His attention is drawn to SP Yeung Kam Wing who seems to be keeping his cards very close to his chest. Another candidate is Shen Chen a man who at one time was Hon Sam's partner. Not everybody is who they seem to be and add to this a lot of flashing backwards and forwards in time it makes for a rather confusing plot Think I'll leave it there I'm getting confused.It's pretty well made but it seems very cobbled together and has little coherence. The plot is very hard to follow and a bit of a mess of a screenplay doesn't really help. Performance wise Tony Leung Chiu Wai was pretty good as Chan Wing Yan as was Andy Lau as Lau Kin Ming. Of the rest Leon Lai did a decent job as the enigmatic SP Yeung Kam Wing and Daoming Chen was pretty good as Shen Chen.The first two films were really good and so I found it hard to believe this one could be so bad. It almost feels like it was rushed out too quickly after the success of the first two and suffered greatly for it. It certainly lacks the punch of the first two and as such is a rather disappointing conclusion to the trilogy. NOT recommended.My Score 4.610".

The problem for him is that his boss Yeung is also searching for any of Sam's moles left in the force. Doctor Lee takes a much greater role in this film as Chan Wingyan is ordered to see her after assaulting a Triad member in a restaurant and Lau sees her to learn more about Chan Wingyan's activities.While I think this was probably the weakest of the three films it was still pretty good and anybody who enjoyed the first two films really should watch this as it neatly wraps up the story. Having missed the second film Tony Leung and Andy Lau are back as Chan Wingyan and Lau and once again they put in fine performances other notable stars are Leon Lai as Yeung and Kelly Chen as Doctor Lee the psychiatrist. The earlier parts of the film are mostly action free but there are some good action scenes later on there are also some nicely humorous scenes as Chan Wingyan tries to avoid being hypnotised by Doctor Lee.".

Its so complex and so messy but at the end it ends up to be a brilliant script. I think the directors did a great job. This film should've deserve an award for best screenplay in both HK Film Awards and The Golden Horse Award. The other cast did a great job too. Especially Leon Lai. His sinister character just give me the chills and I really hate him. He too should've deserve an award for best supporting actor.8.110".

And pleasantly so.The first two instalments of the series were in most respects welldone copandrobbers fare with the first sequel explaining a piece of history in the story while making some nice adaptations from Godfather.  This second sequel however in fact requires some thought as the story unfolded. Spoilers Ahead I will try to reveal as little as possible since my own enjoyment was partially ruined by having read a review which gave the plot away.On the surface level the story weaves together the past and present showing the fall of the main character. Some would criticize the introduction of too many seemingly commercial elements. While the use of Leon Lai may be so his character is IMO an outsider necessary to unravel the mess that plagues the police department namely the many moles inserted by Han. The introduction of a mainland Chinese element ties in nicely with the second sequel again highlighting the fact that the affairs of Hong Kong is no longer merely its own. Han was indeed getting to be one of the biggest fishes in the pond and has attracted the attention of powers higher than just the Hong Kong Police. Although his untimely demise at the hands of one of his protege put an end to his mainland ambition the point is by and large neither here nor there in so far as the story behind this particular instalment is concerned.I am uncertain as to the true intentions of the directors but having seen the whole story knitted together so tightly I must conclude that the first half of the film was designed to mislead the audience in emphasizing the characters who turn out to be in fact subsidiary. The story does indeed focus on Lau as he sinks deeper and deeper into his personal hell. Personally I dislike schizophrenia as a dramatic device but I can accept it in this case since the previous instalments alluded to Lau's desire to turn himself clean.The actions of Han also explained the gaping hole in the first sequel namely his taking on the son of the former triad boss who tried to kill him and was in the process killed by Han. That is simply a supreme piece of human resource management we so often see in the real corporate world. And in having watched all three films in the series I must commend the writersdirectors on how Han's character has been fully developed and I would say his is the most fleshed out of all barring perhaps Chan Wing Yan.I would even go so far as to argue that the plot is a cut above any other Hong Kong directorwriter has produced so far both in terms of the plot consistency and its style.  One can not avoid comparing with Johnnie To who has regrettably floundered of late. Spoilers End There are however minor details that I have contention with1. In both sequels the writers still think as evidenced by the dialogue it is the Department of Justice which sentences people.2. In the first sequel the flag on Wong Sir's desk on the even of the Handover was an Australian flag.".

All it does is finish off Inspector Lau Kin Ming's Andy Laustory but leaves any other character's stories untold. The plot of this story if you can even call it that was based around the desire to feature Inspector Lau Kin Ming's Andy Lauand Dr. Lee Sum Yee Kelly Chen as much as possible. Watching Ming's character fall from grace was all good and well but the movie left giant plot holes. 1 Why would Chan Wing Yan Tony Leung Chiu Wai be willing to help SP Wong Chi Shing Anthony Wong if he conspired to kill his father and also killed his halfbrother? At the end of IF2 he seems horrified and distraught after the SP Wong kills his half brother yet in IF1 he is communicating with him like nothing happened? 2 Besides not answering this question IF3 just raises more. Why would Chan Wing Yan Tony Leung Chiu Wai be willing to keep working for Hon Sam Eric Tsang if he was purposely set up by him? You even see Tsui Waikeung Chapman To get out of Sam's car and in IF1 they are suddenly completely trusted by Sam and even loyal to him? The movie itself is drawn out and painstakingly slow or it jumps around from time period to time period confusingly. The movie also decides to introduce two completely new characters who are not properly introduced until midend movie which makes it even more confusing. It does not resemble the previous two movies in any way. The fact that Ming Andy Lau becomes schizophrenic only adds to the confusing showing the viewer visual hallucinations when it is already quite clear that the audience already knows he has gone crazy. NB The scene where Mary Carina Lau appears and shoots him in the mental health institute. Furthermore when Ming Andy Lau shoots himself in the head he doesn't die? In fact they state he has brain damage to accompany his schizophrenia which was needed because??? He needed more metal problems??? 3 If we assume InspectorSP Yeung Kam Wing Leon Lai is a mole then why does he try to set up Sam? And why does he not kill Chan Wing Yan Tony Leung Chiu Wai when he knows he is a undercover cop. Alternatively if we assume he is clean how does he have the meeting with Sam in the library? If this is a delusion in inspector Min's Andy Lau mind this was not clear at all. But if SP Yeung Leon Lai was clean we need to ask why didn't Chan Wing Yan Tony Leung Chiu Wai turn to them to clear his name in IF1? Because... the writers did not think this last movie through.Therefore this movie only takes away from the first two. It only gets a 5 because of some of the artistic features it has but the story line is missing and flawed. Minor complaints 1 Del Piero Dion Lam was not shown at all but he was suppose to be always with Tsui Waikeung Chapman To and his equal in rank. 2 In IF1 we assume that the little girl at his funeral is Chan Wing Yan's Tony Leung Chiu Wai daughter. Is anyone else but me interested in that? Where the heck is the love story in this whole series?".

Honestly I had never heard of it before finding it in the 5 bin but I like Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg the leads and the premise seemed interesting essentially a separated married couple who are still best friends and do everything together it just didn't work out to be married. There are funny parts but not enough to label it a comedy or romcom and certainly drama but not enough to be considered dramatic. It's not even really a love story. And it's no actionpacked specialeffectsladen blockbuster. I guess what it is is a decent downtoearth story from Hollywood  I KNOW about realtype characters in realistic situations that viewers can relate to with a decent cast even pacing and with a sensible ending. Definitely worth a look. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "'CELESTE  JESSE FOREVER' Four Stars Out of Five Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg play a divorcing couple who remain best friends and inseparable until one meets someone new. The film is equal parts comedy and drama and actually allows both Jones and Samberg to show off their acting chops and do something a little more serious for a change. It was written by Jones as well along with fellow actor Will McCormack who also costars in the film. Lee Toland Krieger directed the film but Jones and McCormack were nominated for Best First Screenplay at the 2013 Independent Spirit Awards. The film has received great reviews as well and I think deservingly so. It's a funny and insightful film and both Jones and Samberg shine in it.Jones plays Celeste a trend analyzer who runs a media business with her friend Scott Elijah Wood. Samberg plays Jesse an unemployed artist still struggling to find work. The two were high school sweethearts who married young and have now been separated for several months while they finalize their divorce. Their friends Beth Ari Graynor and Tucker Eric Christian Olsen who are engaged think it's odd that they spend so much time together and act like they're still a couple. Jesse's friend Skillz McCormack encourages him to start dating. Jesse is reluctant to follow his advice because he believes Celeste will come around and they'll get back together. Celeste ended things with Jesse though because she thinks he's taken so long to find work and make something of himself. When Jesse tells Celeste he's having a baby with his beautiful new girlfriend Veronica Rebecca Dayan it throws her for a loop and causes her to reevaluate her life and her feelings for Jesse.The film is told more through Celeste's point of view and it's nice to see a romantic comedy that seems true to life and revolves around the woman having a mental breakdown rather than the guy. Jones is fantastic in the role and her and McCormack's script is smart and insightful. Samberg is great as well and it's nice to see him trying his hand at drama and doing so successfully. He and Jones still have plenty of truly comedic moments as well as does the rest of the cast and they also have beautiful chemistry. Krieger's directing adds the perfect feel and beautiful look to the movie as well. This is an all around well done romantic dramedy and an impressive career step for both Jones and Samberg!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at httpswww.youtube.comwatch?v6xzh1FLmMq4".

	schema:headline " Jones and Samberg Forever";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is pure candy. Rashida Jones wrote a story about a couple who love each other enough to call it quits while they're still in love. Both characters have flaws but Samberg's character is to blame for the divorce because he's a child who is content to let his upwardly mobile wife carry the couple's financial responsibilities. As a result Jone's character loses respect for him and finds it hard to relate to him as a wife but feels more like a mother. This is a common problem in relationships these days and this script jumps right into the middle of the subject. The chemistry between Jones and Samberg is very believable and they have the same quirk factor so it's heartbreaking to watch their lives move in different directions when Samberg's beautiful onenightstandbabymama shows up. The guy just can't do anything right. Then he decides to do something right and suddenly Jones' starts back walking and taking inventory of what's out there versus what she already had. Elijah Wood was a nice touch as Rashida's gay business partner. Ari Gaynor played a peach of a best friend. In fact all the supporting actors were perfect in this romantic drama comedy that required rapid fire quips flippancy and gut wrenching truths culminating in a tearful confrontation between the two main characters that brought me to tears with its heartbreaking authenticity.Seems like Miss Jones is more than a pretty face and Andy Samberg has range. If I had a criticism it would be that the film seemed primarily about Rashida's character which made her character seem controlling and self absorbed. This made it a little harder to empathize with her character however she redeemed herself in the scene where she fell into and out of Samberg's trash can snooping and got caught doing it. Hilarious. Chris Messina added a nice possibility.A very enjoyable and entertaining film.".

	schema:headline " Rashida Jones becomes a true star with talent. An actress you should keep your eye on in the future";
	schema:reviewBody "Celeste and Jesse Forever is a more honest look at breakups and divorce than most romantic dramedies of the last couple of years. The film had a lot of thoughtfulness to it was delicately filmed and full of wit and raw emotion. The downside though is that it has an overly familiar formula that has been done to death now with films like The BreakUp Forgetting Sarah Marshall Take This Waltz Friends with Kids etcetera. The film just gets lost in that evergrowing genre even though it's quite the gem and probably the most relevant version of that specific formula I've seen lately.The performances were genuine and charming with an undeniable likable cast. Rashida Jones is becoming one of my favorite actresses of today and I think Celeste and Jesse Forever is her true breakthrough performance. Rashida plays Celeste who is in the process of finalizing her divorce from her husband Jesse who still lives with her and are oddly close friends still. Jesse played with corky poise by Andy Samberg soon starts dating to move on which thrills Celeste until his past fling pops up in his life again and reveals that she is pregnant. Celeste finds it harder than ever to move on and all she is feeling is regret. I think the film's process of his or her struggle of moving on was naturally dealt with as there is no Hollywood ending or overuse of sentimentality. The film in the end doesn't sugarcoat anything which was a breath of fresh air in that aspect. The supporting cast was not half bad either and it's always great to watch Ari Graynor who plays Celeste's best friend Beth. Ari Graynor to me is a talented actress and it's about time she deserves a leading role and put an end to playing sidekicks.Director Lee Toland Krieger seems to be a personable director and connects with the audience in a timely matter. There were a couple of quiet simple moments of poignancy and then balanced it with humor effortlessly. The use of songs fits this film like a glove and went with the flow. Writers and stars of the film Will McCormack and Rashida Jones should definitely collaborate again because the writing was just filled with honest humor and thoughtfulness which created great energy for the film.Overall it's not a groundbreaking romantic comedy but Rashida Jones is such a mesmerizing witty and intelligent actress in this film that you will fall in love with it.".

	schema:headline " Celeste and Jesse uses its humor to subvert the it's complicated relationship formula";
	schema:reviewBody "Lots of comedies in the last year or so have focused on whether two people can be involved sexually without being involved romantically. Celeste and Jesse Forever asks if two people who were involved sexually can be involved platonically. Both beat the dead horse of complicated relationships in film but what's nice about Celeste and Jesse is that it never loses its comic edge in spite of melodrama.Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg star as the titular couple in the process of a divorce but because they spent so long as best friends they have no concept of needing to draw boundaries.It's a tough sell early on that two people could go through a divorce yet essentially live together and spend time together in a somewhat intimate fashion. Jones who cowrote the script with Will McCormack who has a supporting role chooses to make Celeste and Jesse opposites in terms of professional status he's a slacker artist she's a bigdeal trend forecaster in order to justify why despite their fabulous onscreen chemistry they're not meant to stay married. It takes a bit of story wizardry namely physical obstacles that force them apart but somehow it makes sense probably because Jones and Samberg are so likable.The story then plays out like the emotional roller coaster of a relationship between two people who feel one thing but do another. It's exhausting at times as a thirdparty observer to watch them fall in and out of the same predictable problems. A few scenes will certainly elicit shouts at the screen of just get back together already! or stop screwing around and end it!  depending on the scene.Naturally each character has his and her attempts to rebound by going on dates with other people and trying new relationships. To this point we've seen enough of the formula to know how that part of the story goes two former lovers get mad at each other the one who didn't really want to split rebounds first the other says they're really happy for that person but secretly can't stand it etc. That's all here in Celeste and Jesse Forever.So what's the saving grace? Something that makes Celeste and Jesse stand out from the pack? The answer is the simple refusal to ever take itself too seriously. Without it the film would likely devolve into a train wreck of predictable moments. In spite of the absurd tear count in the movie Celeste is never shy about cracking a joke nor the script afraid go out on a limb with something more extreme and less believable. This in a movie that so fiercely tries to capture the gray area in relationships in a truthful way. Humor keeps the film in check especially for us who would otherwise happily chop up the script and divide the pieces into piles marked realistic and unrealistic. The quirkier tone and moments maintain the soft illusion of a more fantastical reallife relationship story. Director Lee Toland Krieger nicely flows back and forth between both upcloseandpersonal realism and more standardorder comedy camerawork. On a few occasions he makes bold choices some that work some that backfire but the comic and dramatic moments almost never butt heads.Life in Los Angeles is for many a fantasy of a sort and Celeste and Jesse could easily be deemed a story that could only happen in L.A. In addition to the frozen yogurt and the exposure of the fraud that is trendy exercise Celeste works in the entertainment industry and postJesse she's set up on all these dates with successful creative people. Scenes take place in all kinds of exotic clubs so much of the context surrounding these characters oozes with a superficiality that makes the film both great and disturbing.A little more troubling is the legit problem that Jesse disappears in large chunks of this film. There's a reason Celeste comes first in the billing and that's because the movie only shows intimate moments featuring her and the ones she shares with Jesse. Samberg doesn't get much of a chance to prove himself as a talent that can go below the surface. The script treats Jesse like a child kind of like the way Celeste sees him. There's artist value to this decision but the moments between the two of them are too lopsided in our minds. Great romance movies get you charged up because you feel a certain way about both characters and in this film we only really feel what Celeste feels.There's something special in Celeste and Jesse however some rare ability to see the humor in the personally tragic the potential for levity and irony in any situation. The emotional place that these two best friends arrive at in the end might not be as satisfying as that in a strong romance or romcom nor as poetic as in a tragedy but with its playful disposition it manages to carve out a place that's different one that stands out from the pack just enough.Steven CThanks for reading!

It takes a bit of story wizardry namely physical obstacles that force them apart but somehow it makes sense probably because Jones and Samberg are so likable.The story then plays out like the emotional roller coaster of a relationship between two people who feel one thing but do another. It's exhausting at times as a thirdparty observer to watch them fall in and out of the same predictable problems. A few scenes will certainly elicit shouts at the screen of just get back together already! or stop screwing around and end it!  depending on the scene.Naturally each character has his and her attempts to rebound by going on dates with other people and trying new relationships. To this point we've seen enough of the formula to know how that part of the story goes two former lovers get mad at each other the one who didn't really want to split rebounds first the other says they're really happy for that person but secretly can't stand it etc. That's all here in Celeste and Jesse Forever.So what's the saving grace? Something that makes Celeste and Jesse stand out from the pack? The answer is the simple refusal to ever take itself too seriously. Without it the film would likely devolve into a train wreck of predictable moments. In spite of the absurd tear count in the movie Celeste is never shy about cracking a joke nor the script afraid go out on a limb with something more extreme and less believable. This in a movie that so fiercely tries to capture the gray area in relationships in a truthful way. Humor keeps the film in check especially for us who would otherwise happily chop up the script and divide the pieces into piles marked realistic and unrealistic. The quirkier tone and moments maintain the soft illusion of a more fantastical reallife relationship story. Director Lee Toland Krieger nicely flows back and forth between both upcloseandpersonal realism and more standardorder comedy camerawork. On a few occasions he makes bold choices some that work some that backfire but the comic and dramatic moments almost never butt heads.Life in Los Angeles is for many a fantasy of a sort and Celeste and Jesse could easily be deemed a story that could only happen in L.A. In addition to the frozen yogurt and the exposure of the fraud that is trendy exercise Celeste works in the entertainment industry and postJesse she's set up on all these dates with successful creative people. Scenes take place in all kinds of exotic clubs so much of the context surrounding these characters oozes with a superficiality that makes the film both great and disturbing.A little more troubling is the legit problem that Jesse disappears in large chunks of this film. There's a reason Celeste comes first in the billing and that's because the movie only shows intimate moments featuring her and the ones she shares with Jesse. Samberg doesn't get much of a chance to prove himself as a talent that can go below the surface. The script treats Jesse like a child kind of like the way Celeste sees him. There's artist value to this decision but the moments between the two of them are too lopsided in our minds. Great romance movies get you charged up because you feel a certain way about both characters and in this film we only really feel what Celeste feels.There's something special in Celeste and Jesse however some rare ability to see the humor in the personally tragic the potential for levity and irony in any situation. The emotional place that these two best friends arrive at in the end might not be as satisfying as that in a strong romance or romcom nor as poetic as in a tragedy but with its playful disposition it manages to carve out a place that's different one that stands out from the pack just enough.Steven CThanks for reading!

	schema:headline " BFFs on the Verge of Divorce";
	schema:reviewBody "Celeste Rashida Jones is the owner of a media market firm in Los Angeles but given the recent publication of her nonfiction book about the direction American pop culture has headed she prefers to think of herself as a trend forecaster. Jesse Andy Samberg has artistic talent but is currently unemployed and seems rather indifferent about finding a new job. High school sweethearts who tied the knot they have been separated for six months and are in the final stages of divorcing. That hasn't stopped them from remaining the best of friends they still go to restaurants sing in harmony with the radio mime hugs for each other by crossing their arms and cupping their hands and perpetuate a game where they pretend that a tube of petroleum jelly is a tiny penis. Although Jesse has moved out of the main house he lives in his studio located on the same property which Celeste doesn't seem to mind. They even say that they love each other.Much like the recently released Lola Versus Celeste and Jesse Forever takes a fairly standard romantic comedy concept and fine tunes it for more indieminded audiences. This is not to suggest that the plotting or characterizations are any less manufactured it simply means that the film is overall quirkier subtler and not as easily attracted to the idea of a fairytale ending. I liked the title characters although for most of the film I struggled to empathize with them in large part because they persisted in being so caviler about their feelings for each other. Although Celeste is a right fighter and control freak and although Jesse has the emotional maturity of a fiveyearold they're both in denial about the reality of the separation and lack the courage to admit that they really do belong together.Fortunately the final scenes helped to reshape some of my perceptions. Essentially the film is a cautionary tale of not taking relationships for granted. For Celeste it's a journey towards relinquishing control and accepting the mistakes she has made. For Jesse it's about realizing that he has made his bed and now has to lay in it. Both changes come about as the result of a plot twist that actually hasn't been given away in the ad campaign. The publicity department at Sony Pictures Classics deserves a lot of credit here we live in an age when trailers and TV spots will either hint too strongly at a crucial plot point or altogether spoil it a reality audiences don't seem to care about anymore. I'm going to follow Sony's lead and keep my mouth shut. Should you decide to go see this film you deserve to actually be surprised.What I can say is that the other people in Celeste and Jesse's life seem genuinely bothered by their current arrangement. Jesse's potheaded best friend for example is too focused on the opposite sex and too under the influence to say anything of value which should tell you a thing or two about how he copes with life in general. Celeste's best friend Beth Ari Graynor seems downright devastated by everything perhaps because she's currently engaged and fears her marriage may someday end up like Celeste and Jesse's. Celeste is fairly close with her gay coworker Scott Elijah Wood and repeatedly runs the developing situation by him for his two cents. He's probably the most levelheaded character in the entire film although he isn't saying what the audience is already thinking.Celeste will make a surprising emotional connection with a spoiled teen pop star named Riley Banks Emma Roberts who goes to Celeste's company in order have her newest album marketed for today's audiences. To reveal the hilarious mistake made in the logo design would be doing you a great disservice here is a visual gag that comes out of nowhere and in the best possible sense throws the audience for a loop. Suffice it to say the personality clash is palpable and the two initially want nothing to do with each other. This is not a simple case of Celeste eventually discovering the real Riley Banks it's more a matter of Celeste coming to terms with who Riley is and realizing that even a young woman packaged and sold within an inch of her life can have her heart broken.Another important subplot involves a man named Paul Chris Messina who intentionally signs himself up for yoga classes to meet women. He uses that method to enter Celeste's life and although she initially resists him romcom logic dictates that the two will eventually start dating. What's not made explicitly clear is whether or not they will end up together he's a decent enough guy although the situation with Jesse who's always so passive about everything will repeatedly complicate matters. I've given passing grades to numerous romantic comedies but it's always refreshing when filmmakers go for something unconventional. Celeste and Jesse Forever not only stars Rashida Jones but was also cowritten by her which proves surprisingly beneficial to the story. Who better to capture the essence of a character than the woman who contributed to her very creation? Chris Pandolfi www.atatheaternearyou.net".

This ninety one minute movie takes forever.A good montage of their courting days is fast and fun with quick shots of Celeste and Jesse getting together and writing their initials in the sand.

I am not surprised it was an audience favorite at Sundance. Even the audience on a Monday night at Arclight Hollywood clapped... The cast is great and Rashida Jones proves that she can carry a movie.

	schema:reviewBody "Not even the comedy skills of Jones can save this film from being a boring romantic comedy that is telling too much stories that I did not feel emotionally invested on the centre relationship Sometimes in film we get to see relationships begin and end and this film is an example of these type of films but like most romantic comedies it is boring to watch especially with characters like these. The film is about Celeste Martin Rashida Jones and Jesse Abrams Andy Samberg who after being married at the start of film till the end are going through the hard time that is a divorce. During this period they stay best friends until the time when they have to move on and date. Of course Celeste struggles with Jesse moving on while she has to deal with her own work problems which include her gay best friend and a pop star she does not like.The film suffers from some of the clique moments that happen in a story like this but that is not even the worst thing about the film. If they film mostly focused on the key relationship maybe I would have enjoyed the film more but of course some other plot lines such as an annoying new untalented pop star and a best friend's wedding. The development of the film is fine just because the main actors are charming through the chemistry they have. The film does take a risk in the way it ends because most films like this would somehow find a way in the find to change everything letting the mains get back together but in the end of this film the decision to let them separate was different and the only real positive thing I can say about the film.Rashida Jones playing Celeste and she plays her usual character persona that she has been using for some time and even when it is a delightful character I wanted to see her do something different because I do like her as an actress. Also Jones was the co writer so I can only blame her for writing this character that is so similar to most performances she gives. Andy Samberg plays Jesse he just for me does not have much presence on screen and even when he tries his comedy I was not laughing at his jokes but rolling my eyes. Especially when most of his dramatic scenes are with Jones he just has no talent and made the film even worse then it could have been. All the supporting players are just on screen for these two mains but sometimes in one scene they can be better. Some of those actors are Chris Messina Elijah Wood and Will McCormack in their small roles.The film is not good and trying to make me care for characters in this situation I would usually feel happy for them. The writing is bad and some of the acting is not funny when it try's to be. I would not recommend watching no matter how much you like the actors or romantic comedies.MOVIE GRADE D MVP Rashida Jones".

	schema:headline " Authentic and surprising movie dealing with relationships and heartbreaks";
	schema:reviewBody "At last love wins. You guys are lucky to be best friends.Celeste and Jesse Forever is an authentic romantic comedy directed by Lee Toland Krieger winner of the Independent Spirit Award in 2010 for the screenplay of The Vicious Kind and written by first timers Rashida Jones and Will McCormack. They are mostly known for their acting abilities but they did receive an Independent Spirit nomination for their collaboration in this screenplay. Rashida Jones also stars in this film and McCormack has a supporting role as well. The story feels real and authentic and despite the fact that it stars Andy Samberg this is not as much as a comedy as it is a romantic drama. This is a very different role than what Samberg has us used to and he gives a very convincing performance alongside Rashida Jones who really delivers here. This may be her best performance to date. What I enjoyed most about their characters is that they were deeply flawed and vulnerable towards each other but despite that they still managed to be really likable. I thought it was a very honest portrayal about two best friends who fall in love with each other at a very young age and have problems making the transition to adulthood together. In a way this is a very different romantic comedy since it begins sort of upside down with the romantic montage at the beginning of the movie and the disintegration of their relationship from then on. I really was surprised with the opening of the film since I really didn't know what this movie was about. The movie transitions nicely from being serious at times to being more playful at others but it's all handled in a very authentic and believable way. The movie begins with a romantic montage between Jesse Andy Sandberg and Celeste Rashida Jones two best friends in love with each other with a nice indie soundtrack in the background. When the story begins we are surprised to discover that the two friends aren't actually in a relationship anymore since they have been separated for 6 months and are planning on getting divorced after six years of marriage. You wouldn't know that if you were an outsider because the couple seems to get along with each other perfectly. Jesse and Celeste remain close friends and spend almost all day talking to each other. Jesse also happens to be living in Celeste's guest house as he is currently unemployed and seems to be a bit of a slacker. Celeste on the other hand is a successful trend forecaster who has recently written a book on the matter. It seems that the main issue between them during their marriage was that Jesse was a little too childish and irresponsible. Anyway they seem to get along better now as friends. They spend a lot of time with their friends Beth Ari Graynor and Tucker Eric Christian Olsen who are engaged and think that the two should work out their issues. Celeste is currently working for an important client a pop artist sensation named Riley Emma Roberts along with her partner Scott Elijah Wood. Their friendship is put to the test when Jesse begins dating another woman and Celeste struggles to let go of feelings she thought weren't there anymore. I really enjoyed this film because it tackled the issues of best friends and breakup in a very authentic and real way. Rashida Jones gives a strong performance although she did go a little over the top with her reaction over Jesse dating someone else. She plays this character that thinks is so successful and smarter than everyone else. That is basically what hurt her relationship with Jesse since she considers him a slacker who seems to be heading nowhere with his life. She feels like Jesse is too immature for her but at the same time that is what she loves about him because when the two are together they do a lot of childish things together. Their relationship is complicated and the film depicts it in a very authentic way. This is an enjoyable indie romantic drama that is definitely worth your time. Rashida Jones should get some stronger roles offered her way because she's a talented actress and proved here that she can carry a movie. This is a strong emotional film that will leave you with a smile on your face and at the same time a sense of nostalgia. I agree with Mary Pols from TIME magazine where she said I'd rather watch five divorce movies like this than one more featuring Katherine Heigl getting married. Break up can be really hard and this movie shows it in an authentic way. httpestebueno10.blogspot.com".

They have multiple inside jokes sing along to the radio together and have been together since high school. However Celeste and Jesse are separated and have been for the last six months. Jesse the less successful of the two professionally moved out out their house but only to the guest housestudio in the back. They still have dinner with their friends together and Celeste perhaps without realizing it still wears a heartshaped necklace which says CJ 4ever.Celeste and Jesse Forever is a first time writing credit for Rashida Jones and Will McCormack who plays Skillz the onoff again couple's marijuana supplier and sounding board. For first time screenwriters the screenplay is noticeably witty without tripping into slapstick or tried and true romantic comedy clichs. There are a few problems though Celeste is a successful trend forecaster what? and the line Are we really doing this? or Is this happening right now? pops up in almost every situation. When Celeste calls out a coffee shop line cutter the guys says Are we really going this right now? When yoga classmate a Paul Chris Messina tries to ask out Celeste she naturally responds Are you really doing this right now? Yes this is trivial but if dialogue like this distracts the audience during the film it is unnecessary.Jesse wants to get back together with Celeste. Yes they fight and he mooches off of his wife because he is an unemployed artist but they are so good together. After getting his hopes dashed on too many times Jesse finally screws up his nerve and moves out. This knocks the wind out of Celeste. For her Jesse is as predictable as the morning commute. When she doesn't feel like having his company she just sends him back outside to the studio. But now he's gone. Does Celeste even know who she is sans Jesse?At work Celeste works comfortably for Scott Elijah Wood a homosexual who makes tacky gay jokes to try and seem more gay. Aside from trend forecasting and promoting her new book 'Shitegeist' which is about the death of quality pop culture their firm also markets and brands artists. Their new client is Riley Banks Emma Roberts who is written as a completely vapid imitation or actual representation of Keha. Celeste and Riley have an uncomfortable relationship as Celeste looks down on Riley as all that is wrong with the world and Riley cannot stand Celeste's condescension. It does not help that Riley's new music single is 'Do It On My Face'.Perhaps Celeste finds it so hard to work with Riley and competently function in daytoday life because she is having second thoughts and regrets. Was Jesse really so bad? Now that is he is out from under her shadow what if Jesse straightens himself out matures but meets someone else? These are weighty issues for a comedy which turns out to be deeper and incorporates more drama than the average rom com. Celeste and Jesse Forever is an admirable start for two new writers a worthy relationship study and I recommend it for any young couple on a Friday night.".

When Celeste calls out a coffee shop line cutter the guys says Are we really going this right now? When yoga classmate a Paul Chris Messina tries to ask out Celeste she naturally responds Are you really doing this right now? Yes this is trivial but if dialogue like this distracts the audience during the film it is unnecessary.Jesse wants to get back together with Celeste. Yes they fight and he mooches off of his wife because he is an unemployed artist but they are so good together. After getting his hopes dashed on too many times Jesse finally screws up his nerve and moves out. This knocks the wind out of Celeste. For her Jesse is as predictable as the morning commute. When she doesn't feel like having his company she just sends him back outside to the studio. But now he's gone. Does Celeste even know who she is sans Jesse?At work Celeste works comfortably for Scott Elijah Wood a homosexual who makes tacky gay jokes to try and seem more gay. Aside from trend forecasting and promoting her new book 'Shitegeist' which is about the death of quality pop culture their firm also markets and brands artists. Their new client is Riley Banks Emma Roberts who is written as a completely vapid imitation or actual representation of Keha. Celeste and Riley have an uncomfortable relationship as Celeste looks down on Riley as all that is wrong with the world and Riley cannot stand Celeste's condescension. It does not help that Riley's new music single is 'Do It On My Face'.Perhaps Celeste finds it so hard to work with Riley and competently function in daytoday life because she is having second thoughts and regrets. Was Jesse really so bad? Now that is he is out from under her shadow what if Jesse straightens himself out matures but meets someone else? These are weighty issues for a comedy which turns out to be deeper and incorporates more drama than the average rom com. Celeste and Jesse Forever is an admirable start for two new writers a worthy relationship study and I recommend it for any young couple on a Friday night.";

The film itself was emotional but there were also bits of humor involved with almost every scene. That itself gave me a relief from the nervousness I had felt for each character.

He's not goodlooking. He's a loser. He has no paycheck. He's acting like he's 18 but he's in his 30's. He's not particularly bright. Unless this guy has amazing hidden sexual talents though these were never hinted at and there were opportunities to do so I just don't get the appeal. That more than one woman all lovely to look at seems interested in him shocks me. Zero women should be interested in him. I'm used to such inexplicably attractive loser male characters being written by male writers but it's a shock to see women writing this too.Initially Celeste seems the better bet but she ends up being irritating too and what the heck is her job supposed to be? Is that a real job? Maybe the writers need to hang out somewhere other than Hollywood to get a sense of how real people earn their money.It's a movie about two people I'd never date never be friends with would cross the street to avoid the masturbation of tiny phallic object isn't even sophomoric. It's junior high humor and they do it REPEATEDLY. Save me. The only character who has any appeal is the pop star character. I liked how she was written to have hidden depths. The only scene I found at all funny was the bad first date with the photographer. And the soundtrack irritated me.And in the end this movie said nothing new about relationships. Yeah we get stuck with wrong people and it's hard to leave a marriage but this shouldn't be news to anyone over the age of 18.Unlikeable characters doing very little slowly to irksome music. Not a good way to spend your precious finite time.".

	schema:reviewBody "This may be the only movie you'll ever see where the 'Our Father' and 'Hail Mary' are recited in their entirety. Humphrey Bogart is the reluctant priest Father O'Shea whose masquerade at first is tentatively welcomed by a small Chinese village but who through a series of unforeseen events winds up becoming their savior. The tip off comes in an opening scene this priest carries a gun. We're left dangling for a while as the story unfolds and it's not until well past the half way point that O'Shea's identity is revealed to be that of an American flier who crashed in a remote Chinese province some three years earlier. When the real Father O'Shea dies from a bullet administered by Yang henchman Pao Ching James Carmody sees a way out of his forced service to Yang by donning the vestments of a priest.The romantic tension between O'Shea and missionary Anne Scott Gene Tierney is broached but never fully played out. O'Shea is familiarly comfortable in her presence she's entirely ill at ease to find her feelings being tested. The quandary is dealt with in such a way as to make a resolution virtually impossible and the finale leaves it that way even when she learns of his true identity.It took a long time for film makers to accept Oriental actors in leading roles. Lee J. Cobb of course is entirely miscast as warlord Mieh Yang but no more so than Boris Karloff Peter Lorre or a host of non Asian actors to portray Chinese detectives of an earlier era. Victor Sen Yung proved adequate and believable in a support role as John Wong the church sexton who challenges Father O'Shea to do the right thing when the situation calls for it. It seemed appropriate that he begin the legend of the Shenfu after the fate of seven villages is secured via a game of chance.I found it interesting that Sen Yung and Benson Fong appeared in this film after both saw work in the 1940's as the Number 2 and 3 sons of Charlie Chan. Curiously they never appeared as brothers together in any story during the series. Admittedly Fong's role in this one was almost a throw away as distraught husband Chun Tien whose wife died giving birth to a dead son. For his part Sen Yung would continue his later career in the employ of the Cartwright's on The Ponderosa.For sentimentalists the film's payoff near the end might bring a trickle to your eye. The young Chinese villagers offer their best rendition of 'My Old Kentucky Home' as Bogey's character is allowed to keep his secret by the Bishop's emissaries who replace him. That along with those incredibly lucky rolls of the dice might lead you to believe in Hail Mary endings.".

The role has great potential for suspense as to face one crisis after another as a result of his masquerade but for some reason his performance is overly restrained and unrewarding...

	schema:reviewBody "First this movie was based on a novel written by William E. Barrett  for those of you who are familiar with the movie with Sidney Poiter called Lilies of the Field this is another treasure that should be seen. Humphrey Bogart stars in this movie as a priest the only thing is he packs a pistol along with his Bible and tends to have his own style in doing things. His character is one of an air force flier Jim Carmody downed in China captured by a warlord and forced to work for him. One of the warlord's men slips up and shoots a priest sending Bogie over the edge. Since the priest died Bogie decides to wear the vestments and become Father O'Shea as he sees this as the perfect way to escape out from under the control of the warlord. One problem is when he gets to the mission he is now torn between the heavy burden of the clergy vestment he now wears and from saving himself for with the vestment comes duty. To make matters more complex Gene Tierney plays a nurse who is falling in love with this nononsense priest.There are 2 other reluctant missionaries a doctor and his wife  they tend to try to tell Father O'Shea to close the mission but Fr. O'Shea will have none of that.Fr. O'Shea is certainly making a name for himself in the small section of China he is in. From rattling off his sermon in English to the sleepy Chinese who do not understand to reciting the sermon in Chinese and watching every Chinese person in attendance awake and hear the words as if for the first time.A great scene with such give  take is that where Fr. O'Shea meets the oldest man in the village. The old man asks for a blessing and Fr. O'Shea delivers and then humbles himself to receive a blessing from the old man. Poignant and beautifully carried out.Trouble ensues when one of the warlord's men track Carmody down to the mission and we all know this spells trouble for Fr. O'Shea. Will he run or will he stay?This is a wonderful movie that instills a sense of duty over personal goals. During the filming of this movie Bogart was suffering from back pains and illness but it does not show up in the movie  a constant actor he pulls off the role of reluctant priest very well. And Tierney was on the verge of a breakdown but both portrayed their characters wonderfully. The whole movie is warm.This movie will appeal more to those with Christian values as it is easier for one to accept and understand as to why Carmody makes the decisions he makes. A priest you can respect.It's really a shame this movie is not yet on DVD. Also a shame that it isn't shown more.".

If the film had followed the formula of the author William Barrett it would have been a 10 as well as was Lillies of the Field the wonderful movie that was done of Barrett's novella.  Barrett wrote them both as entertaining stories  and as inspirational spiritual gems.  Lillies  the movie remained so. Left Hand  the movie did not.spoilers ahead Bogart as the bogus priest just does not play well.  Or maybe he would have worked better if the script had followed the book. But I would rather have seen Charlton Heston who as Ben Hur lets go of his vengeful anger in the end  a similar transformation of Jim CarmodyFather O'Shea in Left Hand of God who in the end does the right thing after all and is less concerned with saving his own skin than with saving the whole mission community  at great risk to himself.  This comes across so masterfully in the book.  Is it Bogey's fault that it does not do so in the movie?  Or the stilted dialogue? What were the script writers thinking of??A good deal of the story's charm is the constant circular thinking of Jim Carmody  downed American pilot trapped in China in the early days of communism.  The text is full of irony and wit and tension as he ponders dilemmas as they present themselves cascading upon each other without ceasing.  He finally flees by impersonating a murdered priest.  This is only meant to be a temporary solution.  He knows that his ruthless boss war lord Meih Yang will soon figure out how he escaped.  In the movie we do not even get a glimpse of Yang's lamasary.  The book better tells why Carmody must escape it and contains wonderful foreshadowing in his relationship with Mary Yin  a character nonexistent in the movie.Soon CarmodyO'Shea finds himself in a new trap  the mission itself.  If you dress like a priest you had better act like a priest!  The book makes it clear that the transformation of his character occurs not in the final crapshoot showdown with Meih Yang but long before in the quiet of the confessional as he hears the weary sins of those he has no right to listen to.  He does not know when he ceases being Jim Carmody and slowly becomes the priest  if not in actual fact.The love story is gentle  and pure.  How refreshing!  Jim Carmody renegade soldier for the war lord is definitely flawed and very human. Jim Carmody as Father O'Shea better but still flawed and still human has a new dilemma  how does he handle falling in love with Anne Scott a mission nurse and yet maintain his guise as a priest?  And what hope for them if he ever does escape China?  For Anne is a good Catholic. If she knew the blaspheming Father O'Shea was not really a priest she could never forgive him.  And yet as a priest she can never love him!  The romantic tension between them is exquisite  in the book.  In the movie it barely exists. I am glad this story comes from an earlier era because now it would probably be unnecessarily sexualized  as it no doubt would if a movie were made of it today.The censors of the time undoubtedly contributed to the movie's flaws.  Of all of the scenes they chose NOT to include the one where the priest goes up to the whore house to try to talk the women into giving up their lifestyle  prissy beyond belief  is one that the censorship problem would have been better off leaving out.  Sanitizing it adds nothing but confusion.  By contrast the book's dealing with this episode certainly tame by today's standards sparks with tension as the ladies do not just stand there senseless but jeer the priest and throw rocks at him in but one of the beautifully written ironies  Let she who is with sin cast the first stone!There is not much to criticize about Gene Tierney as Anne though she hasn't much to work with.  I agree with criticisms that Lee J Cobb should never have been cast as the oriental Meih Yang.  Agnes Moorehead comes across as little more than a stick figure  rare for her.  Again must be the script. What she could have done with the Beryl character from the book!  The lonely friendship and camraderie of the mission's only American females Anne and Beryl does not come across in the movie.  And the tense rivalry between CarmodyO'Shea and the doctor  so rich in the book  is stilted and irritating.  And where is the warmth and humor between the grumpy doctor and his longsuffering wife Beryl?  So frustrating not to have these wonderful relationships explored. As I write this I wonder why I even gave it a 6?  Must be out of respect and love for the characters as originally conceived by the author and grief for the movie that could have been but never was.The book is no longer in print but it should be.  My muchread copy long since having fallen apart I did find another in a used book store.  In today's era where pastors and priests are exposed as child molesters we deserve to hear about one who takes his vows seriously  even though technically he never TOOK the vows!  If you are a fan of Lillies of the Field you should by all means track down your own copy forget the movie and READ The Left Hand of God  William E. Barrett's forgotten masterpiece.".

Dmytryk like Bogart in the film pretended he was something he wasn't and submitted himself for a kind of absolution.Flier James Carmody is shot down while flying the hump in Kuomintang China during the Thirties and he's shot down in an isolated area where Chiang Kaishek's writ doesn't run. He gets drafted into warlord Lee J.

He wins over a lot of the villagers where the deceased priest was headed for. And he also wins over missionary lady Gene Tierney. And he becomes involved in a rather dubious miracle that saves the village.The key here is that Bogart is a lapsed Catholic himself in the film. Otherwise the whole thing would have no meaning whatsoever. Even so I'm still dubious myself about Bogart's attitude when all's said and done.Plot elements can be found as I said in The Bridge on the River Kwai and later on it was played for comedy in a military setting when Glenn Ford pretended he was a general in Imitation General in an obscure corner of the European theater in World War II.Bogey fans will consider this film a must others can take or leave it.".

Even so I'm still dubious myself about Bogart's attitude when all's said and done.Plot elements can be found as I said in The Bridge on the River Kwai and later on it was played for comedy in a military setting when Glenn Ford pretended he was a general in Imitation General in an obscure corner of the European theater in World War II.Bogey fans will consider this film a must others can take or leave it.";

As far as Bogart is concerned I rank this movie with the Caine Mutiny and above African Queen. Lee J. Cobb I found quite good too and much more credible than Curd Juergens in the Inn of sixth happiness. The rest of the cast gives I think a quite good idea of the missionary life in China. Which was the weak part in the otherwise good Sand Pebbles. I read the book at least once a year. It explains more of the movie plot and I recommend to anyone interested in the ethics of the film but it should have been too long if strictly respected in the screenplay. I'd rate the movie 9510 admitting though that Bogart is one of my favorite actors which could biase my judgment !".

At a Catholic mission in China  being longawaited Father O'Shea but there shows up Carmody posing as a cleric and he proves to be a twofisted guy .

Meanwhile  China disintegrates in civil war 19451949  warlords  revolution and fights between Maoists and nationalists. This is a sensitive film including emotions  interesting dialogue  a marvelous love story and fine performances . The hand of Edward Dmytryk tends to rely heavily on the enjoyable relationship between Bogart and Tierney . The film is pretty well  though results are rather dull and sincere with an abundance of narrative dialog . Interesting screenplay by Alfred Hayes based on the novel The Left Hand of God by William E. Barrett . Long time ago  William Faulkner completed an adaptation of the 1950 novel for director Howard Hawks  a longtime collaborator . Here Bogart in a new type of action role who proves to be surprisingly effective with the unusual character of an adventurerpilot who disguised himself as a Catholic cleric . Gene Tierney is as beautiful as ever as the attractive woman . However  being last starring screen appearance of actress Gene Tierney who had been suffering from mental illness for a number of years and entered various treatment centers . Support cast is frankly well  such as  Agnes Moorehead  E.G. Marshall  Jean Porter  Carl Benton Reid and Lee J Cobb is great as a warlord . The movie displays a luxurious and colorful cinematography by Franz Planer . Emotive and moving musical score by the classical composer Victor Young  including a stirring leitmotif . The motion picture was well directed by Edward Dmytryk  though being slowmoving and with penchant to weight rather heavily on the proceedings . A veteran filmmaker Dmytryck is one of Hollywood's most prolific directors who started his career in the early 40s . He was a craftsman whose career was interrupted by the activities of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee HUAC a congressional committee that employed ruthless tactics aimed at rooting out and destroying what it saw as Communist influence in Hollywood . A lifelong political leftist who had been a Communist Party member briefly during World War II Dmytryk was one of the socalled Hollywood Ten who refused to cooperate with HUAC and had their careers disrupted or ruined as a result . The committee threw him in prison for refusing to cooperate and after having spent several months behind bars  Dmytryk decided to cooperate . Dmytrick's biggest film was The Caine Mutiny  but he also realized another mutiny film titled  Mutiny with Angela Lansbury . Edward was an expert on warlike genre as Back to Batan  Battle of Anzio  Young lions and Western as Broken lance  Alvarez Kelly  Warlock  among others . Rating  6.510  better than average . It's recommended for drama enthusiasts and big stars lovers .".

Humphrey Bogart as a Catholic priest lands in a village somewhere between Sinkiang and Tibet among the mountains where there is a bandit gang threatening the villages under the chieftain Lee J. Cobb the perfect crook in all his films. It seems that Cobb and Humphrey have met before and the best scenes are between these two men very opposite but matching each other perfectly.Gene Tierney is the nurse in the village who has the misfortune of falling in love with her priest while E.G.Marshall makes one of his best performances as the village doctor married to the equally stalwart Agnes Moorehead the greatest realist in the film. The villagers also play an important part the school children the patients the local whorehouse the elder of the village  like in Soldier of Fortune the ethnic panorama here is of major interest. The backbone of the film though is the fantastic story. Humphrey plays one of his most complex and intriguing characters and does it more than well in perhaps his last real film and one of his very few in colour. The village is not only threatened by bandits and the civil war of China this is 1947 but also by the impending possibility that the mission has to be abandoned. E.G.Marshall and Bogart have many arguments about this. and they are never agreed. The conclusion is inevitable and although it's not a happy end it is in a way most satisfactory. It was after all the best of all possible endings.It's a beautiful film and one of Dmytryk's best. You recognize some of the arguments from The End of the Affair where God also played some part but here he does not intrude although he is used but it is rather more common and rational sense that has the last word here than any theology which actually is better done without.".

	schema:headline " An enjoyable film from the Bogart Collection";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie is set in 1947 just after the end of World War II and during the Chinese revolution where the Republicans and the Communists fought over the huge empire. This movie is set in the outer reaches of China in an area that is still controlled by a powerful warlord Yang and it opens with a priest father O'Shea arriving at a mission.At the beginning we assume that he is a priest but soon come to suspect otherwise. He has a huge amount of rapour yet seems reluctant to actually perform any of the duties that he does. Even then he seems to awaken a spirit in everybody around going out of his way to help. Things start to come to light when somebody walks into the mission and he punches him.O'Shea really isn't a priest but a pilot named James Carmody. He crashed over China and fell into the clutches of the Yang. He worked with him for a while as his second in command but saw it little more than a prison so when a priest was murdered Carmody saw it as an excuse to escape which indeed he did. Though he is hiding in the villages he knows that he cannot hide from Yang forever and even though the church offers sanctuary he knows that Yang does not abide by those rules.The title is interesting as it intones that it is different from the norm. The right hand is typically the one in which one's will is enforced. Carmody is not a priest and doesn't even believe yet he is able to touch the hearts of those around him. He is not exactly unorthodox but rather somebody who is not a member of the clergy yet seems to do a far better job than the clergymen do.

	onyx:emotionText "This movie is set in 1947 just after the end of World War II and during the Chinese revolution where the Republicans and the Communists fought over the huge empire. This movie is set in the outer reaches of China in an area that is still controlled by a powerful warlord Yang and it opens with a priest father O'Shea arriving at a mission.At the beginning we assume that he is a priest but soon come to suspect otherwise. He has a huge amount of rapour yet seems reluctant to actually perform any of the duties that he does. Even then he seems to awaken a spirit in everybody around going out of his way to help. Things start to come to light when somebody walks into the mission and he punches him.O'Shea really isn't a priest but a pilot named James Carmody. He crashed over China and fell into the clutches of the Yang. He worked with him for a while as his second in command but saw it little more than a prison so when a priest was murdered Carmody saw it as an excuse to escape which indeed he did. Though he is hiding in the villages he knows that he cannot hide from Yang forever and even though the church offers sanctuary he knows that Yang does not abide by those rules.The title is interesting as it intones that it is different from the norm. The right hand is typically the one in which one's will is enforced. Carmody is not a priest and doesn't even believe yet he is able to touch the hearts of those around him. He is not exactly unorthodox but rather somebody who is not a member of the clergy yet seems to do a far better job than the clergymen do. His different methods appear when Yang threatens the village and Carmody defeats him in a game of dice. The priests are horrified at this but the truth is that Carmody succeeded and whether they like it or not they must admit that he has an ability that not many others have.";

	schema:reviewBody "Humphrey Bogart's choice of movies to star in or be placed in by a studio didn't always please me. I'm not for example usually very into gangster pics. And there are a number of Bogart films better than this one Sabrina The Caine Muitiny The African Queen Key Largo Casablanca The Maltese Falcon and others . Yet this is one of my favorites of Bogart's perhaps because we see a different Bogart. A man who could be kind and gentle subtle and even sing...yet underneath there was a strength not very far below the surface. Bogart reportedly was extremely kind of Gene Tierney during the making of this movie she was suffering from mental illness that led to a long hiatus from the movies following this film. Perhaps that was who Bogie was as well.How likely such a plot could be is questionable but then again so are the plots of many movies. The plot is not the strength of this film. Rather the strength is of the characterizations of the principals. Bogart is fine as a fake priest he knows enough about Catholicism to get by but he also realizes his limitations...and he can still be the tough guy when needed. Gene Tierney as the potential love interest is interesting...and lovely. Lee J. Cobb as the Chinese war lord is surprisingly effective how did they do his eyes?. Agnes Moorehead is appropriately ditsy as a bit of a busybody albeit a wellintentioned one. E. G. Marshall is good as the mission's doctor although somehow I didn't think this allowed his talents to shine.I'm not a particular fan of Bogart's last two films so this is the film I like to remember as his last really fine performance. And when I watch it I always wonder what could have been had we been able to enjoy Bogie into his mature late50s and 60s.Highly recommended and when it comes out on DVD I'm sure it will grace quite a few home film libraries.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Left Hand of God is set in China in 1947 during the civil war between Chiang KaiShek's Kuomintang and Mao's Communists. A priest Father O'Shea arrives at a remote Catholic mission station where he is welcomed with open arms as the mission has been without a priest for some time since the death of his predecessor. O'Shea proves a popular and inspirational pastor but he is hiding a guilty secret. It turns out that he is not a priest at all but an American pilot named Jim Carmody who crashed his plane during World War II. Carmody was rescued by a local warlord General Yang and became his trusted adviser but decided to desert the General's service after witnessing atrocities carried out by his men. An additional complication comes in the shape of attractive mission nurse Anne Scott with whom Carmody has secretly fallen in love. The climax of the film comes when General Yang arrives insisting that Carmody rejoin his army or else he will burn down the village.The film can be seen as both a physical and a spiritual drama. Carmody is a lapsed Catholic and this is an important plot point were the character to have been written as a lifelong atheist the film would have been a very different one. An atheist for a start would probably not have had the knowledge of the Catholic faith to enable him to impersonate a priest convincingly. Carmody finds that his faith is beginning to return and finds himself in a dilemma. For a layman to impersonate a priest is in Catholic eyes a serious sin for which Carmody stands in need of absolution. Yet can he confess his imposture without destroying the faith of his congregation who have come to trust in him and who have derived genuine spiritual comfort from his bogus ministry? Carmody may not be a priest but as he says he has started to find in himself some of the qualities that a man would need to be a priest.I have never read the original novel by William Edmund Barrett but I understand that the author was a practising Catholic and the film has some similarities to the works of another Catholic author Barrett's British contemporary Graham Greene. Like a number of Greene's novels it takes place in an exotic setting and the theme is characteristically Greeneian. It reminded me somewhat of Greene's The Power and the Glory where the hero is a genuine priest but in his own eyes an unworthy one.By 1955 Humphrey Bogart was already seriously ill with the cancer that was to kill him two years later and The Left Hand of God was one of his last films he was to make only two further movies. Yet even towards the end of his life he was still keen to expand his range by taking new and challenging roles as in The Barefoot Contessa Sabrina a rare venture into romantic comedy and The Caine Mutiny in which unusually he gets to play a weak emotionally vulnerable character. The Caine Mutiny and The Left Hand of God were made by the same director Edward Dmytryk.Bogart was always a good actor but in some of his early films such as Dark Victory he could seem unconvincing when he ventured outside his familiar territory of film noir and crime dramas. In his later films from the fifties however he showed that he was more than just a good actor within a limited range and became a genuinely great one. His performance in The Left Hand of God is one of great power and subtlety he is paradoxically convincing both as a genuine priest which is what we at first believe him to be and as a bogus priest when his secret is unmasked.The other characters however are not so good. Gene Tierney as Anne a relatively minor role has little to do except look decorative. Lee J. Cobb is poor as General Yang making this menacing Chinese warlord seem neither Chinese nor menacing. In the fifties there was something of a tradition now fortunately defunct of white actors playing Oriental characters Jennifer Jones in Love is a ManySplendoured Thing Curd Jurgens and Robert Donat in The Inn of the Sixth Happiness etc. but like most such portrayals Cobb's is unconvincing especially as all the other Chinese roles in this film were played by ethnically Chinese actors. Cobb's failure to seem sufficiently menacing is surprising given that he could seem very menacing indeed as in On the Waterfront or Twelve Angry Men but here Yang comes across as too relaxed and urbane.For this reason I would not rate this film as highly as The Caine Mutiny. In that film Bogart received excellent support from the rest of the cast such as Fred MacMurray and Van Johnson support which is lacking here. Moreover I suspect that most people today regardless of their religious convictions will not accept the film's strong implication that the incident in which Carmody wins his freedom and the safety of the villagers from Yang was a genuine miracle. Einstein famously said that God does not play dice with the Universe. This film would seem to suggest that He does. 710".

The themes are similar to what you would find in a Hitchcock film involving mistaken identity and a man caught up in a perplexing situation where he must use his wits to secure his freedom and get out alive. This film is eightyseven minutes long but I found it so emotionally satisfying it seems longer than that so full and rich it is to me.Humphrey Bogart is perfect as James Carmody now taking up the robes and vestments of a recently murdered Father O'Shea to effect an escape from Lee J. Cobb's Warlord Mieh Yang. He comes to a little Chinese mission complete with a Bible and a gun. The thing that is interesting is how his previous life experience and skill set nonetheless prepare him to fulfill the priestly duties of the slain theologian he is impersonating. He is totally believable as a nononsense Priest who is as much a graduate from the school of hard knocks as he is from any seminary.The supporting cast of E.G. Marshall and Agnes Moorehead as Dr. David Sigman and Beryl Sigman respectively round out a very competent cast including the beautiful Gene Tierney as Anne 'Scotty' Scott. The Sigmans both in their own way sense something not quite Kosher about this 'Father O'Shea' but it's nothing either of them can quite put their finger on even though the Doctor discovers this O'Shea plays a mean game of Chess. Meanwhile Anne discovers herself falling in love with this priest with no one but him to hear her confession.Carmody as Father O'Shea preaches the Sunday sermon in two languages English and Chinese leads the school children in song on a little piano and helps Anne jump puddles in a very gentlemanly way. They call it 'chemistry' now but back when I first saw this movie as a feature on the Bill Kennedy Show on Channel Nine it was simply old style Hollywood romance. In this movie the physical attraction is a given and so the scenes between Bogart and Tierney show two people genuinely caring about each other while still mature enough to respect each other's boundaries.So far Bogart has taken personal advantage of Father O'Shea's death in order to further his plans for a permanent escape from the Warlord Mieh Yang. But now the arrival of the Warlord into the village where Father O'Shea is domiciled imperils everyone. Decisions spurred by the imperatives of adrenaline provide no real solution. There is nowhere to run and Yang's army is too numerous and formidable to fight. Now that animalistic reactions are ruled out what does one do?Enter the Left Hand of God...".

In this movie the physical attraction is a given and so the scenes between Bogart and Tierney show two people genuinely caring about each other while still mature enough to respect each other's boundaries.So far Bogart has taken personal advantage of Father O'Shea's death in order to further his plans for a permanent escape from the Warlord Mieh Yang. But now the arrival of the Warlord into the village where Father O'Shea is domiciled imperils everyone. Decisions spurred by the imperatives of adrenaline provide no real solution. There is nowhere to run and Yang's army is too numerous and formidable to fight. Now that animalistic reactions are ruled out what does one do?Enter the Left Hand of God...";

SaintAvit confides to his friend that he'd once been there and proceeds to tell his bizarre story in flashback. He and a fellow Legionaire Captain Morhange were on a scouting mission for the war office in the desert when they came upon a Turgai warrior dying of thirst. They rescue him but are soon captured and taken to a series of catacombs deep in the mountains that are all that's left of the fabled city of Atlantis. It's ruler Antinea keeps all men in thrall SaintAvit falls under her spell but Morhange resists so Antinea orders SaintAvit to kill him. He does but shocked at what he's done takes to drugs. The Turgai warrior they had saved helps him and Clementine a native in love with Saint Avit to escape the underground labyrinth but the woman later dies in the desert. After SaintAvit tells his tale his comrade writes to the home office notifying them that the battleweary lieutenant has gone mad from the sun and heat while SaintAvit wanders out into a sandstorm following a vision of Antinea...Jacques Feyder was the first to film L'ATLANTIDE in 1921 and there have been many versions since including one by Edgar G. Ulmer in the early 1960s. Pierre Benoit author of the 1919 novel on which the films were based was accused of plagiarism because of similarities between his adventure story and H Rider Haggard's She but director G.W. Pabst dispenses with most of Benoit's saga to create his own compelling tale. Pabst shot German French and English language versions simultaneously with the same sets and cast using actual Sahara locations. Keeping dialog to a minimum Pabst's vision is a cross between Haggard's She and THE CABINET OF DR CALIGARI. The fantastic yarn gives clues along the way that it's only a madman's hallucination there's a foppish European fond of alcohol living in Atlantis along with a Swedish drugaddict both were former lovers of Antinea who apparently was once a cancan dancer at the Casino de Paris. The female reporter at the beginning of SaintAvit's journey is also Clementine and Atlantis itself is a mixture of modernity and mazelike ruins. The vistas of the desert with it's howling wind and shifting sands is visually striking and reminiscent of Josef von Sternberg's MOROCCO. Brigitte Helm Maria in Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS makes an icy and imperious Antinea whom no mortal man can resist and hope to live. The storyline is a little hard to follow on a single viewing but the film's dreamlike quality and the many beautiful images will stay in the mind long after it's over.".

When they descend into the maze of tunnels that is Antinea's kingdom they find a tipsy excitable Quentin Crispy character a longtime resident who holds some key to its history. As Antinea the great German star Brigitte Helm has a mesmerizing presence as she lolls on a divan with a menacing leopard at her side. Equally imposing is a monumental stone head of her visage that figures in several memorable compositions. When the protagonist who is not a traditional hero is first summoned to Antinea what unfathomable depravity will take place? They play chess of course. The story comes from a popular French novel but it is Pabst's fluid style that makes this masterly kitsch.".

Clearly filmed on location on the desert this movie is interesting to watch for a while however once the pair ends up underground the film seems to get lost. I don't know if its because the print I saw is some 10 minutes shorter than the official running time on IMDb or if there is something missing from the novel either way the movie just sort of stops and runs in circles while I tried desperately to figure out what I was seeing. While it never gets really bad it does get discouraging since its clear that there is a story here that would draw film makers back again and again unfortunately what ever that quality is is missing. Running some 78 minutes this version feels twice as long.I can't really recommend this movie since it just sort of misses the target.

	schema:headline " Visually arresting yet oddly dull adventure film of the thirties";
	schema:reviewBody "This is the 3rd and most recent in the three films I've seen by controversial director G.W. Pabst after his extraordinary silent classics 'Pandora's Box' and 'Diary of a Lost Girl' both starring legendary screen goddess Louise Brooks. It's the Englishlanguage version of 'L'Atlantide' itself a soundremake of the '21 silent film by Jacques Feyder and by being mostly shot on location in the Sahara Desert went against the grain at the time of shooting movies exclusively in studio.In Brigitte Helm mainly known for her starring role of Fritz Lang's scifi magnum opus 'Metropolis' he had a stunning villainous female who would have made a great femme fatale had she continued on the following decade in film noir. The script is nondescript and a tad melodramatic and the other actors are decidedly pedestrian but Pabst's visual elan and directorial genius shines through and lifts an otherwise drab picture. Worth your time if you're a fan of adventure films of the era however.".

All this is worthy of Sternberg and Dietrich in their their own escapades into sensual  opiate dreaming. But it's all what an unreliable narrator presents to us of his supposed discovery of the lost city of Atlantis elusive sandparticles of a story.Your first clue is that there is a woman in the early stages of the lost expedition who writes an account  a script  of the narrative. The film is from that French tradition of layered fiction most notably expressed later in Rivette and Ruiz but predates them all with the exception of Epstein that mage of fluid dreaming. It is not immensely effective. Sternberg made similar things work because he was madly in love with Dietrich with the kind of love that bends reality. Pabst lacks his own muse this time Louise Brooks so there are no strong currents around his woman. His brilliance is that he doesn't film big and gaudy it's a piece of erotic fantasy after all in an exotic place. And it's a story being recalled a piece of sunbaked imagination. The magic is not in the sets and costumes the way Lang did for Metropolis though some of them impress the overall feel is earthy and makeshift like something the narrator and listener may have walked through in their patrols and have the images for. No Pabst sustains the fantasy in the uncanny drafts of desert wind between something resembling reality and feverish dream with fragile for the time borders between memory and fiction the mind captive in its own world of stories. The pursuit of myth is only the opportunity to travel out in search of fictions spun from such fabrics of the imaginative mind.What Pabst does here finds its continuation in Celine and Julie Go Boating not Indiana Jones.Eventually it is all swallowed up by the sands and time every answer we had hoped for. There was a woman desired possibly a cabaret dancer and that's all we can glean  consider the subplot in Rivette's film about a vaudeville tour in the middle east.

	schema:reviewBody "COMRADESHIP 1931 can be said to have marked the relative end of the most fruitful period in the career of renowned German filmmaker G. W. Pabst that had seen him create a handful of classics of World Cinema in fact his next venture was a very ambitious undertaking  an adaptation in distinct German French and Englishlanguage versions of Pierre Benoit's epic adventure novel L'ATLANTIDE  but one that in hindsight would prove only partially successful. Another distinguished filmmaker Frenchman Jacques Feyder had already made a celebrated stab at the material as a 3hour Silent epic in 1921 and over the years other established filmmakers  John Brahm Frank Borzage Edgar G. Ulmer Vittorio Cottafavi George Pal Ruggero Deodato Bob Swaim and even Walt Disney  would find themselves attracted to the subject of the mythical lost empire. Admittedly I have never read Benoit's original source and this 1932 Englishlanguage version is the first cinematic adaptation of it that I am watching but is not Atlantis supposed to be an undersea kingdom? In fact a recent study even went so far as to imply that the island of Malta from where I hail might well have formed part of Atlantis centuries ago! How come therefore that here and reportedly likewise the other adaptations it is situated in sandy desert dunes? A criticism leveled at the Feyder film had been that his choice of leading lady the entrancing Queen of Atlantis was all wrong but Pabst certainly got that bit down perfectly when he cast Brigitte Helm  bestknown for playing the two Marias in Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS 1927 as Antinea. The plot has a little of H. Rider Haggard's SHE about it as two legionnaires stumble onto Atlantis in the Sahara desert and lose themselves within its labyrinthine dungeons replete with Antinea's past male conquests that have either gone mad or been mummified! The two male leads seemed slightly overage to me but in any case whatever acting capabilities they might possess would essentially have been dwarfed by the awesome sets and imaginative camerawork. As a matter of fact this is where the film's main fault lies the protagonists' plight never moves us as it should even when one kills the other over Antinea or when after her terrible secret is revealed to him the survivor decides to go back to Atlantis anyway. The fleeting appearances of an eccentric 'prisoner' of Antinea who speaks with a distinctly upperclass British accent and sports a Daliesque moustache adds to the fun quotient but overall the stilted rendition of the dialogue even Helm utters her own scarce lines in English is on a par with other films from the early Talkie era. For the record although every listing I have checked of this film gives its running time as 87 minutes the version I watched ran for just 78! Incidentally a movie I should be catching up with presently  DESERT LEGION 1953 with Alan Ladd Richard Conte and Arlene Dahl  is said to have been partially inspired by Benoit's L'ATLANTIDE itself!".

Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this is one of those old and rare films that is probably better appreciated from an historical perspective than from a more modern context. Yet even with certain allowances made it is still undermined by the rather bizarre plot and abrupt script. Of course the fact that it was translated into three different languages English German and French no doubt affected that to an extent.

She's Antinea part Tondelayo and part Cobra Woman living with a leopard by her side and featuring a smile that could melt stone yet one that only fools trust. A crafty game of chess shows her at her most sinister repeating check over and over again like a leopard who has its prey trapped yet keels making it think that it is near freedom until it is too late. In the case of this game he's the equivalent of both Randolph Scott and Ronald Colman recently arrived and lost in the desert as he comes across a paradise both intriguing and sinister. Bridget Helm isn't quite Helen Gahagan but she is far from Shangri La's Margo. She is closer to a spoiled school girl used to getting her way no matter what. World culture including Can Can dancers are part of the regular culture there managing to entrance everyone caught in its trap. I believe that it is John Stuart as the captured hero who longs to be escape even though he us intrigued by there. A strange performance by an actor whom I wasn't able to identify just giggles with sinister effeminate behavior yet is portrayed to be in love with a female servant. Sometimes breathtaking to look at this just gets furtherly more bizarre as the plot develops. The great G.W. Pabst shows that he had a true artistic sense that didn't always have a common appeal often pretentious and too high brow. The conclusion made absolutely no sense. As others have suggested this often seemed like bits and pieces of various ideas tossed together without the benefit of cohesion. I must refer to it then as an artistic let down where nothing really comes together and the results are unsatisfactory all over.".

I was quite surprised by The Lost Atlantis as I expected quite a bit from it since it was directed by the famous G.W. Pabstthe same guy who directed Louise Brooks' famous films Diary of a Lost Girl and Pandora's Box as well as the brilliant German dramas Kameradschaft and Westfront 1918. Instead I found the film to be quite dull and lacking momentum. In other words it has an unusual but interesting idea but is so poorly paced that I found myself losing interest as the film progressed. My assumption is that this will happen to you too if you decide to watch.The premise of this film is that Atlantis was not lost in sea but covered in the Sahara Desert. And unknown to outsiders this bizarre land still existsand is ruled by a goofy lady named Antinea Brigitte Helm. For the most part folks just sit around in this land doing nothing while Antinea spends her time jerking men around because you assume she has nothing better to do. If she says to kill they doand it's all VERY slow and mysteriouswith LOTS of staring from Antinea. In fact she rarely talks possibly due to her strong German accent but lounges about and makes men dance because she is supposedly so exotic and enticing. Yeah...whatever.All in all this is a pretty bad film. The plot is WAY too slow the acting way too poor and you wonder how Pabst could have made such a film. I was hoping for a strange escapist sort of film like She 1935 but instead it was just boredom from start to finish.FYIHelm was famous as the lady who was the evil robot woman from Metropolis. However in Metropolis her performance was much more human and emotive!".

	schema:reviewBody "At a French outpost in North Africa Lieutenant SaintAvit and his comrade listen to a radio broadcast concerning the lost city of Atlantis now believed buried under the Saharan sands. SaintAvit confides to his friend that he'd once been there and proceeds to tell his bizarre story in flashback. He and a fellow Legionaire Captain Morhange were on a scouting mission for the war office in the desert when they came upon a Turgai warrior dying of thirst. They rescue him but are soon captured and taken to a series of catacombs deep in the mountains that are all that's left of the fabled city of Atlantis. It's ruler Antinea keeps all men in thrall SaintAvit falls under her spell but Morhange resists so Antinea orders SaintAvit to kill him. He does but shocked at what he's done takes to drugs. The Turgai warrior they had saved helps him and Clementine a native in love with Saint Avit to escape the underground labyrinth but the woman later dies in the desert. After SaintAvit tells his tale his comrade writes to the home office notifying them that the battleweary lieutenant has gone mad from the sun and heat while SaintAvit wanders out into a sandstorm following a vision of Antinea...Jacques Feyder was the first to film L'ATLANTIDE in 1921 and there have been many versions since including one by Edgar G. Ulmer in the early 1960s. Pierre Benoit author of the 1919 novel on which the films were based was accused of plagiarism because of similarities between his adventure story and H Rider Haggard's She but director G.W. Pabst dispenses with most of Benoit's saga to create his own compelling tale. Pabst shot German French and English language versions simultaneously with the same sets and cast using actual Sahara locations. Keeping dialog to a minimum Pabst's vision is a cross between Haggard's She and THE CABINET OF DR CALIGARI. The fantastic yarn gives clues along the way that it's only a madman's hallucination there's a foppish European fond of alcohol living in Atlantis along with a Swedish drugaddict both were former lovers of Antinea who apparently was once a cancan dancer at the Casino de Paris. The female reporter at the beginning of SaintAvit's journey is also Clementine and Atlantis itself is a mixture of modernity and mazelike ruins. The vistas of the desert with it's howling wind and shifting sands is visually striking and reminiscent of Josef von Sternberg's MOROCCO. Brigitte Helm Maria in Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS makes an icy and imperious Antinea whom no mortal man can resist and hope to live. The storyline is a little hard to follow on a single viewing but the film's dreamlike quality and the many beautiful images will stay in the mind long after it's over.".

It's ruler Antinea keeps all men in thrall SaintAvit falls under her spell but Morhange resists so Antinea orders SaintAvit to kill him. He does but shocked at what he's done takes to drugs. The Turgai warrior they had saved helps him and Clementine a native in love with Saint Avit to escape the underground labyrinth but the woman later dies in the desert. After SaintAvit tells his tale his comrade writes to the home office notifying them that the battleweary lieutenant has gone mad from the sun and heat while SaintAvit wanders out into a sandstorm following a vision of Antinea...Jacques Feyder was the first to film L'ATLANTIDE in 1921 and there have been many versions since including one by Edgar G. Ulmer in the early 1960s. Pierre Benoit author of the 1919 novel on which the films were based was accused of plagiarism because of similarities between his adventure story and H Rider Haggard's She but director G.W. Pabst dispenses with most of Benoit's saga to create his own compelling tale. Pabst shot German French and English language versions simultaneously with the same sets and cast using actual Sahara locations. Keeping dialog to a minimum Pabst's vision is a cross between Haggard's She and THE CABINET OF DR CALIGARI. The fantastic yarn gives clues along the way that it's only a madman's hallucination there's a foppish European fond of alcohol living in Atlantis along with a Swedish drugaddict both were former lovers of Antinea who apparently was once a cancan dancer at the Casino de Paris. The female reporter at the beginning of SaintAvit's journey is also Clementine and Atlantis itself is a mixture of modernity and mazelike ruins. The vistas of the desert with it's howling wind and shifting sands is visually striking and reminiscent of Josef von Sternberg's MOROCCO. Brigitte Helm Maria in Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS makes an icy and imperious Antinea whom no mortal man can resist and hope to live. The storyline is a little hard to follow on a single viewing but the film's dreamlike quality and the many beautiful images will stay in the mind long after it's over.";

When they descend into the maze of tunnels that is Antinea's kingdom they find a tipsy excitable Quentin Crispy character a longtime resident who holds some key to its history. As Antinea the great German star Brigitte Helm has a mesmerizing presence as she lolls on a divan with a menacing leopard at her side. Equally imposing is a monumental stone head of her visage that figures in several memorable compositions. When the protagonist who is not a traditional hero is first summoned to Antinea what unfathomable depravity will take place? They play chess of course.

While it never gets really bad it does get discouraging since its clear that there is a story here that would draw film makers back again and again unfortunately what ever that quality is is missing. Running some 78 minutes this version feels twice as long.I can't really recommend this movie since it just sort of misses the target.

The film is from that French tradition of layered fiction most notably expressed later in Rivette and Ruiz but predates them all with the exception of Epstein that mage of fluid dreaming. It is not immensely effective. Sternberg made similar things work because he was madly in love with Dietrich with the kind of love that bends reality. Pabst lacks his own muse this time Louise Brooks so there are no strong currents around his woman. His brilliance is that he doesn't film big and gaudy it's a piece of erotic fantasy after all in an exotic place. And it's a story being recalled a piece of sunbaked imagination. The magic is not in the sets and costumes the way Lang did for Metropolis though some of them impress the overall feel is earthy and makeshift like something the narrator and listener may have walked through in their patrols and have the images for. No Pabst sustains the fantasy in the uncanny drafts of desert wind between something resembling reality and feverish dream with fragile for the time borders between memory and fiction the mind captive in its own world of stories. The pursuit of myth is only the opportunity to travel out in search of fictions spun from such fabrics of the imaginative mind.What Pabst does here finds its continuation in Celine and Julie Go Boating not Indiana Jones.Eventually it is all swallowed up by the sands and time every answer we had hoped for. There was a woman desired possibly a cabaret dancer and that's all we can glean  consider the subplot in Rivette's film about a vaudeville tour in the middle east.

Pabst that had seen him create a handful of classics of World Cinema in fact his next venture was a very ambitious undertaking  an adaptation in distinct German French and Englishlanguage versions of Pierre Benoit's epic adventure novel L'ATLANTIDE  but one that in hindsight would prove only partially successful. Another distinguished filmmaker Frenchman Jacques Feyder had already made a celebrated stab at the material as a 3hour Silent epic in 1921 and over the years other established filmmakers  John Brahm Frank Borzage Edgar G. Ulmer Vittorio Cottafavi George Pal Ruggero Deodato Bob Swaim and even Walt Disney  would find themselves attracted to the subject of the mythical lost empire. Admittedly I have never read Benoit's original source and this 1932 Englishlanguage version is the first cinematic adaptation of it that I am watching but is not Atlantis supposed to be an undersea kingdom? In fact a recent study even went so far as to imply that the island of Malta from where I hail might well have formed part of Atlantis centuries ago! How come therefore that here and reportedly likewise the other adaptations it is situated in sandy desert dunes? A criticism leveled at the Feyder film had been that his choice of leading lady the entrancing Queen of Atlantis was all wrong but Pabst certainly got that bit down perfectly when he cast Brigitte Helm  bestknown for playing the two Marias in Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS 1927 as Antinea. The plot has a little of H. Rider Haggard's SHE about it as two legionnaires stumble onto Atlantis in the Sahara desert and lose themselves within its labyrinthine dungeons replete with Antinea's past male conquests that have either gone mad or been mummified! The two male leads seemed slightly overage to me but in any case whatever acting capabilities they might possess would essentially have been dwarfed by the awesome sets and imaginative camerawork. As a matter of fact this is where the film's main fault lies the protagonists' plight never moves us as it should even when one kills the other over Antinea or when after her terrible secret is revealed to him the survivor decides to go back to Atlantis anyway. The fleeting appearances of an eccentric 'prisoner' of Antinea who speaks with a distinctly upperclass British accent and sports a Daliesque moustache adds to the fun quotient but overall the stilted rendition of the dialogue even Helm utters her own scarce lines in English is on a par with other films from the early Talkie era. For the record although every listing I have checked of this film gives its running time as 87 minutes the version I watched ran for just 78! Incidentally a movie I should be catching up with presently  DESERT LEGION 1953 with Alan Ladd Richard Conte and Arlene Dahl  is said to have been partially inspired by Benoit's L'ATLANTIDE itself!".

Throw in the fact that there is something missing beside these aforementioned motivations and it just doesn't work for me. There are lots of closeups. This seems to be part of a legacy from the silent film a transition piece if you will.

But because he is a loyal French officer Captain Morhange is more concerned about the health and welfare of his subordinate and this results in severe consequences for both of them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this is one of those old and rare films that is probably better appreciated from an historical perspective than from a more modern context. Yet even with certain allowances made it is still undermined by the rather bizarre plot and abrupt script. Of course the fact that it was translated into three different languages English German and French no doubt affected that to an extent.

My assumption is that this will happen to you too if you decide to watch.The premise of this film is that Atlantis was not lost in sea but covered in the Sahara Desert. And unknown to outsiders this bizarre land still existsand is ruled by a goofy lady named Antinea Brigitte Helm. For the most part folks just sit around in this land doing nothing while Antinea spends her time jerking men around because you assume she has nothing better to do. If she says to kill they doand it's all VERY slow and mysteriouswith LOTS of staring from Antinea. In fact she rarely talks possibly due to her strong German accent but lounges about and makes men dance because she is supposedly so exotic and enticing. Yeah...whatever.All in all this is a pretty bad film. The plot is WAY too slow the acting way too poor and you wonder how Pabst could have made such a film. I was hoping for a strange escapist sort of film like She 1935 but instead it was just boredom from start to finish.FYIHelm was famous as the lady who was the evil robot woman from Metropolis.

	schema:reviewBody "It's difficult to make an accurate assessment of this film because it's incomplete. In fact it's far from complete. Still from the pieces of what is left we can see that Passenger may well have turned out to be a masterpiece. Like Jean Vigo Andrzej Munk was considered a cinematic genius who died too soon in a car crash in 1960. Munk is less well known than Vigo but he is still important especially in the development of Polish film. Passenger is the story of a German woman on a cruiseliner who catches a glimpse of who she believes to be a Jewish girl she was in charge of at a concentration camp during the war. She recounts to her husband in flashback the story of how she tried to protect the girl from her vicious captors. Later on though in another flashback we see what really happened the woman was not the girl's protector but a sadist who relished her position of authority and her control over the lives of the prisoners she guarded. The cruiseliner scenes are all done using still shots with a narrator or the restorer of the film trying to decipher how exactly Munk intended to piece the film together while the flashback scenes are actual moving images shot in fine black and white widescreen compositions. As the narrator tries to understand the film what it would have become so do we as viewers. In this way the film itself becomes perhaps even more labyrinthine than it would have been had Munk completed it and we have an added level of mystery that is as frustrating as it is exciting. The incomplete film entices us to guess how it would have turned out and while its certainly not a substitute for the completed film this fragmented Passenger is brilliant and tantalizing nonetheless.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie primarily deals with recollections of memories through a series of still images and documentary style storytelling as we see a woman traveling on a ship narrating the events of her life to her husband after a chance meeting with a person aboard the ship who bears resemblance to a Jewish prisoner at Auschwitz she had once saved during her tenure as a Nazi officer. The film is all but an expanded portrayal of a chance meeting with a stranger aboard a ship who somewhat bears a stark resemblance to a past acquaintance strictly dealing with recollection and recounting of memories. This film also happens to be one of Andrzej Munk's unfinished works setting the tone for the film in terms of the filmmaker's unfinished goals and dreams. Munk's friends took it upon themselves to finish this project as an ode to a visionary filmmaker who met a premature end to his life. This piece of work not only reflects the protagonist's memories and trauma but also that of the filmmaker Andrzej Munk. The protagonist now a retired Nazi SS officer is aboard a ship with her husband sharing figments of her experiences at a Jewish prison at Auschwitz where she had certain personal encounters and conversations with a Jewish convict who had everything but freedom. Although at the helm of the story it is a fleeting moment or a passing moment at its best the film captures a score of unspoken emotions and sentiments. What the film tries to capture is a vague retelling of an incident wherein a person whom we believe to be a past acquaintance could be more than what meets the eye. What makes it more intriguing is the prospect of reconciliation or reuniting of two opposing or similar sentiments or feelings. The film is unique in its storytelling and visual style as it follows a nonlinear narrative with narration and documentarystyle flip book image storytelling. The unfinished segments of Munk's film have been filled with pictures and artist's impressions of sequences to give the story a more coherent sensibility and feel. However the segments that Munk himself had shot are a treat to watch as he had tried to look at a chance meeting with a stranger bearing a resemblance to be nothing but a fleeting or a passing moment yet arrive at a point where the character consciences come to a consensus or maybe even come to terms with the harsh realities and truths that they were previously unaware of. Since the film primarily deals with the resurfacing of thoughts ignited by an external agent in this case the chance encounter on the ship it is the utmost responsibility of the film to weave all nostalgic events and lost memories in realist terms and in totality. Also this film deals with the plights and sufferings of a country in general and its people in specific. Henceit is important to observe the intricacies that the above specified film has to offer.".

Andrzej Munk's bits and pieces about a Nazi Concentration Camp officer and her relationship to a young Jewish woman she seems somewhat obsessed with has some quite obvious power. What he managed to capture before his untimely death is gorgeous moments of uncertainty uncertainty in the actions in the motivations and in the ambiguous acting of the lead character. To be sure the finished product would have had a lot to say about the strange relationship between life and death the Nazi's had while running the camps.Unfortunately he died before he finished. So others took on the task of finishing it filling the holes with sometimes literal voiceover ruminations of what Munk might have intended. So we have the intentional ambiguity of the primary text and the ambiguity of what that intentional was meaning we're basically treated to an incomplete movie that basically begs for us to try to figure out how to complete it ourselves. The problem with that is that we already have that historical narrative with the Holocaust anyway and the nature of the imagery Munk shot shows that he was leading somewhere significant.For one thing much of the horrible imagery of the Holocaust the stuff that's become trope for narratives about it is kept in the background the foreground is the face of the actress Alecsandra Slazka which is achingly compelling and probably the reason why others felt it was necessary to finish the work despite itself. Many of the actions are not actually resolved and plot holes and gaps that are literally unfilmed parts of the plots and missing imagery leave some unintended ambiguities that simply detract from the main story. It's clear that Munk was going somewhere. This film doesn't take it there. So it's kind of depressing to watch it go nowhere.PolarisDiB".

Firstly its only half a film because unfortunately the director died before it was complete there's hardly any dialogue and it kinda just jumps all over the place. Cinematicly its brilliant but the content isn't so good. I would direct people to 'Fateless' which is a much better independent Hungarian film. Yes I appreciate it was made in the 1960s at a time where there wasn't hardly any films on the subject of the holocaust and in that context then I would say its pretty ground breaking however i think audiences are harder to please these days and so you might end up just a little confused wondering why you spent the last hour on this film.Don't bother watching this unless you have no other options. I can't believe i wasted 10 on this.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all I want to say some of my thoughts about IMDb ratings. If you look at IMDb top 250 you can hardly find any family movie . In fact there are only three family movie I mean live action movies not animated flicks in this chart. They are Princess Bride on the 99 position haven't seen yet A Christmas Story on 142 a movie nobody heard of besides English speaking countries and the E.T. on the 244 forever classic  no point denying that. And I bet you would be unable to find another one even in top 500. On the other hand you can find in this list for example more than eighty thrillers or more than thirty 30 war movies. Does that result means that family movies can't be good. Obviously it is not. For me the point is that many of people as well as lots of critics don't appreciate movies sweet movies without profanity drugs sex and violence. Cheesy movie for kids only that's not a fair grade. Well it's only my opinion but for me it's very sad when such a beautiful movie become so undeservedly underrated. Now more directly to our movie. I watched Free Willy no less than four or five times and found it one of the best family and animal movie ever made. The bonds of friendship between man and animal are shown incredibility well here. From this point Free Willy remembered me another beautiful animal movie The Black Stallion. The unlikely friendship between twelve years old Jesse and giant whale as the main element of the story is very sweet and touching. Overall plot is well constructed and there's no point to complain its unreality with decent development of the main characters. Young and definitely talented Jason Jammes Richter created terrific performance of a young lonely problem boy Jesse. Also very good in the movie were August Schellenberg as Randolph and Michael Madsen as Glen. As I always mentioned cinematography is pretty good including firstrate animal action Keiko is so cute there. The beautiful movie soundtrack written by Basil Poleuydouris a bit resembled for me terrific Carmine Coppola's score for The Black Stallion. And finally that's maybe the most important Free Willy is a very humanistic movie a movie that what was made with love and care about nature. Thanks to Simon Wincer for this great masterpiece. We need more movies like this not a laughable rubbish that Hollywood studios now provide for family entertainment. I rated Free Willy 10 out of 10 as an excellent and beautiful family friendly movie. Check out also its two sequels. They are also pretty good.Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English.".

	schema:reviewBody "Oh this one is underrated here. The story of Jason James Richter's character trying to escape from a life of crime and missing prospects is way beyond the average. The growing affection for Willy is not even stereotyped or clichd. It's a genuine bond that focuses on two outcast characters who slowly but surely come to experience true friendship and the value of trust. Jason's performance really appealed to me when I saw this movie as a kid. It is a sincere depiction of friendship of a way out of fighting for your values against all odds and of never giving up. Right I'm grown up now but this is one of the movies of my childhood I'd like to watch again and I'm sure I'd enjoy it almost as much as back then. Jason James had very few acting appearances but the Free Willy series assured him his place in movie history. His entire performance in here is sincere and straight he doesn't laugh nor smile if it wasn't just natural in the specific sequences. His facial expressions and body language fit into the total frame as well. The story has some profoundly human themes to it. I can't help it I think this one is both entertaining and deep dealing with emotions and prospects of life with integrity and courage in the face of danger.".

Compared to a lot of the movies kids force their parents to watch this one isn't so bad.It's really sweet and it puts out a good message. It allows you to feel and care about things that go on it the world. I dug this out today and watched it again and it was still pretty magical to me although I'm much older now.

But if you can appreciate films that have something important to say and something that it wants people to open their eyes to then Free Willy is just as important and gripping as anything from Gandhi to Platoon Mississippi Burning to Boyz and the Hood and JFK to Dancing With Wolves. And that is the truth.  The problem with films like this is that it is viewed in the same light as movies like Gorillas In The Mist and Instinct. And that is they are bleeding hearted fluff.  They ask you to feel for animals.  It asks you to realize that we are bad people and that we should change the system from within.  The only problem with that last statement is that it is said while people are rolling their eyes and using a sarcastic tone.  But if we can look at films like Schindler's List and Cry Freedom films that examine the atrocities perpetrated towards humans see them for the genius that they are why can we not take a film that has something to say about the abominable treatment of animals more seriously.  After all as Shylock once said Does a Jew not bleed?  Does an animal?We are so desensitized towards cruelty to animals that we are practically oblivious to their plight.  When we hear of a stray dog that shows up at the humane society with internal bleeding and a missing eye we say that it's terrible and then we turn away and forget about it until the next ones shows up.  When we go to water parks and see captive whales performing tricks we laugh and cheer and go back to our freedom and think nothing of the life that was destroyed when that beautiful beast was taken from its habitat. If anything this movie shows us that we should not imprison these or any wild animals and it does it so well that if you have any ounce of compassion in you it will affect you.  This film is not just for 10 year olds it is a film that should be viewed by everyone that takes their freedom for granted. Because if all of a sudden one day we were put in prison for no reason then and only then would we truly understand what animals go through.Perhaps you think this review is not really about a movie and all I am doing is expressing my political beliefs and that may be true but if someone doesn't say something about this then what good is our right of freedom of speech.The film itself is about a parentless boy that ends up in foster care. There he ends up working at a Sea World type place where he meets a newly captured whale.  He then takes it upon himself to free the whale knowing that the whale is going to be killed for insurance purposes.As I said though I believe this is an important story and if you disagree think about the film  A Time To Kill .  Matthew McConnauhey  wrong spelling I know  gives his speech at the end about the heinous crimes that were committed against the little black girl.  He asks the all white jury to close their eyes as he tells the story.  At the end of his graphic description he tells them to imagine she was white.  It won him the case. Now do the same thing in regards to stories like Free Willy.  Close your eyes and picture a whale held in a cell just big enough to move in.  This whale is fed every once in a while and he is taught to do tricks so that people can laugh and cheer.  He is separated from his family and his friends and his natural surroundings.  He can hear them crying for him to come home at night.  He has done nothing wrong committed no crime and he just wants to go home.  But he is kept against his will for our entertainment.Now picture what I am describing to you isn't a whale.  Picture it as being human.I applaud Richard and Laura Donner for making this film and I certainly hope people can see this and change their thinking about things.  It is a powerful film.  And it is one that should be taken more seriously.".

This film has taught us a lot about captivity and the need of freedom. There should be more films like this. If you are in need of a friend there will always be on in animals and this film has shown us so with Jesse and Willy. This film will continue to touch many hearts of the world.";

Heck I wanted to be a whale. I don't care how many stars it got this movie is a childhood treasure for me and I think of it every time I hear the Michael Jackson song Will You Be There?

Keiko had a life filled with traveling from one theme park to the other and in a lot of ways he experienced much more that Willy did. Keiko played the part of the whale terrifically! James did a great job too acting as Jesse and gave the perfect image of a young boy who has lived on the streets. Some people call it the best friendship movie since ET. This movie rocks over ET! and shows us the true meaning of friendship. We all should learn that caring for another person or animal goes a long way.".

	schema:headline " A successful family movie from the early 90's but one which has left me cold";
	schema:reviewBody "This renowned PGrated family flick was released when I was around seven years old. I didn't see it in the theatre but I don't think it was too long afterwards when I saw some of it in the VHS format. I don't recall ever seeing the whole thing during my childhood though I did see the first of the two sequels Free Willy 2 The Adventure Home from start to finish one time. When I rented the original Free Willy just yesterday I could only remember a little bit of it from what I saw back in the 90's. After all these years I've finally seen the entire film. However as much as a fair number of other people seem to like it I definitely didn't find it as entertaining and touching as many have made it out to be which didn't surprise me after seeing its mediocre rating here first.Jesse is a troubled 12 year old boy who was abandoned by his mother years ago. One night while getting into mischief with a group of friends he is caught by the police after vandalizing an aquatic park. His social worker Dwight Mercer manages to get him off the hook provided he cleans up the mess he has made at the park. As Jesse works at the park he looks in the tank and sees an orca whale named Willy who was sadly separated from his family in the ocean recently and brought here. The 12 year old boy befriends this whale and manages to teach him tricks which nobody else has succeeded in doing. However it turns out that Willy won't do these tricks in front of a big audience with kids banging on the tank windows. Dial the park owner has an evil plan and the homesick orca whale's life is in danger! The beginning of the film showing whales in the ocean may not be that bad at first but it's a little too long. After the capture we are introduced to Jesse played by Jason James Richter and it doesn't exactly improve here which leads me to another slight problem I have with this movie. This problem is the characters. This includes the main kid. At the beginning he's one rotten little brat but I guess that can easily happen with the kind of childhood he's had. Yes much of the film is supposed to be extremely touching and clearly is to some people but to me it just seemed a little too phony. The story may have some occasional mildly touching moments but they are very brief. There may be a bit of excitement as well but in the end despite the fact that I wasn't completely bored throughout I was still left with indifference. Nothing too overwhelming. I know this is a film about saving whales and I assure you I do not approve of the captivity of marine animals. They're meant to live in the ocean not chlorinated tanks. Still this movie just didn't quite do it for me. I also know I'm writing this just a couple days after the death of Michael Jackson who sang the closing theme Will You Be There for this movie but that is of mere coincidence. I didn't know he sang the theme song nor did I even know what this movie's theme song was before I rented it yesterday! If I had seen the entire film from start to finish during my childhood it just might have been a more entertaining and memorable experience than it was for me watching it after growing up. Free Willy should be a nice moving family drama but somehow it fails. Many kids might like it and adults as well but in my opinion it's far from the perfect heartwarming family film it seems to have often been considered.".

There may be a bit of excitement as well but in the end despite the fact that I wasn't completely bored throughout I was still left with indifference. Nothing too overwhelming. I know this is a film about saving whales and I assure you I do not approve of the captivity of marine animals. They're meant to live in the ocean not chlorinated tanks. Still this movie just didn't quite do it for me. I also know I'm writing this just a couple days after the death of Michael Jackson who sang the closing theme Will You Be There for this movie but that is of mere coincidence. I didn't know he sang the theme song nor did I even know what this movie's theme song was before I rented it yesterday! If I had seen the entire film from start to finish during my childhood it just might have been a more entertaining and memorable experience than it was for me watching it after growing up. Free Willy should be a nice moving family drama but somehow it fails. Many kids might like it and adults as well but in my opinion it's far from the perfect heartwarming family film it seems to have often been considered.";

It starts with the capture of an innocent young killer whale who is taken away from his family and he ends up in a tank in a marina. Meanwhile 12yearold Jesse Jason James Richter is the street kid who has caused trouble for ages and he is caught vandalising the marina so he is forced to clean up the mess. As Jesse continues his work he starts to notice and befriends the killer whale named Willy played by Keiko the killer whale the whale even saves his life. But what is even better is that the staff including Lori Petty Rae Lindley and Randolph Johnson August Schellenberg start to notice that Jesse can teach Willy tricks. So they decide to open The Willy Show with the help of marina owner Dial Michael Ironside and Willy's capturers and carers. But unfortunately it does not go well because of Willy's tank having viewers banging on the glass of the tank mixed with his missing of his family. So with some help from Lori Randolph and his carers Glen Michael Madsen and Annie Greenwood Jayne Atkinson Jesse and Willy set off towards the ocean to free him. The moment where Willy leaps over the rock wall is obviously the pinnacle of the film and the end credits feature the great Michael Jackson song Will You Be There. Sadly the beloved Keiko died in 2003 of pneumonia he will be missed by children and adults alike. It was number 74 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Worth watching!".

	schema:reviewBody "Whale! Whale! Whale! What do we have here? It's Free Willy and I love blubbering about Free Willy. It's a whale of a tail. It's one of my favorite nostalgia early 1990s kid films. Directed by Simon Wincer Free Willy tells the story of a delinquent boy Jesse Jason James Richter who become friends with a captive killer whale Willy Keiko. Seeing that Willy was upset due to the absence of his family and the fact that Willy didn't like his small living conditions Jesse set up a plan to kidnap Willy and tries to set him free in the wild. Can Jesse and Willy escape from the cruel owners of aquarium or will Willy end up being fish food? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie too much I found the movie to be a bit predictable. After all the title of the movie kinda gives it away. It's not like the movie posters DVD covers and trailers pretty much spoils the outrageous end of the movie as well. The film's ending has been spoofed several times in popular culture due to how over the top it was. It was a bit unrealistic. The movie also suffers from overused clichs. I really didn't like the subplot of Jesse's handling of his new foster parents. It seem a bit forced and underdevelopment. I really didn't buy into the whole surviving on his own as a runaway bit. Around thing that was hard to believe was the chemistry between the whale and the main actor. It was too similar to previous movies of a child bonding with a wild animal like 1966's Namu. I really found the whole idea of Willy connecting with the child a little impractical. For a creature that been left alone in a small dark tanks for hours I would have thought the orca would be a little more aggressed and bite Jesse's head off or try to drown him. It's seem a bit off. After all they are killer whales! I guess Keiko was just that welltrained. While the film does make a good persuasive case against keeping these creatures in captivity for the purposes of human entertainment by highlighting incidents that Willy has. The movie is a little onesided argument about whales being in captivity. I find it a tad odd that this movie is basically condemning the very thing it is exploiting which is using captive wild animals for entertainment purposes. The movie also fails to tells how important some aquariums are for sick killer whales. Now every aquarium seem a bit evil. Like the 2013's documentary Blackfish viewers of this movie might not understand that some places like SeaWorld honestly tries hard to keep whales healthy enough to return to the wild. Still when this movie did came out I was one of those who really believe that the whale that play Willy should have been free. At least the filmmakers followed their own preaching and campaigned for the freeing of Keiko the actual killer whale who stands in for an animatronic Willy in many scenes. The plan for Keiko to return to the wild was a topic of much controversy at the time. Some critics felt that a return to the wild was somewhat impossible because of the years of him being in captivity. They were somewhat right most of the attempts of him going back into the wild were mostly unsuccessful due to the fact that he often return seeking contact with human beings and allowing children to ride on his back. He was so dependent on humans that he really couldn't connection with other whales. In 2003 Keiko sadly die in one last attempt in the wild at the young age of 26 due to Pneumonia. He will be miss. Despite him not living long in the wild I still came out from this movie learning more than I came into the film. I love the fact that this movie help spark the Save the Whales Foundation into a success organization. I love the fact that this movie had singer Michael Jackson produced and performed Will You Be There as one of the theme songs for the film which can be heard during the film's credits. The song won the MTV Movie Award for Best Song in a Movie in 1994. It was also included in Michael Jackson's Dangerous album. It's one of his best songs ever. It really help the save the whales program. The main theme by Basil Poledouris was also amazing and majestic. Even the harmonica music that Jesse plays wasn't that bad. While the music was good. The acting not so much. While some of the characters strongly express of human emotion like James Jason Richter who work well onscreen with Keiko. Others were kinda one dimensional. The worst had to be the over the top money hungry villain played by Michael Ironsides. He was really hammy. The movie made great use of stock footage of whales. It was really nice seeing them in their natural habitat. The movie was followed by three sequels 1995's Free Willy 2 The Adventure Home 1997's Free Willy 3 The Rescue and 2010's Free Willy Escape from Pirate's Cove and a shortlived animated television series. I don't recommended watching the sequels but I do want you to check out 2010's Keiko The Untold story. It's a documentary film about Keiko that is worth seeing. Overall Despite its cheesy nature Free Willy is great movie for fans of Marine life. I really enjoy this film.".

It was really nice seeing them in their natural habitat. The movie was followed by three sequels 1995's Free Willy 2 The Adventure Home 1997's Free Willy 3 The Rescue and 2010's Free Willy Escape from Pirate's Cove and a shortlived animated television series. I don't recommended watching the sequels but I do want you to check out 2010's Keiko The Untold story. It's a documentary film about Keiko that is worth seeing. Overall Despite its cheesy nature Free Willy is great movie for fans of Marine life. I really enjoy this film.";

As usual it's the friendship between the main character and the animal that makes this one work.Jason James Richter is great as Jesse a character who has been having a really rough life and wants to reunite with his mother someday. Randolph is an awesome supporting character and I also like Jesse's adoptive parents and Rae.The story is very good with Jesse having to clean up his messes and straighten up his life forming a bond with a whale named Willy along the way. Willy played by Keiko the Orca is a lovable character who has the most charming Bond with Jesse.I really like the feel of the film and the locales in the Pacific Northwest. The climax with the gang trying to get Willy back to the water kept me in suspense and the ending scene with Willy jumping over the seawall always gives me chills.The villains weren't anything special they were just your typical greedy shallow businessmen who don't care about animals. Also the scene with Willy refusing to perform at the show because the children were scaring him felt like a plot device it seems unlikely that they would allow children to tap on the glass repeatedly because everyone knows it makes animals nervous.However this is still a fantastic movie overall. This is a movie I recommend to any families who like movies with a lot of heart.RATING A".

To make matters worse his soontobe step son Michael Anderson Jr. has bailed from college and has basically moved in with Ford at the hotel. But Lansbury has misled him and he thinks the kid is 13. Plus he wants a home but that's not what Lansbury has in mind.Page and Ford are just terrific in this onandoff romantic story of two souls who finally find one another despite the pitfalls along the road. Lansbury is brash as the other woman and Anderson is OK in an odd role and subplot.Others in the large cast include Charles Drake as Evie's onetime boyfriend Barbara Nichols as the sales girl Patricia Barry as Ford's old girl friend Richard Deacon as the convention runner and Sandra Gould as his assistant. The pack of old maids includes Ruth McDevitt Mary Wickes and Alice Pearce. Neva Patterson is Page's oftmarried friend.

Here she is teamed with the very talented Glenn Ford in a lighthearted romantic comedy where they play off of each other brilliantly.  The directing is fabulous and so is the story even though some may find it a bit slow.  I think it is worth watching more than once.  One of the most hilarious scenes in the film is when Miss Page and Mr. Ford are in one of the hotel hallways deciding exactly what the other guests are like and 'supposedly how they live' as well.  I like this movie because it makes me feel good! Angela Lansbury is excellent also in her 'barely more than a cameo appearance' as she ignites the fire that makes the story work!  A definite 10 in my book.  Watch this gem!".

The title song by Mancini is rather cloying and irritating but I can overlook that for the wonderful performances by Ford and Page. Lansbury is also quite good as the supposed shrew and tomato but even she is not entirely unsympathetic in the end. She is also lonely you see.Anyone who has been truly lonely or is sympathetic to that position will react emotionally to this film.

	schema:headline " A Movie for Middle Aged Romantics";
	schema:reviewBody "This is a film about two middle aged people in search of their soul mates. It is a very adult film. Children under 35 usually don't find it very rewarding unless they possess an unusual emotional maturity. I loved it the first time I saw it when I was about 22 but I didn't understand its depths until I was about 38. It shows the despair of lonely singles. It shows the innocence of the never attached. A spinster what an ageist and sexist term and a not too old jaded and bored bachelor try to make relationships which don't really fit work for them. The efforts they go through and the situations they find themselves in make for a lovely and sweet ride. The resolution is extremely gratifying and not so unrealistic. Its tone mood and pacing as the two meet and learn about each other build beautifully. I don't want a remake but I miss movies of this maturity thought and charm. No glamour no glitz no silly gags no pretty young things this film shows ordinary people with ordinary problems trying to find someone to love in a world that isn't always kind to people past their prime. Geraldine Page is revelatory as the slightly ridiculous woman who grows more lovely as the story progresses. Glenn Ford's charms are used to their maximum effect and Angela Landsbury adds the right shrewish tone. This is a must see for people who love a good complicated normal romance.".

She would eventual be nominated for 8 putting her in 8th place behind only Streep Hepburn Nicholson Davis Olivier Newman and Tracy which is pretty impressive territory! She would win one. Or perhaps it was just the strong year for actresses with Sophia Loren in Marriage Italian Style Anne Bancroft in The Pumpkin Eater Kim Stanley in Sance on a Wet Afternoon Debbie Reynolds in The Unsinkable Molly Brown or eventual winner Julie Andrews in Mary Poppins but I believe Geraldine Page's performance here is the equal of any 1964 female film performance. Her character Evie is one of the most sympathetic ever recorded and Page's expert portrayal captures the hearts of the audience. Along for the ride is the vastly underrated Glenn Ford and the always watchable Barbara Nichols. Too bad we didn't see more of her along with contemporaries Hope Holiday and Sue Ann Langdon. I wish there was more on this site about all three. Dear Heart was not intended as a blockbuster and as 1960s films go it was more or less a B picture. But the film features excellent writing a believable storyline excellent performances and a captivating score by Henry Mancini.".

	schema:headline " One of the Best Romantic Comedies Ever";
	schema:reviewBody "Comedy is hard. Ask any professional comedian. In the movies romantic comedies are hard to do so that good ones are rare and really good ones even more so. Great romantic comedies are like rare gems the avid movie fan sees a lot of junk looking for these sparkling creations. I give you Delbert Mann's exquisite 1964 jewel DEAR HEART perhaps the sweetest little film of the decade and a showcase for the late great Geraldine Page.Page plays Evie Jackson a postmaster from Avalon Ohio who arrives in New York at the beginning of the film for a convention. Evie is a sweet slightly daffy and almost toofriendly woman on the brink of middleage who redecorates her hotel room to make it feel more like home and who knows every member of the hotel staff by their first names before her first day in New York is over.Also checking in is Harry Mork played by the alwaysdependable Glenn Ford. Ford was never a great actor but he is wonderful here. Harry is the epitome of the stereotypical traveling salesman greeting cards with a woman waiting for him in nearly every city he visits. Soon after his arrival he goes to visit one of his many mistresses a commercial artist he calls by her last name Mitchell played to a faretheewell by the great and underrated Patricia Barry. It is to Mitchell that he breaks the news that he has met a woman named Phyllis and has somehow gotten himself engaged to marry her almost on a bet. Mitchell the consummate New York sophisticate takes the news in stride and as Harry leaves you can almost hear her thinking You'll be back buster!Back at the hotel Harry finds himself being shadowed by a young man who takes it upon himself to carry his luggage upstairs. The young man is the son of Harry's asyet unseen fiance. Harry is a bit befuddled he has a picture in his wallet of Phyllis and her son taken when Patrick was thirteen. He is now twenty and has come to seek out Dad's advice and support because Mom appears to him to be unaware of the fact that he is nearly grown. With him is his silent girlfriend whose main function is to be caught taking baths in other people's bathrooms.Finally Harry enters the hotel coffee shop in search of lunch and the only available seat is at a table across from none other than Evie Jackson. Page and Ford are simply sublime together the script is very knowing and quite sophisticated for its time. Harry's exploits are already wellestablished and in a later rather poignant scene we realize that at a previous convention Evie was intimate with a married man an intimacy she now regrets because it was only a shadow of what she really wants. For himself Harry is so taken with Evie that almost immediately after lunch he propositions the girl at the magazine counter almost on a reflex. The resulting date is one of the film's comic high points.I don't want to give away too much of the romance it is too good to be spoiled that way so I'll simply urge anyone who reads this to see it for himherself.But what about Phyllis?Oh yes Phyllis. So far she's only been a name and a face in a picture we haven't actually seen her. But as Harry and Evie return from a lovely stolen day in New York the lady herself Angela Lansbury is at the magazine counter swathed in furs and completely unconcerned that Harry has been out and about with another woman.Lansbury's role is a small one but as usual she is a revelation. Coming a mere two years after her absolutely chilling Mrs Iselin in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE her Phyllis is quite the wrong woman for a man looking to settle down by the standards of the day. She's also screamingly funny because she never seems to actually hear a word her fianc says to her. As for her son even with a beard she still sees him as a little boy.Somebody once said that the best comedy comes from pain and sadness. I think there is some truth in this because amid all the laughs and there are a lot of them the central theme of this film is loneliness. Evie and Harry underneath their cheery faades are both desperately lonely people.Geraldine Page a selfdescribed stage actress who does movies occasionally delivers another luminous performance here she is so utterly appealing that by the end of the film we feel as if we know her and wish we did in real life. As for Ford working with talents like Page and Lansbury is good for him here he delivers a much deeper performance than he is accustomed to one that may be all the more difficult since he starts off as a bit of a heel and it is not until the end that his character finds redemption.In his excellent review of 1981's ON GOLDEN POND the eminent critic Roger Ebert had this to sayFragile emotions are hard to portray in a movie and the movies that reach for them are more daring really than movies that bludgeon us with things like anger and revenge which are easy to portray.I give you DEAR HEART a film which like ON GOLDEN POND nearly twenty years later deals in the frailty of the human heart the pain of loneliness and the ways in which lonely people deal with their pain all while making the audience laugh. For a little film this is a huge accomplishment.A definite mustsee.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dear Heart finds Glenn Ford and Geraldine Page as a pair of late thirty somethings who find true love at a New York convention. The convention is one Geraldine's attending she's the postmaster of her small Ohio town and it's a Postmaster's convention. By the way at that time these were political positions in every postal area of the USA so in 1964 Geraldine would have to have been a good organization Democrat in her town.Glenn's a traveling salesman greeting cards is his line and he's spent his young years just on the road and now wants to settle down. He thinks he's found what he wants in Angela Lansbury a widow with a son from Altoona.Almost a third of the film goes by before Ford and Page even meet and we get a good background into their character. Makes what happens in the film almost inevitable. Although this is far from the exotic setting of The African Queen Dear Heart is like that film showing that love can certainly come at any age. And in this case from unexpected quarters where you least expect it.The code was still in place or the postmistresses played by Ruth McDevitt Alice Pearce and Mary Wickes would be far more explicitly lesbian. The three of them eye Page as possibly a member of the fraternity. As for Page she gets an offer from Charles Drake with whom she had a fling before she found out he was married and a more crude offer from Ken Lynch in the hotel elevator.The very lovely title song of the film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. A whole flock of people recorded it back in the day Frank Sinatra Andy Williams and Jack Jones come immediately to mind. It lost to Chim Chim Cheree from Mary Poppins but while that song is known it certainly can't be separated from the film it came from. I think Dear Heart has more staying power.And I think the film Dear Heart has a lot more staying power as well.".

By the way at that time these were political positions in every postal area of the USA so in 1964 Geraldine would have to have been a good organization Democrat in her town.Glenn's a traveling salesman greeting cards is his line and he's spent his young years just on the road and now wants to settle down. He thinks he's found what he wants in Angela Lansbury a widow with a son from Altoona.Almost a third of the film goes by before Ford and Page even meet and we get a good background into their character. Makes what happens in the film almost inevitable. Although this is far from the exotic setting of The African Queen Dear Heart is like that film showing that love can certainly come at any age. And in this case from unexpected quarters where you least expect it.The code was still in place or the postmistresses played by Ruth McDevitt Alice Pearce and Mary Wickes would be far more explicitly lesbian. The three of them eye Page as possibly a member of the fraternity. As for Page she gets an offer from Charles Drake with whom she had a fling before she found out he was married and a more crude offer from Ken Lynch in the hotel elevator.The very lovely title song of the film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. A whole flock of people recorded it back in the day Frank Sinatra Andy Williams and Jack Jones come immediately to mind. It lost to Chim Chim Cheree from Mary Poppins but while that song is known it certainly can't be separated from the film it came from. I think Dear Heart has more staying power.And I think the film Dear Heart has a lot more staying power as well.";

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not certain there are any spoilers here but I checked the 'spoiler' box just to protect myself...Dear Heart is one of those movies where you know how you want to see it work out but you don't know how it's going to happen  and sometimes you aren't sure that it will. But you hope...Evie played by Geraldine Paige is a lady Postmaster attending a postal convention. She is overthetop interested in everyone around her  being at once helpful and maybe a little too much so for some tastes. Harry played by Glenn Ford is a greeting card salesman who is going to settle down from living on the road. He is about to marry Phyllis a woman he met not long ago. He dreams of being settled at last in a house with family members and visitors and home cooked meals every day. Harry and Evie are staying at the same hotel.While Harry waits for Phyllis to arrive he meets Evie  and while her brand of involvement and caring about others puts him off a little bit at first slowly he comes to realize that those qualities are drawing him to her. But Phyllis is on the way Harry is sure she is the woman he has been looking for soon they will be married and that will be that.We get a couple of insights into 'adult relationships' in this movie while of course nothing is spelled out or anything but totally proper we do learn that Evie has been with a man  another Postmaster on the convention trip  who seems to want to take advantage of her again but she learned that giving herself away is not how to attain the kind of happiness she wants. The man tells her without specifically stating 'sex' that it's that one page in the book that the whole damned world is after. She replies But you can't read just that one page. It doesn't make any sense all by itself. Superb dialog.When Harry's fiance Phyllis arrives as things develop she makes it clear that she doesn't care whether he fools around behind her back  so long as he doesn't tell her because as she says Then I'll have to do something about it. Just don't say anything and all will be well. She doesn't like the apartment he has chosen for them  she wants a hotel so she only has to pick up the phone and order food. She doesn't want to cook or have company come to visit. Phyllis she declares about herself is done DOING!Harry realizes that he is about to make a mistake  marrying a woman who does not want the things he does while passing by a woman whose big heart is ever more appealing to him.Usually I like Glenn Ford best in Westerns  in real life he was about the fastest gun in Hollywood  but he is superb in this movie as is Paige. I enjoy the scene where he walks her back to her hotel room after an encounter with an elevator 'masher'  out in the hallway they analyze what some of the other guests have left on their food trays and try to determine something about the person in the room. Harry tests Evie with some questions and he can't help being fascinated by her answers. It is right then when you see it in his face  he is falling in love with her and she realizes it. It's a great moment in the film.This movie ought to be seen a lot more than it is. It is truly an adult film  not because it shows adults ripping at each other's clothes is that truly 'adult'? but because it shows mature people weighing their circumstances and deciding on the course they will take. Classic.".

I saw Glenn Ford in The Gazebo and Geraldine Page in Sweet Bird of Youth. They were both so good that I gave this movie a try. From the time I heard the song of the same title to Page's first 10 seconds of screen time I was absolutely captivated. I have read that Meryl Streep adored her. Page was a chameleon of an actress who thoroughly engrossed herself into her part. I can see her influence on Streep. I've seen few actresses as good as Page and I've only racked up 2 films so far!! I'm not sure if I would have appreciated this film as much as a younger person but I'll never know since I'm now in my 40's. It was so easy for me to picture myself in Page's character's shoes had I not found love and a wonderful husband and family. The opportunity for love and a satisfactory career for the middleaged spinster in the 1960's was not very promising. Page portrays her juxtaposition of loneliness and friendliness with such vulnerability that only a knowing eye which is the audience can see. Glenn Ford resists Page at first but somehow she softens him with her dear personality. There is really no need to go on. If you want to experience a film that will be dear to your heart forever then this one is it.".

Even though she had only one line in the story she was one of those characters who are constantly being referred to. And Barbara Nichols doing her dumb blonde bit that she did so well. In spite of the sentimental title this was a genuinely quirky comedy also and though I'm prejudiced it was better at that than most quirky ones made now where that kind of thing is almost always laid on too heavily. Including the sexual jokes like the stepson moving into his future stepfather's hotel room and bringing his girlfriend with him without considering it anything strange if this movie were made now that joke would really be overdone!. No one could underplay his role in a comedy or a drama like Glenn Ford. In one scene he wants to have a fatherson talk with his future stepson Patrick about any subject Patrick likes. Without phrasing it this way Patrick who has an untraditional relationship with Zola asks him how long a boy should put a girl off before he finally agrees to sleep with her. The reaction Glenn Ford gives to that question is really priceless. And Geraldine Page was great in it and Angela Lansbury as the fiance with her openminded attitude to the living Harry had done in the past and the living he would probably do in the future an openminded attitude that only upsets him. I don't like to label things according to decades but it's full of things you don't really expect from an early ' 60s comedy.".

They both happen to be staying at the same hotel and through certain circumstances they meet but only after we see Glenn visiting a friend who's got the hots for him but he doesn't give her a tumble and after seeing Geraldine talking to Charles Drake a married man of whom she's been seeing. But of course she's miserable not having the whole package. This is a very sweet film that was originally called The OutofTowners but when the Oscarnominated song was written they came up with the idea to change the movie title to fit the song. Great idea! The title fits this very funny yet vulnerable film. It may be one of those films that are far from perfect but has much heart and sentiment. Therefore it makes up for any imperfections in the eyes of those who love it. If you've never seen Glenn meet Geraldine then you are missing one match made in heaven as they seem very well suited for each other. There's really nothing else to know about the film. Dear Heart is a movie that shows average people in search of love and finding it.".

	onyx:emotionText "Geraldine Page is a postmistress who's going to her convention in New York. Glenn Ford is an engaged man who's getting married in a month to Angela Lansbury. They both happen to be staying at the same hotel and through certain circumstances they meet but only after we see Glenn visiting a friend who's got the hots for him but he doesn't give her a tumble and after seeing Geraldine talking to Charles Drake a married man of whom she's been seeing. But of course she's miserable not having the whole package. This is a very sweet film that was originally called The OutofTowners but when the Oscarnominated song was written they came up with the idea to change the movie title to fit the song. Great idea! The title fits this very funny yet vulnerable film. It may be one of those films that are far from perfect but has much heart and sentiment. Therefore it makes up for any imperfections in the eyes of those who love it. If you've never seen Glenn meet Geraldine then you are missing one match made in heaven as they seem very well suited for each other. There's really nothing else to know about the film. Dear Heart is a movie that shows average people in search of love and finding it.";

It's about two lonely souls Geraldine Page and Glenn Ford who meet in a hotel where they are both staying for business reasons and find comfort and understanding in each other that neither finds elsewhere. Glenn Ford is really winning in a lighter and more comedic role than I'm used to seeing him and it's refreshing to see Geraldine Page take a break from the heavy roles she was most often associated with. The film is kind of slow and a little blah actually but it does manage to create a satisfying feeling of melancholy and capture that unique quality that business trips have when the realities of one's real life seem far away and moments seem full of the potential for excitement.The warbly title song written by Henry Mancini Jay Livingston and Ray Evans was nominated for an Academy Award.Grade B".

This credibility and the fact that it is difficult to identify this as a nazi film by simple watching a few seconds of cutting would remove all evidence makes this film dangerous even today. The film asks the viewer for his judgement on the topic and even supplies him with possible objections but the answer is inevitable 'pro reo'. So this film could be used as ammunition in todays discussion about assisted suicide and its extensions e.g. against the patients will if his resistance is considered as irrational by an authority as discussed in at least 2 western countrys.

Nature lets things die quickly when life is no longer viable. Medical science with its pills and its drugs insists on artificially delaying the mercy of a quick natural death even when a cure or improvement is completely impossible.This is far more than a piece of fine dramatic cinema with a superior cast. The writing is highwire taut and its courtroom scenes in particular make for riveting viewing. Ich klage an must surely have presented to German society a most credible and utterly compelling argument for at the very least a rational debate on the subject of euthanasia. And it is not merely a vehicle for some sinister National Socialist doctrine but rather a beautifully moving and profoundly disturbing document of the period with a relevance undiminished by its age or the political system which held sway at the time.At the piano her left hand falters.Brilliant medical researcher Thomas Heyt has been appointed to a professorship in Munich and at an intimate gathering to celebrate the event the first signs of something amiss with his vivacious young wife Hanna appear. Accompanying her on cello Dr Bernhard Lang. Had he simply asked Hanna for marriage years before rather than introducing her to his student friend Thomas she would have readily accepted. He has now held a torch for her ever since but respects unreservedly the love which binds his two friends.Hanna hopes that this sudden strange sensation is a sign of a longedfor pregnancy but as her condition quite rapidly deteriorates and paralysis begins to ravage her body it becomes evident that something far less benign is occurring. Bernhard's tests lead to an unmistakable diagnosis  Multiple Sclerosis. A certain and painful death. And as husband Thomas works tirelessly in his laboratory to discover the cure which he feels sure can be found in time Bernhard does what he can to ease her everincreasing suffering.The medicine. In small doses a necessary palliative. She wants to know more.Her life was becoming an unbearable torture both physically and spiritually. She saw her husband suffer as a result and was unable to release herself from her pain because of the paralysis. Otherwise she would have done it herself.Thomas will help me one way or the other.Because I loved her more I did it.As the drama then moves into the courtroom we are assailed with the tightest and most thoughtprovoking of scripts. This aspect made for absolutely mesmeric viewing and the distillation of the language into subtitles provided no barrier whatsoever. Accused of murder the moral dilemmas now take hold. Expert medical witnesses are called. Was it the overdose which actually killed Hanna or could it have been the actual disease? What acts are incompatible with a doctor's oath and why? When does the relief of suffering become murder?There is one small but critical scene in this movie upon which so much hinges. It is but one powerful image among so many othersHanna's death has left Bernhard a broken man. His friend's intervention has taken the life of the woman they both loved. It is then that he opens a letter. The parents of a young girl he had once successfully treated request that he see them as soon as possible and it is behind a locked door in a children's ward that he is left to ponder the legacy of his lifesaving work She's blind she's deaf she's demented. It's wonderful you healed her doctor instead of letting the poor creature die.We are one step from a stunning climax.The right to kill shouldn't be given to a doctor alone these final medical decisions should be left to the state.There are very few visual references to betray this movie's Third Reich origins. Only once on a back wall in Thomas's office do we fleetingly see the portrait of Adolf Hitler. The legal robes bear the appropriate Hoheitszeichen and we catch a glimpse of the Hitlergru as the court resumes after an adjournment but that's about it. The almost avuncular judge does however make a stunning contrast to the rabidly hypothalamic Roland Freisler of the July 20 showtrials.Heidemarie Hatheyer's performance in particular as the young wife is transcendent.".

It is but one powerful image among so many othersHanna's death has left Bernhard a broken man. His friend's intervention has taken the life of the woman they both loved. It is then that he opens a letter. The parents of a young girl he had once successfully treated request that he see them as soon as possible and it is behind a locked door in a children's ward that he is left to ponder the legacy of his lifesaving work She's blind she's deaf she's demented. It's wonderful you healed her doctor instead of letting the poor creature die.We are one step from a stunning climax.The right to kill shouldn't be given to a doctor alone these final medical decisions should be left to the state.There are very few visual references to betray this movie's Third Reich origins. Only once on a back wall in Thomas's office do we fleetingly see the portrait of Adolf Hitler. The legal robes bear the appropriate Hoheitszeichen and we catch a glimpse of the Hitlergru as the court resumes after an adjournment but that's about it. The almost avuncular judge does however make a stunning contrast to the rabidly hypothalamic Roland Freisler of the July 20 showtrials.Heidemarie Hatheyer's performance in particular as the young wife is transcendent.";

Opposite views are illustrated by the two main male characters Thomas played by Paul Hartmann who is the one who helps Hanna to die and Bernhard played by Mathias Wieman who is initially totally against the idea Hanna has asked him to help her die but he refused. Propaganda is about trying to convince people that your views are the right ones or justify your choices or actions. This film does not try to do either and the proof is that it ends before the verdict is rendered...

	schema:reviewBody "Ich klage an or I accuse is a German movie from 1941 so this one has its 75th anniversary this year and if you do the maths you will realize that this one here was made in Nazi German back during the dark days of World War II. The director and one of the writers is Wolfgang Liebeneiner and the two main characters are played by Heidemarie Hatheyer and Paul Hartmann. First of all yes this is a propaganda movie as it tries to get the German population on the same side about the difficult topic of euthanasia. And with same side I am of course referring to what highprofile Nazi politicians thought about this issue back then. This is the story of a couple a young woman and her older husband and how they have to deal with the female being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Unlike some other propaganda films from back in the day this one here is in blackandwhite.I must say even if I disagree with the officials' motivations in making this movie obviously! I believe that some of the central messages aren't wrong. Euthanasia is still a controversial subject today and while suicide is not considered something bad anymore really opinions differ when it comes to putting a human to sleep i.e. taking his life. There were some points and scenes in this film that I find myself agreeing with and that's also why there are more reasons to watch this film not just to understand the Nazis' propaganda machine which is a description that fits some of their other works. not this one here. I personally think the acting is fine actually pretty great from the two leads on some occasions. I also think that the screenplay is fairly good sometimes and in combination with the strong performances it grants the occasional great and truly touching moment in terms of the main characters' relationship and their emotional suffering because of the illfated young woman. And after all looking at the ending it is left open. The filmmaker did not push his or the Nazis' opinion on euthanasia entirely on the audience. On a negative note I felt that this film is way too long for its own good at two hours and should have been kept much more essential as I personally felt there were a handful scenes that really could have been left out and I am also not too sure if the final trial really should have been included. The film was at its best when Hatheyer's character was still visible on screen and the longer it went the more it felt as it was already past its peak for quite a while. Still I believe that overall the good outweighs the bad and I recommend checking it out. Thumbs up from me and this one here is a good example of how Nazi Germany also produced some really touching films that were not just false and touching for the sake of it. Good job! This really should not be banned anymore.".

Once the Nazi army invades Greece Arouch his entire family and all the Jews in Greece are shipped off to the Nazi death camp in Austwitz.Within moments all the women in Arouch's family are murdered in the gas showers. He is forced with his family and brother to work at slavelabor. Arouch is brutalized by a camp Kapo who happens to be a professional boxer as well. In a brutal scene Arouch and the Kapo have a fist fight with Arouch scoring a knockout and a Nazi camp guard finishes off the Kapo with a gun shot to the head. Arouch is then forced to box in the camp for the Nazi officers who bet on the boxing matches. Only problem the losing boxer ends up the chimney stack. A heartwrenching and brutal story. Shocking to realize that not only did the Nazi murder torture starve and kill the inmates at Auswitz but they also forced all the professional Jewish boxers to put on Galdiator matches for their entertainment.The Triumph of The Spirt is a triumph of filmmaking. A very depressing one at that.".

In a brutal scene Arouch and the Kapo have a fist fight with Arouch scoring a knockout and a Nazi camp guard finishes off the Kapo with a gun shot to the head. Arouch is then forced to box in the camp for the Nazi officers who bet on the boxing matches. Only problem the losing boxer ends up the chimney stack. A heartwrenching and brutal story. Shocking to realize that not only did the Nazi murder torture starve and kill the inmates at Auswitz but they also forced all the professional Jewish boxers to put on Galdiator matches for their entertainment.The Triumph of The Spirt is a triumph of filmmaking. A very depressing one at that.";

He was allowed life while his losing opponents perished. Based on a true story without doubt the most devastating film ever made on the topic of death camps it is extremely realistic in its presentation having been filmed in the bleak winter of 1989 on location in Auschwitz and that shows. It must have effected the cast and the crew extremely. Willem Defoe's performance proves the depth of feeling that was thus achieved and this is reflected by the whole cast. Certainly not an easy film to watch but it is rewarding and extremely moving to those who make the effort. Perhaps in some small way this film might prevent such evil being perpetrated on the world again. A remarkable achievement that predates and eclipses Schindler's List yet sadly not widely shown.".

The story is based on true incidents hence it is quite interesting historically  almost accurate and direction wise  at par with the best. Most of the characters had been explored richly and the cause effect relationship behind every subplot is quite pronounced. The movie never borders on obscurity yet ends it with a depth that is so often lacking in movies based on real life. Performance wise Willem Dafoe and Robert Loggia stands out magnificently. Everyone else does their bit to perfection... no hiccups in acting. Sometimes a bit of production value is missing that we are so used to these days. Like in the airraid scene towards the end any typical Hollywood movie these days would have wonderful SFX showing allied aircrafts and what not... but here it was just the sound Foley and a bit of pyrotechnic... quite old school but very effective.If you are a true movie buff and looking forward to relive the 80s style of movie production go for it.

It's an ode to a man refusing to accept the obvious fate and fighting to stay alive in spite of the total degeneration and breakdown of all humanity around him. In a way I compare this movie to 'The Pianist' and unlike many other holocaust movies this movie depicts the protagonist fighting back his tormentors and even bettering them as they hate him for winning every time. All this time he is like a Gladiator fighting other men who are in same position as his just to entertain ruthless Nazi officials while he is constantly aware that if he loose he would surely die. The movie is aptly named after Salamo's undying perseverance for life where his soul was been trampled. The death camp scenes sure hint that movies like Schindler's list and life is beautiful borrow heavily in visual style from this movie. Though the violence in the movie is more of suggestive and less graphic than its successors yet it proves quite moving due to a very convincing performance of William Dafoe I am sure he did work hard to get in shape and develop such agility for a boxer and to the fact that all this happened in reality. Also the soundtrack was successful in carrying the heaviness of the movie. Sure it is a seriously made movie on one of the most shameful happenings of modern human history. But at one point it can also be seen as a great boxing movie. It is like capturing the psychology of a tormented and tortured warrior and the movie does that well.".

	schema:reviewBody "Somehow in thinking of the horrors of the Holocaust thoughts of Greece do not spring readily to mind. And yet obviously there were Jews in Greece and many were interned after the Nazis occupied Greece in 1941. Triumph Of The Spirit follows the story of Salamo Arouch a Greek champion boxer who is among those sent to Auschwitz.Arouch's story is interesting. He uses boxing as a way of staying alive  fighting other prisoners for the entertainment of Nazi officers and officials knowing full well that those he defeats are destined almost certainly for execution  and that the same fate awaited him if he were to lose. The movie is rife with reflection on collaboration. The Sonderkommandos Jews who actively worked with the Nazis in exchange for privileges which included perhaps a few extra months of life are front and centre in this and we see various internees doing various things to placate the Nazis to earn favour with them  and in the circumstances who can blame them. They were uprooted from often comfortable lives and placed almost literally into hell. Defiance might have been the more noble choice but some form of collaboration was more practical. But the choice was never easy and consciences were surely wounded as those decisions were made. Arouch was played by Willem Defoe  not my favourite actor but he handled the part quite well. Some license was taken with his story as is almost always the case when a story based on fact is portrayed but basically from what I've been able to learn the broad sweep of Arouch's story is told. Really though Arouch fades into the background in this  or at least he did for me.It was the sheer brutality of Auschwitz and of Nazism that was the engine driving this movie forward. It's a realistic and gripping portrayal of the conditions in the camp  all under the slogan Arbeit Macht Frei  work makes free  the slogan that appeared over the gates entering Auschwitz. It makes what happened inside the camp sound almost noble but there was nothing noble about the type of work done in Auschwitz and it had nothing to do with freedom. That was made very clear throughout this film. It was perhaps the closest thing to hell that any of the inmates could have possibly imagined. Many died and those who survived were scarred for life left empty by the experience. The last scene I thought portrayed this quite hauntingly as Arouch  who survived  wanders lost and aimless away from the camp after liberation not knowing where he was going or what he would find. His story has a happy ending filled with marriage and children and grandchildren but how happy could it have really been all things considered.This isn't the best movie about the Holocaust ever made but it is one that stays with the viewer and it's one that provides a gripping portrayal of life inside perhaps the most notorious of the Nazi concentration camps. 810".

	schema:headline " An untold story from one of history's darkest chapters";
	schema:reviewBody "Throughout history many have preferred to forget the atrocities of the Holocaust during World War II. However Hollywood has helped to keep this important event alive thanks to films like Life is Beautiful Schindler's List and The Boy in the Striped Pajamas but sometimes there are stories that go unrecognized or forgotten. Director Robert M. Young decided to take the lesser known story of Holocaust survivor Salamo Arouch and bring it to the masses.Salamo and his family heritage of Jewish Greeks are first seen living their lives happily just before the Nazis invade their village and ship the Jewish citizens off to concentration camps specifically the dreaded Auschwitz. The film follows the Arouch family's struggle to struggle specifically showing the male members of the family and also the perspectives of Allegra Salamo's fiance and her sister on the women's side of Auschwitz. In the pivotal role of Salamo is an underrated performance by Alist star Willem Dafoe. Portraying a strongwilled survivor but also a man who loses nearly every person he loves the emotion of Dafoe's performance is raw and heartbreaking. Going from a carefree man with the world in the palm of his hand to a prisoner fighting literally to survive the harsh environment of Auschwitz. Dafoe's costar chemistry is in top form from a touchingly sweet affection for Wendy Gazelle as Allegra a believable son to Robert Loggia who plays his father and a tenuous friendship with Edward James Olmos as Gypsy the officer who aids Salamo by giving him a chance to use his boxing talents as well as a better using the term loosely job within the camp due to Salamo's consistent winning streak. Dafoe is an adept fighter with a naturally thin frame and limber muscle the actor demonstrates adept skill in the boxing arena. However as things grow from bad to worse for Salamo Dafoe portrays the right amount of emotion that expresses the character's inner pain such as the horrible losses of his brother shot for refusing to work in the crematorium and father executed in the gas chamber due to his age and no longer useful for labor to the officers of the camp and fear at never seeing his beloved Allegra again. By the film's close we are as exhausted as Salamo and hope for a happy ending after so much horror.The film's narrative is quite dark and depressing due to the subject of the Holocaust and its atrocious violence. Prisoners were forced to march for hours on end beaten if they tried to seek additional food or refusal to cooperate many were shot and gassed if their usefulness had ended and there is the violence of the boxing ring when we watch our protagonist fight. It gets bloody and exhausting as we hope that things can't get worse for the characters but knowing the history of what occurred during the Holocaust we know it is far from over until the Allied Powers finally liberated the camp in 1944.See this film as soon as you can but keep some tissues on standby cause this is gonna make you cry.".

When Charlie finds out David was a deserter in the Vietnam War. Hate builds up within as he lost his son in Vietnam and he takes it upon himself to hand out the punishment for fleeing his commitments. If there's a sorely undervalued and truly forgotten pearler Wolf Lake is one of those sleepers that should have a wider audience. It might be far from perfect as the project has some teetering problems but for most part it's an adeptly crafted and hauntingly cerebral picture. The problem area mostly arose from the oddly placed flash forward sequences that cut in and out within the narrative. This aspect certainly spoiled what's about to come and clouded the story with confusion. Feels like we the viewer are missing out on details. Actually it begins with the ending so it's not terribly surprising in the final outcome. But reading a fellow user's review on the flick it has made interested in seeing the supposed reedited The Honor Guard. As the choppy editing that was worked in was the only thing that dampened the film's edge. Despite knowing what was going to happen Burt Kennedy's sedately crisp direction was a ticking time bomb waiting to explode with the burning tension and scathing actions coming to the forefront in the closing half. Building up to this riveting game of cat and mouse was made possible by a studiously pressure filled script and a sensationally barnstorming lead turn by Rod Steiger. He really does get into his relentlessly hotheaded character but its hard to really despise him as the torment really shows in his face and we watch as it tears him apart. Whenever he and David Huffman's character David share the screen watch how intensely gripping their confrontations become and how they feed the film's fire. It's a conflict of two generations just waiting to crack over their opinions of the changing face of America. The bleakly threatening atmosphere spun out from the beautiful lakeside backdrop and isolated woodlands was made to great use and a stirring music score truly does hold a lethal sting in its rhythm. All the rich performances are well grounded and focused. David Huffman as the placidminded young man David is convincing and a lovely Robin Mattson plays hapless Linda. Jerry Hardin superbly plays the concerned and always consciousness Wilbur. His character is the little voice that Charlie would here if something he was doing didn't sit to well. Richard Herd and Paul Mantee do well in their parts. If your expecting a rough revenge  survival exploitation vehicle amongst a familiar setting. Its starts off with a lot innuendo and then some disturbing moments like rape show up. There's way more too it and gladly so. Kennedy fleshes out the situation with a diverse range of traits fusing together with excellent suspense and convicted performances. A couple hiccups can't stop this stimulating potboiler from deserving to be picked out of obscurity. Admirers of Steiger or Kennedy shouldn't miss out on this one. Recommended.".

This is not to say she deserves what happens to herthe tragedy here is that all the characters are actually sympathetic to SOME extent even if only Huffman approaches ever really being too likable.With several gun battles a gang rape a wilderness chase and lots of explosions this works pretty well as a violent action movie.

	schema:headline " Unfairly neglected seventies thriller!";
	schema:reviewBody "Plots like this have been done before and done better in some films but that doesn't stop Burt Kennedy's little known thriller 'Wolf Lake' from being a very well done and constantly intriguing little thriller. The film is not perfect there are pacing problems and a series of annoyingconfusing flashbacks that break up the narrative but it also features some strong characters and an interesting plot line with some ideas that actually do hold some weight. The film takes in themes of patriotism vigilantism and vengeance and fuses it with a thriller narrative. The base of the plot is very simple and centres on a wood cabin by the side of a lake known as 'Wolf Lake'. A group of war veterans turn up for a week of shooting drinking etc but find the cabin being looked after by a young man named David and his girlfriend. One of the group discovers that David is a war deserter and warns him that all hell will break loose if the leader of the group were to find out about it. He then goes and tells the leader ? and all hell breaks loose.The film stars Rod Steiger and the actor gives a real powerhouse performance and is definitely the best thing about the film. His character is the most complex in the film and even though his actions are extreme they are justified and Steiger manages to make the role believable which is testament to his acting talent. The film is rather slow to start although this time is used well in building up the plot line and characters. We get a good impression of the central players early on and this makes the film more involving by the time we get to the inevitable conclusion. The location used is excellent in that it creates a real feeling of loneliness for the central characters they really are out in the middle of nowhere with no chance of help coming for them. The central plot and the problem between the two main characters are open for debate and also give the audience plenty to think about. Overall while this film does have some flaws it's still an excellent thriller and it's very unfair that this is so little known! See it if you get the chance.".

The central plot and the problem between the two main characters are open for debate and also give the audience plenty to think about. Overall while this film does have some flaws it's still an excellent thriller and it's very unfair that this is so little known! See it if you get the chance.";

	schema:reviewBody "Given that the movie takes place in Canada and with producer Melvin Simon having dabbled with the Canadian tax shelter system you might have reason to believe WOLF LAKE is one of the outputs Canada made during its tax shelter period. Especially since it happens to be a thriller taking place in the backwoods. Surprisingly though the credits reveal that the movie was in fact shot in Mexico!While the premise of the movie may seem somewhat familiar even though I can't think of any movie with a plot that's exactly like this one it does have some exceptional elements part due to writerdirector Kennedy a veteran western director. In fact some parts of the movie do resemble a western. The production values are really strong boosted no doubt by the ability to squeeze more value out of a dollar in Mexico and the camera placing and other directional touches are very professional. Kennedy manages to give this lakeside setting an unsettling feeling a sense of the threats to come.Kennedy also handles the cast pretty well though all the actors seem well prepared and up to the challenge. The acting is really good due in part that Kennedy gives the actors dialogue that fleshes out their characters. Steiger no surprise towers over everyone. Though his character is a villain whose eventual behavior can't be excused you really sense the grief his character has been suffering for years  a grief that has eaten him up and filled him with poison. He's a frightening character even before crossing the line because his behavior is so believable.The movie is not perfect though. The biggest flaw is that at least in the version I saw there are flashforwards in the first half of the movie that manage to spoil almost every major happening in the second half. The second half has a flashBACK to a previously unseen event which makes as much sense as those flashforwards! Also it takes over half of the running time before the crisis actually starts! Incidently the movie runs only 87 minutes which is a pretty short running time. Given that short running time and those confusing edits there's a chance the movie's slow though not boring first half panicked the investors and resulted in some drastic changes. Apparently the movie was rereleased a few years later in its original form as THE HIGHEST HONOR which I would like to see and compare. Maybe some enterprising DVD company could rerelease the movie on that format with each version on a separate side of the DVD. It's not as if the rights for such an obscurity would cost that much.".

This year they notice that the cabins are being taken care of by David David Huffman and Linda Robin Mattson. It doesn't take long for Charlie to start messing around and picking on David but things turn much darker when the men find out that David dodged the war.WOLF LAKE is a film that not many people saw when it was originally released and I doubt too many people have seen it since. In fact had I not stumbled across it during a sale then I probably would have missed it as well and that's really too bad because it's a rather interesting if flawed thriller. What makes the film work and especially in today's times is its views on how people should treat their country and we also get some fabulous performances.It should go without saying that it's Steiger who steals the picture with yet another wonderful performance. The actor really has to show off pain and anger and he does so wonderfully. The way Steiger mixes both the anger and pain to explain why his character is the way he is really helps sell the film. The supporting players are all extremely good as well and that's especially true for both Huffman and Mattson. The film basically starts off as a weekend getaway picture before turning much darker once the friends learn about David's past. Even then there are some interesting ideas being floated around about what it means to serve your country and love it. I do think things take a turn for the worse during the final third of the picture when we basically have everyone lose their mind and so some things that I just didn't believe would happen. I'm not going to ruin anything but Charlie basically makes the three other do a very criminal act and I just didn't believe they would have gone through with it.With that being said it's really too bad WOLF LAKE isn't a better known movie but it's certainly a gem that needs to be rediscovered.".

	schema:reviewBody "Rod Steiger typically ratchets up the intensity in this interesting revenge thriller from director Burt Kennedy a filmmaker who mostly made Westerns. Kennedy also wrote this one about a quartet of WWII veterans who gather for an outing at a hunting lodge. Soon after they arrive they learn that the regular caretaker is away and taking his place is a young man David Huffman who turns out to be a Vietnam War deserter. Naturally this doesn't sit well with group leader Charlie Steiger a former Marine who lost his son Danny in Vietnam. Things get very ugly before long.I think it's way too bad that some viewers will feel put off by an admittedly slow first half. It's good that Kennedy and company take their time to allow us to get to know these characters and to not paint them in only broad strokes. Even David a character whom some in the audience will feel inclined to despise is not rendered merely one dimensional. You do however feel the incredible tension in the environment slowly getting worse and worse and know that there's going to be Hell to pay as Steiger gives Huffman more than just a piece of his mind. In a sense the film is largely predictable but it's compelling nevertheless and in the end there is not just murder in the cards but rape as well. David has a sweet sexy girlfriend named Linda played by Robin Mattson who did her share of exploitation features in the 70s and went on to become a soap opera regular.It's all very sobering and very sad with a grim feeling of inevitability hanging over the entire proceedings.Steiger is great and gets some opportunities to really sink his teeth into his material and dialogue. Huffman is fine as well. A trio of top character actors  Jerry Hardin 'The XFiles' as worry wart Wilbur Paul Mantee Robinson Crusoe on Mars as the macho Sweeney and Richard Herd Trancers as the amiable George  round out the minimal acting ensemble.Although set in Canada it may surprise some to learn that the film was actually shot in Mexico!Eight out of 10.".

Originality might not be this film's biggest trump perhaps but it's intense and unsettling from start to finish and brought to an even higher level by the phenomenal performance of Rod Steiger as the embittered War veteran with outmoded patriotic ideals. Charlie along with three of his obedient and docile buddies arrive at Wolf Lake for their annual weekend of duck hunting poker gaming and whiskey boozing. Their usual contact person isn't there but they meet with the young caretaker David and his sexy girlfriend Linda. They find out David is a fugitive Vietnam deserter and this happens to be a very sensitive issue for Charlie because he lost his son there. To him all deserters are cowards who're to blame for the downfall of America. Charlie taunts and provokes David but the posse really goes too far during a wild drinking party. And you know how that goes once you cross a certain line . there's no way back. Wolf Lake is obviously inspired by the 70's trends of Vietnam veterans going mental Open Season Rolling Thunder and remote backwoods survival thrillers Deliverance Straw Dogs. Writerdirector Burt Kennedy may not be Sam Peckinpah or John Boorman but he undeniably manages to keep his movie suspenseful and creepy. The isolated setting is very effective for starters and so are Ken Thorne's pounding score and the unnervingly slow pacing. Some political debate sequences are so intelligent and powerful that it's a real shame that the film remained so obscure and unavailable on DVD. The only really annoying thing about Wolf Lake is that the plot stupidly spoils itself the entire time by showing brief but revealing images of vital things happening later in the film. What the hell's the point of that?".
