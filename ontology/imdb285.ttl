If there's anyone out there with such a copy i'll be willing to buy it at a price. I rated this movie 7 out of 10 because of the fabulous costumes exotic scenes escapades and hot and steamy scenes. To be true..i don't know which is the most erotic between this Ali Baba and Sheherazade 1982. You have to see them to judge between the two.".

Yes there are lots of naked women on offer in this movie but not really that much of a plot. Technically the film is perfect very colourful and with excellent sets and lighting but let's face it  who cares about the scenery when all these naked and halfnaked women are on view? With this FrenchItalian offering you can be sure there's not long to wait before another nubile young woman parades herself before the camera.The lead role of Ali Baba is played as a mischievous and excitable young man by the Britishborn Alan Barker who never went on to fame of any sort. However I have to admit that he does look good in the role and probably comes closest to how most people think Ali Baba would look. As for the supporting cast well most of the men are portrayed as bumbling idiots getting into all sorts of scrapes complete with comedystyle music and the women aren't exactly required to act. The plot sees Ali going from one woman to the next until he ends up falling from a window and then some woman makes an aphrodisiac potion or something and the film ends with everybody sleeping together. This is mildly amusing stuff but nothing to go out of your way to see but at eighty minutes in length it never becomes boring or dull. It's just okay.".

	schema:headline " Good Film but too politically correct";
	schema:reviewBody "Let's be clear on this one this is a good film to watch. Picture quality is more than adequate and the characters are very well developed. The first prize has to go to the boy Isaiah himself who really was cute no other word to describe him. The story is well executed and of course does not fail to raise emotion. What I query in the film is its political correctness. Any normal person would expect the boy to remain with his adoptive mother as his biological mother had left him for and even considered him to be dead. That his biological mother on finding out he's alive tries to reclaim him seems normal. What is not normal however is that the courts give any creedence to the idea that he should be given back to her as it is implied on the sole grounds that he has the same colour skin as her !!! The rubbish spoken by her lawyer to the effect that black babies should be with black mothers should have been shown to be the rubbish it is but it seems to come across as being the only argument that influenced the court's decision as no other factor seems to have warranted the baby being returned to its biological mother. I am sure that if the roles and been reversed and that it was a white baby abandoned in a trash can adopted by a black family the courts would have left it with its adoptive family on the basis that skin colour had no importance only the love of a stable family. This last hypothesis is in my opinion the just one but it should be applied in all cases whatever the colour of the baby and whatever the colour of the family. One get's the impression the director wants to be good to the blacks at all costs even when the wellbeing of the child in this case would dictate otherwise and I call this being a victim of political correctness. Of course the ending is diluted and we see Khaila calling back Jessica Lange to look after the child when she realises that she can't cope. Her behaviour throughout the film is quite plausible and quite understandeable. What is not it the behaviour of her attorney and the courts. I am not an American but one of the great things about that country is the mixture of origins which has gone to forge it  people of all colours and races but all American. Once you go down the line of wanting to make a black child have a black doll read obligatorily books about black characters have black parents etc etc you are starting down the same path as the Ku Klux Klan many years ago and it's not better but more of the same. To get back to the film though I would highly recommend it but would warn viewers of its failing as described above.".

Maybe it's because I'm from Canada where I don't believe that racial issues play as important a part as in the United Statesof course racist attitudes exist in Canada but I was completely astonished that the colour of someone's skin was the deciding factor of where a child belongs  that's completely unrealistic to me and that was the ONLY point the biological mother's lawyer made.  Give me a break!  As a mother I understand that the only reason you have a child is to give life to that child for it to be happy and your ownership never plays a feeling moment because when you really love and care for a child you're ultimate feeling is for that child to be happy and you as the loving mother always comes second  that child comes first! This particular movie explained the baby to be thrown in the garbage and that fact was never brought out in court.  It's not about racemoney  this movie was unrealistic and for those who think the biological mother was right  ask yourself if you're thinking of the child or a selfish adult who cannot grow up and admit a mistake and try and make it better by considering the child's feelings at this point.  Wouldn't it be better if the biological mother introduced herself slowly into the child's life and not turned his world upside down at an age where he only looks for security???  And the biological mother never once thanked the adopted mom for saving her baby's life and taking care of him.  Again I found this movie unrealistic and disturbing that the torment of a child would be allowed especially by someone who says they love them  that's not love that's selfishness!As for the ending  the biological mother shouldn't have won period. imagine the poor kid never would have went through the torment.  a mother even gradually brings their child to daycare before they leave their child for just a couple hours!".

	schema:reviewBody "I come from a family of 3 children 2 adpoted and have to applaud this movie for doing a good job of pointing out that being a parent isn't about giving birth or donating sperm. A child always belongs with a family that loves him it shouldn't be about color or wealth or any other irrelevant factors. It's about responsibility and love. Any one can have a baby not everyone can be a parent. There are certainly some stereotypes and the movie goes to the extreme point of a mother who literally throws away her baby to a family that is white wealthy and kind to the child. The movie does this for dramatic purposes and succeeds in provoking a response from the many viewers who have seen this movie as reviews will show. The movie also manages to enrage without even engaging the color issues. When Khaila's character tells her lawyer but I'm his mother and insists on her parental rights it isn't even about color but about what is important about being a mother. Her character thinks that giving birth gives her rights over this tiny human being well played by Marc when even children should be viewed as human beings with rights themselves. Parents who view children as possesions are wrong. I am white my husband is Mexican does our child belong with one or the other? Khaila's lawyer says black babies belong with black mothers. Is that what we want to teach? Segregation? Doesn't work for me. Babies of any color belong with the people who take care of them and love them. That's what being a parent is.".

	schema:reviewBody "LOSING ISAIAH is a moving and wellacted drama that takes a hotbutton issue to an emotionally manipulative level but will involve you to the point of taking sides. Halle Berry plays a crack addict who one night desperate to get high leaves her newborn baby in a pile of garbage and when she returns after her mission finds the baby gone. The baby is rescued and is eventually taken home and raised by a sensitive social worker Jessica Lange who decides to raise and adopt the hyperactive crackaddicted baby as her own. In the meantime Berry gets clean wants her baby back and takes Lange to court to regain custody of her son. This is an involving story that provides a balanced account of an emotional issue and if you're really paying attention you will find your alliance with the protagonists in this story switching from time to time. Lange is solid as always and Halle Berry works hard at being convincing as a reformed junkie. Strong support is provided by Samuel L. Jackson and LaWanda Richardson the reallife spouse of Jacksonas Lange and Berry's attorneys David Straithern as Lang'es husband and Daisy Prince as Lange's daughter. No matter how hard you try to remain neutral this film will suck you in and find you taking sides.".

On the other hand I would do anything for my sons even if it meant me being in pain... so perhaps I would do the same as her and go.What really bothers me is Halle Berry's motivation it seems to be pure selfishness on her part to disrupt a family 4 years after Isaiah's placement. I can understand her desire to be part of his life I am sure the mothers of both my sons think of them on occasion and I hope they are secure in the knowledge that their children are being raised as lovingly as is possible. So would a mom do what she did? Perhaps but I have to ask is it out of love or some sense of pride!".

	schema:reviewBody "I totally disagree with those critics who say that the ending of Losing Isaiah is wishywashy' or a cowardly compromise' to quote IMDB reviewers.  I found it very satisfying and the only one that has a chance of working for this situation.  POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOW  Biological mother Halle Berry makes a very intelligent decision when she enlists the help of Jessica Lange as the boy's foster mother in raising the child.  It was monstrous to simply wrench the 4 year old boy out of the only home he's ever known and plunk him down in a totally alien environment.  No wonder he totally shuts down and withdraws.  I believe that what the two women do is something that should be tried in more cases of this type.  The judge should have given them joint custody allowing the child to be kept with the foster mother but also allowing the biological mother visitation rights perhaps babysitting him and taking care of him while the other mother is busy.  This would give the child an opportunity to get to know his real mother and vice versa since the boy is a stranger to her as well.  As he grows older he will probably become more curious about his racial heritage and may eventually grow as close to his real mother as he was to his foster mother in the beginning.  At any rate this is a strong compelling drama beautifully acted all around.".

	schema:reviewBody "Just from reading the plot of Losing Isaiah I felt the film is better suited to a Lifetime movie. But after seeing the film I may have to change my mind because on the whole it is a very powerful and impacting film about child custody and the best interests of the child. The film would have been so much better expect the film didn't have an ending at all. I did not like the ending and that took down my rating a notch or two. But film will strongly affect everyone especially those who tend to be politically correct.Stephen Gyllenhaal's film is about a custody battle over an abandoned kid between two women. One woman is a former black crack addict who is now sober and leading a better life but not after abandoning her kid in a drug haze. The other woman is a white social services worker who has a welloff family and a nice place to live. Now the crack addict named Khaila decides to sue to get her child back.This film is strongly acted. Jessica Lange gives a hell of a performance as Margaret Lewin who shows unconditional love to the boy. Halle Berry also delivers a potent performance as Khaila the grieving mother who also truly cares for her son. Samuel L. Jackson makes a good appearance as Khaila's lawyer and David Strathairn was decent as Margaret's wife.Overall Losing Isaiah is a great movie but it could have been more if it wasn't for that horrid ending that left me with even more questions. But there is no denying the emotion the film provokes and the sympathy that is created for each woman. Each of them has their faults but both of them truly care for the kid which makes this custody case even more heartwrenching. I wasn't even able to choose a side. But this is a great film and I'm surprised I haven't heard of it until now. With a better ending the film would have been perfect. I rate this film 810.".

In reality you can see that the Lewins were better fit to raise Isaiah than Khaila. I don't think a real court would ever give a child like that to its biological mother considering her background! Maybe if she found a job good enough to support a child before taking the case to court I would've rooted for her more. In real life a woman like Khaila can't compete with parents like the Lewins. The only thing I saw wrong with the Lewins was that they didn't read to him multicultural books or showed him any real pictures of people of different skin color so he could learn more about himself.".

Nobody could argue with the acting and Halle Berry Fans who may not be aware of this filmit's from awhile ago may want to see it but and I have to stop here and out MAJOR ENDING SPOILER!!!!!The movie kind of lacks credibility because of the unreal quality of the ending. In real life it just usually would not happen like this. While it's perfectly OK for movies to be unrealistic in this case the movie starts off to gamely tackle a very important REALISTIC issue that a lot of humans go through. The ending was not only unrealistic it was almost implausible.I was quite young when I first saw this and at the time I was glad it ended as it did because the movie was heartbreaking enough so being young I WANTED a nice cut and dried Hollywood ending.But now being all grown up and seeing the agony real people go through in this situation I'm not sure the ending was as good as I thought then. Of coarse it would be really REALLY difficult for the writers to end it any other way and thus appear to take sides. So they chose to play it safe. I think the movie would however have been taken more seriously had it maybe been done a little differently though of coarse that would have come with it's own set of problems.Maybe Losing Isaiah was a movie that was just to ahead of its time.".

Originally he denied paternity so he never signed off on the adoption. She kept her adopted boy at the end but my heart went out to her at the time. The plot of Losing Isaiah is of course a little bit different but it deals with the same emotional issue of having a child that you are raising ripped away from you to be with the biological parent. This of course raises lots of interesting questions such as what defines being a parent? So because of my own personal experiences I found the movie very moving and upsetting and I cried at the very end. So I guess the film worked for me. That being said I'm not sure this situation could ever happen in real life. In real life would Halle Berry's character EVER have had a chance of finding her baby years after she abandoned him in a crackinduced haze? Seems pretty doubtful to me.".

Since it is closer to a perfect ten than a perfect 9 however I had to give it a 10.Far Side of The Moon is an absolute gem of a film. Robert Lepage is another one of those depressingly competent people who writes directs and stars in his own films. It is so enchanting that its length under an hour and three quarters seems even shorter than it is.Far Side... is chock full of the most carefully constructed sequences I have ever seen in the cinema. There is literally not one frame that has not been carefully nurtured and coaxed into placelike a piece of a brightly colored mosaicto create what must be one of the most seamlessly engineered set of images in film history.There are no stock shots in this film. Not one shot is ever simply thrown in to get on with the plot. Each scene segues beautifully into the next each is composed with the utmost care. This is what film making should be. While the movie relies servilely on often complexspecial effects for the realization of its vision these techniques are not there just for the wow factor rather they are all in the service of a unified directorial vision full of resonant symbols and painterly motifs that seem always to reach toward each other as if in a dance.You would think that this obsessive attention to setting and color and detail would make the movie stiff and formal. But it does not. First of all Lepage and his character Philippe are full of such selfdeprecating irony that there are almost as many laughs as there are sighs of wonder in the movie. But moreover the film is a supremely dramatic and melancholic tale . Lepage has created in his character Philippe probably the greatest sad sack since Nabokov's Pnin. You can't help but feel for the poor helpless loser tricked by his hyperactive and poetic imagination into a failed marriage a failed university degree and a failed relation with the only two family members he has.Funny tragic witty and visually splendid. Why don't more moves like this get made?Numer of car chases 0 Number of gun shots 0 Number of psychopathic killers 0 Number of action heroes 0".

I know Lepage a bit because of works he did in theater and the fact that he usually does plays is pretty obvious in the way the film is made if you pay attention specially the way he uses the background in many scenes.I first have to warn a few people who are thinking about seeing this movie. Although the magic of it by the way Lepage plays with scenery background and various imaginative nonrealistic shots is pretty accessible to everyone like say Big Fish is some people might discard the plot as simplistic and unworthy. If it is hard to actually say the opposite the point is that to make a plot that's original or particularly thrilling wasn't the goal. It's basically just the day to day life of a dreamer who isn't quite successful in any aspect of his life would it be on a professional or social basis. But the movie wants to show that despite theses lacks the main character I forgot the name is still an original person with imagination et interesting thoughts. To make that point I might take the various imaginary scenes where Lepage take us or simply the video the guy shots fort the SETI program. You'll notice that most of the interesting commentary and clever interventions by the main character are made while shooting this movie and that he is alone doing so. It just emphasis the fact that he's apparently quite boring but actually an interesting person.Another clever idea in the movie is that there actually isn't many differences between the shots taken during the children hood of the guy in the 70's and the on taken in 2000 while he's 40. Besides many transitions take place from 2000 to the 70's or the other way around without any warning. This is to show that the character didn't really evolved much. He was a dreamer when younger and unlike many he didn't change when he grew up.About transitions they all are very very smooth and you end up at the end of the movie not so sure if it wasn't only one long shot. Any viewer able to appreciate a movie for anything else but it's plot should see this one. The soundtrack mostly Beethoven songs is also quite fit.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unlike the ancient notion that the moon is a mirror of the Earth's surface modern space exploration and satellite imagery have revealed that the moon is a large cratered rock with the far side permanently turned away from the Earth. In Quebecois director Robert Lepage's film Far Side of the Moon the moon's far side serves as a metaphor for the divide that separates two brothers each with a different sexual orientation. Based on a oneman stage play by Mr. Lepage it is both a history of man's exploration of the surface of the moon and the inner exploration of two individuals who are trying to put their life in order after the death of their mother AnneMarie Cadieux.Shot in fifteen days in digital video using dissolves and CGI the film creates a dazzling confluence of reality and fantasy that moves effortlessly between past and present utilizing delightful surreal effects that form a bridge between the Earth and the cosmos. Philippe looks at the window of a washing machine and sees the vastness of space a trip into the stomach of a pregnant mother turns a fetus into a tiny astronaut connected to his craft the stacking of bottles in a restaurant becomes the launching of a space mission and a man walking on snow becomes an explorer on the moon. The two brothers Philippe and Andr are performed in a dual role by the director. Philippe is an unhappy dreamer with no relationship and no profession.He works as a telephone solicitor for the Montreal newspaper Le Soleil but is clearly distracted and makes personal calls to his exgirlfriend Cline Bonnier and his brother that cause his employer consternation. His younger brother Andr a gay man is a weatherman for the local television station and maintains an ongoing relationship with Carl Marco Poulin. More carefree than Philippe he is preoccupied with disposing of his mother's possessions. Philippe is a perennial student who at age forty is still seeking approval for his Doctoral dissertation which argues that man's desire to explore space is built not on discovering the mystery and wonder of the universe but on his own narcissism  his act of selfprojection.When Philippe's thesis is again rejected by his Doctoral committee however he seeks other avenues for recognition but they lead only to humiliation. He is treated rudely by guards when he wants to give a copy of his paper to former Russian cosmonaut Alexi Leonov is thrown out of a late night bar for being loud and drunk has an embarrassing meeting with Carl at a sauna and when he receives an invitation to present his paper at a symposium in Moscow ridiculously forgets to adjust his watch to local time and faces an empty theater. Finally given a chance to showcase his creative talent when he is accepted as a participant in a SETI project to collect home videos to send into space he limits his film to showing his apartment while rambling about his life and his video lacks poetry or self awareness.As Philippe's life becomes increasingly dysfunctional and his estrangement with Andr more pronounced a suddenly discovered secret brings the two brothers together. Like the scarred far side of the moon their lives have sustained repeated impacts which they have kept well hidden. Now that their scars are revealed a huge burden has been lifted and with the aid of CGI Philippe's weightless body can ascend into space. Far Side of the Moon is entertaining and highly imaginative and I would recommend it yet there is little emotion in the film and for all its transcendental motifs I found it to be lacking a sense of the mystery and wonder of either outer or inner space.".

I'm not sure if it's just my enthusiasm from having seen the play but the story was just one that I felt I wanted to embrace again.  The stage play was so cinematic that a movie seemed inevitable and the transitions between scenes were even enhanced through the use of a camera rather than stage.

In one scene we actually see him looming over his Montral neighborhood like Gulliver in the Land of Lilliput. There's a frozen goldfish named Beethoven a selfrighteous younger brother also Robert Lepage and a loving mother who never speaks a single word AnneMarie Cadieux. The way Robert Lepage treats fact fiction dream memory and fantasy as aspects of the same seamless reality are reminiscent of Michel Gondry but in a minor key. La Face Cache is a quiet movie moving through the darkness with the solemn gravity of a heavenly body in tune with the celestial harmonies of Benot Jutras' original score.

After it ended we all looked at each other and simply shrugged as we were so confused about what the movie was even about. It was one of the few times I've spoken about a movie to total strangers spontaneously after seeing it. Apparently it was a play adapted to a movie setting yet the special effects were too cheesy like the rope moving the moon across the scene was visible. Also the main character of this movie is just not a goodlooking man and for one of the twins he plays he looks extremely bad. This badlooking twin is unfortunately the star of this movie and he wasn't a sympathetic character. He is working on his master's and works as a telemarketer and is miserable. This movie was too disjointed or maybe I don't get the philosophical message underlying it. I just saw someone miserable who is perfectly willing to stay miserable and avoids positive change. I wholeheartedly support Canadian films yet this is the worst Canadian film I've ever seen. And that is saying a lot as there are many mediocre Canadian films.".

There are at least two major misspellings one above the entrance to Tsiolkovsky Institute in presumably Moscow there is no such institution in real life. The other is on the poster at the airport towards the end of the movie. And the Aeroflot announcement on the plane to Moscow sounds just a little bit accented and unAeroflotish.

For the first time with Les motifs associs 2010 Amris has opted for a lighter tone ... without indulging in superficiality for all that. His new effort marks in fact an interesting evolution in JeanPierre Amris's way to address his subjects. At ease with the problems of others his characters the writerdirector has now decided to examine a question that concerns his own self and to do it with optimism.For if there is a subject that JeanPierre Amris knows like the back of his hand it is hyper emotionality. A highly emotional person himself since he was a child Amris has however been able to give a film crew orders to guide them and to impose himself on them a thing an overly timid creature would never dream of ever managing to do. Having now overcome his handicap at least to some extent as he occasionally still finds it hard to make a decision or deal with strangers the director has undertaken to share his experience with his audiences and help the victims of hyper emotionality to have a better life.And what better way to achieve this goal than resorting to the romantic comedy genre? For sure provided a filmmaker avoids falling into the trap of oversentimentality he or she will make an audience susceptible to the attraction of one character to the other and take advantage of this feeling of empathy to instill his message in the complicit viewers. What JeanPierre Amris needed first was two amiable spokespersons to pass on his message and with the help of his cowriter Philippe Blasband he has given life to an engaging couple consisting of JeanRen the owner of a small chocolate factory who has never overcome his mental blocks and has remained single despite his deep love for women and Anglique probably the best chocolate maker alive but who for exactly the same reasons has failed to make a name for herself and to find the genial soul. Mission accomplished as the two characters are well delineated and remarkably interpreted by Benot Poelvoorde and Isabelle Carr.This established all the suspense will lie in the fact that though Anglique and JeanRen share a common passion for chocolate and are drawn to each other the fear of giving a bad image of themselves and of taking the first step is a source of misunderstanding and tends to estrange them. Will there be a happy ending? Nothing is less certain...Through this situation and these two characters JeanPierre Amris describes with the light touch allowed by comedy the nightmare experienced by those people who are so scared of life that they miss out on it preferring the safety of doing nothing over the risks of taking action. And not taking action does not only bring frustration to the people concerned  it is also misleading to others. Deep inside themselves neither is JeanRen this gruff unpleasant boss nor Anglique this slightly retarded little girl. They are much better persons and deserve better. Les motifs anonymes will thus recount Anglique and Jean Ren's desperate efforts to become a couple on the one hand and to become who they are on the other describing the various means they use to this end consulting a behavioral psychologist doing exercises to try to ACT even if the odds seem impossible using auto suggestion trying to touch someone to invite a person to the restaurant joining a mutual aid movement such as the Emotifs Anonymes hence the title...A useful film for the overly timid an entertaining and charming one for the more extrovert Les motifs anonymes is played to perfection by the ever delightful and fresh Isabelle Carr and cast againsttype Benot Poelvoorde. There is such a chemistry between the two onscreen partners that you never doubt for a single moment that the princess can be infatuated with a bullfrog!A comedy with a heart Les motifs anonymes contains several scenes to remember  the disaster dinner at the restaurant JeanRen singing 'Dark Eyes' to Anglique at the hotel JeanRen's declaration of love to Anglique during an Emotifs Anonymes meeting.Don't be shy. Go and see it. Your audacity will be rewarded!".

But it feels so good it doesn't matter and that's the way Romantics Anonymous works. The leading woman Isabelle Carre He Loves Me He Loves Me Not is a sweet cute lovable introvert and I suppose any movie with her in it acting vulnerable and awkward would be a winner. Next to her is a very geeky kind of leading French actor Benoit Pelvoorde who is utterly brilliant even if he won't quite steal your heart. Or maybe he will. Part of the movie's aim is to take two mild misfits who are lonely and yet rather wonderful inside and get the audience to identify with them.Another major character is the little chocolate factory where they meet. Seeing the chocolates being made and tasted is part of the fun of the movie. Even if you don't like chocolate you'll see the pleasure of a superb highend chocolate being developed as you watch. There are then two groups of sidekicks one for each character. The woman goes to group therapy for her emotional issues hence the name of the movie and the man has his staff at the factory. All of them are en masse supportive and sweet.In fact with all this sweetness going on you might wonder how you can stand it. And I suppose that's where you appreciate that it's just an hour and a quarter. Plenty. Even at this length you yearn for some complication or some depth. Our two lovebirds are great but they remain oddly cardboard thin too. It's a bit ogreish to complain about such a wellmeaning and wellmade movie. It's edited with breakneck speed shot well acted well and rises up the television sitcom genre it may somehow owe something to. Give it a look. Totally fun.".

It's a movie that addresses the insecurities we all have had or perhaps still have. And how could anybody not fall in love with Isabelle Carre and her delightful Angelique character. It's a lighter piece or work yet it's not fluff. It addresses some serious social issues but in a delightful entertaining engaging manner. Watching this and recently the splendid TV series Engagements Spiral I have developed a whole new appreciation of French cinema. In many ways it's better than British work and incomparably ahead of Hollywood's efforts. I dare you not to love this film and the people in it".

	schema:reviewBody "The very words Romantic Comedy now inflict feelings of dread upon any sober moviegoer especially those with a stereotypical girlfriend to entertain. Just like the musical genre was once an intelligent and stylistic way of telling an emotionally complex story but has since become the theatrical equivalent of a mindless action blockbuster so too has the romantic comedy lost its exciting inventiveness. Although an unimaginably long time ago the mixture of colourful romance and witty humour that has the two feeding off and enriching each other was successfully used to create one delightful story. It was about a shy hapless young bachelor who comes across a seemingly cold unfeeling and cantankerous young woman. Under ordinary circumstances they would never even care to look at each other but there something unusual and convenient happens that allows the man to get up close and personal with the woman and eventually her heart is softened and the man starts to overcome his social anxieties. Yet alas the truth is unravelled about this unusual and convenient event and the two are torn apart because the girl is too upset to hear an explanation and the man is too lazy to persist and prefers to mope around at a pub where someone is playing a slow sad tune on the piano. Luckily the leads' wisecracking best friends are there to set them back on track and deliver a happy ending.I'm sure this story delighted its original audience however since then no other story has been created using that promising combination of humour and love but this same story has been recycled over a hundred times since rendering the source indiscernible and slaughtering the impact.Thank goodness that JeanPierre Amris has been much more proactive and freethinking in his approach to cowriting and directing Les motifs anonymes where both the guy and the girl are shy hapless embarrassed romantics. Although such a twist might seem like the sort of cheesy gimmick usually employed by the moneygrubbing directors of a superfluous Hollywood sequel it's surprising how much it changes and refreshes the dynamic and how much Amris allows it do so. Whilst he inevitably lets in some aspects of that dreaded overused narrative he has the courage to put down the rulebook and fly solo for quite a few scenes. Most notably after the disastrous first date where the ceaselessly paranoid but adorable middleaged JeanRen Van Den Hugde Benot Poelvoorde abruptly jumps ship in a fit of nerves his lovely but hopelessly jittery employee Anglique Delange Isabelle Carr doesn't say a bad word against him. Je suis nul I'm hopeless she repeats to herself after every one of these debacles believing that she is the maniac who keeps scaring off this perfectly normal friendly old man. Conversely JeanRen scolds himself just as harshly. Therefore the situation is both tragic and enjoyably ironic giving the audience plenty of opportunities to sob and chuckle heartily. Thankfully though these complications are never frustrating because they are believable and in many ways relatable and because Amris and coscreenwriter Philippe Blasband aren't delving into a bottomless bag of improbable plot points.Another effort worth mentioning is the simultaneous capture of the joys of chocolate and the passion and ingenuity that goes into the craft showing an impressiveness willingness to tackle more than one piece of subject matter and not just for future plot conveniences. However they do interconnect in quite a clever way. Mlle Delange is a uniquely talented chocolatier but her debilitating social difficulties make it impossible for her to discuss any of her methods or accept the fulsome praise that critics are desperate to give her so she invents a hilariously wacky scenario in order to distance herself from her creations. The audience feels just as much frustration for her lack of recognition as they do for the countless misunderstandings between her and Ren and for Ren's incredibly clumsy business operation of the chocolate company for which they both work and that is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy despite the efforts of his very kindly employees and supporters.If the story that I am describing doesn't sound particularly amusing and just unusual and dismal then that is perhaps for the best for humour is ultimately inexplicable and if explained in advance it spoils the unconscious reaction of gleeful laughter. All I can tell you is to trust the French to take a quirky story and make it funny moving and meaningful all at once. The main method Amris employs in order to achieve this balance is to ensure that the audience is familiar with the characters and feels sympathetic towards them before he dares to start mixing in anything sentimental so that the audience isn't suddenly asked to take seriously the soulless clowns whose misfortune they have just been delighting in. Finally as well as this nice and even consistency of hilarity and comparative solemnity he recognises that a few welltimed irresistible French renditions of the song I Have Confidence from The Sound of Music 1965 can't hurt but that is the only surprise I'm willing to give away.".

	schema:reviewBody "Why do the French do everything with so much more finesse than we do? JeanPierre Ameris brings us the simplest of love stories with characters who touch your soul and with humorous twists that surprise and delight. Romantics Anonymous is a mustsee. Must I tell you.Halfway through watching this fine film on Netflix I felt I could not go another minute without a piece of chocolate. We are not talking about a Hershey bar I had to drive sixteen miles each way to Chatham Manor Chocolates for a few of their chocolatecovered caramels without the salt and then hightail it back to my house to watch the second half of the movie while savoring the sensuous chocolate in the way the movie demands. Clearly Director and Writer Ameris like most French people knows his chocolate and the movie is better for it. The flavors will penetrate the chocolate. Impregnate it. Sexual. Sensual. Sensational. To ensure you need not leave in the middle be sure and have some really fine chocolate on hand.Did I mention it's funny? Laughoutloud funny even as it makes you feel empathy for the painful way these two people JeanRene the chocolate factory owner and Angelique the secret chocolate maker who he hires to do sales. Both of them try  and keep trying  to live in a world that is very difficult for them to navigate. He has them repeat statements just made to them in a way that is laugh out loud funny confirming their issues. Two painfully shy people whose faces could make a hardened criminal apologize for frightening them. Two people who have a passion for chocolate and a long unfulfilled need to be loved. I loved them both. I'm so glad they loved each other.Benoit Poelvoorde who plays JeanRene is an Inspector Clouseau clone but better. While Clouseau was unaware of his own ridiculousness our JeanRene Van Den Hugde is painfully aware of his. That awareness is what makes him so compelling  and a stronger character than Clouseau. His innocent presentation of his Achilles heel shyness and his running away to regroup at every difficult moment is moving and so very well done. And yet he never gives up which makes us pause to consider our own ability to walk away when the going gets tough. Isabelle Carre JeanRene's Angelique is as pure as chocolate itself. She's humble wears a dimple next to her mouth that I have never seen the likes of on anyone before. A hopeful smile that you could practice in front of a mirror for years and never get right. The two together are magic.Ameris uses the camera in a way that follows his thought process that I haven't seen done before. For example when JeanRene is interviewing Angelique for a job the camera goes back and forth between the two over and over again even when they aren't speaking. It helps emphasize the discomfort between them the anxiety that silence causes for two people who are not ready for its intimacy. Back and forth back and forth. But instead of making our heads spin it simulates the characters' anxiety for us. Great technique. Others should try it. Works better than words.Lest you think my love is blind there are a few flaws. There is a scene that is reminiscent of Notting Hill. In Notting Hill Hugh Grant looks at his friends when he realizes he's made a mistake in rejecting Julia Roberts and they all pile into a small car and speed off to correct the error before it's too late. They are all a bit ridiculous but in a sweet way not a silly way. I thought it was a nice scene. Romantics Anonymous has the same moment. JeanRene is explaining to his Keystone Cop chocolate factory workers that he has walked from the chocolate maker extraordinaire and love of his life and they make the same plea as Hugh Grant's posse for him to get it right and hurry. They pile into a car too small for the group and head out to find her. It's the same scene although the Romantics Anonymous scene is ever so much better. Subtle. Stronger acting. OK French.So two shy people meet and fall in love. They find it hard to make it work and in the end they know they are meant to be together. The other flaw is the ending. Running down the street leaving everyone in the church waiting for them? Not so much. Silly and not in a good way like Runaway Bride. Could it be that Ameris has a RobertsGrant thing? It's beneath these fabulous characters. Ameris should have ended at the moment when JeanRene opens the wardrobe to find her waiting and directed the two to head down the hallway to their wedding. Trust me on this and edit it for the DVD version.So load up on a few pieces of chocolate and download this fabulous film.".

While Clouseau was unaware of his own ridiculousness our JeanRene Van Den Hugde is painfully aware of his. That awareness is what makes him so compelling  and a stronger character than Clouseau. His innocent presentation of his Achilles heel shyness and his running away to regroup at every difficult moment is moving and so very well done. And yet he never gives up which makes us pause to consider our own ability to walk away when the going gets tough. Isabelle Carre JeanRene's Angelique is as pure as chocolate itself. She's humble wears a dimple next to her mouth that I have never seen the likes of on anyone before. A hopeful smile that you could practice in front of a mirror for years and never get right. The two together are magic.Ameris uses the camera in a way that follows his thought process that I haven't seen done before. For example when JeanRene is interviewing Angelique for a job the camera goes back and forth between the two over and over again even when they aren't speaking. It helps emphasize the discomfort between them the anxiety that silence causes for two people who are not ready for its intimacy. Back and forth back and forth. But instead of making our heads spin it simulates the characters' anxiety for us. Great technique. Others should try it. Works better than words.Lest you think my love is blind there are a few flaws. There is a scene that is reminiscent of Notting Hill. In Notting Hill Hugh Grant looks at his friends when he realizes he's made a mistake in rejecting Julia Roberts and they all pile into a small car and speed off to correct the error before it's too late. They are all a bit ridiculous but in a sweet way not a silly way. I thought it was a nice scene. Romantics Anonymous has the same moment. JeanRene is explaining to his Keystone Cop chocolate factory workers that he has walked from the chocolate maker extraordinaire and love of his life and they make the same plea as Hugh Grant's posse for him to get it right and hurry. They pile into a car too small for the group and head out to find her. It's the same scene although the Romantics Anonymous scene is ever so much better. Subtle. Stronger acting. OK French.So two shy people meet and fall in love. They find it hard to make it work and in the end they know they are meant to be together. The other flaw is the ending. Running down the street leaving everyone in the church waiting for them? Not so much. Silly and not in a good way like Runaway Bride. Could it be that Ameris has a RobertsGrant thing? It's beneath these fabulous characters. Ameris should have ended at the moment when JeanRene opens the wardrobe to find her waiting and directed the two to head down the hallway to their wedding. Trust me on this and edit it for the DVD version.So load up on a few pieces of chocolate and download this fabulous film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Romantics Anonymous Les Emotifs anonymes 2010 French with subtitles.A beautifully refreshingly sensitive film that charts the lives of Angelique a chocolatier extraordinaire and JeanRen the almost bankrupt chocolate company owner. Sounds like a match made in heaven... except these two emotionally compromised people are almost completely unable to express themselves.. Fortunately fate is one of the main ingredients that whisks these two together in this slightly dark comic film. We follow Angelique as she surfaces from being a hermit on her quest for a new job and after a short mumbling interview with JeanRen. The ever fainting Angelique sets off with passion in her heart chocolate in her briefcase and a chant of 'sell chocolate' in her ears. But this is not to be the chocolate is not up to par and Angelique tries to pull out secretly a recipe for alchemy in order to try to save the company. Meanwhile JeanRen constantly swings on a emotional pendulum between the equator and the north pole in 0.5 seconds over Angelique... not forgetting the underlying threat of losing his company. However it would seem that a recipe for disaster has been finally been put in the oven to bake when the two are unwittingly booked into the same room in at a hotel for the all important make or break Chocolate Exhibition. The close up and medium close ups of the flowing cinematography captures the central pivot of the surrounding panic and slight claustrophobia that constantly embraces the characters as they battle with shyness and the consequences of their actions to be together and the panic seizures that push them to the extremes they go  to avoid each other. The film is based loosely on the autobiographical journey of the Director JeanPierre Amris when in 2002 he joined a group ' Emotions Anonymous in 2002 a discussion group based on the same principles as Alcoholics Anonymous.' Romantics Anonymous..is a lovely film..in which two people shy away..from love....well at lest until their passion for chocolate over whelms them.".

The nuances of chocolate and their relationship to human behavior have been well analyzed in all types of film even CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. Nonetheless JeanPierre Amris' film is a charming comedy set in a provincial French town in which Anglique Delange Isabelle Carr a genius at chocolate making who passes herself off as a sales executive and her boss the gloriously named JeanRen van den Hudge Benoit Poelvoorde repeatedly convince themselves that they are not in love with one another while behaving in precisely the opposite way. The problem is that both of them have a chronic lack of selfconfidence. The film offers them several opportunities to get together but eventually stages the denouement during the meeting of a selfhelp group called Romantics Anonymous hence the title. Several of these sequences are cleverly filmed  for example the night when both of them are thrown together in the same hotel room during a chocolatetasting convention. JeanRen tries every trick in the book to leave the room having plucked up the courage to tell Anglique his feelings he finds that she has run away. The main actors offer winsome central performances and the props also help define their natures. Anglique's long woolly scarf so Seventies in style more than aptly sums her up.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being said it's a romantic comedy there actually can't be any doubt about the outcome of the movie. Especially not if the movie is as oldfashioned as Les motifs anonymes. The viewer knows every part of the storyline right from the beginning but i guess that's why some people love these kinds of movies. Les motifs anonymes is very warmhearted and light the script doesn't dismiss its characters though it also doesn't take them too serious. In opposition to another reviewer I think there actually isn't any emotional depth but that wouldn't matter too much if only the jokes were working. For a comedy Les motifs anonymes provides too weak comical elements. The jokes are neither subtle nor hilarious at the utmost they make you smile. At some points Les motifs anonymes almost collapses due to absolutely unnecessary and ridiculous musical scenes. The cast is what really carries the movie. Everybody in the cast is acting at least solid and the main actors deliver excellent performances above all lovely and wonderful Isabelle Carr. Altogether in case you're not into old school romcoms this movie isn't worth a recommendation. It's not that bad but it's possibly the most oldfashioned movie this season. Imagine a remake of Chocolat but deduct the poetic fairytale references from it and replace Binoche and Depp with two at some point annoyingly shy characters. So some viewers may and I'm sure will say that Les motifs anonymes is a nice and cute piece of storytelling. Those people are right but at the same time it is a very predictable tame and boring piece of kitsch. Last but not least be forewarned this movie clearly tries to appeal to an elder and mostly feminine audience.".

Overall the script is a masterpiece of understatement and an example of artful writing paired with precise performances. A lot of the point is actually conveyed between the lines in what isn't said which is a brilliant approach for a film about people who are too shy to speak. Given the above one might wish they'd paid better attention to the translation. Time and again important nuances in the French lines are lost in the English subtitles often for reasons that are hard to fathom. I've worked as a translator and know how heartbreaking some choices can be but most of the outofsync stuff in Romantics Anonymous is easily expressed in English.Just two examples In a significant scene a character is told You're going to have to touch someone. This was translated as Touch someone. Another time a character is uncharacteristically outgoing and another one says You're not sick are you? But at the bottom of the screen it says Are you feeling alright? Not only does this mess with the theme of the film  that these people live in fear of misfortune  it also flattens a much funnier joke. Similar humbugs rain down in Romantics Anonymous. I don't know why the studio's translator made these choices but given the tonedeaf nature of the work I'd bet he or she was simply handed a list of lines to translate and not shown the film itself. As a final indignity there's the unforgivable use of a subtitling machine that deals with diacriticals by dropping the accented character entirely. In a French film!! Therefore not only does the expression crme de la crme appear as crme de la crme but the male lead's own name  JeanRen  is consistently written JeanRen throughout the movie. Shameful treatment for a film that deserves better. If you speak any French even just a bit try to understand as much of the dialogue as you can while you read the subtitles a lot of easilyunderstood genius is lost in the clunky translation.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can relate to being very shy and not wanting to focus any attention on myself. OK  so I was 12 not 35. If I had hiccups or sneezed the LAST thing I would do is open my mouth as wide as possible to make for the grandest attention getting sound. Well this is just one of many minor issues that culminated in a large deficit of a sensible plot.I give major kudos to the script and scenes involving the appreciation of chocolate. I rarely eat chocolate but while traveling in Belgium I ate 2kilos straight up it was that incredible. Hence I imagine we are not having access in the States to a delectable treat with many fine layers. C'est Dommage! I was confused with the English translation captions. For example how does 'Romantic' translate to 'Overly Emotional'? There were many idiomatic phrases eliminated that would have provided an appreciation of unique and refreshing french expressions. The greatly anticipated Secret Chef reveal was about as interesting as watching paint dry. I can't conceive of a Skype call presented in this manner without any initial skepticism. What happened to the Teacher identifying a face he never forgets?? The portrayal of phobias anxiety and severe shyness in adulthood is a serious concern and should be treated with respect. I only found this film to incite crass humor even using a support group to extend the joke. It should not have been the crux of every attempt at humor.The two leads were initially endearing but I grew weary of their continual breakdowns and farcical interactions. The ending provided a beautiful setting but far from a satisfying conclusion.Will recommend for appreciating the fine intricacies of the french language and deep love of chocolate confections. Yumm!!".

Most of the problem with it was the atrocious writing and I ended my article suggesting you try another filmANY other film. Well I just saw a wonderful romantic comedyone that I heartily endorse and hope you see with someone you love. This is THE film to see instead. Sadly however because it's a French language film many folks won't even consider it.The film is about two amazingly shy peopleso shy that she faints when she is nervous and he tends to run away when he gets a case of the nerves! How the two finally get together is what makes this an ultracharming and delightful film.It begins with Anglique Isabelle Carr  going on job interview to become a chocolatier. What she doesn't know is that the man interviewing her JeanRen Benot Poelvoorde is also incredibly shy. She's so shy that she doesn't even tell him that she wants to make chocolates and he's so shy that he doesn't even tell her she's been hired! Eventually she somehow figures out she's been hired but reluctantly goes out to sell his subpar chocolates because he thinks she wants to be a salesperson. But chocolate shops don't want his candies and unless something happens she realizes that the company is bound to go bankrupt. What you then learn is that she is a worldclass chocolatierbut is so shy that she cannot bring herself to tell anyone that she is the 'mysterious hermit' who has previously gained nationwide fame for the chocolates. How can she manage to help JeanRen without revealing who she really is? And more importantly how can the pair ever get together romantically considering they are absolutely hopeless with the opposite sex? So why did I like this film so much? Well the characters are so cute and adorable you can't help but care about them and love them. This means that the actors director JeanPierre Amris and writer JeanPierre Amris also cowrote the film did a fabulous job in this film. Additionally the film is so totally unique and so amazingly clever that you cannot help but enjoy. Try this filmI pretty much guarantee that if you watch it you will enjoy it. And if you have Netflix it's now available. Or since it's such a great film you might just want to buy this film from Amazon for less than 14a real bargain!".

Eventually all these tales converge when Trumpy a lovable fuzzy alien with an odd shaped head and phallic snout hatches out of one the aforementioned strange eggs.Tommy takes in Trumpy and teaches him the joys of jigsaw puzzles and eating peanuts which Trumpy sucks through his snout which should be charming but is ultimately a creepy image. Unfortunately another alien who looks exactly like Trumpy is on a killing spree and a case of mistaken identity could land Trumpy on the business end of alcoholic Uncle Joe's shotgun!This is a pleasantly dumb movie full of dumb characters and dumber dialog Oh yeah?

Trumpy is cool especially when he does magic things like stand on the ceiling make Tommy's laundry fly through the air and turn an old Simon game into a slammin' beat box Mix Master Trumpy's jams would later be pilfered by Moby The Beastie Boys and others.

	schema:reviewBody "While I don't agree with those reviewers who claim that Pod People is the worst movie of all time  these viewers have obviously never seen Teenagers Battle The Thing  it is indeed a very painful viewing experience. It's got braindead characters uttering highly contrived and unlikely dialog and acting with the finesse of sock puppets. It's also got an English dub created with a tin ear and ESL voice actors reading their lines from cue cards for the first time. It's got fuzzy washed out sepia tinted photography that resists any attempt by the viewers' eyes to pull pleasure and satisfaction out of the film stock. It's possible I just saw a bad print of the movie but even so. It's got a highly derivative plot that is derivative in all the wrong ways  what's the point of ripping off E.T. if all you do with it is create a spam in the cabin type horror movie??It also gets off to a rousing start by subjecting us to a full length performance of the worst version of an 80's pop song ever heard by human ears. Seriously as if the movie didn't have enough problems with pacing and atmosphere and dialog and characterization it also alienates us by subjecting us to a supposed studio session where the pop star sings a would be song about driving a car with some of the most maladroit lyrics you will ever hear. FYI Mr. Pop Star you don't want feel the wind in your EYES you want feel it in your hair or your face. If you feel it in your EYES you are effectively blinded and will soon crash your car. The character comes off as an abrasive selfimportant jerk and his cronies and cohorts seem to have been drained of all intelligence humor selfawareness or even basic motor functions. I have to say that I liked the little boy. In spite of the highpitched feminine voice they dubbed over his part he seemed genuinely alive with the enthusiasm and magic of childhood which is a miracle given the situations he was probably working in. The cast and crew probably loved him to death and he was probably as the only person in the film who wasn't aware that he was sinking into a pile of suck. The kid's performance even buried under a painfully affected dub adds a star to the rating.Also of interest is a synthesizerheavy soundtrack with very New Age music elements that both adds to and takes from the movie's watchability. It's got some nice hypnotic drone and trance elements but there is far too much of it and it's mixed waaaay too loud at times. It adds another star to the ratings. Well half a star but it would have been a full star if the composer had cut it in about half and turned the volume dial down to 10. As far the rest...I'm pretty sure the director just pointed the camera at the actors and let them roll. It doesn't look like a film with very many second takes or screenplay rewrites and the poor actors who come off as European community theater players at best are left to struggle with the script as best they can. And as I mentioned the horrible English dub robs their performances of even the limited nuance and dignity they may have contributed to the film in the first place. Boy what a painful film. I recommend saving it for times when you feel bad about yourself and your career and prospects. Watching Pod People for even a few minutes will put things in perspective I may have made some dumb mistakes you can tell yourself but at least I never had anything to to with 'Pod People!'".

It's also got an English dub created with a tin ear and ESL voice actors reading their lines from cue cards for the first time. It's got fuzzy washed out sepia tinted photography that resists any attempt by the viewers' eyes to pull pleasure and satisfaction out of the film stock. It's possible I just saw a bad print of the movie but even so. It's got a highly derivative plot that is derivative in all the wrong ways  what's the point of ripping off E.T. if all you do with it is create a spam in the cabin type horror movie??It also gets off to a rousing start by subjecting us to a full length performance of the worst version of an 80's pop song ever heard by human ears. Seriously as if the movie didn't have enough problems with pacing and atmosphere and dialog and characterization it also alienates us by subjecting us to a supposed studio session where the pop star sings a would be song about driving a car with some of the most maladroit lyrics you will ever hear. FYI Mr. Pop Star you don't want feel the wind in your EYES you want feel it in your hair or your face. If you feel it in your EYES you are effectively blinded and will soon crash your car. The character comes off as an abrasive selfimportant jerk and his cronies and cohorts seem to have been drained of all intelligence humor selfawareness or even basic motor functions. I have to say that I liked the little boy. In spite of the highpitched feminine voice they dubbed over his part he seemed genuinely alive with the enthusiasm and magic of childhood which is a miracle given the situations he was probably working in. The cast and crew probably loved him to death and he was probably as the only person in the film who wasn't aware that he was sinking into a pile of suck. The kid's performance even buried under a painfully affected dub adds a star to the rating.Also of interest is a synthesizerheavy soundtrack with very New Age music elements that both adds to and takes from the movie's watchability. It's got some nice hypnotic drone and trance elements but there is far too much of it and it's mixed waaaay too loud at times. It adds another star to the ratings. Well half a star but it would have been a full star if the composer had cut it in about half and turned the volume dial down to 10. As far the rest...I'm pretty sure the director just pointed the camera at the actors and let them roll. It doesn't look like a film with very many second takes or screenplay rewrites and the poor actors who come off as European community theater players at best are left to struggle with the script as best they can. And as I mentioned the horrible English dub robs their performances of even the limited nuance and dignity they may have contributed to the film in the first place. Boy what a painful film. I recommend saving it for times when you feel bad about yourself and your career and prospects. Watching Pod People for even a few minutes will put things in perspective I may have made some dumb mistakes you can tell yourself but at least I never had anything to to with 'Pod People!'";

Such is the case with this infamous Mystery Science victim.Along those lines let me make clear what i think is decent if not good about Pod People. Despite jokes stating otherwise the plot is somewhat simple linear interwoven and predictable. However that mere fact alone makes this film higher quality than countless other MST movies. Furthermore there is an attempt despite it falling prey to the painful trap of stereotypes at character development admittedly a handful of the characters are irritating but even then they have their moments. The trollop character plays her part with genuine enthusiasm and serves to provide a shred of actual comic relief. Ultimately Pod People is a mediocre film. Its story is laughable in parts drawn out in others. However much of the scenery is intriguing if not outright beautiful and as a result the movie has an almost surreal atmosphere. It's as if Pod People has an intangible charm to it borne out of its clear vision mild ambition and occasional moments of decent filmmaking. All in all a watchable movie but probably just that....".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw this film on the cult television show Mystery Science Theater 3000. Suffice to say it is one of my favorite episodes of the show as it is a very bad film that is a complete mess and deserving of the riffs it receives. The film apparently was going to be yet another film that tried to copy the success of Alien by having people in the woods being terrorized by an alien. Then E.T. happened and thus a switch in gears and the alien was now friendly. Well not entirely there are two aliens present in the film one mean and the other friendly so they kind of do a mash up of both films and thus these film was born. I cannot say if the alien was going to look like it did in the final product initially when the film was being made though. The way it looks in this film I almost have to wonder if the people would would create the semi hit television show Alf saw this film as it does sort of resemble the alien from that show. The version I saw of this film was called Pod People and I am almost positive that the people who released it under the Pod People title are the same ones that did Cave Dwellers as they do the same thing with the credits having a totally different film run during the opening and ending credits. Here it is a film called Galaxy Invader and from the looks of it I am going to guess it is not much better than this one.The story has poachers in the woods and then a little boy in a cabin in the woods and then a singer in a studio and we get introduced to all the principal cast members thus making this one feel more like a horror at the beginning. A comet or meteor or something crashes and one of the poachers goes into a cave with huge eggs or pods and immediately begins bashing them! The mother returns and dispatches him and later the kid will find a surviving egg and hatch it and raise an alien of his own all while the mother goes on a kill spree. The film is a mess as it goes all over the place. The singer and his back up singers go camping with a fan of his who falls off a cliff and this leads them to the boy in the cabin's cabin where his mother and cranky uncle resides. Can they get help before all are killed will the boy get to play with his alien or will this film remain completely uneven? This made for a wonderful episode of MST3K in fact it is my favorite Joel hosted episode. I prefer Mike but Joel was on fire with this one as it played to his strengths. I never understood the people who claimed Manos was his best episode as to me that one was dull in a lot of places and this one was entertaining throughout. I actually own this film without the riffs on a collection of science fiction films and one day I may try to watch it and see how much was left out due to the show's time constraints however I do not see this one becoming vastly better. Unless there is some nudity or something...which brings up another point. What was the deal with the one girl that supposedly was not attractive. Sure she was the least attractive of the backup singers and the groupie but she was not exactly ugly either.So this film is a movie that wanted to be one thing and then became something else entirely. Kind of like a film from the 70's called The Dark. It started out being about a zombie roaming the streets of L.A but they turned it into an alien due to the success of the film Alien. This one was trying to copy Alien but due to the success of E.T it changed. Though the horror elements are still there as the mother alien knocks people off left and right while the boy tries to feed and hide his buddy alien. Strange how the friendly alien had all this magical abilities but the mother only seem gifted with on hell of a karate chop!".

	schema:headline " Spanish science fiction film middlingly directed by Juan Piquer Simn in which a little boy finds a lovable alien .";
	schema:reviewBody "Below average Alien movie in which an extraterrestrial from a distant galaxy befriends a little boy . It's a slight fun with absurd images  ingeniously cheap special effects  horrible musical score with awful songs  campy set decoration and regular art direction . It deals with a young boy Oscar Martin in the woods discovers a lovable alien egg to hatch . The creature called Trumpy  a mixture between Alf and an anteater arranges to use his snout to suck up peanuts and other articles . Unfortunately  his partner is found by some poachers Frank Braa and carrying out a killing spree . Meanwhile a rockin' rocknroll band Ian Sera  Susanna Becquer  Nina Ferrer  Emilio Linder are going on a camping trip . As this extraterrestrial being possesses mighty powers such as sensational strength  throwing objects and he manages to warp time and space with his fingers  all of them being recreated by means of traditional effects .This is a humdrum adaptation based on ET movie from a story and screenplay by the same director Juan Piquer Simon .Extraterrestrial visitors or The new extraterrestrials is an atmospheric  silly SciFi film with terror elements  an amusing monsters mixture  creaky at times but it's still acceptable . The film's original draft was meant to be a straightforward horror film about an evil alien on a murderous rampage but the producers demanded script alterations in order to cash in on the success of Steven Spielberg's E.T. the ExtraTerrestrial by featuring a child and cute lovable alien. The opening and ending credits for The Pod People are superimposed over blurred footage from an entirely unrelated movie in this case The Galaxy Invader 1985. Film displays passable set design  ridiculous screenplay with two cheesy monsters and average interpretations of all casting . This is a slightly entertaining Spanish science fiction movie though packs absurd situations and embarrassing frames . Originally intended as a lowbudget horror movie about an evil alien. After the success of E.T.  the producers  Dick Randall  Montoro and Piquer  made the alien into a lovable character and added a kid who befriends it. A widelycirculated rumor that script was submitted to Steven Spielberg as a sequel to E.T. is false . However  filmmaker Juan Piquer Simn was not satisfied with the final result . SpainFrance coproduction and originally filmed in French and Spanish  the actors learned both languages  it premiered in France before Spain. The new extraterrestrial is a light amusement as well as atmospheric movie that contains bemusing scenes when appear the monsters and take place their confrontation in some ridiculously made scenes  including primitive special effects . The picture has numerous older technique FX such as transparency  foggy sets  rubbersuited short man like alien  reversefootage  excessive makeup  all of them were made by Juan Piquer  Emilio Ruiz Del Rio and Basilio Cortijo . Juan Simn owned his own independent studio in Madrid Spain and designed many of his own special effects sequences for this film . It's a slight fun with professional makeup  naive special effects  evocative set decoration and functional art direction . You will watch it and think it is either awful  hilarious a masterpiece or all three . It's a simple entertainment with embarrassing images  naive special effects  campy production design and evocative setting . Although critics do not appreciate much this picture  however has a kind of loopy  Ed Wood quality that must be endured to be totally considered . The fable is sometimes silly and laughable  though a few Naif effects and action are professionally made . Some illogical parts in the argument are more than compensated for the excitement provided by the Aliens appearance though some scenes are a little bit cheesy . While not a hit during its original run the film became a limited success when reissued nearly 25 years later and deemed to be one of the best worst films of cinema history  being one of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 faves  even the fictional pop band's performance of Burning Rubber Tires was lampooned in a sketch on Mystery Science Theater 3000 .The motion picture was regularly directed by Juan Piquer . Juan  who goes by J.P. Simon on foreign releases  began in films as a writer and assistant director and continued his career by making short films and documentaries . Juan has produced and directed exploitation pictures for two decades running . He was a Spanish film director most well known for directing some cult classic horror films . He was one of the main directors of the Spanish horror boom in the 70s and 80s specially for his quartet of horror films as Escalofrio Slugs  Cthulhu Mansion and his greatest success and immensely popular Pieces  this is one among the many cult classic horror films that have recently been restored and digitally remastered . Juan owns his own studio and created andor designed many of the simple and primitive special effects sequences you see in any of his many imaginative undertakings . Piquer  who recently passed away was a good craftsman who realized a lot of amusing as well as entertaining films . Juan Piquer who was director of the Mostra of Valencia Spain  displayed a professional career and specialized on all kind of genres as Terror  Scifi The rift  Supersonic man and made some adaptations about Jules Verne novels Fabulous Journey to the Center of the Earth  Mystery on Monster Island . While his films have been universally panned by the prestigious reviewers they have a kind of quality that must be endured to be utterly appreciated .".

It's a slight fun with absurd images  ingeniously cheap special effects  horrible musical score with awful songs  campy set decoration and regular art direction . It deals with a young boy Oscar Martin in the woods discovers a lovable alien egg to hatch . The creature called Trumpy  a mixture between Alf and an anteater arranges to use his snout to suck up peanuts and other articles . Unfortunately  his partner is found by some poachers Frank Braa and carrying out a killing spree . Meanwhile a rockin' rocknroll band Ian Sera  Susanna Becquer  Nina Ferrer  Emilio Linder are going on a camping trip . As this extraterrestrial being possesses mighty powers such as sensational strength  throwing objects and he manages to warp time and space with his fingers  all of them being recreated by means of traditional effects .This is a humdrum adaptation based on ET movie from a story and screenplay by the same director Juan Piquer Simon .Extraterrestrial visitors or The new extraterrestrials is an atmospheric  silly SciFi film with terror elements  an amusing monsters mixture  creaky at times but it's still acceptable . The film's original draft was meant to be a straightforward horror film about an evil alien on a murderous rampage but the producers demanded script alterations in order to cash in on the success of Steven Spielberg's E.T. the ExtraTerrestrial by featuring a child and cute lovable alien. The opening and ending credits for The Pod People are superimposed over blurred footage from an entirely unrelated movie in this case The Galaxy Invader 1985. Film displays passable set design  ridiculous screenplay with two cheesy monsters and average interpretations of all casting . This is a slightly entertaining Spanish science fiction movie though packs absurd situations and embarrassing frames . Originally intended as a lowbudget horror movie about an evil alien. After the success of E.T.  the producers  Dick Randall  Montoro and Piquer  made the alien into a lovable character and added a kid who befriends it. A widelycirculated rumor that script was submitted to Steven Spielberg as a sequel to E.T. is false . However  filmmaker Juan Piquer Simn was not satisfied with the final result . SpainFrance coproduction and originally filmed in French and Spanish  the actors learned both languages  it premiered in France before Spain. The new extraterrestrial is a light amusement as well as atmospheric movie that contains bemusing scenes when appear the monsters and take place their confrontation in some ridiculously made scenes  including primitive special effects . The picture has numerous older technique FX such as transparency  foggy sets  rubbersuited short man like alien  reversefootage  excessive makeup  all of them were made by Juan Piquer  Emilio Ruiz Del Rio and Basilio Cortijo . Juan Simn owned his own independent studio in Madrid Spain and designed many of his own special effects sequences for this film . It's a slight fun with professional makeup  naive special effects  evocative set decoration and functional art direction . You will watch it and think it is either awful  hilarious a masterpiece or all three . It's a simple entertainment with embarrassing images  naive special effects  campy production design and evocative setting . Although critics do not appreciate much this picture  however has a kind of loopy  Ed Wood quality that must be endured to be totally considered . The fable is sometimes silly and laughable  though a few Naif effects and action are professionally made . Some illogical parts in the argument are more than compensated for the excitement provided by the Aliens appearance though some scenes are a little bit cheesy . While not a hit during its original run the film became a limited success when reissued nearly 25 years later and deemed to be one of the best worst films of cinema history  being one of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 faves  even the fictional pop band's performance of Burning Rubber Tires was lampooned in a sketch on Mystery Science Theater 3000 .The motion picture was regularly directed by Juan Piquer . Juan  who goes by J.P. Simon on foreign releases  began in films as a writer and assistant director and continued his career by making short films and documentaries . Juan has produced and directed exploitation pictures for two decades running . He was a Spanish film director most well known for directing some cult classic horror films . He was one of the main directors of the Spanish horror boom in the 70s and 80s specially for his quartet of horror films as Escalofrio Slugs  Cthulhu Mansion and his greatest success and immensely popular Pieces  this is one among the many cult classic horror films that have recently been restored and digitally remastered . Juan owns his own studio and created andor designed many of the simple and primitive special effects sequences you see in any of his many imaginative undertakings . Piquer  who recently passed away was a good craftsman who realized a lot of amusing as well as entertaining films . Juan Piquer who was director of the Mostra of Valencia Spain  displayed a professional career and specialized on all kind of genres as Terror  Scifi The rift  Supersonic man and made some adaptations about Jules Verne novels Fabulous Journey to the Center of the Earth  Mystery on Monster Island . While his films have been universally panned by the prestigious reviewers they have a kind of quality that must be endured to be utterly appreciated .";

It is the story of a group of bad musicians that take their job too seriously so they go the mountains.

One member of the group falls off a cliff and is promptly killed by her companions when they fold her in half and bring her back to the camper.

They meet up with a family of voice throwers that have a kid that has been trying to hatch an egg he found in a cave next to a dead guy. The thing hatches and starts drinking all the milk in the house. It looks like the head of a small elephant glued to a bear. Trumpy as the kid with endless imagination names it can do stupid things as Joel says in one of my all time favorite line like create stop motion animation and shake animal cages. Pretty soon Trumpy's dad goes on killing spree instead of asking for directions. It reminds me of my own dad. 'Nough said about that. I know it doesn't make sense. I believe that the director dropped some acid cranked the Pink Floyd and watched E.T. with a running tape recorder in his hand as he dictated the screenplay.

Now Juan Piquer Simon delves into the scifi genre this time and despite all the bad reviews on here i actually enjoyed this little film. Now it is a low budget bmovie! do not expect a Hollywood blockbuster here. If you like that kind of stuff great! it is bad bad dubbing and laughable at times but i really liked the beginning with the eerie atmosphere....really starts off like a horror film. it has a bad alien that kills people and a good alien...this is more like a kids movie at that point but only briefly as it always continues with the killer alien...So i liked the atmosphere throughout the whole film...not a bad chiller.

They're born out of eggs a ton of which are hurled to earth in a meteor. This is where the first of the stupid characters enters the moviea bunch of moronic poachers out stealing eggs from a tree. One of theses doofuses a guy who looks like Rick Moranis's character from Strange Brew finds the eggs and starts destroying them for some reason. One of the aliens whacks him and the movie is off and running! Sort of. Because then the socalled 'plot' switches to a bunch of pop singers cutting the worst album ever with a song whose lyrics are totally incomprehensible. Understanding the words isn't helped by VERY poor dubbingby the same dubbing team that did the voices for Devil Fish. Jump immediately from that to a cabin in woods so perpetually fog shrouded that they make London look like a place where the skies are always sunny and clear in comparison. Here lives an annoying little red headed tyke his mother and his grouchy weird uncle. The kid likes to collect 'specimens'man i sure hope he meant bugs!. While on a specimen hunting trip he finds the last uncrushed egg and hatches it in his room. Cut back to movie A where the poachers are still drifting through the forest then to movie B where the pop group has migrated into the mountains to wander through the fog then back to the kid and his 'bringing up alien'. Then my favorite part of the movie beginswhere the boy's kitten attacks the alien's stupid trunk and hangs on for dear life while Crow begins to talk in a strange British accent and ramble on about 'potatoes'. That is perhaps one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen in an MST3K bar none. There is something about that voice and the monologue that just has me in stitches every time I watch it. After that one of the aliens goes around killing a bunch of peoplebut not enough since not all of the characters died...especially that kid!and the boy abandons his own personal alien Trumpy in the woods.

The other classic scene has to be Trumpy's magical manipulation of the objects in the annoying little child's room set to wacky music while the alien's eyes glow like demonic diamonds. And what was up with the cast of about 100 characters? There were so many different plots most of which never even came close to merging I literally had no idea where the film was going. Thankfully Joel and the 'bots point out this big flaw along with the many scenes of characters shouting out one another's names. Character Shane? Shane??? Shane! JoelBots Fox? John Boy?

The plot has been explained many times in other reviews so I'll focus on reviewing the main character a good alien named Trumpy who does resemble ALF as stated by many other fellow reviewers on this film. Trumpy has magic powers that help him befriend a boy who lives in a cabin. These powers are nothing more that cheap special effects that are less like magic things as said by the boy and more like stupid things as said by Joel.  There's also another alien an evil one who looks just like Trumpy whose reeking havoc around the forest where the cabin is located. But both of these creatures are just downright creepy looking which raises the question how could this boy not be frightened by this scary looking alien. Well anyway this is a stupid movie though the MST version is quite funny.".

The plot has been explained many times in other reviews so I'll focus on reviewing the main character a good alien named Trumpy who does resemble ALF as stated by many other fellow reviewers on this film. Trumpy has magic powers that help him befriend a boy who lives in a cabin. These powers are nothing more that cheap special effects that are less like magic things as said by the boy and more like stupid things as said by Joel.  There's also another alien an evil one who looks just like Trumpy whose reeking havoc around the forest where the cabin is located. But both of these creatures are just downright creepy looking which raises the question how could this boy not be frightened by this scary looking alien. Well anyway this is a stupid movie though the MST version is quite funny.";

	schema:reviewBody "To quote a rather unsympathetic character from this film It STINKS!.So this is the infamous Return of E.T.. Well would you look at that! Nothing's happening! No Henry Thomas here. That's because this movie has NOTHING TO DO WITH E.T.! Instead it's a rather ludicrous ripoff completely incomprehensible and oddly enough spoken in about two languages.This movie ran in South America with Portuguese subtitles so nobody even bothered  dubbing the whole thing into English. This means we get a smorgasbord checkered soundtrack where they'll say something in Spanish and get replied to in English. Maybe other viewers will be luckier. Anyway following in the success of E.T. is this fogladen ripoff. I've never seen so much fog is a movie. Even John Carpenter's The Fog had less fog than this. I suspect it was a long workaround the fact that the E.T. was terrible makeup and costume. A static Aardvark mask EXACTLY like the one you could buy some 15 years ago in Spain but slightly altered and a child sized gorilla suit make up Trumpy and his race. The inspiration was most likely the alien from The Far Out Space Nuts. Watching this movie is extremely painful. For one thing it looks like some 10 different movies mixed into one. The movies starts with something approaching a bad matte painting of Earth accompanied by what sounds like a Casio score. Get used to these 3 chords. You'll hear them over and over for the duration of the movie. Then we cut to three hunters lost in the fog. They are looking for bird eggs. Okay. That's one movie. But why are they carrying guns to look for bird eggs? We get an answer to this in movie 2 when the same people are watching park rangers drive into a fog. Once the rangers go away the hunters get ready to hunt deer in the fog.Cutaway to movie 3. A bunch of obnoxious 30 yearold teenagers are recording a pop tune in a recording studio. We're supposed to care about them? Ok. We'll try very hard. They stay in the studio for about 10 minutes. Joke of note a guy wearing a tee shirt that says I'm a virgin. Fortunately movie3 doesn't last long and we jump to movie4. The characters of movie3 are boarding a camper. It seems they've decided to drive to the country for the weekend once they're done recording their completely puzzling song.Back to movie 2 the hunters run into this cave full of alien eggs and one of them decides to gleefully break all the eggs He gets attacked. Yay. Looks like finally something's gonna happen. But that doesn't last long and now the teens are driving into the fog. I don't want to continue writing about this plot for much longer so here's what happens. This kid whose mom doesn't seem to care much about him has several animals in his bedroom. I'll bet IT STINKS. So what's one more? Well he finds an egg in the fog and hatches it himself. Out comes a miniature aardvark he immediately names Trumpy. Trumpy starts out like one of those drinking birds toys but soon he's Phil Fondacaro in a monster suit. He has psychic powers and shows them to the kid by reenacting the Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down scene from Mary Poppins the Disney version not the better Russian version.Meanwhile momma Trumpy is out in the fog killing everyone. But not soon enough. The producers rented a fog machine and by golly they're gonna use it!This movie is only good if you're in a mood to joke about a bad movie. I can watch Troll 2 several times but I can't watch this several times because it's really really really slow paced. Troll 2 might be BAD but The Return of E.T. is pure evil!!Directed by the hopelessly untalented Juan Piquer Simon of The Rift Slugs and Cthulhu Mansion this movie proves that every country has its Ed Wood jr. I got from the credits that this was a CanadaSpain coproduction. This would explain how they got away with calling this The Return of E.T.At least they didn't call it The Return of ALF who resembles Trumpy a lot more.".

	schema:reviewBody "Les deux timides or Two Shy Ones was Rene Clair's last featurelength silent film. It was made in between of The Italian Straw Hat 1928 and Under the Roofs of Paris 1930. That is to say in between of Clair's two silent and sound masterpieces. Due to this Les deux timides has been left into oblivion. Surely the film doesn't have the wittiness of The Italian Straw Hat nor the avantgardist experimentalism of Entr'acte 1924 but what lifts it above many other silent comedies is its charming wit and playful attitude when it comes to the use of cinematic techniques. To my mind it is a cheerful satire whose mockery hits marriage the bourgeoisie and the judicial system.At its heart the film is a love triangle between two shy ones and a girl. It tells the story of an awkward lawyer who unintentionally gets his own client behind bars. But after three months or so these two meet again. For the lawyer has fallen in love with a girl whose father is marrying her with the man who was the lawyer's client. The man threatens the young lawyer to leave the girl. Several misunderstandings take place but in the end love wins over  as it very often does for Clair.The film was made right before the breakthrough of synchronized sound and therefore is characterized by many references to the use of sound such as the ear plugs of the maid. However the most brilliant example of using images to express sound can be found from the two courtroom scenes First the words of the lawyer turn into images when he tries to shape his violent client into a decent husband  an insightful realization regarding the falsehood of the facade of bourgeois love. This seems to be connected to the fact how in social comedy images are more ironic than words. In the later scene both parties present untruthful and opposite testimonies which turn into a travesty of the society.The way I see it Clair wants to highlight how in bourgeois life nothing is certain or what they first seem to be how there is no sense in anything. Their entire reality is reigned by different kind of misunderstandings and vacant rules of behavior. It is this from which Rene Clair always took his material  impressionistic description of everyday life characterized by Dadaist ideology. Furthermore one can clearly note the trade marks of his style in Les deux timides the melancholy and nostalgic Parisian milieus movement in the zone between dream and reality ironic satire combined with moral study.It is characterized by lively and poetic visuals typically for Clair but also by the perfect control of cinematic technique the innovative use of splitscreen effects and cross image both of which have regularly been associated with the films by Abel Gance. But above all it is its tender comics and sentimentality that seem to appeal to people. Les deux timides is indeed a very charming film but its entirety feels a little clumsy. Nonetheless this shouldn't let one skip the film for it is an astonishing accomplishment made during the heyday of the silents.".

He convinces her to take a chance on acting and her first film is a huge hit. PR man Oscar Muldoon remembers when Maria was in court supporting her father who was accused of murdering her mother. It was Maria's testimony that got him off and she was a bigger star than ever. Alberto Bravano one of the richest men in South America sets his sights on Maria and she goes off with him  as much to make Edwards angry as anything  but he treats her badly. When she meets Count Vincenzo TorlatoFavrini they fall deeply in love. They are married but theirs is not to be a happy life.";

It all still could had worked out had the characters been better ones.You can't really blame the actors for not letting the characters work out well enough for the movie. I mean when you have actors like Humphrey Bogart Ava Gardner and Edmond O'Brien involved you can hardly blame the acting can you?The movie is just too much talking and not enough drama or romance involved. I didn't very much liked watching this movie and didn't feel involved with it enough but nevertheless I also couldn't hate it.

And what you've got you used to have. although the scenes of the patheticglamorous European jet set are also excellent the way Mankiewicz can create a small line or gesture that delineates an entire character. Really the only time his touch fails him is toward the end when Maria meets her Count and things get a bit melodramatic.Also magnificent is the cinematography by the alwaysbrilliant Jack Cardiff who invests everything with colordrenched glamour. Did you know that along with shooting such visual masterpieces as Black Narcissus The Red Shoes and Pandora and the Flying Dutchman Cardiff was also the cinematogrpaher on Rambo First Blood. Yikes. Edmond O'Brien won a welldeserved Academy Award for his portrayal of the sleazy PR man Oscar Muldoon managing to bring hints of depth and dimension to a character that could have easily been pure caricature. Another fine if brief supporting turn comes from Mari Aldon as Edwards' longsuffering mistress Myrna especially her I'm just a scared tramp exit line.Still what makes this film work is the presence and performance of Ava Gardner. See The Barefoot Contessa and you will understand why many have thought her to be the most beautiful woman ever to grace the screen. She is simply breathtaking. Ava's appearance alone is enough to give credibility to Maria Vargas' legendary magnetismand without that the whole film would fail as it's really just about three men standing around one woman's coffin wondering that made her tickbut it's her work as an actress that raises the character from beautiful blank to irresistible enigma. Even when her dialogue is a bit trite and soapopera she manages to make it believable by making shallowness appear to conceal depth if you get what I mean and even does a fine job with the accent. This was the film that earned her the tag the world's most beautiful animal but Ava Gardner was much more than that.".

Written and directed by Joseph Mankiewicz the story is supposedly based on Rita Hayworth who turned down the role. There are some similarities  the Spanish roots the dancing angle the studio head who desires her but doesn't get her a la Harry Cohn and the great sadness of her life. The famous story about Rita is that her first husband Edward Judson was nothing more than a pimp though he is the man who turned her into a movie star. He demanded that she have sex with Harry Cohn and Rita refused time and time again. Finally Judson made a date for himself and Rita to go on a boat trip with Cohn and Judson cancelled at the last minute leaving Rita alone with the studio head. She still didn't go to bed with him.The story begins at Maria's funeral and is told in flashback by the various men who were in her life. Most of the narration is provided by the Bogart character writerdirector Harry Dawes who had a unique relationship with Maria  he cared for her deeply and was always there to listen to her and advise her. Maria was a woman whose life was lived as a barefoot Cinderella looking for her prince. Harry has a sixth sense about things and when Maria is about to marry the man she believes to be her prince Count TorlatiFavrini Harry starts to worry. He knows that as is often pointed out in the film real life is much more erratic than a movie script.Edmund O'Brien gives a terrific Oscarwinning performance as a yes manpublicist who does all the talking for the studio head Kirk Edwards Warren Stevens. Bogart is excellent but he does not have a great role although he has top billing he doesn't even have the starring role. One suspects he's there for box office pull.The dialogue has been praised here  Mankiewicz was one of the great dialogue writers but I found some of the dialogue in this a little pretentious and the pace slow. It's an interesting story but for me it doesn't compare with All About Eve and Letter to Three Wives in script or in pace.The star of the film is Ava Gardner. For this writer Gardner and Hayworth were ultimate sex symbolmovie stars  gorgeous sexy exciting women. Around 32 here and living the wild life she always did Gardner is breathtaking to look at. After the beginning of the film she drops the Spanish accent but she more than makes up for that in presence. Like Lana Turner and Rita Hayworth she was one of those actresses whose appearance and private life often received more publicity than her actual acting  but Ava could act. There was always something uninhibited earthy sexy and inherently honest about her performances  and she was that way as a woman too. I highly recommend her autobiography to anyone who hasn't read it.To see this marvelous cast and especially to see them in something written and directed by a fine artist like Mankiewicz is worth it even if it's a little flawed. Nobody's perfect.".

The remainder of this overlong film then turns to pretentious soapopera building to a climax in which Maria and a boyfriend are in face of an impotent husband The film was populated by harsh selfindulgent and unsavory men who all came off secondbest to Bogart a cynical but comparatively likable characterThe plot had strong cinematic possibilities but the script by Joseph L. Mankiewicz who also directed had ambiguous passages overly ornate and ultimately tiresome".

The remainder of this overlong film then turns to pretentious soapopera building to a climax in which Maria and a boyfriend are in face of an impotent husband The film was populated by harsh selfindulgent and unsavory men who all came off secondbest to Bogart a cynical but comparatively likable characterThe plot had strong cinematic possibilities but the script by Joseph L. Mankiewicz who also directed had ambiguous passages overly ornate and ultimately tiresome";

Wondering why the most stunningly beautiful woman who ever lived had to throw herself at an old drunk a gay count and some random gypsy with a guitar.Was it the men she loved? Or the love she threw away? Was it the animal in her? Or the beast in the heart of every woman? The questions made no sense. The answers had no meaning. Life is like that. Life the opposite of death. Not the cereal or the magazine.Maria never had cereal for breakfast growing up. She crawled out of a Spanish sewer and instantly became a star. But a part of her still craved the stench of life. The passion. The forbidden filth.Perhaps the billionaires who pursued her weren't filthy enough. Or was it a different kind of filth? Some filth you can't find in a sewer. Only on the Riviera or in Hollywood. Maria was pure too pure for Hollywood. Except when the beast in her sent her running for the filth she once called home.

It's one of a brood of movies dating from about 1950 Sunset Boulevard The Bad and The Beautiful A Star Is Born Two Weeks in Another Town The Legend of Lylah Clare that shows Hollywood turning poisonously on itself.  But while Mankiewicz' similar lowdown on Broadway All About Eve transformed all the backstage bitchery and mordant cynicism into entertaining brittle artifice The Barefoot Contessa sinks into its own fetid swamp.  It reeks of private scores being settled of spiteful inside jokes. An unpleasant party of American filmmakers none of whom likes the others descends on a dive in Madrid to watch Maria Vargas Ava Gardner dance flamenco.  But the haughty peasant girl won't consort with patrons even with a filthyrich icepick of a producer Warren Stevens who sends first his toadying publicist Edmond O'Brien then a director in his employ Humphrey Bogart to fetch her.  Ultimately she relents journeys to Hollywood and becomes the toast of the town.  The possessive controlling Stevens pushes her too hard and she leaves him for an even wealthier South American playboy Marius Goring.  When he too pushes hard a proud Italian nobleman waits in the wings to make her his Contessa.The central portrait of Gardner descends from the protofeminist carnality of her compatriot Carmen as drawn by Prosper Merime and Georges Bizet. For various reasons her relationships with the four principal males in the story stay chaste she reserves her passion for flings with lusty men of the same soil in which she likes to dig her unshod toes.  The avuncular Bogart numbers among her platonic lovers wed as he is to doting Elizabeth Sellars who looks like Dorothy Kilgallen in her What'sMyLine couture.But as the 1950s never tired of telling us unbridled sexuality leads to death.  The movie opens at the Contessa's rainy funeral and returns there again and again  like a tolling bell.  That sets the lugubrious portentous tone  a splashy threnody.  But The Barefoot Contessa is closer in spirit to a pulpy potboiler with its moviecolony parties and casinos at Cannes and with characters suggesting Porfirio Rubirosa and the exiled Windsors.Mankiewicz a wildly uneven director misfires badly here with an overlong overblown melodrama that some ruthless nipping and tucking might have made more svelte.  He even repeats an entire scene shot from a different angle but to no rhetorical point.  The dialogue shows grease stains from all the midnight oil and what in All About Eve was overwrought and epigrammatic has become arch too cleverly coy.  Though Gardner took the title role the center of attention defaults to Bogart starting to look old and ill but still the best thing in the movie. O'Brien walked away with a supportingactor Oscar for his part though he lent much finer support in two better pictures The Killers and White Heat. Both Goring and Brazzi could benefit from subtitles.  Voiceovers disorientingly shift from character to character like a relay race.  The freshest element in the production is the camera work from Jack Cardiff who defied the garish Technicolor of the era to give The Barefoot Contessa a muted autumnal look.

He was great as always and Gardner was good but lacked oomph for someone supposedly able to set the world on fire.I think that was due mainly to the direction she wasn't allowed to sparkle quite the opposite she was prohibited from shining. The odd thing about the movie is how much of her action happened off screen. When Hollywood arrives in her village to see her dance we only see her hands clicking castanets. When she has a screen test which dazzles jaded directors and we don't see it. When she makes three movies we never see her on set or even get a hint of what she was like in the movies. When she rises to the top of the celebrity mountain with legions of adoring fans we don't see them or even understand why. In fact all she really does is mope around and wait for her demise.

This is by far the most negative one I have ever written.I also thoroughly appreciated the excellent commentary by John Holder on page 1 of hated it. I have seen 2400 films in my 64 years and this is one of the top 10 worse big budget socalled A level films I have ever seen.This is the second time Ava Gardner has appeared in a film where her husband or lover has somehow lost his penis or else lost its use. This was the problem in the Hemmingway classic novel The Sun Also Rises that was made into a film in 1958 when Jake Barnes played by Tyrone Power either had Mr. Johnson shot off in WWI or else had it so damaged that he could not use it. I did not understand what happened to Ava Gardner's husband Rossano Brazzi in The Barefoot Contessa. Was his penis shot off? Did he have PTSDshell shock in those days? Did it get damaged and cause him to become impotent? Was he gay? Was he a latent homosexual who found out that Ava could not satisfy him? Talk about a hard luck dame 1950s language. No writer has mentioned that Ava's character was an uneducated peasant woman who did not even have an elementary school education yet she spoke as if she were a college English professor. Talk about stilted language this takes the cake. The scene where Warren Stevens Kirk Edwards and Marcus Goring the rich playboy had their verbal confrontation was so silly that I spit up the burrito I was eating. They stood at opposite ends of the lavish mansion and in an excessively theatrical manner started hurling insults at each other. I expected them to challenge each other to a duel. Edmund O'Brien a fine actor seemed to have overloaded on caffeine or worse. Rossano Brazzi seemed stupefied as to what motivated his ridiculous character. Humphrey Bogart spent the 1950s attempting to stretch his roles. This was a stretch that Wilt Chamberlain in his prime could not reach. Ava Gardner was being portrayed as an innocent in the woods yet in 1950s style movie subtlety she was sleeping with her cousin her chauffeur the deck hand on her husband's yacht and the gypsy to whom she threw her gambling casino winnings. Joseph Mankiewitz won back to back double Academy Awards in 1949 and 1950 for writing and directing A Letter to Three Wives and All About Eve. He was a fine writer for almost 20 years before becoming a director. This was his Waterloo.".

Yet the contrasts and conflicts among the characters and the contrasts between them and their surroundings make for plenty of good material.

	schema:reviewBody "This film covers a lot of the same themes as Sunset Boulevard though in my opinion that film is more riveting than this one. It's hard to believe Bogart got top billing for this one since this film clearly revolves around Ava Gardner's Maria Vargas. In fact I think you could plug practically anyone worldweary and haggard into Bogart's role and the film wouldn't lose much. I guess they felt they needed his starpower to sell the movie. He just doesn't have much to do in this film. On the other hand Edmond O'Brien is truly memorable as the sweaty publicist. He deserved the Oscar he got for the role. Maria's relationship with Count Favrini seemed a bit rushed but not to the point that it is totally unbelieveable. Afterall Maria's whole life is supposed to be a fairy tale. I wish somehow they could've developed the role of Kirk Edwards. He came across as onedimensional. This film being so old there is no commentary to explain the purpose for this or whether it was by design at all. Despite my complaints I still enjoyed the film and appreciated its message 810.".

His Harry Dawes is not the hero of this tragedy  there is no hero just a heroine who loses all. Harry is her closest confidante and guide for he sees the talent that makes Maria Vargas Ava Gardner the great film star she becomes but he realizes that she is a very real and good person  but a terribly naive one for all that in a corrupt world. It is Harry's sad duty not only to help tell the audience the story but to watch one might say inevitably Maria destroy herself.Harry is one of the people that wealthy control freak Kirk Edwards Warren Stevens finds available because they are on beams end. Harry has had drinking problems and his career as a film director is in the toilet. Edwards has found Maria in the slums of Madrid and believes she has great potential. He wants Harry to direct her in a film test just to be sure. Harry has little choice and does the test  but he gets to know Maria and win her trust. And he finds a way to somehow do his work for Edwards but give Maria a fighting chance to not be under Edwards' iron glove control.We watch Maria's career progress with her honesty able to capture public approval when she runs to defend her father from a homicide charge. Later we see her successfully break with first Edwards and then his Latin American rival Alberto Bravano Marius Goring and then falling in love with the Count Vincenzo Torlato  Favrini Rossano Brazzi whom she marries in the belief he is her long awaited knight in shining armor. But the Count has a secret and in learning it and trying to overcome it Maria destroys all she achieved in four short years.All of Joseph Mankiewicz's films are literate  he is possibly the most verbally careful of all major film directors. Some by the way find that THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA may stray too far afield because of the dialog most of the film's narration is during a funeral. But he still gets some very effective scenes in. The confrontation between Edwards a humorless example of the Puritan work ethic and Bravano who for all his defects is honest about enjoying his money and position to appreciate living at a party is a great highpoint. So is such a minor moment as when a royal pretender to a throne makes a tragically accurate comparison between himself and Torlatto  Favrini. So stick to that dialog  it pays off.The film is also a romanaclef. Some of the characters are obviously clones of real people. Edwards the millionaire control freak is based on Howard Hughes especially with private contracts for performers like Jane Russell. Bravano has a lot of the Dominican Republic playboy Porfirio Ruberosa. The background of Maria Vargas is supposedly based on that of Rita Casino Rita Hayworth. I am sure that Harry Dawes is based on some directors that Mankiewicz knew of as was Edmond O'Brien's publicist and factotum Oscar Muldoon catch his scene on the telephone talking to Harry when the latter is in Hollywood and Oscar is in London or his final break with Edwards  the Party's Over  and realize this role not D.O.A. was the one that netted O'Brien his Oscar for best supporting actor. A fascinating study of the limits of movie fame and fortune in winning happiness.Final note Mankiewicz apparently could not avoid having a small joke at the expense of his audience. When we see Maria's first film the marquee has a poster that mentions the screenplay is by Lloyd Richards. Lloyd Richards Hugh Marlowe was the dramatist who wrote plays for Margo Channing and Eve Harrington in Mankiewicz's classic ALL ABOUT EVE!".

Gardener only had to look delicious for those who like their women overly thin and it often seemed as if she was taking her lines from a prompter. Bogart foolishly chain smoking is well cast but looks very unwell and perhaps not comfortable with some of his lines. He fares best of all the cast  even though surprisingly Edmond O'Brian took the acting Oscar for his overcooked portrayal as the soulless producers press assistant what were the Academy thinking? Jack Cardiff's location footage glistens but is rarely allowed to shine saddled with a turgid script that flounders ponderously under its somewhat melodramatic themes. How this painfully obvious treatment garnered so many Rotten Tomato raves is quite beyond belief. Many of the press reviews of the day were more onthemoney along with numerous IMDb users comments. Not the best representation of its day and coming in at 2hr 10mins way too long to maintain complete interest. Maybe OK for lovers of the stars or movies about Hollywood although I think The Big Knife may have summed much of it up with less gloss  more succinctly.".

	schema:reviewBody "An oddity for a decade prone to fairy tale type movies. After all the buildup is that of a fairy tale coming true for peasant girl Maria Gardner. In stages she's lifted from poverty first by a film director who gets her a screen test then from a successful test she becomes a successful star after which she blossoms into a popular super star. From those heights however she unwisely marries a rich man Goring who soon proves intolerably abusive. In a ballroom showdown she's happily rescued by a handsome Prince Charming Brazzi who spirits her to his European castle to be married. But there just as her Cinderella tale seems to be coming true she finds out her Prince's secret a word that unfortunately could not be used in 1954. So we're left to infer the problem and the movie's crux.Small wonder the story's told in a series of flashbacks from Maria's graveyard funeral. Thus interest is aroused from the start as to why a girl so young and wealthy could possibly be dead. On my view the movie's really a modern fairy tale turned into a tragedy. For example consider a recurring theme namely Maria's constant attachment to bare feet over shoes. That I take as an underlying desire for a naturalness stripped of the kind of social pretensions shoe styles can convey. Thus her struggle on this view is really between the stark reality of feet and the societal contrivance of shoes. Extrapolated a bit it can also convey the importance of foundations to a person's wellbeing. Perhaps that's why she seems reluctant to accept her fairy tale climb it goes against a deeper instinct. Be that as it may in view of the ending it's too bad she doesn't stick with instinct rather than temptation.All in all the indie production was a biggie of that year featuring two marquee stars a lavish production and Hollywood honcho Mankiewicz in charge. Unsurprisingly it all led to some Oscar gorounds. Never mind that Hollywood doesn't come off looking very good in the persons of tyrannical producer Stevens and sycophantic public relations man O'Brien. There's still enough gloss travelogues and closeups of the beauteous Gardner to keep us diverted. Happily Bogie gets his trademark role as a cynical observer while Gardner gets to show she's more than a pretty face along with O'Brien who bathes in fasttalking. Not much really happens besides character development. So credit director Mankiewicz for keeping things moving. Though dated the movie's worth catching up with that is if you can stand the taboo word impotence which the 1954 movie obviously couldn't.".

	schema:headline " I like it better than All About Eve myself";
	schema:reviewBody "A quietly moving film about the short life of a curiously indescribable woman Maria Vargas Ava Gardner and the men who knew her. Joseph L. Mankiewicz is probably most famous for his film All About Eve which he both wrote and directed as he did with The Barefoot Contessa. He structures Contessa much the same as he does Eve starting the film at the end of the story and then working backward through flashbacks. This time we begin at Maria's funeral and three men who are attending it narrate her strange and melancholy story. Humphrey Bogart is arguably the lead actor as he narrates the majority of the film probably about half. He plays Harry Dawes a washedup movie writerdirector who is carried along to Madrid by his producer Kirk Edwards Warren Stevens and his producer's assistant Oscar Edmond O'Brien who won a muchdeserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar Oscar is the second narrator. They go to Madrid to pursue Maria whose name has started to become famous in Europe. While Maria at first refuses Harry is able to convince her to come where others have failed. Where one might expect Mankiewicz to make The Barefoot Contessa about Hollywood what All About Eve was to Broadway the film has little to do with Hollywood. We do experience a couple of Hollywood parties but the film is more concerned with the world of the fabulously wealthy. Maria has grown up poor and rather wretched  she has many sad stories about her life during the Spanish Civil War  and she can hardly relate to anyone around her. Harry comes the closest he's more down to earth. Maria is such a fascinating character. We know a lot about her  but then again we know so little. The film never really does define or understand her but that is the point. Mankiewicz almost tops All About Eve with his dialogue here sometimes it's almost too good. The story and its structure work perfectly and Mankiewicz does not repeat his one mistake from All About Eve that is he doesn't shove our faces in the film's point. We're left to ponder which I think is going to make me remember this one a lot longer than I will All About Eve. 1010.".

It can and should be appreciated both in and outside of Scandanavia.The film highlights a significant event in Finnish history  that during WWII around 70000 Finnish children were sent to Sweden among other countries to be temporarily hosted as their real parents stayed in Finland to continue in the war. The story is made accessible and immediate by taking us through the experiences of one child  Eero Topi Majaniemi  who as a 9year old boy is dealing with language differences a desire to return home and a host family that can provide materially but maybe not in the nonmaterial ways that Eero really needs.That the film stays true to the viewpoints and desires of the child really makes this movie work. From the opening sequences the warring environment was clear. As the movie continued the sense of the unknown a certain amount of foreboding and the everpresent desire to connect with family was also subtly introduced to give a very full sense of the conflict within this child's mind. The soundtrack nicely complemented everything the movie was going for. This is a great total package with a movie that is assured concise and crafted from a very fine director. This film gets my recommendation. Moreover I'm very much looking forward to seeing the next film from this decidedly capable director!".

That was fresh for me.2. Great cinematography! Many beautiful shots of the Swedish countryside and other nicelyframed shots. One that impressed me was the shot of Eero sitting inside the concrete bunker with the sea and sky in the window next to his head. This movie is worth it just for the camera work.3. Great acting by all of the actors.4. Excellent storyplot that kept moving at a good pace.The one negative comment I would make is regarding Eero's young female peer. She tries to be his friend but he ignores her and their friendship is never developed so I wondered what was the use of her character since she had such a minor role. Maybe it ended up on the cutting room floor?All in all I highly recommend this movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "I liked this movie for several reasons 1. It differs from other similarlythemed movies by focusing on the one war child Eero and his relationship with the two mothers in his life. That was fresh for me.2. Great cinematography! Many beautiful shots of the Swedish countryside and other nicelyframed shots. One that impressed me was the shot of Eero sitting inside the concrete bunker with the sea and sky in the window next to his head. This movie is worth it just for the camera work.3. Great acting by all of the actors.4. Excellent storyplot that kept moving at a good pace.The one negative comment I would make is regarding Eero's young female peer. She tries to be his friend but he ignores her and their friendship is never developed so I wondered what was the use of her character since she had such a minor role. Maybe it ended up on the cutting room floor?All in all I highly recommend this movie.";

This movie however has yet overrode those movies by its subtle but yet delicately constructed interplay among father mother and the son. More so it touched so much upon young man's hope and tie with the mother. Just when you think that was the whole thing about the movie i.e. mother and son antiwar wakeup call the movie got brilliantly galvanized by the two women in how they dealt with themselves and the motherhood and what they wanted adding a potent twist to the narrative as well as gently tweaking the emotions of the audience.For such a long time there was no movies that was able to employ such a basic and simple setting but yet so able to capture the multifaceted humanities in such an embedded compiling way.Highly recommend this movie.".

I was happy that they brought with them the guy who scored the music soundtrack because the music was a perfect fit for this film. Topi Majaniemi as Eero is charming and Michael Nyqvist as Hjalmer Jnsson is excellent but Maria Lundqvist as Signe Jnsson is superb and really carries this film.

It is a very hearty film and especially at the beginning when the ruthlessness of the war begins to show its ugly head it contains downright heartbreaking material.On the other hand those parts where grownup Eero played by Esko Salminen converses about the past with his mother feel a bit too much like commentaries and they might have benefited from a little more liveliness. On the first viewing I thought also that Eero's relationship with the foster mother Signe Maria Lundqvist doesn't ever really open and warm up like the narration implies later. However on the second viewing I noticed that the scene in the graveyard is honestly trying to deal with this point. So that part of the theme is not completely left undeveloped.Michael Nyqvist as Hjalmar Jnsson does a pretty good job but one of the best virtues of the film is the fact that director Klaus Hr has been able to cultivate an extremely believable Eeroboy from young Topi Majaniemi. Praises also belong to the numerous incredibly beautiful scenes of which one of the finest is a shot where a bus comes from the left side of the panorama picture and continues its drive to a stop in the middle of desolation with Eero as its only passenger traveling towards his new home.In short Mother of Mine is a recommendable movie for everyone who considers himherself to be a friend of honest and straightforward drama.

	schema:headline " A Masterpiece On What It Really Means To Have Family";
	schema:reviewBody "Could you ever part with your child due to war? How would you maintain a sense of hope? Klaus Haro's film Mother Of Mine depicts an honest and heart wrenching portrayal of the separation of families in Finland during WWII when over 70000 children were evacuated to neighboring neutral Sweden. For one family young Eero played by Topi Majaniemi is separated from his mother Kirsti played by Marjaana Maijala soon after the death of his father and placed with a rural family in Sweden. The host couple Signe and Hjalmar played by Maria Lundqvist and Michael Nyqvist is unprepared for Eero as Signe was secretly hoping to host a young girl as their daughter drowned only two years before. As Eero misses his mother in Finland he bonds quickly with Hjalmar much to the immediate dismay of Signe. However when Eero's mother's situation in Finland suddenly changes Signe is asked to raise Eero as her own son prompting a heart rendering attachment that is too good to last.One of the key themes throughout the film is the fluidity and construction of family. Initially the audience witness Eero's family as three father mother and son. Quickly after the war enters Finland however Eero's father leaves to join the military and dies in combat. Eero's mother Kirsti heartbroken and distraught then has to abandon her only son and stay alone in Finland. Within the first 20 minutes of the film viewers watch Eero's family shatter into fragmented pieces. When Eero arrives in Sweden he is given a host mother and father who act as replacements for the parents he left back home. Eero bonds more quickly with Hjalmar as his father has passed and Hjalmar effectively takes on that fatherly role. Signe however remains distant as she mourns the loss of her child and in effect so does Eero as he still has a mother back in Finland. Over time Eero loses contact with his birth mother and begins to let Signe into his life and she ultimately does the same. Soon Eero interacts with Hjalmar and Signe as his parents and they treat him as their son. Family roles become fluid for both parties and the construction of family changes for each party as they need it to.Another unique theme to this film in particular is the dynamic role of language and with it communication. Mother Of Mine is an example of a film coproduction as both Finnish and Swedish languages are utilized. While this draws in a wider Nordic audience it creates an initial barrier between the characters as they cannot communicate with each other very effectively. Hjalmar is open to learning Finnish and attempts to memorize Finnish words in the government language book provided but Signe insists that since Eero is in Finland he must speak Finnish. By forcing Eero to learn Finnish Signe puts up a language barrier between the two of them so that she does not have to communicate with Eero as she still mourns the loss of her daughter. When she is ready to accept Eero into her life as her own child the language barrier between them is broken and she helps instead of criticizing him in his language skills.A final theme centers on the loss of loved ones most importantly family members. As stated previously Eero lost his father in the war and Signe and Hjalmar's daughter drowned. Both parties are hesitant to let someone new into those previously lost family roles but as their relationships develop all three experience what it means to love again. For Eero and Signe this motherson relationship becomes a permanent attachment despite some 60 years apart. Later in life Eero tells his birth mother Kirsti that she stopped being his mother as soon as he returned to Finland as Signe had taken over that role. It is only upon reflection many years later at Signe's funeral that Eero realizes his love for both his mothers despite his loss of each one of them at one point.Haro has created a masterpiece with Mother Of Mine and viewers will not be disappointed. Not only is the cinematography stunning but the soft musical tones and panoramic silences transport audiences back in time. Maria Lundqvist gives an incredible performance as Signe and I hope to see young Topi Majaniemi's face in many future Finnish films. Audiences worldwide will experience true emotion with this film and find connections with it that will tug at one's heartstrings. American cinema has a thing or two to learn from this work of art and I look forward to watching more Haro films in the future.".

	onyx:emotionText "Could you ever part with your child due to war? How would you maintain a sense of hope? Klaus Haro's film Mother Of Mine depicts an honest and heart wrenching portrayal of the separation of families in Finland during WWII when over 70000 children were evacuated to neighboring neutral Sweden. For one family young Eero played by Topi Majaniemi is separated from his mother Kirsti played by Marjaana Maijala soon after the death of his father and placed with a rural family in Sweden. The host couple Signe and Hjalmar played by Maria Lundqvist and Michael Nyqvist is unprepared for Eero as Signe was secretly hoping to host a young girl as their daughter drowned only two years before. As Eero misses his mother in Finland he bonds quickly with Hjalmar much to the immediate dismay of Signe. However when Eero's mother's situation in Finland suddenly changes Signe is asked to raise Eero as her own son prompting a heart rendering attachment that is too good to last.One of the key themes throughout the film is the fluidity and construction of family. Initially the audience witness Eero's family as three father mother and son. Quickly after the war enters Finland however Eero's father leaves to join the military and dies in combat. Eero's mother Kirsti heartbroken and distraught then has to abandon her only son and stay alone in Finland. Within the first 20 minutes of the film viewers watch Eero's family shatter into fragmented pieces. When Eero arrives in Sweden he is given a host mother and father who act as replacements for the parents he left back home. Eero bonds more quickly with Hjalmar as his father has passed and Hjalmar effectively takes on that fatherly role. Signe however remains distant as she mourns the loss of her child and in effect so does Eero as he still has a mother back in Finland. Over time Eero loses contact with his birth mother and begins to let Signe into his life and she ultimately does the same. Soon Eero interacts with Hjalmar and Signe as his parents and they treat him as their son. Family roles become fluid for both parties and the construction of family changes for each party as they need it to.Another unique theme to this film in particular is the dynamic role of language and with it communication. Mother Of Mine is an example of a film coproduction as both Finnish and Swedish languages are utilized. While this draws in a wider Nordic audience it creates an initial barrier between the characters as they cannot communicate with each other very effectively. Hjalmar is open to learning Finnish and attempts to memorize Finnish words in the government language book provided but Signe insists that since Eero is in Finland he must speak Finnish. By forcing Eero to learn Finnish Signe puts up a language barrier between the two of them so that she does not have to communicate with Eero as she still mourns the loss of her daughter. When she is ready to accept Eero into her life as her own child the language barrier between them is broken and she helps instead of criticizing him in his language skills.A final theme centers on the loss of loved ones most importantly family members. As stated previously Eero lost his father in the war and Signe and Hjalmar's daughter drowned. Both parties are hesitant to let someone new into those previously lost family roles but as their relationships develop all three experience what it means to love again. For Eero and Signe this motherson relationship becomes a permanent attachment despite some 60 years apart. Later in life Eero tells his birth mother Kirsti that she stopped being his mother as soon as he returned to Finland as Signe had taken over that role. It is only upon reflection many years later at Signe's funeral that Eero realizes his love for both his mothers despite his loss of each one of them at one point.Haro has created a masterpiece with Mother Of Mine and viewers will not be disappointed. Not only is the cinematography stunning but the soft musical tones and panoramic silences transport audiences back in time. Maria Lundqvist gives an incredible performance as Signe and I hope to see young Topi Majaniemi's face in many future Finnish films. Audiences worldwide will experience true emotion with this film and find connections with it that will tug at one's heartstrings. American cinema has a thing or two to learn from this work of art and I look forward to watching more Haro films in the future.";

	schema:reviewBody "Having only just finished watching this film I can say that I consider it to be the most emotionally authentic story I have viewed in a very long time. This is a truly beautiful film and I was not in any way distracted by having to follow the story by reading subtitles. All actors are to be commended for their performances but special mention must go to child actor Topi Majaniemi for an outstanding performance as Eero the child who is sent by his Finnish mother to Sweden for the remainder of the war. He is in almost every scene  a big ask for a child  and he never ever wavers I hope we see more of him in the future.As well as Majaniemi special mention also must go to Maria Lundqvist who played the child's troubled foster mother and also Michael Nyqvist who can do no wrong IMO as the kindly but often outofhisdepth foster father and the one to first befriend Eero in his foreign environment. All three actors give such realistic performances that I kept forgetting that I was watching a work of fiction albeit based upon true stories. I felt that I was being allowed into this private world of these people trying to find their way through a situation none of them asked for and so I had better be quiet and respectful.And this is beautiful to watch set chiefly in coastal rural Sweden complete with rolling green hills and whitewashed buildings. Cinematography and Direction of this film as so flawless as to be invisible the film just flows gently but is never ever boring.Just one piece of advice........have some tissues handy as it is an emotional journey but without any of the emotional manipulation found in many Englishspeaking movies.I give it 12 stars!".

	schema:reviewBody "ideist Parhain is a satisfying film that almost but not quite avoids the saccharine pitfalls that accompany mixing children war and melodrama. It focuses on an event that surprisingly has been untapped as the subject for a feature film the world's largest evacuation of children from a war zone. During World War II over 70000 Finnish children were taken away from their homes and families and were relocated to Sweden to be watched over by adoptive families for the duration of the war. The protagonist of ideist Parhain is a young boy named Eero who after his father is killed is sent away by his grief stricken mother for his own protection. His adoptive Swedish family proves enigmatic however as the father is welcoming and accommodating while his new mother Signe is mysteriously cold and aloof. The film is framed by an aging adult Eero confronting his birth mother and reconciling abandonment and identity issues that have plagued him as a result of his childhood experiences. The film though straightforward on surface subtextually deals with the importance of communication and the effects of war on children not to mention the beautiful photography that evocatively uses light that contrast emotion with landscape.The dramatic core of ideist Parhain lies in its character's struggles with both verbal and emotional communication. As a child unexpectedly transposed into a new country Eero's difficulties are compounded by his inability to speak Swedish at first he can only speak a single phrase consisting of his name and country of origin. The language barrier alienates Eero from his new Swedish family and neighbors enhancing his feelings of isolation and preventing him from forming strong emotional bonds. As a child in his formative years his identity is being shaped as that of an outsider the result of which can be seen in the frame story more on that later. This divide is naturally symbolized in the auxiliary language Eero eventually comes to speak Finlandssvenska. This hybrid dialogue between Swedish and Finnish speaks sorry to Eero as a child torn not only between two cultures but his two mothers as well. In this regard Topi Majaniemi as Eero gives a fantastic and naturalistic performance that perfectly captures the difficulties of a displaced and vulnerable child. Though Eero eventually picks up the language he still has trouble emotionally connecting and communicating with Signe who does everything in her power to shut him out.Initially Signe is peculiarly cold and distant when confronted with Eero. Beyond being unable to communicate with him he easily frustrates her and she goes out of her way to avoid dealing with him. This disaffection climaxes when she attempts to get Eero taken back by the rescue agency only to change her mind. None too subtle hints are dropped throughout the film as to a past tragedy which is eventually revealed to be the loss of her daughter at six years old. Not wanting to grow attached to and then lose another child the emotional distance she puts between her and Eero is exposed to be a selfish defense mechanism. When Signe is finally able to accept him the shift is too sudden to have much of an impact rendering much of the third act's dramaturgy less effectual than it is intended to be.The director Klaus Hr and his cinematographer Jarkko Laine use color and light to expressionistically convey character's inner states and the gamut of emotions they undergo. Early scene of Eero with his mother and father living happily together are filmed in the warm glow of a magic hour sunset which gives way to cold gray light after Eero's father dies highlighting their isolation and loneliness. Finland's gray forested landscape is replaced with the sunny bucolic hills of Sweden reflecting the safety and freedom that Sweden offers. However the interiors of the farmhouse Signe's domain are initially dark are cramped growing lighter only when she is able to accept Eero and move beyond her tragic past. Finally Eero's return to Finland is filmed during a sunsetrise aesthetically bookending the film and suggesting the premature end of Eero's childhood.In an unusual reversal the present day scenes of an adult Eero and his elderly mother are in black and white in contrast to the vibrant color of the events of his past suggesting that the proceedings being portrayed had a profoundly negative effect on his life. It's evident in these scenes that Eero has had a poor relationship with his mother who is stoically unsympathetic. His recounting of his childhood thus becomes a way for him to move on with his life and find closure with his mother. Though ideist Parhain does occasionally turn manipulative and cloying the stroke victim grandfather saying don't go stands out it is nevertheless a compelling exploration of the effects of war on children. It moves at a good pace has gorgeous expressionistic cinematography and is elevated further by a great cast who all turn in excellent performances. Most importantly the film conveys the message that war beyond the deaths tragically scars all involved.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this moving Swedish and Finnish coproduction director Klaus Hr uses a historical glimpse of the Nordic countries to examine aspects of the human condition. Hr addresses the nature of loss as well as the meaning of family. Mother of Mine is the tale of a young boy Eero Topi Majaniemi one of more than 70000 war children displaced from Finland in World War II and relocated in neutral Sweden. Following the death of Eero's father in the war Eero's mother Kirsti Marjaana Maijala is severely grief stricken and chooses to send Eero to live with a family in rural Sweden. Eero's foster parents Signe Maria Lundqvist and Hjalmar Michael Nyqvist expect to adopt a young girl and are thus surprised when he arrives. Hjalmar welcomes Eero warmly and is able to form a strong relationship with the boy. Signe however is unexpectedly cold and shorttempered to her new foster child. As Eero overcomes the difficulties of assimilating in this new environment the reason for Signe's bitterness is made clear and the relationship between Eero and his foster mother begins to grow.The nature of loss is addressed in a rather broad manner in Mother of Mine. Characters in this film experience both the loss of life and the temporary loss of connection to a loved one. The first significant instance of loss is the death of Eero's father. This has a devastating impact on Kirsti who is overwhelmed with severe depression. While the characters' reactions to this loss suggests Kirsti is most heavily affected the young Eero is stricken by the recurring element of broken promises which accompanies loss in this film. Eero's father promises that he will return soon and everything will be as it was which is shattered early in the film. Shortly after loss is experienced in another form as Kirsti sends her only child away to Sweden. During their farewells Kirsti echos her husband's promise to Eero saying they will be together soon and everything will be as it was. Eero recognizing the similarity to his father's promise is unwilling to blatantly accept and is faced with the loss of his only remaining family member. In Sweden Signe's past is plagued by the death of her six year old daughter. In addition to grief Signe's loss is accompanied by guilt for her lack of attentiveness that led to her daughter's drowning. Signe also experiences the loss of Eero a child she has come to know as her own. Eero is once again left with a broken promise Signe states Eero and her will never be separated. Hr presents loss and its impacts in a number of forms in Mother of Mine. In doing so Hr includes a Christian theme as an explanation for loss the Lord gives and the Lord takes away which Signe shares with Eero as she explains the reason for death and loss. This Christian perspective of loss is a rather distinct element of the film.A unique set of film techniques is used within Mother of Mine to contribute to the pathos and focus of the film. Music plays an integral role in Mother of Mine. Tones within the film are emphasized by the score which is often in a minor key. In addition a handful of slow motion scenes are used to heighten the intensity of critical scenes including the scene in which Eero is forced to leave Hjalmar and Signe in Sweden. The use of color in the portrayal of Eero's childhood and monochrome for the latter stages of Eero's life emphasizes the importance of the events of his childhood in relation to his adult life. Subtle techniques such as these contribute very heavily to the overall quality and effect of the film.Hr provides a very interesting examination of the nature of family in Mother of Mine. The film begins with a breakdown of a family unit following the death of Eero's father. Eero is separated from his mother and introduced into a new family in which he becomes a fundamental part of. As Eero's relationship with Signe grows his ties to Kirsti begin to unwind. The weakening relationship between Eero and his mother is a result of his perception of her actions Eero associates his mother's choice to send and keep him in Sweden with abandonment. It is only after many years that Eero realizes his mother's intentions reflect her love her son. Hr's use of this complex structure of relationships supports a broad definition of family that is not limited to blood ties even if those ties remain a part of one's life. That being said this film demonstrates the equal love for a son by two independent mothers and the difficulties in choosing what is best for him. Mother of Mine is powerful and emotional film that displays distinct elements of human nature in a factual and unique historical context. In this film Hr provides a Christian but universal perspective of loss and examines the love present in uncommon relationships. The result is a work of art that goes beyond the traditional bounds of cinema.".

The film begins with a breakdown of a family unit following the death of Eero's father. Eero is separated from his mother and introduced into a new family in which he becomes a fundamental part of. As Eero's relationship with Signe grows his ties to Kirsti begin to unwind. The weakening relationship between Eero and his mother is a result of his perception of her actions Eero associates his mother's choice to send and keep him in Sweden with abandonment. It is only after many years that Eero realizes his mother's intentions reflect her love her son. Hr's use of this complex structure of relationships supports a broad definition of family that is not limited to blood ties even if those ties remain a part of one's life. That being said this film demonstrates the equal love for a son by two independent mothers and the difficulties in choosing what is best for him. Mother of Mine is powerful and emotional film that displays distinct elements of human nature in a factual and unique historical context. In this film Hr provides a Christian but universal perspective of loss and examines the love present in uncommon relationships. The result is a work of art that goes beyond the traditional bounds of cinema.";

	schema:reviewBody "The film Mother of Mine was a very emotional film about a young boy named Eero who is forced to leave Finland and travel to Sweden where he lives with a foster family until the war was over. This film incorporated a common Nordic film theme of a love triangle however this time it was between two mothers and Eero. Personally I thought the director Klaus Haro did an amazing job of utilizing certain filming techniques in order to make some of the heartbreaking scenes feel much more dramatic. I also thought that the plot was excellent and kept the viewer guessing as to what Eero would have in store for him in every coming day.This movie takes place during World War II where thousands of Finnish children were evacuated from Finland to Sweden in attempt to avoid the bombing and raids. Kirsti and Eero have to deal with the unfortunate news of her husband and his father dying in battle which Kirsti does not cope with all too well. Kirsti then decides that after losing her husband that she could not deal with losing her son as well so she decides to send him off to a foster family in Finland. After finally arriving at his foster home in Sweden he is not accepted right away at all by Signe due to the fact that she was expecting a young girl. Throughout the movie we begin to see emotional connections being made between Eero and Hjalmar Signe's husband which leads to the eventual bonding between Signe and Eero as well. As the movie progresses Signe begins to accept Eero as one of her own and even refers to him as her child. This occurs right after Signe reveals to Eero that she had a 6 year old daughter who drowned to death two years prior to him coming to their house. As viewers we now watch a strong relationship develop between the Jonsson's and Eero which makes us become emotional as we anticipate a letter coming in the mail from Kirsti requesting the return of Eero back to Finland. In the end Eero is forced to leave the Jonsson's and travel back to Sweden and meet up with his mother which was very painful for Eero as he had developed a strong relationship with the Jonsson's. The final scene of the movie ends with Eero as an adult who visits the grave of Signe because he never had the guts to leave Kirsti again and see Signe of whom he loved so much.As a viewer I found this film to be very emotional and frustrating to watch because Eero never really had a chance to settle down and find his true family. Its one thing to have to leave your own country and travel to another of which you cant speak the language but to have to leave your mom behind or in this case your last family member would make the experience much more difficult. On top of that he then had to learn Swedish and cope with a foster mother who at the beginning of their relationship was extremely bitter and harsh towards him. Once he began to get to know the family he then had to try and fit in at school and learn how to help out at the farm all while receiving letters from his mother saying that it would be longer until he could come back. What made me cry is when he found out his mom left him for a German soldier which led him to become fully attached to the Jonsson family which ended up hurting him as he received a letter later on saying that his mom separated from the soldier and demanded he be sent back to Finland. Between the confusion and unsettledness of Eero we the viewers become very sad for Eero as we watched his heart being broken several times throughout the movie.As far as how the movie was shot I felt that the slow motion scenes when Eero originally leaves Kirsti and then again when he has to leave the Jonsson residence makes the viewer much more emotional as we realize that Eero is yet again being torn from loved ones. I really felt a part of the scene when Signe could not watch Eero be dragged into the car and then she chased him down the road. I thought the acting was phenomenal in that scene and I really began to feel for not only Eero but the Jonsson family as well. Another technique I noticed throughout the movie was the sharpness of the sound. I could here when the cast gulped and many other subtle noises throughout the movie could be heard crystal clear. This made me feel like I was actually watching the film live and helped me become much more attached to the characters as well.In conclusion I thought that the film was a 910 stars and I would without a doubt recommend it to anyone interested in watching a foreign film. As I mentioned before I thought the plot was very well thought out and made the viewers feel extremely connected to the characters of who all acted wonderfully throughout the entire film. All in all I would not mind watching this film for a second or third time in the future and am very happy that I had the opportunity to view it.".

The thin trunks of topless trees can't camouflage the old man in black whose convergence with the woman and the boy is halted by the next anxious moment. The bible should be a dead giveaway to this apprehensive encounter but the priest removes his hat before he gets any closer just so there's no confusion about the meaning of their meeting. Before long EeroTopi Majaniemi and his motherMarjaana Maijala are told by some grim women that they'll have to separate. And so it is the church's will that Eero finds himself on a crowded boat with other fatherless Finnish children en route to Sweden where he'll live with a Swedish family until the war is over.Aideista parhain is about the unexamined feelings between Eero and his mother Kirsti during the period of their severed existences in which both parties are forced to revisit when the former war child returns to Sweden for the funeral of his foster mother breaking the complicit silence they maintained throughout the intervening decades. Told in flashback this black and white film switches to color as if the past is more vivid to Eero than the present.By boat by train and then by bus the boy whose father was killed by Russians meets his new guardians on an unpaved road HjalmaMichael Nyqvist and SigneMaria Lundqvist Jonsson one of many Swedish couples who provided shelter and sustenance to over seventythousand Finnish children affected by the war. While the farmer seems accommodating enough Signe is hostile and sometimes downright odious towards Eero from the outset walking ahead of her husband and charge with a head full of steam back to their house on a farm. Since we recognize that Aideista parhain aspires to be an epic cut from the same cloth as American epics about life during wartime we're not fooled by Signe's distaste for the strange Finnish boy with his strange Finnish ways. Panorama after panorama of sumptuous Swedish scenery makes it clear that Aideista parhain is governed by the same parameters as a mainstream studio movie from Hollywood. Signe may shout or even hit Eero but she's not going to stab him with a kitchen knife nor will the boy like a boy from some Patrick McCabe adaptation. The movie's soundtrack is so sentimental so heavily laden with strings to overemphasize every moment of incident with its crescending bulge it takes away the possibility of the unexpected because Aideista parhain is essentially a European version of a prestige film meant to secure multiple Oscar nominations.But when Signe's moment of transformation arrives the emergence of the nurturing mother beneath that gruff exterior we predicted all along seems entirely arbitrary as is her epiphany about Eero's sudden lovability. In the last scene Signe chastises the boy for stealing money and running away. She calls social services to send the boy back home. But when the administrative woman suggests that Eero would be sent to a children's home Signe has a change of heart but the audience will be hardpressed to allocate that change of heart's origin. Thin air that's where she got it. His impending departure should be cause for celebration after her constant illmannered behavior towards the boy. There's not enough smoke and mirrormagic from the screenplay to obscure the paradigm.After Aideista parhain is through with casting Signe as the villain we learn that Eero's mother abandoned him in favor of a German soldier. The film would be riveting if we along with Eero had a harder time deciding between both mothers when it's time for his return to Finland. Aideista parhain decides for us. Of course we're more sympathetic towards Signe's claim after all his birth mother is f a soldier affiliated with the Nazi party. While Eero functions as a replacement for Signe's dead little girlwho drowned under her care the mother uses her son as a preventive measure against a heartbreak of the romantic sortor so it seems.Aideista Parhain gets even more manipulative after the old man learns belatedly about his mother's intentions in a letter written by Signe. It's a farfetched notion that Eero never broached the subject with Kirsti in all those years because if he felt like a consolation prize to a German logic dictates that he'd return to Sweden and seek the real love of a devoted mother. Aideista Parhain is unmistakably misogynistic it gets off on reducing an old woman to tears then tries to have it both ways by redeeming her. But it's too late. The audience will feel jerked around after investing our allegiance with Signe.Aideista parhain casts Signe and Kirsti as the mother and the whore then lacks the conviction to let the sow be a sow.".

Then parhain means of mine. Perhaps ideist means mothers in the plural? Now my summary says One son. Two mothers. That's exactly what I mean. One son because the boy is an only child. Two mothers because there are two in fact the biological and the foster. That's exactly the point. Despite being another Holocaust movie it doesn't focus so much on the World War II but more in such things as what it's like to be in and out of family.The boy Eero is orphan of father but has his life with his mother. In 1943 his mother sends him to Sweden as a refugee. History tells that more than 70.000 finnish children were sent to Sweden as refugees during that time.Eero doesn't understand why his mother is abandoning him. He feels bad in a country he doesn't know with a language he doesn't talk with people he is unfamiliar with and his anger makes him cold and hostile. Even the new mother doesn't want him and is very hard and bitter on him. Eventually things change even if just because circumstances leave them with no choice. Upon his real mother's return when the war is over Eero wants to stay with the foster mother.A reasonable movie if flawed. It's a little boring and not very involving although it does capture the attention until the ending. I don't like certain things such as the presentday parts. For some reason I just don't like that in movies. To compensate the story is decent although with margin for improvement the cinematography is typically nordic the actors are talented and the atmosphere is faithful to reality.".

The acting is excellent.To say this is a miniseries is misleading and adds the impression of a cheese factor that is not present. There is a reason that this film has been taken from the small screen and released in theaters  I didn't even know it had been a miniseries until I read some of the comments here.The story is simple but it is not trite we may not have a huge number of surprises and no amazing plot twists and contortions but it is an emotional moving satisfying story.The most moving part of the story is the love and connectedness between the characters and how this is expressed  here in the U.S. physical display of platonic affection is virtually nonexistent unless you count athletes hitting each other on the rear. You can tell these characters really care for each other.I sat for the second three hours today with people who sat through the first three hours with me yesterday. Some yesterday just got back in line for part 2. There was a line waiting to get in today  all people who had seen part 1 already.Saying this movie is like Zelig as someone here did is false and insulting. We couldn't tell a story about a U.S. family that spans the 60's to the present without mentioning Viet Nam or Watergate or 911 so this story of course mentions events internal to Italy during that time. The historical events are a backdrop to the story not the story itself.The story is about this family and we care about what happens to them. We become engaged we sit and watch and laugh and cry with them. That's what movies are supposed to do.".

	schema:reviewBody "Best of Youth La Meglio giovent proves that Italians have learned the art of the longform television miniseries that the British have long mastered.Covering a somewhat same period of the baby boom generation as In A Land of Plenty it has more of the generational feel of individuals caught up in history as we have usually seen in British miniseries about endoftheeras or World War I such as Brideshead Revisited and Jewel in the Crown. U.S. miniseries were more successful as sweeping historical epics even when they were also family sagas like Roots and Centennial when the networks tried to interpret more recent history as in The Sixties the set characters sped through Zelig and Forest Gumplike in happening to be at the right place at the right time perhaps the several seasons combined of the NBC series American Dreams could be considered comparable in showing how the times that are achanging affect a family.Best of Youth is being released in the U.S. in movie theaters though I'm not sure even shown in two parts of three hours each how edited it is from the original format as other grand European miniseries like Berlin Alexanderplatz Das Boot and Fanny and Alexander were originally only shown in the U.S. in truncated theatrical versions as even PBS seems averse to television with subtitles so we rarely get to see the best of world television. Comparison to the Italian film The Leopard is unfair as that was not created in the same format and covers a shorter period of historical time.Best of Youth combines charismatic acting leisurely directing amidst beautiful scenery in several parts of Italy with writing that takes the trajectories of complex yet consistent characters' lives believably and searingly affected by uniquely Italian experiences of the baby boomers' young adult years through middle age without the American tendency to reject or regret youthful ambitions through the lens of local natural disasters violent political activities judicial battles against the Cosa Nostra European economic changes with regional variations that Americans rarely see in movies. The focus is primarily on two brothers from the 1960's almost to the present played by two actors who must be the equivalent of George Clooney and Richard Chamberlain in Italian television. Alessio Boni in particular as Matteo captures the screen with such tortured macho dynamism that it's no wonder he's gone on to play Heathcliff and Dracula in other miniseries. His Paul Newmanlike startling blue eyes become a talking point of the series and a continuing visual leitmotif. Similarly the physical differences between the two actors help to point up the different paths the brothers take through life even as the casting of other family members to look like them is eerily effective. The series is particularly good at capturing the camaraderie amongst old male friends over the years and the intimate interactions of members of a family particularly with children with a strong theme of the importance of both as an anchor.Unlike in American TV where women are adjuncts as the girlfriendwifemother the key women here are crucial fulcrums in the brothers' lives and have separate intellectual psychological and emotional demands. The emotions are important here  grief is shown very movingly with more pain and tears than American culture usually allows. In one extended scene we see a grieving mother walk slowly up a long flight of stairs in numbed silence and gradually see her revive as she learns of surprise news about her son. There are of course some coincidences of family members' and friends' paths crossing at key junctures but the story overall grips us. The pop music selectionsAmerican European and Italian are wonderfully evocative.".

Most comments consist indeed of positive words of praise in favour of this movie emotionally engaging never boring despite the long timerun authentic genuine poetic finely characterised wonderfully acted sober delicate sensitive intelligent never banal captivating enjoyable at every age simply great. I agree with all the qualities outlined by the users' reviews and just add a great merit the total lack of any political lineup in a movie where great political events and dramas of Italian history are displayed. Faults and merits are just to be seen everyone may form hisher opinion but Giordana never falls into the temptation to make any propaganda or engage any political controversy. As an Italian and living in a country where nowadays every aspect of one's life is object of political assessment as if politics were the only criterion of one's behaviour I appreciate this political noncommitment not in the sense of indifference of course but of sterile factiousness as a comforting and rare quality. Everything even tragic events with deep social wounds is displayed with such delicacy everything gets such an intimate and human dimension that the movie can really reach a universal impact. For me The Best of Youth is one of those movies you can never leave I bought the DVD which I keep jealously and lend only to deserving true friends. It's a sort of sweet companion which never disappoints it's so loaded with sound feelings and humanity that it is a sort of drug I take when I feel down and recovering is granted!".

On Swedish telly the divided in into 4 parts which were shown 4 days in a row. It is one of those series where one is longing for the next episode I found myself pondering about the film the characters all day. So many things has been said already in other reviews which I don't have to repeat I just say watch this lowly very slowly unfolding slice of life and Italian history. If it doesn't move you you will have to have a heart of stone. Excellent acting wonderful photos lots of atmosphere.....".

On Swedish telly the divided in into 4 parts which were shown 4 days in a row. It is one of those series where one is longing for the next episode I found myself pondering about the film the characters all day. So many things has been said already in other reviews which I don't have to repeat I just say watch this lowly very slowly unfolding slice of life and Italian history. If it doesn't move you you will have to have a heart of stone. Excellent acting wonderful photos lots of atmosphere.....";

	schema:reviewBody "Not necessarily THE best cinematic experience I've ever had which will always be reserved for LOTR Best of Youth is unquestionably among the top few.Even before we register with any visual images the unmistakable chords of House of the Rising Sun Am C G7 F take us right back to the late sixties when the first batch of post WW II baby boomers experienced the fears and aspirations of youth facing a world that will soon be radically changed by the information technology revolution. We then follow the protagonists along an epic journey of nearly four decades from youth to middle age starting as total strangers and ending up at the end of the six hours feeling like we belong to the family. When the lights in the cinema finally came on I for one longed to remain there for another 3 hours to accompany these people into their old age sharing more of their joy and sorrow.There is nothing new in Best of youth. It's about things you and I experience throughout our lives  growing up maturing facing choices falling in love sharing in friendship making mistakes making amends living and dying. What makes this movie soar above others is the care time and honesty the moviemaker have devoted to making it. The 6hour length helps the fact that this was initially a miniseries is quite irrelevant as we watch it as a movie shown in the cinema anyway. Like good vintage wine it takes time to age and takes time to properly enjoy.It could not have been more wrong to assume that because of the length the movie is slow in the sense of dragging. There are many mesmerizing stories to tell and they are told in such a perfect pace that there is not a single moment in which your interest might wander. The characters are all going through a continuous process of development. There are alternating scenes of happiness poignancy suspense pensive stoicism and gripping tension. There are also sprinkles of delightful humor as in the scene when one of the main characters Nicola visits his mother after a few years of absence. Mother you look like an old women exclaims Nicola with a cheery wink in his eye. I AM an old woman snaps the mother in mocked indignation with goodnatured humor underneath.The very personal stories are told against the backdrop of Italy going through the transition in the second half of the last century  economic development political unrest the Red Brigade social turmoil class struggle. And yet you don't really have to be Italian to appreciate how these macro changes are affecting the people in the stories because these changes are quite universal.There are a lot of characters portrayed with realistic depth by a wonderful wonderful cast too many to mention. Top of the list are obviously Luigi Lo Cascio and Alessio Boni who play the two brothers Nicola and Matteo respectively and Adriana Asti who plays the mother. And it's difficult not to fall in love a little with Maya Sansa who plays Mirella with such sunshine in her smile. Truth is however that there are a dozen more characters who are all wonderful and deserve mentioning.Best of youth is among my best cinematic experiences I have a hopeless weakness for LOTR. To you it may simply be THE BEST.".

	schema:reviewBody "I liked this so well that my first reaction after having watched it was to go back and watch it again. And that is what I did. As with most any good movie a second viewing is more rewarding than the first particularly if reading subtitles has been required.It has been a long time since the heydays of Fellini Bertolucci or Antonioni so it's good to see a quality Italian film come out that has international appeal. The ambitious scope of this film covering the lives of a family from 1966 to 2003 well justifies its six hour length. The story concentrates on two brothers Nicola and Matteo who take quite different paths with Nicola becoming a psychiatrist and Matteo a cop. In addition to the brothers we get to know their parents siblings two female lovers friends and children. The number of characters is balanced not too many to be confusing but enough to make things interesting.Director Giordana definitely has the eye of an artist. The movie is masterfully filmed throughout and some scenes are so beautifully shot that you can only respond with a sense of awe. Consider the scenes that have Nicola wandering through a natural history museum with his daughter. The editing is flawless and the tracking shot from a distance that interposes various animals as the two walk along is brilliant. Or take the scene where Nicola is at the photography exhibit with large photos mounted on stands throughout the hall. This is where having the luxury of a relaxed time constraint pays off. Nicola wanders among the photos for some time before finding the one he is looking for. The mood of that scene makes us as anxious to find the sought after photo as Nicola is.I thought all the actors were effective and was particularly impressed with Sonia Bergamasco who plays Nicola's significant other Giulia. Camilla Filippi who plays Nicola's daughter Sara as an adult is most appealing. And it doesn't hurt that all of the young actors are physically attractive.The story is told in a linear fashion and it moves along seamlessly which is a testament to the editing. I am sure that intercutting the lives of the various characters while supplying a backdrop of historical events was not easy. I particularly appreciated this as a counterpoint to the disjointed time sequencing and jump cuts adopted by so many current movies. I learned a good deal of recent Italian history from this movie but the emphasis was always on the characters. The point is well made as to how much our lives are shaped by the larger social events of the time. I never understood before how turbulent things were in Italy during the time frame of this movie.I liked how many of the characters remained enigmatic. What prompted Giulia to become a member of the revolutionary Red Brigades at the sacrifice of her family? Matteo is so complex and conflicted that I never figured him out. He could be sensitive but also subject to fits of anger. The only consistency in Matteo was his love for his brother even though they were sometimes at odds. Matteo was prone to selfinflicted woundson a visit to Rome he sees his parents as he drives by them but he does not stop he makes a date with a girl but shows up only to follow her secretly in his car as she finally walks away. For all of Nicola's skills as a psychiatrist in the end it is seen that he did not quite understand his brother either. This movie does not dazzle you with technique but rather seduces you into becoming involved with its story and its characters. Who can argue with a technique that accomplishes that?".

	schema:reviewBody "No the number of minutes is no typo. This film is over six and a half hours long. But as Roger Ebert says I dropped outside of time and was carried along by the narrative flow when the film was over I had no particular desire to leave the theater and would happily have stayed another three hours. Of course I was watching in the comfort of my home but I agree completely with Mr. Ebert.The narrative covers the years 1966 through 2003 and focuses primarily upon the older brother of a middle class Italian family. As it begins the two brothers of the family are ready to pursue college education as an avenue to successful careers. The younger of them is volunteering at a local mental facility as a walker  a companion for patients who need to explore the world outside the institution. He finds that the girl he accompanies is being mistreated and more or less kidnaps her in an attempt to return her to her father's home. In this effort he seeks the help of his brother and the two embark upon an idealistic quest to return the girl to the love and safety of her home. The unhappy result of their venture changes the outlooks of both and sets them on paths which diverge from their original plans. Each chooses a new course which is in conflict with his basic personality. The older brother who had been practical in all of his previous projects finds himself diving into an alternative culture whereas the younger who had been more footloose joins the military and eventually becomes a policeman. The encounters of both during the almost forty year span of the film gives us many insightful what ifs of two lives and reminds us of the enormous effect sheer chance has upon each of us.If you are familiar with the Italian political climate and events during the era of this film your enjoyment will be heightened  but even someone as politically innocent as I had no trouble understanding the conflicts of the major characters that come from diverging ideologies. I can probably be pretty much assured that if you are a HSC regular you are well versed in the politics of Italy in the latter part of the Twentieth Century. This film has a great feel to it in that it doesn't fall into the trap of being overly melodramatic which is often the bent of films that span long periods of time. I was left with a good feeling at the end but it arose from having viewed the triumphs and tragedies of a very believable family a family whose members change and grow as a result of their experience of life just as happens in all families no matter their geographic location.As for geographic location the viewer of this film is treated to many memorable scenes of Italy from the grit of the city to the blissful pleasures of the islands. The experience is one of a resident of the country rather than a tourist who only has privy to a gossamer view.If you enjoy excellent filmmaking and a good story I have no doubt that you will also be carried along by the narrative flow just as Mr. Ebert and I can guarantee you that you will enjoy the ride.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Best of Youth is a wonderfully scripted acted and visually stunning film that will sweep you off your feet and into the lives of an Italian family as they go through the trials and tribulations of life. The film's main focus is on two brothers Nicola and Matteo Catiti whose personalities are as different as night and day yet is also immediately apparent that these two love each other very much. Nicola is the younger free spirited and philosophical brother while Matteo is more outspoken with a hot temper and closed personality.What I admired most throughout this film was the use and passage of time. Events in Italian history are not crammed into 120 minutes but is instead elongated as Matteo and Nicola react in their own ways to the events that occur in their country. Time is such an important factor in this film evidents not only by the six hour running time but how those six hours are treated. Special occasions occur yet none are given any special attention. The events that occur are important for that moment in time yet one pass become mere memories such is the case of life.With the passage of time The Best Of Youth became such a moving experience for me. I felt as if I were a part of their family. I could not touch them or talk to them yet they seemed to welcome me with open arms as I silently watched their lives unfold before me. I could feel the love this family had for each other as I laughed and cried right beside them. Words just do not seem to be enough to describe the brilliance of this film. It is literally life transferred on screen.The Best of Youth is remarkably acted and directed. At no time during this film was I bored because such attention is made to character development script and cinematography. In the first part of the film Nicola is exploring Norway and sends a postcard to his brother back home telling him of his travels and experiences and in three words seems to sum up the film perfectly Life is beautiful. After viewing this film you will share the same perspective.HIGHLY Recommended".

But of course I still realize that the key to great drama is the characters  and they make this epic Italian miniseriesturnedmovie work and work beautifully at that.The Best of Youth focuses on various members of the Carati family and their friends advancing from the 1960s to the nearpresent as it chronicles their lives in the context of social turmoil in Italy as a whole. For the most part the story never drags and every single character is compelling and sympathetic.Many of the character have flaws but they're not bad people  just complex. Many tragic things happen but the film never wallows in misery except on one wholly justified occasion. Moral conflicts are explored not in blackandwhite but in shades of grey. In other words The Best of Youth is rich with the kind of warmth complexity and subtle nuances that you tend to miss in most American dramas  even the ones that win Oscars.I won't spoil the plot really  I'll just say that both of the main characters brothers Matteo and Nicola Carati are charismatic and cool and well worth six hours of screen time. They're also very different which keeps things interesting.Are there any significant flaws here? Nah not really. My interest waned a bit during some segments particularly the historical ones that aren't explained that well. There's also a bit of cheesy makeup and blue screen but that can be excused because this is really a TV production as I understand it not a big movie. Besides I sort of love production flaws. They're fun aren't they? On a totally pointless note I'd like to mention a strange plus of The Best of Youth  much of the cast is totally gorgeous. Guys and gals alike have reason to rejoice here...One final random thought. While I'm glad that The Best of Youth was distributed and wellreceived in the U.S. I'm annoyed that it was publicized as being like the Godfather or like the works of Scorcese. It's nothing like the Godfather it's nothing like Scorcese. The marketers seemed to have believed unfortunately that U.S. audiences are only interested in Italian criminals not normal Italian people. This sort of irritates me. Note my surname and you'll figure out why! But such concerns have nothing to do with the actual movie which is pretty much flawless.".

Important issues were brought up but like life not always spelled out so clearly.

This film turned out to be a masterpiece to be remembered forever in movie history and be ranked with films like Godfather Seven Samurai What a wonderful life Shawshank Redemption etc.What a magnificent film... where can I begin? The story? The story draw both destiny of troubled Italy and ordinary middle class Italian family both Macro and micro story is combined seamless you will experience and get thorough the turbulence time of Italy and the family from 1960s2003.All main actors are top class acting so naturally from their early unresponsively 20s student times to bittersweet grey hair late mid age times without false note. Particualry Maya Sansa I think the Star was born here her another recent film Good morning night is another evidence. I haven't seen an actress with such a presence and ability in last few years. Needless to say about the lead roles Luigi Lo Cascio and Alessio Boni both shows such a true resonance of all the emotions. Also its nice to know 70's Italian movie icon Adriana Asti still keep that elegance.The greatest thing is the directors sympathetic eye to all the characters. Most of characters are given real three dimension character in the course of 40 years time in this film all of them have their own life and problems. each character come with such a detail  depth you will feel like they are your real family at the end of the film. The length of this films seems weakness of it but actually strongest point lay in there. Because of the length you are able to feel the passage of 30 years of time in the film and you can feel characters so close it grows in you during the film. Towards the end of the film you may do not want to say good bye to them don't want film to finish! Like all the masterpiece I mentioned above this film come with some memorable scene Warning  Spoiler Matteo jumps from window  its so abrupt but still make sense its so realistic his face are painful before and such a quiet pain he shows that night without any big speech. Nicola and Mirella walking in the forest and Matteo appears and touched them... I never cried that much in the cinema. Not like Hollywood film this scene doesn't come with any sentimental big music or emotional speech actually its speechless its very subtle still so strongly moving... Giulia met Sarah at church after she released and Sarah asked Giulia to play church's organ... Spoiler endActually if you don't want show your friendsfamily your cryingsobbing face you should avoid this film all the cost its that moving so powerful.Conclusion  true gem masterpiece. Best film I've even seen last 5 years. If you love movie you can't miss this film. Your 6 hours will be more that rewarded. 12 out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "The gist of my toolong ramble below is there probably is at least definitively within the film no answer to the Why? of Matteo and that Nicola as he ages increasingly embraces the status quo. Blame inevitable age if you like but it doesn't happen to their mother.Way back among some finished and unfinished novels that migrate to each computer I buy but that otherwise I no longer bring myself to look at is one in which my Myshkinlike protagonist lies up a minor tragedy to cause his various acquaintances who have nothing to do with one another to show up at one place at the same time. The Russian Myshkin couldn't lie of course but mine did. Just to see I guess a sort of wishfulfillment curiosity that killed the cat or made the student's mind viable or kept the oldster's young and nimble. Lying is storytelling is lying. The act of writing allows or allowed me playing god just like that character of mine to introduce to one another versions of people I known but whose paths never crossed otherwise. A tragic now late slow guy from work somehow occupies my vacationvacant condo and hits it off with my garrulous but uneducated father. That kind of thing. Or as Myshkin I grab one or another misplaced acquaintance long gone well before my mountaineering days and march her way above the timberline to some icy col only to play at not knowing the way back down while sweet panic and thunderheads well.I don't want to get into most La Meglio giovent's maybe merits the pacing and rhythms gained by extraordinary length the credible aging and acquisition of Time's wisdom whether for growth or stagnation in most the characters the relatively quiet interpolation of passing history. But the sadly heavyhanded grossly unnecessary insertion of Matteo's ghost into the closing scene between Nicola and Mirella made me realize what an orgy of wishfulfillment the second half is. Suddenly seemingly because Life or Time heals but maybe just so the filmmaker could resolve things for us nearly everyone meets everyone. Even at six hours a story's tick needs its tock. Whether or not director Giordana and his writers intended the nearly dead center division Part One ticks and then Part Two tocks.If this is more than just a really really good soap opera then there have to be ambiguity loose ends disappointments that come more from life's constraints than from audiences' need for reassurance and resolution. Why other than to create suspense does Nicola deny Giorgia's need be involved in finding Mirella? He's suddenly so uncharacteristically lacking in empathy. If he's hurting over Matteo then he's selfish. If he's just being professional then we're denied his rationale. I can easily dream up justifications within Nicola's character but watching I sensed a filmmaker struggling to twist an ending out of events that in reality must fractal along indefinitely. With possible exceptions of Nicola's mother and perhaps his tooyoungyet barely formed though marriageable daughter Mirella seems the sanest creature in the film Fate's gift to this at least slightly askew family. Has Nicola even told her about Giorgia and in what terms? Inevitably she will meet Giorgia Tiny piece of a sixhour sequel?! but the film denies us the experience.Matteo's so everpresent and all the more so as the film progresses in no small part because of Giorgia's obsession that that bit of magic realism offended me as a viewer. Don't plaster on the screen what's already there don't double images. Besides I'm not at all certain the living Matteo would have been so generous. The sequence suggests suicide's a path to peace of mind a return to balance or to freedom from self What?! Does Matteo reach Enlightenment? Aurrgh! but no one can know this. Are the filmmakers saying that Matteo by selfabnegation selfdestruction restored balance to his family? Probably not but how cruel the suggestion! Even so Matteo's the glue here the MacGuffin a key of some sort. I've sat through enough director Q  As to suspect there may be no explanation. Ambiguity's a storyteller's tool. Ambiguity red herrings in stories not by genre mysteries cue ineptness from hacks but deliberation from pros. Matteo's case abounds in red herrings. Despite the transvestite I don't think he's gay all I saw in the episode was selfloathing and nowadays they would have simply told us so the day he first flirts with Mirella despite his holding back he seems no less enthralled than Nicola will be later. Despite the cop stuff the look the gun I don't think he's political they could have involved him against Nicola's terrorist love but don't Nicola though by surviving so wholeheartedly within the status quo does come off political. Surely each of us as I think the filmmakers intend will find a different key to Matteo. Empson writing about ambiguity usually says not that one or another reading is it but that all are present and in play. Matteo's mystery allows the filmmakers' artifice to breathe. If I see any clue it lies way back the day or two with Giorgia when she if not he knew him already a soul broken in some way that her experience had taught her to understand. Whatever was wrong with him likely was already wrong then. I don't know what it was but banishing from the film's close the first and only character who got it seems to doom the whole family if only in the sense of their not getting it about Matteo and Giorgia. It seriously undercuts that silly ghostMatteo scene.I know too little to speak but recall vaguely that there may be a genetic tendency to suicide sort of a nofault clause.Luigi Lo Cascio as Nicola incidentally looks like both JeanPierre Laud and Dustin Hoffman but even saying that I can't see that those two ever behave quite alike.".

Empson writing about ambiguity usually says not that one or another reading is it but that all are present and in play. Matteo's mystery allows the filmmakers' artifice to breathe. If I see any clue it lies way back the day or two with Giorgia when she if not he knew him already a soul broken in some way that her experience had taught her to understand. Whatever was wrong with him likely was already wrong then. I don't know what it was but banishing from the film's close the first and only character who got it seems to doom the whole family if only in the sense of their not getting it about Matteo and Giorgia. It seriously undercuts that silly ghostMatteo scene.I know too little to speak but recall vaguely that there may be a genetic tendency to suicide sort of a nofault clause.Luigi Lo Cascio as Nicola incidentally looks like both JeanPierre Laud and Dustin Hoffman but even saying that I can't see that those two ever behave quite alike.";

I admire the script the labyrinthic action which is not confusing at all but is perfectly mixed together. The puzzle once completed is beautiful.

Our eyes and attention are focused on the plot and not on fantastic camera movements or a music video type editing.It's a sober and excellent movie.

	schema:reviewBody "La Meglio giovent THE BEST OF YOUTH is a spellbinding drama that sweeps the viewer through Italian history from 1966 through 2003 as distilled in the lives of one family. Writers Sandro Petraglia and Stefano Rulli have created a screenplay that is both informative to those of us who did not live this period in Italian political disturbance and simultaneously passionate in the creation of a group of people surrounding two brothers who propel the story with heartrending power.Nicola Luigi Lo Cascio and Matteo Alessio Boni are brothers in Rome in the Carati family  mother Adriana Adriana Asti father Angelo Andrea Tidona and sisters Francesca Valentina Carnelutti and Giovanna Lidia Vitale. Nicola and Matteo are devoted to each other despite their polarity of differences in personalities and beliefs. With their childhood friends Carlo Fabrizio Gifuni and Vitale Claudio Gio they begin their an adventure of travel to the northern regions of the globe but Nicola and Matteo encounter and rescue a young abused girl Giorgia Jasmine Trinca who is confined in an asylum a pause for humanity reasons that alters their lives forever. Matteo joins the military and then the police force while Nicola travels to Norway to work as a hippie laborer. He returns to Italy after the flood of Florence and meets Giulia Sonia Bergamasco a talented piano player who sympathizes with the Red Brigade of socialism. Matteo as an angry rebel spirit travels to Sicily where he encounters and encourages photographer Mirella Maya Sansa. Due in part to his devotion to Giorgia's plight Nicola becomes a psychiatrist. The four main characters then are the keys to the story which lives through the myriad terrorist political upheavals in Italy during that forty year period but also demonstrate the profound effect that family and friendship have on shaping the destinies of all concerned.Of course the story is far richer than this brief synopsis the film is after all over six hours long! and it is conducted like a symphony by the gifted director Marco Tullio Giordana. Originally screened as a television miniseries in Italy the six hourly episodes are seamlessly joined for the award winning theatrical release and the result the film is a drama that stirs every emotion in the human spirit. It boasts brilliant cinematography by Roberto Forza and a musical score that is fine pastiche of works by Bach Georges Delerue Mozart Astor Piazzolla and Giovanni Sollima. The cast succeeds in brandishing talent so deeply embedded in their characters that each becomes part of the viewers' psyche. This is a stunning film one that once seen will probably find its way into the permanent film libraries of those who appreciate great cinematic art. An exceptional visual and emotional experience. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp".

We drift slowly through these white mountains and Hanna Schygulla's voice starts retelling an ancient legend from the Far East a long time ago the living and the dead inhabited the same world but the dead grew in numbers and power and the living feared them very much. So the living banished the dead into the world of mirrors.Franzen manages to set the mood for his whole film in these first minutes. Slow beautiful magical and with a hint of longing and romance in Schygulla's voice.The movie tells three stories softly interwoven there is Momme a 20yearold boy whose father suddenly dies. Momme is the stereotype of a Northern German greatly exaggerated he hardly ever says a word or shows any kind of emotion. Momme goes to see his grandfather to tell him of his father's death. The conversation between the two could summarize the whole movie again. Over dinner Momme asks his grandfather why he doesn't live in the city anymore. The grandfather replies by saying that he can't stand the smell there ever since Grandma died it reeks of death there he says and the subject is dropped. Momme never tells the old man of his father's death somehow the message comes through loud and clear in Momme's silence. Momme then flees his grandfather's little hut and runs into Lene a strange carefree Danish girl. They fall in love and immediately lose each other. This is the main narrative thread in the film the story of Lene and Momme and how they're doing everything to get back together.Then there is Hauptkommissar Poulsen a police chief who seems to have not a single friend in life. His story tells of the constant struggle against loneliness. He is also the comic character in this film. While everyone else is chronically silent he just can't seem to keep his mouth closed. Despite this absurd humour Poulsen is probably the film's saddest character.Finally the story of the old man pops up every now and then. As a reaction to his son's death he flees his home and sets up a tent by the sea.The film is not sad or melancholy. It is actually pretty funny mostly in a really absurd way. But what makes this film special is not its magical soundtrack its enchanting landscapes realized in gorgeous CinemaScope or even the great characters. What made this film special almost unique to me was the director's approach to storytelling. This film has been hailed as the comeback of romantic filmmaking in German cinema and as a contrast to the recent fashion of gritty naturalistic films. While Franzen himself has said that he never planned this film as a contrast to anything or a comeback of anything a certain sense of the magical permeates his work.There is for instance Momme's father's hearing aid. After his father's death Momme takes that hearing aid and wears it himself. Lene's grandmother on the other side of the blue border a literal translation of the title has evidently had an operation due to a cancer of the throat. She uses one of these electrical devices to amplify her voice. At one point Momme whispers Lene's name into his father's hearing aid we zoom into the hearing aid and out of the old lady's voice amplifier and out of that little box we suddenly hear Momme's voice distant and distorted.Thus we have here a magical film a film which is well rooted in reality which tells three very real stories but which is also not afraid to elegantly exaggerate as Franzen put it in an interview.If you see only one German film in 2005 make it this one.".

Also for you TV trivia fans see if you can spot Lois Lane Noel Neill in here.Never as gorgeous as billed Lake still had a unique look and voice but she plays it pretty straight here characterwise.

After stomping out into the rain Morrison learns Helen has been murdered and must race to prove his innocence before the coppers pick him up.Ladd would give considerably more sophisticated performances in his later years but he strikes all the right ultratough chords and although Veronica Lake is a rather wooden actress she is remarkably beautiful and as a team the pair has considerable chemistry. The standouts in the cast however are Da Silva who gives the role of the heavy a surprising interpretation and William Bendix who plays Ladd's warwounded buddy to great effect.THE BLUE DAHLIA lacks both the moodiness and grittiness of truly great film noir so it is not in the first rank of the genrebut it is no less enjoyable for that. The film cracks along at a rapid pace with plenty of action and a surprise twist or two that will keep you guessing to the very end. Ladd and Lake fans will love it and any one who likes the hardboiled style will be in for a real treat. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

	schema:reviewBody "The trailer for The Blue Dahlia advertised the film as Ladd Lake and Bendix. Not a mention about Raymond Chandler maybe he wanted it that way.The Blue Dahlia has mystery writer Raymond Chandler writing an original screenplay and Chandler delivers a good movie for the most part. Nice suspenseful noir film but it could have been better.The main weakness in the plot is Veronica Lake. Chandler couldn't stand her and called her Moronica Lake as a reflection of her acting ability. In fairness it's a poorly defined role and her meeting with Alan Ladd in this film is too too coincidental. I guess you had to give the star a love interest but the idea that Ladd is hunting for the killer of his wife and just happens to come upon the wife of his number one suspect is way too unreal.The number one suspect of the killing is Howard DaSilva. If I had to name the best performance in this film it would have to be DaSilva. He's the dapper elegant owner of a Hollywood nightclub but he exudes a menace that chills you. His best scene in the film is paying off blackmailer Will Wright. He pays him THIS TIME. Wright gets the message he'd better not come back for more.I believe it was Raymond Chandler who also said that Alan Ladd was a small boy's idea of a tough guy. That is unfair to Ladd who delivers a more than competent performance here as the returning war veteran who's on the hunt for his wife's killer while being suspected of the crime itself. Check out Alan Ladd's scene at the farm with DaSilva's thugs. Very similar in the way they end up to how Bogart handled the baddies in The Big Sleep. Bill Bendix gets in the top billing with stars Ladd and Lake because he's also a radio star because of the Life of Riley Show. Bendix and Hugh Beaumont are Ladd's wartime buddies and Bendix never was bad in any film he did. He shows signs of post traumatic stress at a time when that diagnosis had not been invented.A bit too contrived but a nice film noir.".

	schema:headline " Meanders After a Promising Start";
	schema:reviewBody "The first 30 minutes are terrific. Three navy buddies are returning from combat in the Pacific. The trouble is that Buzz Bendix now has a plate in his head and doesn't think too well while Johnny Ladd has a faithless wife Dowling who welcomes him home with a party for her boyfriend de Silva. The party scene is especially well done with the girls looking like they've emptied Paramount's best wardrobe racks. Now Johnny's angry and footloose while poor Buzz keeps hearing monkey music in his plated head. So when the faithless wife unsurprisingly turns up dead the cops are looking for Johnny and we're wondering who really did it.The trouble is the story meanders after this promising start while Ladd fades somewhat into the background and Chandler's screenplay seems unsure what to do with Veronica Lake. After all what's the point of the lengthy diversion with the two heist guys and the fleabag hotel or Dad's blackmailing of Harwood both of which detract from the central plot of who killed Helen. Marshall's direction doesn't help either. Note the deliberate pauses in too many of the dialogue exchanges that slows down the action when what's needed is more snap to match Chandler's often clever lines. Then too for what seems like noir material there's not much matching atmosphere. Ultimately the movie's really more of a meandering thriller than a compelling noir.There are compensations however. Bendix really delivers as the braindamaged exsailor. His scenes are the movie's real core and have lost none of their original force as he struggles painfully to fight through the mental fog that the war has cost him. This may be the only postwar film to portray the ravages of his type of injury albeit in a nonrehabilitative context. We wonder what will become of him. I gather the screenplay originally set him up as the culprit but navy authorities objectedtoo sensitive for returning vets I would guess. It may also be worth noting that even though Buzz's injury evokes sympathy he's none too likablesomething of a surprise given Hollywood's tendency to sentimentalize. Nonetheless he's often belligerent and abusive toward strangers a boldly realistic move on both Chandler's and Bendix's parts.I guess no commentary would be complete without remarking on the LaddLake pairing perhaps the most perfect visual matchup from Hollywood's socalled golden era. They're like two exquisite blond dolls with wryly brittle personas to match. I'm just sorry the script got sidetracked into not giving their pairing the amount of screen time they deserved. And speaking of visual perfection was there ever a better embodiment of an unfaithful wife than Doris Dowling with her cruel eyes and dropdead sexy gown. No wonder she cuts through even Buzz's mental fog. With her unusual appearance it's too bad Dowling left Hollywood at the height of the Mc Carthy investigations. Too bad also that Ladd's career was plagued by his lack of height 5'5''. In fact like Cagney 5'6 Ladd could project the authority of a much taller man a real tribute to his abilities. Nonetheless note how in giving a description of Johnny Ladd in the movie all his physical characteristics are included except his height!a rather glaring omission.Anyway the movie remains an interesting period piece even though it lacks the coherence and snap of a firstrate thriller.".

It may also be worth noting that even though Buzz's injury evokes sympathy he's none too likablesomething of a surprise given Hollywood's tendency to sentimentalize. Nonetheless he's often belligerent and abusive toward strangers a boldly realistic move on both Chandler's and Bendix's parts.I guess no commentary would be complete without remarking on the LaddLake pairing perhaps the most perfect visual matchup from Hollywood's socalled golden era. They're like two exquisite blond dolls with wryly brittle personas to match. I'm just sorry the script got sidetracked into not giving their pairing the amount of screen time they deserved. And speaking of visual perfection was there ever a better embodiment of an unfaithful wife than Doris Dowling with her cruel eyes and dropdead sexy gown. No wonder she cuts through even Buzz's mental fog. With her unusual appearance it's too bad Dowling left Hollywood at the height of the Mc Carthy investigations. Too bad also that Ladd's career was plagued by his lack of height 5'5''. In fact like Cagney 5'6 Ladd could project the authority of a much taller man a real tribute to his abilities. Nonetheless note how in giving a description of Johnny Ladd in the movie all his physical characteristics are included except his height!a rather glaring omission.Anyway the movie remains an interesting period piece even though it lacks the coherence and snap of a firstrate thriller.";

Chandler put Ladd down as not in Bogart's class a small boy's idea of a tough guy but Ladd is strong in his role of the returning veteran. The real weakness is Lake catatonic in a bland role with little dimension or mystery. We know from the get go that she didn't do it which may have been a mistake and no reason is given for this sweet girlnextdoor being married to a gangster.

While Fredric March came back to perfect wife Myrna Loy Ladd finds an unfaithful Doris Dowling drunkenly laughing in his face over being responsible for the death of their son. Ladd threatens her with his gun but in another contrivance leaves it and her behind as he walks out into the rain. The next morning wifey is found shot dead with Ladd the obvious suspect. With help from Lake he eludes the police and tries to ferret out his wife's killer another contrivance as she meant nothing to him and his motivation is a pale copy of Bogart's logic from The Maltese Falcon.The solution to the mystery is no great shakes but the movie plays well because of some crisp dialogue by Chandler plus interesting and wellacted supporting characters. William Bendix shines as a wounded serviceman with mental problems Howard Da Silva as a smooth gangster with a hidden past Will Wright as an extremely sleazy bungalow peeper and blackmailer and Tom Powers as a sarcastic cop.All in all I expected it to be better but certainly worth a look for fans of old crime movies.".

Plot sees Ladd playing a navy officer who returns home to his unfaithful wife after fighting in the South Pacific. When she is found murdered he is the number one suspect he must find who is responsible before it's too late.Legend has it that Paramount Pictures were so pleased about the success of Double Indemnity and in particular Raymond Chandler's writing on it they handed the writer a contract where he produced this tightly wound film noir piece. Nominated for an Academy Award Chandler had in fact had to give up his teetotaller way of life he was a recovering alcoholic so as to gain inspiration for the story. Also of note is that his original ending was shelved after objections by the U.S. Military Department shame because I believe that an already good film could have been a better one with Chandler's original denouement. Oh well what's left is still rather rewarding to the genre faithful.After This Gun for Hire and The Glass Key this was the third pairing of Alan Ladd  Veronica Lake. Their working chemistry set in stone it's nice that the film doesn't solely rely on the pair to make Chandler's material work. True enough their scenes have a tenderness to them acting as a sort of warm place to go to when the harsher aspects in the plot hit home hard but the film is far more than just the Ladd  Lake show. What marks it out as a worthy point of reference in the film noir cycle is that it delves into the psyche of the servicemen returning home from the war. Observing how they were being received and showing that some of them also carried emotional scars as well as those ones gained in battle. Then Chandler mixes it in with a hardboiled murder investigation as our wrongly accused protagonist trawls the mean streets of L.A. searching to clear his name. With that comes grungy premises' and periods of brutal violence all cloaked moodily by the competent Marshall. Ladd does good work very appealing yet tough but it's Bendix who steals the movie with an intense portrayal of an ex serviceman with psychological issues.With the original ending and a deeper exploration of the war veterans not being warmly received on homecoming The Blue Dahlia would have been close to being a genre classic. The script and Bendix ensure tho that it's still very easy to recommend to like minded fans of the genre and its dark alley offshoots. 7.510".

Returned veteran Ladd is accused of murdering his trampy wife and his servicemen buddies and a beautiful blonde help to clear his name. Ladd  Lake disappointingly don't get many scenes together but the ones they do have are wonderful they had excellent chemistry even if they weren't the world's greatest actors. Bendix gives the performance of the picture as Buzz the veteran with shellshock. Howard Da Silva is memorably sleazy and Doris Dowling turns on the femme fatale appeal. I like how as in The Best Years Of Our Lives the problems of returning veterans are dealt with realistically. Chandler wrote the screenplay and he gives us some great noir dialogue exchanges even if we are asked as with The Big Sleep to believe in a plot with a hell of a lot of coincidences and rushed and silly ending. Marshall does a good job directing. Its not the best noir you'll ever see but it is great fun especially if you like Ladd  Lake.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Blue Dahlia is a flower and a nightclub both of which figure in the plot of this 1946 film starring Alan Ladd Veronica Lake William Bendix and Howard da Silva. There's plenty of the busy somewhat chaotic postwar atmosphere in this movie as war pals Johnny Morrison Ladd Buzz Wanchek Bendix and George Copeland Hugh Beaumont return from service. While the braindamaged Buzz and Copeland get an apartment together Morrison returns to his beautiful wife Doris Dowling whom he finds has been living a wild partyfilled existence and cheating on him with club owner Eddie Harwood da Silva. Hurt and angry Morrison trying to get a cab in the rain is picked up by none other than a beautiful blond named Joyce who he does not know is actually Mrs. Harwood. After parting company they both stay at the same inn without realizing it. The next morning Morrison hears on the radio that his wife is dead and the police are looking for him. On the run and with some help from Joyce Morrison tries to find out who really killed his wife.This is a pretty good noir with a solid effective performance from Ladd and excellent work by both Bendix and da Silva. There are plenty of suspects too  viewers will have their pick. Though The Blue Dahlia is a decent noir it's the frenetic postwar energy that makes it watchable rather than the story which as one reviewer here pointed out has the strange coincidence of Johnny being picked up by Mrs. Harwood. The other odd thing to this viewer anyway is the fact that the Bendix character is so obviously braindamaged from the war he has a plate in his head yet no one seems to really pick up on it or at least acknowledge it until later in the film. He's told to pull himself together and allowed to drink. Meanwhile loud music drives him nearly insane and he suggests getting on a bus not remembering he just got off of it.The Veronica Lake role is criticized  it's true she doesn't have much to do it's also true that not many people liked working with her and that she wasn't the world's greatest actress Raymond Chandler called her Moronica but she and Ladd made a great if short team and she was always beautiful to look at and listen to.All in all worth watching for one of the great noir teamings and some good performances.".

Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake sporting a slightly shorter version of her trademark peekaboo hairstyle are reunited in this stylish film noir. Johnny Morrison just returned from military service comes home to his Los Angeles bungalow to discover his fickle unscrupulous wife Helen the relatively unknown Doris Dowling best remembered as Ray Milland's drinking buddy in The Lost Weekend hasn't exactly been waiting in the wings for him  she has been having an affair with Eddie Harwood Howard da Silva owner of the Blue Dahlia nightclub You've got the wrong lipstick on mister!. She then drunkenly shrieks of how her impaired driving had killed their young son which leads Johnny to threaten her with a gun but he promptly leaves before he does something he'll regret later. However Helen is found dead the next morning and Johnny who had made the acquaintance of Joyce Veronica Lake is the prime suspect. Joyce offers to help and Johnny's war buddy William Benedix also wants him cleared but as with all Chandler noir there are plenty of red herrings twists and mazes of clues that don't always make sense. Johnny feels he can't trust Joyce when he discovers that she is the wife of Harwood although she clearly wants nothing more to do with him. She tries to explain but Johnny dismisses her with So long baby! The truth does come out but not until after a few fascinating plot twists. Many have said that this is not really noir since Lake's character is not so much a femme fatale as she is a mystery dame but hey if she sparks Ladd's interest that's more than enough! Benedix who had teamed with Ladd and Lake in The Glass Key four years earlier gives tremendous support and his wounded traumatized war veteran is a compelling character.Chandler's ungentlemanly treatment of Lake calling her Moronica Lake and deriding her acting skills couldn't have earned him very many points may account for the reason why she appears blank in a few scenes but she pulls the role off and she and Ladd make screen magic as always. She and Dowling are beautifully costumed by Edith Head. On a rather morbid note this film's title was the inspiration of giving murder victim Elizabeth Short the moniker The Black Dahlia. And the similar turns that both Ladd and Lake's lives would take is very ironic and sad  both would see their careers slide suffer from depression and die relatively young as a result of alcoholism. If there ever was a screen couple who ran neck and neck it was these two!A worthy DVD contender what the heck is taking so long? and let's hope when such a day comes plenty of extras will be included!".

There his wife is having a party with a dozen of friends in which her lover Eddie Harwood is also invited.

I just saw this movie tonight at the Oak Street Cinema in Minneapolis. Overall the movie is good thanks to a good plot the scenario is signed Raymond Chandler not quiet a coincidence. At first I found the acting very poor and dated. Especially during the argument between Alan Ladd and his wife played Doris Dowling. This was quiet a surprise for me because I met this actress in Othello in which she has a small part directed by Orson Welles a director who generally hires only good actors. But as soon as you get into the story the acting and the dialogues get better and you really want to know the name of the murderer really I could not guess it!. After the plot the scenes between Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake are what make the movie worth to remember. Frustrating enough for the most romantic of us you won't see them kiss each other during this movie even at the end this was probably not allowed on screen at the time when the movie was made. It is also hard to tell if the Dahlias in the movie were actually blue since it was filmed in black and white. Finally yes Veronica Lake is very beautiful.This is good entertainment I recommend it with a 710.".

However the film isn't perfectjust very enjoyable.Alan Ladd returns home from the service along with two war buddies Hugh Beaumont and William Bendix. Bendix's brain is a bit scrambled due to a head wound he got in the war and he seems a bit punchy throughout the film. Beaumont is on hand mostly to keep an eye on Bendix. As for Ladd he's returning to his old ball and chainleaving the other two in an apartment they rent together. However Ladd is shocked to see that his darling wife is a good time girl and it seems pretty obvious she was playing the field while he was in the service. To make things worse he finds out that his dead son died because his wife was too busy partying to watch him and naturally Ladd hot foots it outta there. Soon after this the dame gets it and it's assumed Ladd done it due to their big blow up at the apartment. When Ladd finds out he's wanted he takes it on the lam and intends to prove he was innocent I always wanted to use 40s lingo in one of my reviews.As for the quality of the film it's pretty good. Ladd is at his laconic best and watching him fight off a couple thugs late in the film was a treat. Veronica Lake a frequent costar with Ladd is on hand and she actually underplays it a bit. Howard Da Silva is a slimy jerk in the filmsomething he really excelled at during the 30s 40s and 50s before finding a new image as Ben Franklin in 1776. As for Beaumont he's just fine though I do think Bendix played the brainaddled role perhaps too broadlyit certainly was NOT a subtle performance. The best lines in the film though came from none of these guys but were very clever Film Noir one liners from the copsthey came off as the typical smart but very cynical law menvery very typical of the style of Raymond Chandler who wrote the story. Like other Chandler films THE BIG SLEEP DOUBLE INDEMNITY and FAREWELL MY LOVELY the biggest star of the film was the writing and incredibly great dialog that made the film very enjoyable indeed.The only negative about the film is that Chandler's original story was changed and frankly I think having the braininjured friend Bendix be the killer would have been a lot better. Pinning it on the house detective made little senseas they really had no proof he'd done it and it required a Perry Mason moment i.e. a guy confessed out of the blue with no evidence that he'd done it. Very sloppy but you certainly can't blame Chandler for thisblame some stupid studio hacks that were afraid to hurt the image of the US military since the guy was supposed to be a returning vet who was injured in the line of duty. Had they kept the original vision it would have scored even higher.".

There are military people everywhere in the opening scene as Ladd a bomber pilot and hero arrives in LA after demobilization. His wife has sunk so low that she has parties with loud music and wears a silk pajama outfit that looks alluring and she kisses bad men and drinks too much so he leaves and soon she winds up dead.

His wife has sunk so low that she has parties with loud music and wears a silk pajama outfit that looks alluring and she kisses bad men and drinks too much so he leaves and soon she winds up dead.

As for the leads Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake well their physical attractiveness is enough to carry them through the film but they don't add anything much beyond that. Still they were good casting decisions and the story is engaging enough for the audience especially huge film noir fans like me to follow it through to the end. Recommended 710.".

It was the daring adventure of it all that stayed in my memory ever since.Especially impressionable was the scene with Noel Purcell as the old seaman Paddy who drank too much saw or heard apparitions and died of fright in a cave. I always kept track of Noel's career even decades later due to my seeing him then. There's also a youngish Cyril Cusack as the leering boatman James with designs on the lovely Jean Simmons shown as Emmeline grown up.Would very much like to own a video of this haunting film and refresh my memory of it. Where do I send my request?".

All I could see was two kids on a small row boat one of them was obviously female and not wearing a shirt. The other was a male with very curly hair. The commercial break came and they announced the name of the movie The Blue Lagoon. I had never heard of this movie before. Knowing I had a 7 am meeting the next morning didn't stop me from staying up until 330 in the morning to watch the movie. Weather it was the interest to see nudity or the wanting to know what was going to happen to these two individuals the story sparked my interest to watch it. The next day after work I went online to the Internet Movie Database and looked up the movie. Finding out more and more made me want to buy the movie. In reading the comments from other patrons I found out there was no movie available. Now I am on the verge of sending a letter to the Movie company and asking for the release of the original The Blue Lagoon of 1949. Whose with me??? P.S. Sorry I didn't tape the edited version on TV I didn't know how good the movie was".

I've seen it again recently and it is pretty cheesy. But the fun kind of cheesy.I was really curious about the original source for the movie because I read that it was originally based on a book written at the turn of the 20th century. So I went to amazon and lo and behold you can actually download the book for 2.99. It's funny to read it on the computer because at one point the author talks about Emmeline holding a package about the same size as the book you are holding now.The characters of the book are much more subdued and introspective than the 80s characters. There was one lovely section of the book where Emmeline is wanting to go back to the other side of the island. She has been scared of it since they found Paddy dead but she decides she wants to return because she's not afraid anymore. She had a child and now knows that death may be a void but life comes out of that void as well.I don't know how the 40s movie ends but the 80s movie ends exactly how the book does. I don't think it is necessarily a happy ending. The sailor says they're sleeping but Paddy says those were the neverwakeup berries and you've got to wonder if this time he was right. Also in the book the Uncle starts to have the some doubt about whether rescuing the children from paradise is something that is necessarily good for them.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of my favorite ballads is of British origin and it's If You Were The Only Girl In The World. It became popular in the Twenties right around the time that the silent British cinema came out with the first version of The Blue Lagoon. I didn't even know there was one until researching it only today. The song certainly could have served as a theme for all the versions.I can only compare this version to the one done by Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins that came out in 1980. That one of course had the full frontal nudity and the accompanying scandal something that the high minded J. Arthur Rank would never have put into one of his films. Still Jean Simmons and Donald Houston are something to look at.This is another of those universal stories that everyone knows a boy and girl shipwrecked at sea at the ages of 10 and 9 and stay for ten years on a desert island. At first one of the sailors from the boat they were on Noel Purcell is shipwrecked with them. He apparently teaches them enough to survive because he dies and the kids have to fend for themselves. And as these are Edwardian era English kids they aren't exactly schooled in the facts of life. Never mind with her the only girl and him the only boy they figure it out. Besides the sensationalism the main difference between this and the AtkinsShields version is that Simmons and Houston are thoroughly British and Chris and Brooke cannot be mistaken for anything but Americans. Still the sexual tension is there as we know the first time we see them as adults. We know but they have to figure it out.This version is dated in time because when they do get their first visitors in a pair of cutthroats played by James Hayter and Cyril Cusack they are identified as coming in the summer of 1914. Life does play funny tricks because soon enough there would be any number of British boys and girls who would love to be playing house in the south seas as opposed to being in the trenches in France and hearing bad news about a loved one there. And in researching The Blue Lagoon I learned there is yet another version coming out soon. Maybe that might give impetus to some film preservers to go to work on this one. It's a good film but the color is pretty washed out and it needs a visit to the film labs.".

I mean granted in some scenes Micheal does show that he cares about emmeline where she is nearly taken away by the men and when a big storm strikes the island. And with emmeline it's the same. What I also find annoying is The baby's relationship with his father. When he is born Micheal is happy and weirdly laughing  I was a bit wierdes out by it  But when he grows up to be a toddler. Micheal rarely shows love for him mostly talking about how the kids miserable and how he sounds mad when he says how having him it was confusing.Okay further all the movies good but the relationship between the main leads and the child eh.".

The addition of a couple of thieves before the end made this a little more exciting. The Shields version had some funny scenes concerning preferences in certain kinds of people one wants to socialize with but this one seems a little more serious about what to do when going back to civilization.

Jean and her costar Donald Houston were practically clad in loincloths the entire movie and the actor and actress who played them as children were actually topless during their island scenes.In case you don't know the story two children and a deckhand survive a shipwreck in a tiny lifeboat. They find an uninhabited island and while they don't give up hope of being rescued they settle in and make a home. As the years pass and the children's hormones kick in nature takes over and they start to notice each other.It's the proverbial fantasy stranded on a desert island with the love of your life but The Blue Lagoon is actually a pretty sad story. They were children when they were stranded and it wasn't by choice. They miss their families and long for contact with the outside world. They have no idea where they are and have very little hope of being found and rescued.Although it was very nasty for its time and although it shows a completely different performance from Jean Simmons I don't really recommend this one. The remake is just as sad if not more so but with a lot more nudity and sex so I can't really recommend that one either.DLM warning If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells there are some scenes in this movie that won't be your friend. The camera bobs about during the boat and canoe scenes and it might make you sick. In other words Don't Look Mom!".

My favorite is the worst staged bar fight of all time. Where were the MST3K guys on this one it would have been perfect for skewering. Oh well my friends and I did it ourselves.

My favorite is the worst staged bar fight of all time. Where were the MST3K guys on this one it would have been perfect for skewering. Oh well my friends and I did it ourselves. A worse movie...I don't recall.";

	schema:reviewBody "Die blutigen Geier von Alaska and this film has a handful other German and English titles is another West German  Yugoslavian coproduction directed by Harald Reinl and according to IMDb the language is German but I am sure several actors in here got dubbed especially lead actor Doug McClure. This movie is from 1973 so already fairly late compared to the Winnetou films by Reinl and the wave of Germans loving these European westerns may have considerably decreased by then already. Anyway this one is easily over 40 years old and I believe it has not aged well at all sadly. On a more positive note I must say that Doug McClure certainly looks the part for a western film character and his acting is also better than the acting of most of the supporting players. This film has a handful fairly famous actors in the list such as Harald Leipnitz Klaus Lwitsch and last but not least Roberto Blanco. His inclusion feels really random though. I guess with his character and portrayal they wanted to give this film a bit of a tone like the really appreciated Bud Spencer rip films from the same time. Very bizarre though. He adds nothing to the film at all and it would not have been a better or worse movie without him. All in all they tried their everything to deliver in terms of drama and emotion but most of the characters and the plot too were just so poorly written that it is not working out. I would not call the film a failure but these slightly over 90 minutes also weren't a good watch. A big part of the cast is also Yugoslavian and these names don't ring a bell for me at all so I cannot say anything about these actors. Overall you have to be a huge western film buff in order to see positive in here. I do not recommend the watch. Thumbs down.".

	schema:reviewBody "In Rome as the title suggests a spate of home invasionsrobberies are taking place carried out by some hardarse criminals. Following the most recent robbery these fellows are spotted and chased by the plod including young cop Vanni Massimo Vanni who shortly receives a bullet to the chest. Luckily he had a picture of his wife and kid with him so his boss Marcel Bofuzzi can stare at it and vow revenge. Meanwhile rich guy Anthony Steffen has just bought his daughter an eighteenth birthday watch but isn't doing so well bonding with his son Giorgio who has moved out and hates his dad for some reason. Once we've established all that it's time for Steffen's daughter to get gunned down during a party by a group of masked robbers. Steffen vows revenge but is sceptical of the police as they seem to be heading down the wrong road when it comes to the culprits. Basically there's two gangs of robbers Your usual runofthemill rough crowd and a gang of spoilt upstart kids who are killing for kicks.

Steffen of course becomes a guntoting vigilante eventually but things don't work out as straightfoward as that eh?The best bit for me and what gave me an idea that director Girolami wasn't that bothered about the final product was when somehow Massimo Vanno was magically resurrected to take part in an action sequence set at a robbery at a train station. Either they filmed that as the intro to the film and decided to go with the first home robbery or they just stuck that in there and hoped no one would notice.

Following the most recent robbery these fellows are spotted and chased by the plod including young cop Vanni Massimo Vanni who shortly receives a bullet to the chest. Luckily he had a picture of his wife and kid with him so his boss Marcel Bofuzzi can stare at it and vow revenge. Meanwhile rich guy Anthony Steffen has just bought his daughter an eighteenth birthday watch but isn't doing so well bonding with his son Giorgio who has moved out and hates his dad for some reason. Once we've established all that it's time for Steffen's daughter to get gunned down during a party by a group of masked robbers. Steffen vows revenge but is sceptical of the police as they seem to be heading down the wrong road when it comes to the culprits. Basically there's two gangs of robbers Your usual runofthemill rough crowd and a gang of spoilt upstart kids who are killing for kicks. It's the latter Steffen tries his hardest to bring down but these smug b'stards have rich fathers with lawyers out to cover everything up while they rape beat and shoot their way through Rome.

What I like a lot about her casting here is that she looks quite a bit like Marilyn Monroe but is as different internally as anyone can possibly be  which a lot of the world was doing at this time being bad Marilyn Monroe wannabees. I love that the platinum hair makes her look much more harsh older and very false and that is of course the essence of the character. And this film is mainly a character study with little story and little explanation.Our leading man is the young naive everyman sucked into her world in all respects. We feel for his every bad decision and this is a true and real representation of both the allure and the tawdriness of the gambling world. Without giving anything away the ending feels contrived but in this time period films wanted endings... today a truer ending would just go on spinning like the roulette wheel. Michel Legrand's score is great. Like many of Demy's films this is a dark story of the current day told with musicality and attention to the games we play with ourselves.".

It's a movie that sweeps you along just as fast and unpredictable as a spin on the roulette wheel. This is a film in which blackandwhite becomes a dazzling metaphor so that the sundrenched exteriors of the south of France are contrasted with the various interiors of hotel rooms and casinos.

	schema:headline " some interesting direction and Jeanne Moreau but nothing very special";
	schema:reviewBody "First a note of interest Jeanne Moreau is in the movie and she's the star of course but she's also a blonde here. Usually from what I can remember from say The Lovers or La Notte or Jules  Jim it's dark or at least brunette. I wonder if she was already blonde at the time or if it was a deliberate and specific choice on director Jacques Demy's end. Because somehow it does add something extra to the character. When we first see her on screen she's being 'escorted' kind word for kicked out of a casino that Jean and Caron are at to start gambling and it's a big scene where we see her arguing and stomping her feet and we barely see her face just a fury of big blonde hair and attitude to match. It's not exactly the same cool presence one saw in some of Moreau's other big films of the period  and yet when we see her again she is lovely and with that face that charms immediately upon the smile and makes one feel the gloom of after hours when looking serious.Bay of Angels is a movie that works best when Demy focuses his theme on escapism what would appear to be at first a film for escapists about people going off to rich places like Monte Carlo and gambling away the life savings and having a great time in expensive suits and drinking champagne. But it's also about the nature of this escapism the danger of it. It's predictable to see that Jean who comes from a family where gambling is incredibly frowned upon and Jackie who at one point confesses that going into a casino is like going into Church will lose a lot of money maybe all of it and keep going in dire straits throughout. What isn't expected is how Demy interweaves this seemingly endless back and forth of the bottomless pit that is a gambler's life if only seeming like a lifetime in however few days JeanJackie are together and how touching it becomes against the backdrop of glamour. At the least his film is about something.The only problems come with a few scenes in the script that drag  the dialog often works but sometimes not quite enough to satisfy the emotional purpose of a scene. Maybe also contributing to this is first time actor Claude Mann as Jean. Mann would later be featured in Melville's Army of Shadows among other notable films but here he just can't hold his own most of the time alongside such a presence like Moreau. It was wise to cast someone young and maybe not with the most experience as this kid who goes on vacation from a small bankclerk job to try and find himself by way of throwing away hundreds of thousands albeit I pictured moreso as the film went on the actor who played the lead in Pickpocket. But Mann just doesn't really fit in especially when he has to go into big dramatic scenes i.e. the outbursts of anger against Jackie in the hotel rooms.And yet Bay of Angels displays a director with an intuition with the camera a grace and style and a dazzling sense of music precisely repetitive over the shots of the roulette table spinning around and the faces dissolving in and out with it. There are beautiful moments and it's hard not to take eyes ever off of Moreau one of those actresses who keeps working today into her late 70s going on 80s but whom one thinks of in black and white only. She hadhas one of the great faces in movies and she's a damn good actress to boot. 7.510".

With his winnings he's able to go on a vacation to the Riviera. There he meets a pathetic woman Jeanne Moreau who has abandoned her family in order to gamble. The two hook up have sex and gamble again and again and again. As long as they are winning they are in love. But winning like their love is shallow and fleeting. And by the end you just want them to go away....This really is all that there is to the film. The majority of the film shows them gambling. And I couldn't care less about gambling I couldn't care less about these unappealing characters. It really became a chore to watch after a while and although reasonably well acted and crafted it's not particularly enjoyable or enlightening. I didn't need to see this film to know that gambling addicts are pathetic.By the way the theme music from this film is godawful. Too intense and too invasive and doesn't at all fit the film.".

I remember though most clearly on of the lines from the movie which really stood out and was hilarious and is still everytime I think about it. Alex Baldwin is getting beaten up and thrown round a room by this hotshot rich guy who he really does not like and he gets thrown into a cupboard totally destroying the room and he is busy of all things handing out insults to his aggressor. The best of which is that suit...it looks like the lining to a better suit".

It is not surprising in our cretinous era that some would lament the unavailability of computer generated special effects in 1964. That they persist in doing so however only serves to illustrate how very far these modernists are in both sensibility and aesthetic principles from the 19th century Gothic tradition that this film so faithfully seeks to reproduce. The point isn't the snakes but the psychological force behind the baleful facial expression!In this connection it is appropriate to observe that Terence Fisher was absolutely right in considering this one of his best films.And make no mistake this film is very much in the 19th century Gothic tradition in both story and atmosphere. In that sense it may be compared to a story by Ludwig Tieck while its visuals hearken back to the paintings of Jacob van Ruisdael.Visually it is among Hammer's most accomplished productions. Michael Reed's effective photographic renderings include a nocturnal cemetery festooned with fluttering autumnal leaves the viscerally chilly fog and frost bitten ravine you can almost watch your own breath smoke in merely watching it where a hanged man is discovered the vast shadowed Castle Borski depicted under a full moon with scudding clouds to name but a few.And Mr. Reed is ably abetted by production designer Bernard Robinson whose key piece in this film the deserted inside of the selfsame Castle Borski is a marvel of tattered armorial flags dust laden furniture and sinister mirrors. The musical score is also one of Hammer's best and most effectively understated.But the film belongs to the incomparably lovely Barbara Shelley's Carla Hoffmanshe of the sweeping pelisse seated on a gilded throne in the deserted castle. It is to be hoped that someday this accomplished beauty will receive all the retrospective attention surely due her. For now suffice it to say that few actresses in the history of cinema have constructed a portrayal so wholly and precariously based on an enigma an enigma Miss Shelley consistently reveals in every gesture expression and nuance without allowing her character Carla the possibility of even understanding it herself.It isn't merely that her Carla is fatally charming and alluring but decent and humanitarian as well a victim to be sure but not at all in the degraded naturalistic way that Jean Seberg's portrayal is in Lilith a film to which The Gorgon is frequently compared.Much can always be found to admire in anything Miss Shelley does. For now let us just close with a passing note on her deportment the absolute self control she exercises in her throaty perfectly modulated voice and carriage. Would that actresses today would study her technique !!!!!!!!!!!Watch her in her first confrontation scene with Peter Cushing in his parlor where she accuses him of stonewalling during the inquest just prior to the entrance of Paul's fatherProfessor Heinz. Merely observing her majestically exit the room after being introduced to the Professor is worth the whole price of admission!".

Cheaply made the film has no doubt turned some to stonecold hysterics with its campy effects and home movielike makeup of the creature. While the story has wonderful elements of mystery and lure it never reveals certain motivations. For example why has the Gorgon's spirit returned to earth? What is the Cushing character's intentions? Many of the story's characters know the myth behind the murders how many variations are there to a creature turning a man to stone with her gaze? so controlling the creature was no revelation. But all that aside the film's theme is captivating. If you don't expect a monster movie but view this film as a mystery based on folklore and with a haunting backdrop you too will be delighted with this hidden gem. There is a scene in castle when Mageara first appears and we catch glimpses of her peeking out at a prospective victim. It's a tantalizing prelude to the terror to come. But the scene that had me mesmerized  and that singularly crystalizes the Gorgon's chilling presence is when she has turned a character with her demonic stare then seemingly drifts back into the shadows. It is a strangely beautiful scene. The Gorgon called the Mageara is a true mystery. She has no emotion no true motivation and she is not shown stalking her prey. Like a black widow in human form she merely waits for perhaps even lures innocent souls to come to her parlor. Mageara seemingly in incapable of harming man except for her petrifying gaze she quietly floats about the castle. If I were to remake this film I would tell the story from the perspective of the female host and the struggle to understand her curse.  There is sheer tragedy in what Hammer has presented and I find myself looking upon many of the story's characters with sense of sadness and doom. Finally I want to say that I wish the stone victims could have turned quickly like those poor souls in the film Thief of Baghdad with Steve Reeves. Oh well just a last thought.".

	schema:headline " A world turning to stone";
	schema:reviewBody "The crucial clue to understanding the work of director Terence Fisher is to note that his directing hero was not one of the 'usual suspects' for a horror director like Lang or Hitchcock but Frank Borzage the 30's director of tender fragile romances like 'Moonrise' and 'A Farewell To Arms'. And as he grew more confident and independent in his work for Hammer films Fisher's most personal work smuggled Borzagian romance past his producers in horror guise. Forget the usual critical cliche about his work that it presents rigidly defined blackandwhite battles between Good and Evil.This only applies to a handful of his pictures usually from the earlier part of his Hammer career. In Fisher's mature work the lines between good and evil are often more ambiguous than in many of the more modernist horrors that came after him e.g.'The Exorcist' and 'Halloween'. And his most heartfelt work  'Curse Of The Werewolf''Phantom Of The Opera''Frankenstein Created Woman'and the film discussed here is a sequence of tragic love stories. Which brings us to 'The Gorgon' one of the most romantic but also the bleakest of these love stories. All the key characters in the film are driven by the most desperate love the pregnant Sascha in the opening scenes Professor Heitz mourning and defending a lost son Carla and Paul in their foredoomed affair Namaroff oppressing Carla and torturing himself with the love she can never reciprocate Ratoffwho might at first seem a token thugworshipping Carla as devoutly as is master does even Christopher Lee's celibate Meister has a father's anxious protectiveness towards Paul. But in the bleak world which cameraman Michael Reed depicts throughout in grim blues and greys there is no reward for such devotion but the stony isolation of death. The film however is tragic rather than merely nihilistic for the characters are haunted throughout by the thought that their love might somehow win them a place in some better world somewhere else. This makes Carla's parting from Paul in the castle scene all the more poignant haven't we all known a moment such as she knows then when we face the fact that the door to salvation was open to us as recently as a couple of minutes ago but we looked away at the wrong moment and the breeze blew it shut? That's why this like all Fisher's best films is such a treasurable work. It's not about shock effects but about the beauty and sadness of being alive. It stands as the bleakest of all Gorgon myths bleaker by far than the Greek originals for it portrays a whole world whose fate is to turn to stone.".

	onyx:emotionText "The crucial clue to understanding the work of director Terence Fisher is to note that his directing hero was not one of the 'usual suspects' for a horror director like Lang or Hitchcock but Frank Borzage the 30's director of tender fragile romances like 'Moonrise' and 'A Farewell To Arms'. And as he grew more confident and independent in his work for Hammer films Fisher's most personal work smuggled Borzagian romance past his producers in horror guise. Forget the usual critical cliche about his work that it presents rigidly defined blackandwhite battles between Good and Evil.This only applies to a handful of his pictures usually from the earlier part of his Hammer career. In Fisher's mature work the lines between good and evil are often more ambiguous than in many of the more modernist horrors that came after him e.g.'The Exorcist' and 'Halloween'. And his most heartfelt work  'Curse Of The Werewolf''Phantom Of The Opera''Frankenstein Created Woman'and the film discussed here is a sequence of tragic love stories. Which brings us to 'The Gorgon' one of the most romantic but also the bleakest of these love stories. All the key characters in the film are driven by the most desperate love the pregnant Sascha in the opening scenes Professor Heitz mourning and defending a lost son Carla and Paul in their foredoomed affair Namaroff oppressing Carla and torturing himself with the love she can never reciprocate Ratoffwho might at first seem a token thugworshipping Carla as devoutly as is master does even Christopher Lee's celibate Meister has a father's anxious protectiveness towards Paul. But in the bleak world which cameraman Michael Reed depicts throughout in grim blues and greys there is no reward for such devotion but the stony isolation of death. The film however is tragic rather than merely nihilistic for the characters are haunted throughout by the thought that their love might somehow win them a place in some better world somewhere else. This makes Carla's parting from Paul in the castle scene all the more poignant haven't we all known a moment such as she knows then when we face the fact that the door to salvation was open to us as recently as a couple of minutes ago but we looked away at the wrong moment and the breeze blew it shut? That's why this like all Fisher's best films is such a treasurable work. It's not about shock effects but about the beauty and sadness of being alive. It stands as the bleakest of all Gorgon myths bleaker by far than the Greek originals for it portrays a whole world whose fate is to turn to stone.";

Still most of the Hammer stalwarts above all director Fisher and composer James Bernard are in good form  however the two stars only interact in one brief scene and Roy Ashtons makeup isnt exactly great which Fisher astutely generally films from a distance and in fact we only get to see her full figure at the very end.Needless to say Id love to see this receive an official DVD release  along with my two mostdesired ColumbiaHammer properties namely TASTE OF FEAR 1961 and THE DAMNED 1963.".

The encounter by moonlight in the graveyard between Richard Pasco and Barbara Shelley.The Gorgon is certainly one of Hammer's most pessimistic entries.  The setting is turnofthecentury Middle Europe and the productiondesign more Teutonic than ever Hammer ever economical transposed the monster of Greek classical myth to their familiar Germanic milieu.  When we join the story the village of Vandorf has been under Magaera's baleful spell for seven years.  Much of the action takes place in a repressive asylum.  And Castle Borski is not the richly appointed seat of other Hammer films but a broken windswept ruin.Characterisation is equally unrelenting.  Cushing's Dr Namaroff is a more ruthless and maniacal variation of Van Helsing.  Lee's  Professor Meister  though gruffly benevolent is overbearingly fatalistic.  Meanwhile the most sympathetic characters  Carla Paul his father and brother  are all killed.OK inevitably the Gorgon's makeup is weak though it scared me when I first saw it at age 11.  The sickly green palor and spidery wrinkles are good but the snakehair just looks like she washed it the night before and couldn't do a thing with it.  Halfglimpsed her first appearance is remarkably effective though.  Her graceful tiptoe from behind the cobwebs in ghastly counterpoint to what we know will be her terrible visage.  A sudden shock closeup and she disappears  almost glides  back into the shadows in long shot a sequence as well done as anything Fisher has ever constructed.  Alas audience expectation something Hammer usually deferred to demanded a fullfacial exposure at the end.The temptation would be to say  that The Gorgon might have worked better in black and white  but that would be to deny Michael Reed's disciplined use of colour.  Perhaps only today's enhanced computergraphics could properly pull off the effect required.That flaw apart The Gorgon survives as an early Hammer classic that can stand alongside Dracula Brides of Dracula and The Hound of the Baskervilles.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have to say that I'm really surprised that The Gorgon isn't one of the better known Hammer Horror films. Aside from the fact that it stars Hammer's two biggest actors  Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing  The Gorgon also features a fairly original cinematic monster and it makes for a great fun watch! This film reminded me a lot of The Reptile in the way it plays out in that it focuses on a mystery surrounding the central monster. It has to be said that like a lot of Hammer Horror films the plot is very simplistic but that's hardly a problem as there's plenty to enjoy outside of the plot in this film. As the title suggests the film focuses on a mysterious 'Gorgon' a woman with a head full of snakes that can turn people to stone just by looking at them. She's creating quite a problem for the local village as citizens begin turning up dead  but unlike most dead people they've turned to stone! The authorities try to cover it up but as the murders continue the son of one of the victims decides to investigate.The film is very typical of Hammer in that it features a lush colour scheme and a lot of eerily Gothic settings. The Gorgon is directed by Hammer's most prolific director Terence Fisher and as usual  he does a solid job. The fact that this film stars both Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee is definitely to its advantage although it is unfortunate as is the case with many of their joint ventures that they don't get to spend a lot of screen time together. Neither one is at their very best but even Lee and Cushing on autopilot makes for great viewing and neither one disappoints. It has to be said that the special effects are a bit shoddy and the monster doesn't look particularly scary but stuff like that is part of the charm of Hammer Horror and personally  I wouldn't have it any other way! It all boils down to a pretty standard conclusion but while nothing about this film stands out too much next the rest of Hammer's output  it still stands up as a more than decent little horror film and I'm certain that my fellow Hammer fanatics wont be disappointed with it!".

Unfortunately he ends up turned to stone as well so it's up to Paul Heitz Richard Pasco to find the truth behind his father's  brother's deaths  the local villagers don't seem to want to cooperate...This British production was directed by Terrence Fisher  I didn't think The Gorgon was one of Hammer's best by any stretch of the imagination. The script by John Gilling takes it central idea from Greek mythology  plays around with it a bit to accommodate Hammer's particular forte the Victorian set Gothic style horror mystery. I personally found the story a bit silly even sillier than the average Hammer offering  it is one of the most predictable 'mysteries' I've seen as the identity of the Gorgon is utterly obvious. At only 80 odd minutes it moves along at a fair pace I wouldn't say it's boring but at the same time I can't say that I really got into it the story just didn't engage me or draw me in with forgettable character's dull dialogue  the baffling decision not to have stars Cushing or Lee meet until the final 10 minutes  only then very briefly.Director Fisher does alright  despite some obviously studio bound European exterior locations it looks nice enough with a strong colour scheme forget about any style though as this is pretty much point  shoot stuff. I wouldn't call The Gorgon scary either there's a reasonable atmosphere but not as strong as other notable Hammer productions of the period like The Curse of Frankenstein 1957. The Gorgon creature itself looks terrible with awful face paint  a poor fitting wig with rubber snakes as Christopher Lee once supposedly said 'the only thing wrong with 'The Gorgon' is the gorgon!'  I'm struggling to disagree.Technically the film is OK it's well made but some of those sets really do look incredibly fake as usual for Hammer at the time it was shot at Bray Studios in Berkshire in England which is probably why it never convinced me for a second that the film was set in Europe. The acting is OK but as already mentioned Cushing  Lee only meet at the very end  Lee is only seen once during the first 50 minutes which just seems like a waste to me. Soon to be the second Doctor in Doctor Who 1963  1989 Patrick Troughton turns up as a copper with a silly helmet.The Gorgon is an OK time waster the Gorgon itself is barely in it  when it is it looks terrible Cushing  Lee are somewhat wasted  overall I just didn't think it was anything special  it's as simple  straight forward as that.".

	schema:reviewBody "Overshadowing the village of Vandorf stands the Castle Borski. From the turn of the century a monster from an ancient age of history came to live here. No living thing survived and the spectre of death hovered in waiting for her next victim.Directed by Terence Fisher for Hammer Film Productions The Gorgon stars Peter Cushing Christopher Lee Barbara Shelley and Richard Pasco. Photography is by Michael Reed the design courtesy of Bernard Robinson and the unique score is by James Bernard he blended Soprano with a Novachord. Very much a bit off kilter in terms of classical Hammer Horror The Gorgon sees Hammer turn to Greek Mythology for its latest instalment.The key issue here is that The Gorgon should be viewed more as a doomed love story featuring a legendary horror character. To call this a horror film is just wrong and marketing it a such has done the film few favours over the years. Fisher always thought of The Gorgon as one of his best film's and he was right to do so for it's a hauntingly beautiful piece of work that is also one of Hammer's most visually accomplished efforts. Yes the effects of the Gorgon herself come the finale are low budgeted naffness to which if it had been possible to never show close ups of her the film would have been greater. More so because all the prior long distance shots of her have gained maximum chill factor. A floaty green demon accompanied by eerie music effectively shot in dreamy Technicolor by Michael Reed. But cest la vie the story is such we have to have these close ups so lets just embrace this minor itch for existing in a time before CGI and applaud its adherence to the Gothic tradition that the film faithfully captures.Tho featuring the big Hammer Horror hitters Cushing  Lee it's Barbara Shelley who really takes the honours. Her Carla Hoffman is the axis of the movie an emotionally conflicted character beautiful yet sorrowful she gets an indepth makeover from Shelley. Further lifting the film above the average jibes bestowed on it by cruel and unfair critics. Patrick Troughton also lends some good support as Inspector Kanof wonderfully attired in Rosemary Burrows' Gothic European costumes. There's no bad performances in truth all the cast are delivering good work to do justice to the material. There is no if you pardon the pun ham in this Hammer Horror.A wonderfully told story is given a smart technical work over within the budget restrictions. Forget any hopes of a blood laden movie for this is not the one. But if you yearn for Gothic atmosphere or prefer a hauntingly told tale then this is for you. 710".

No living thing survived and the spectre of death hovered in waiting for her next victim.Directed by Terence Fisher for Hammer Film Productions The Gorgon stars Peter Cushing Christopher Lee Barbara Shelley and Richard Pasco. Photography is by Michael Reed the design courtesy of Bernard Robinson and the unique score is by James Bernard he blended Soprano with a Novachord. Very much a bit off kilter in terms of classical Hammer Horror The Gorgon sees Hammer turn to Greek Mythology for its latest instalment.The key issue here is that The Gorgon should be viewed more as a doomed love story featuring a legendary horror character. To call this a horror film is just wrong and marketing it a such has done the film few favours over the years. Fisher always thought of The Gorgon as one of his best film's and he was right to do so for it's a hauntingly beautiful piece of work that is also one of Hammer's most visually accomplished efforts. Yes the effects of the Gorgon herself come the finale are low budgeted naffness to which if it had been possible to never show close ups of her the film would have been greater. More so because all the prior long distance shots of her have gained maximum chill factor. A floaty green demon accompanied by eerie music effectively shot in dreamy Technicolor by Michael Reed. But cest la vie the story is such we have to have these close ups so lets just embrace this minor itch for existing in a time before CGI and applaud its adherence to the Gothic tradition that the film faithfully captures.Tho featuring the big Hammer Horror hitters Cushing  Lee it's Barbara Shelley who really takes the honours. Her Carla Hoffman is the axis of the movie an emotionally conflicted character beautiful yet sorrowful she gets an indepth makeover from Shelley. Further lifting the film above the average jibes bestowed on it by cruel and unfair critics. Patrick Troughton also lends some good support as Inspector Kanof wonderfully attired in Rosemary Burrows' Gothic European costumes. There's no bad performances in truth all the cast are delivering good work to do justice to the material. There is no if you pardon the pun ham in this Hammer Horror.A wonderfully told story is given a smart technical work over within the budget restrictions. Forget any hopes of a blood laden movie for this is not the one. But if you yearn for Gothic atmosphere or prefer a hauntingly told tale then this is for you. 710";

	schema:reviewBody "This is an enjoyable rather forgotten movie from the Hammer studio's staring both Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee again.I particularly liked the atmosphere of the movie. Unlike many other Hammer movies this one actually got creepy which was mainly due to its mysterious build up and overall atmosphere. The first appearance of Megaera is a great horror moment and surprised me quite a bit at how greatly it was done.But no unfortunately the movie is a whole isn't among the best the Hammer studios ever provided. The actual story fails to become really interesting and the character treatment isn't the greatest. It took me a while into the movie to realize that Peter Cushing was going to be the 'bad' guy in this and Christoper Lee the good guy. Normally those roles are always turned around. Besides that Christopher Lee doesn't really get featured until the movie is already halve way through. His character after that also makes a redundant impression and the movie could had easily done without him. He's first billed but don't be fooled he really isn't the main character in this. It also isn't Christopher Lee's finest acting moment. At times he's just downward horrible. His silly looking makeup and wig also doesn't help much to make his character a good one. Peter Cushing also gets makeup applied. In some sequences he looks so much different than he did in real life! It also takes a while for the movie to introduce its real main character Paul Heitz.The story flow also isn't the greatest. The movie gets stuck at times when the mystery doesn't get explained and not enough is happening in the movie even though the actual story itself is in its core quite a good one that's filled with lots of potential that doesn't really get ever exploited in this movie.The movie obviously didn't cost a lot to made. Like I said before the makeup effects aren't the greatest but more distracting are the obvious fake backgrounds and sets. Nevertheless this has now of course become part of the charm of Hammer horror movies.Greatly enjoyable to watch for the Hammer fans.610httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

There is another problem and that is who is the Gorgon ? For much of the running time the audience are supposed to be on tenter hooks wondering whose body the Gorgon takes in human form . Unfortunately it's obvious from the start who it is which means the big shock revelation isn't really any kind of revelation never mind a shock big or otherwise . It's also obvious who is THE REPTILE but in that film I was still entertained probably because THE REPTILE succeeded in creating a brooding atmosphere  one that is lacking in this film and because of this THE GORGON should be classed as a failure".

Only when the arrogant and straightforward professor Karl Meister Lee arrives to help Paul with his investigation progress is made. The Gorgon benefices from the original choice for a monster as well as from the brisk performances and direction. The set pieces and filming locations are visually striking and deeply impressive most notably all the sequences that take place inside autumn gardens and nearby old castle ruins. My only complaints concern the lack of Grand Guignol the rather tacky makeup job on Prudence Hyman and the abrupt  disappointing climax.

The first is the pace is too slow to enjoy. The story goes along at at a snail's pace. This is especially so in the middle part. The second problem is the special effects and the makeup don't do the movie justice IMAO. By today's standards they are campy and fake but not intentionally. This could have been much more scary with a little better sfx. The whole ending was ruined by the bad effects of the gorgon head. But to give credit where it's due there a few good scary moments. Overall it's worth checking out if you're into 60s horror.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a Hammer film starring both Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. However unlike their Dracula or Frankenstein movies this one has a very very unconventional plot. Apparently one of the Medusae is still alive and living in Germany just before WWI. Now considering that these three characters were from Classical Greek mythology this is a tad farfetched to say the least!! Plus oddly they got the name wrong of the lady who was cursed with this sort of wereMedusa curse. Megaera was actually not one of the three Medusae but considering how weird the plot was this really didn't seem to matter! The film concerns several bizarre deaths in a small town. The victims were found petrified and oddly the police and locals seemed to want to have no investigation! This made no sense and it never really was explained in the film. Nor for that matter was it explained why Peter Cushing went to such great lengths to preserve this menace and excuse all the deaths. Hmmm....it looked a lot like no one bothered to worry about plot holes! Despite these serious plot problems this is still an exciting film if you can just turn off that pesky brain and enjoy the film on a very superficial level. The film has some very exciting moments and despite how cheesy the cast apparently felt about the Medusa special effect I thought it looked pretty good for 1964. Strange but also compelling and worth a look for horror fansand especially fans of Lee and Cushing.".

	schema:reviewBody "A key part of the atmosphere of the film is the brilliant orchestral score. It's almost a character in itself along side the set and set decoration. Perhaps if there was more writing and less repetition in the musical material but that is surely a budget problem I would like it even better. Superb just he same.I remember watching this film with my sister maybe 35 years ago and it really did give us chills up and down the spine. Still does. Great film. Although some have criticized the make up job on the Gorgon I think it's very effective. Very nice touch to see the reflection of the monster in the pool of water. I really like the snakes moving in the hair and I wait for that moment each time I see this movie.The weakest spot in the movie is the character that Peter Cushing plays. There doesn't really seem to be a compelling reason why he holds back so much information. His research into the Gorgon phenomena and his romantic interest in the female assistant who turns into the Gorgon is not developed enough. This character is a bit of a cypher despite Cushing great horror acting ability.It is a pessimistic and very sad movie since the male and female leads all die a fairly tortured death. It's one of the best of the Hammer movies no question. A one of a kind and comes from the heart.I have named the sets to the Hammer movies Hammer Hotel since the same set seems to appear in different guises quite a few times. I believe the castle in Gorgon is the same castle as in The Horror of Dracula. Great set none the less.One of the Hammer horror films goofs I have noticed is where you can see the set number listed on the riser. The camera shot too low. Funny. It may be from the Gorgon or the Reptile. I think it's the Gorgon.Doug Toronto".

Of course any film of this sort that stars both Sir Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing is automatically worthy of some interest. It's also fun to see any film featuring the Gorgon character from Greek mythology. As directed by Hammer stalwart Terence Fisher this doesn't really work as a mystery but all of the expected trappings do make this easy enough to watch. Perhaps the greatest asset to the tale is the overwhelming sense of tragedy to all of it.The setting is the European village of Vandorf in the early 20th century. The Gorgon Megaera has supposedly taken up residence in a nearby castle and people periodically turn up dead turned to stone as we are told was the fate of any person who looked a Gorgon in the face. Headstrong Paul Heitz Richard Pasco learns of the bad ends that befell his brother and father and determines to solve the mystery he is eventually joined by his colleague Professor Karl Meister Lee. They believe that the cagey Dr. Namaroff Cushing holds the key to all of it.It's a treat to see the usually heroic Cushing play a much more dubious character than usual and to see the often villainous Sir Christopher in a good guy part. They don't share any screen time until 71 minutes into the film but the resulting scene is riveting as they square off. The other performances are all excellent Pasco as Paul who falls in love with Carla Barbara Shelly the gorgeous assistant to Namaroff Michael Goodliffe as Pauls' father Patrick Troughton as the officious Inspector Kanof and Jack Watson as thuggish orderly Ratoff. Prudence Hyman dons the makeup as the monstrous form of the Gorgon whose visage may come as a disappointment to some viewers.Technically well made overall with a great score by frequent Hammer composer James Bernard The Gorgon does have protagonists worth rooting for and a fairly formidable monster.Seven out of 10.".

To the scientist's frustration the residents turn to stone before he can properly record his experiments. Instead of the Nobel Award for medicine late one stormy night he receives a lethal injection at a state prison while screaming that his intentions were misunderstood. When financing fell through the producers kept the cast and the plaster statues of men and women and hurriedly rewrote the screenplay to appeal to a wider audience. Now deep in Transylvania in the village of Vandorf near the forbidding Castle Borski villagers still turn to stone. The instruments of terror however are not a large jar of calcium tablets and a funnel but the hideous Magera the dreaded gorgon with hair like writhing snakes and a gaze that can petrify those unwise enough to look upon her. When Professor Jules Heitz's son an artist staying in the village is found hanging from a tree branch the professor arrives to clear the boy's name. His son had been accused of killing a village lass whose autopsy was made difficult because...well she'd hardened. It's not long before Professor Heitz is hardened too but not before he'd sent a telegram to Professor Karl Meister Christopher Lee at Leipzig University asking for help. Soon Professor Heitz's remaining son Paul is in Vandorf. All does not go well. When at last Meister himself arrives and meets the intense and obviously conflicted Dr. Namaroff Peter Cushing we know secrets will be discovered and terror faced with courage. Science will learn there's more to life than we can imagine...in heaven or in hell. The Gorgon is filled with lush color creepy sets and the kind of straightfaced acting that so many fine British actors with precise enunciation can bring to nonsense. Among the great enunciators in this movie in addition to Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee is Barbara Shelley who plays Carla Hoffman Dr. Namaroff's assistant. Carla like the actress who portrays her is tall cultured and elegant. The more we see of Carla and Dr. Namaroff the more we realize there is a complex relationship trying to move beyond the confines of Transylvanian science At last Professor Meister ventures into the stone hulk of Castle Borski. He will encounter what legends say is true... the hideous secret of the woman whose hair hisses. As corny mannered and predictable as most of the Hammer horror movies are including The Gorgon it's got to be said that they're great fun. They're almost like watching a Kabuki performance with all of the deadly serious line delivery richly detailed costumes predictable and satisfying outcomes and stylized set pieces. The only thing lacking is quality. But while you might not get many smiles from most Kabuki plays you will from most Hammer horror movies.".

The music is one of my favourite things about any movie and Turkish films in my opinion are always very good at this. The same score is played in this film whether the scene is happy or sad but played slower and quicker with different instruments is a very effective way to touch the audience.

There's nothing new about the characters the same basic ones that appear in films from most any culture. Think The Dead End Kids in the 70's. In the US Welcome Back Kotter leaps to mind. Unfortunately time has not been kind to this film. The production values are pretty well dated the soundtrack is off splicing is a bit abrupt. If you don't know who the actors are and how famous it is then you're missing 75 of the film. The film is about a group of students who have repeatedly failed their classes at a boarding school. There is the usual mother figure at the school and the strict disciplinarian who tried to install respect and dignity to the kids. The actors appearing in the film are among the most famous in Turkey but that doesn't do anything for the rest of the world unfortunately. The jokes also don't translate as many of them are wordplays on Turkish words and phrases. But for Turks it is one of the most beloved films from the classic 70's Yesilcam Sinemasi period. Watch it with an open mind and for sociological interest. You'll see nothing that you haven't seen in your own country in 100 different films but it's a insight into what Turks enjoy in their cinema. By the way Arsenal1988 there are just over 75 million people in Turkey not over 100 million.".

The actors appearing in the film are among the most famous in Turkey but that doesn't do anything for the rest of the world unfortunately. The jokes also don't translate as many of them are wordplays on Turkish words and phrases. But for Turks it is one of the most beloved films from the classic 70's Yesilcam Sinemasi period. Watch it with an open mind and for sociological interest. You'll see nothing that you haven't seen in your own country in 100 different films but it's a insight into what Turks enjoy in their cinema. By the way Arsenal1988 there are just over 75 million people in Turkey not over 100 million.";

The people who produced this movie probably wanted to save the day and had no idea that it would be one of the best Turkish comedy movies. I think what makes it unforgettable is not about its having a complicated or mind blowing story but rather its simplicity. When you watch it you find it having a simple story and jokes that even 56 year old kids can enjoy. Even though the movie industry has widely grown up in the recent years no movie has even come close to challenge Hababam Sinifi.".

However this release was a total disappointment for me. It had the comedy and the lovable characters but the storyline was extremely poor and out of portion. It seemed the filmmakers were using ideas from various foreign films which lost the audience. The audience is not stupid they know what is from what and when the plot does not link up. This movie lost the whole theme of the chaotic class which gave their teachers hell but managed to win their hearts in the end. I laughed a lot but i left the cinema feeling extremely annoyed. If they make another release i hope they devote more time into the storyline and the values of the concept. 510 for the comedy and characters like Bebe Ruhi and Psiko.".

	schema:headline " Familiar Material With a Nationalistic Twist";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the modern reboots of a classic series based on the novel by Rfat Ilgaz that first appeared in the late Seventies. The material will seem extremely familiar to nonTurkish viewers with strong echoes of chaotic classroom comedies such as the ST. TRINIANS saga and British blackandwhite National Service satires such as ORDERS ARE ORDERS 1954 and most notably CARRY ON SERGEANT 1958.The comedy opens with Bedri the Lunatic Mehmet Ali Erbil being outwitted once again by his anarchic group of mature learners. He has acid placed on his head teacher's chair that burns through his pants and leaves his bottom bare. He walks out of school to a chorus of laughter. In revenge he decides to send the whole class on National Service even though technically they should have left school before they are eligible for this.There follows a series of gags based on the familiar theme of the incompetent squaddies bossed about by their sergeant Erbil again. The chief comic conceit is that the learners think the sergeant is actually Bedri the Lunatic in disguise and cannot take him seriously. They only learn to do so when Bedri unexpectedly turns up at the barracks claiming that he has missed his class too much.The comedy is quite oldfashioned with several gags based around the squaddies ogling their female counterparts in a fashion reminiscent of Benny Hill. There is also a battleofthesexes theme as the sergeant resents the presence of female squaddies in the barracks under the command of Major Zehra Hlya Avar. His antediluvian prejudices are soon put to shame however as the girls outwit the boys in a night exercise.HABABAM SINIFI ASKERLK is nonetheless interesting if only for its underlying nationalist preoccupations. We see several shots of the Turkish flag in the background as well as the portrait of Mustafa Kemal Atatrk. Right at the end a soldier is seen in medium close up giving the kind of cheerleading speech that would encourage soldiers to fight in their country's cause and thereby fulfill Atatrk's vision of a great nation.The film ends with a surprise twist but this does not undermine its underlying emphasis on the importance of everyone forming a community so as to ensure their future irrespective of gender differences.".

The shipwreck scenes in the beginning of the film are not only great for 1958 they're great by today's standards too. I'd love to see a making of documentary. I'm so bored with the special effects making of docs of today. It's always that everything was first shot against a green screen and then come the interviews with the SPX guys telling you what they did and how hard it was to do. Yep we just programmed the computer and went for coffee while it rendered the action. Yeah really impressive. No computer here. This is the true essence of what used to be a CRAFT. Albeit scaled down everything you see here on the screen actually existed in real life and not in cyberspace. I don't know if anyone will ever read this or even care to compare but watch the similar ship scenes in the newer version of King Kong and then compare them to what was done here almost 50 years sooner. IMHO the scenes in the 2005 King Kong look more like a very realistic cartoon! Same thing with this years Flyboys. The dogfights had a lot of great camera angles and thrilling sequences but nowhere near as thrilling as done almost 80 years before for Wings. And besides that cartoon look clashes with the live action stuff. Yes NOT using a computer WOULD have made things harder for the Flyboys and Kong crews but if they're really any good they would have come up with better results! That's why the director of The Fugitive crashed a REAL train for the film rather than stoke up the computer chips. You really want real you have to have real in there someplace! I really think that the film industry has it backwards. Huge budget films should spend all that money on the harder to do but more satisfying hand crafted SFX and leave the computer generated junk for the low budget flicks.".

Finally he and Heston swim beneath the wreckage on the reefs in search of evidence... 'Wreck of the Mary Deare' is really Cooper's film... His performance is strong but is possessed of a fanatic determination that carries through and works... Heston's role that of the devil's advocate is well played although there is little to work with in terms of character... As opposed to Cooper who is out to redeem his name lost by the suspicious murder of the ship's original captain Heston's John Sands is a marvelous counterpart... All he is interested in is getting the salvage rights to shipping wrecks...

Now he continues I'm on the end of a rope. Do I have to beg you Mr. Sands?Heston says nothing and when Mr. Petrie the owners' investigator played by Alexander Knox starts asking questions all Heston will say is that the forward bulkhead went and the ship could not be saved...

Heston is uncomfortable having lied but Cooper insists that the ship's location be kept a secret until the court of inquiry has had a chance to examine the wreck... Cooper won't tell Heston why he asks this favor...Based on a novel by adventuremaster Hammond Innes 'The Wreck of the Mary Deare' is a good film curious star amalgam of sea saga action and courtroom melodrama originally intended for Hitchcock with fine suspense values good color photography and an able cast...Look for Richard Harris 19302002 who quickly earned a reputation as an interesting performer precisely in 'The Wreck of the Mary Deare' 'The Guns of Navarone' and 'Mutiny on the Bounty.'".

The story is largely told through movement of ships or of men moving around in the dark. I mention this to help any potential viewer.Cooper gives a compelling desperate performance that makes you really want to watch what happens to his character Capt. Patch. Also this is probably the most believable performance by Heston as an ordinary nonhistorical non scifi character. I was pleasantly surprised by both Cooper's and Heston's performances. Both performances are essentially very modernstyle screen acting and are not dated after these many years.The supporting roles are undeveloped and onedimensional including the role so forcefully played by the young Richard Harris. Its a shame the great Virginia McKenna is so underused here. She could have made the film appeal to a broaderbased audience. The other supporting actors Alexander Knox at his most wooden don't add to the film. Even if you don't like seafaring stories watch this for the acting by the two stars and for the marvelous night cinematography. Film students and buffs should look carefully at the night scenes inside the ship and on the docks. You will see true night cinema work with perfectly set light meters and minimalist lighting. In other words nighttime lighting and camera artistry not gimmicks.".

	schema:reviewBody "Gary Cooper and Charlton Heston star in The Wreck of the Mary Deare along with an incredible supporting cast including Richard Harris Michael Redgrave Alexander Knox and Emlyn Williams. The reason for such a cast? The original director was to be Alfred Hitchcock.Heston plays John Sands captain of a small rescue ship who finds the freighter Mary Deare drifting. The crew seems to have abandoned the ship but there's one person left the first officer Gideon Patch. What happened on board isn't certain but Patch begs Sands not to say anything about the ship until there is an official investigation and the ship is examined by an objective third party. Sands goes along though this means not telling anyone that ship hasn't sunk as people are led to believe but that it is on the Minquiries Islands.Very good drama with a screenplay by suspense writer Eric Ambler. The shipboard atmosphere and storm sequences are great and the performances are strong. Despite filming shutdowns due to Gary Cooper being ill you wouldn't know it from his fiery portrayal of Patch whose reputation and career are on the line. Heston does very well opposite him.This is really the best of Gary Cooper's last few films. He only made one film after this The Naked Edge released in 1961 after his death and that was a bomb. By that point he had to stop filming frequently to get oxygen. He was ill while making Mary Deare but probably didn't realize that he had cancer. Amazing that he worked to the very end. He deservedly died the huge star that he had been for 30plus years.Very good movie suspenseful with great performances atmosphere and effects.".

Based on the Hammond Innes novel The Wreck Of The Mary Deare fuses action and suspense and then cloaks it in a court room denouement. For practically the first hour of the piece we are left purely in the hands of Cooper and Heston both men bouncing off each other with acting gravitas born out of sheer hard work it really is a thrill to witness both men giving gusto.That this film is rarely mentioned in classic circles comes as surprise to me I can only think that many feel that both the leads here deserved a better project? Maybe that this pairing should have produced a more memorable piece? Yet the film was a positive joy for me a hark back to days when the effects masters had to graft and sweat for a desired effect a time when men were men a time when the likes of Gary Cooper got the job done in spite of illness. Also here a young fresh faced Richard Harris puts down his marker for the future his Higgins is both arrogant and snide in equal measure. Although the accent is a bit bemusing to myself it's a memorable turn that delivers all that's required. Emlyn Williams  Michael Redgrave flesh out the solid support whilst Michael Anderson The Dam Busters directs with knowing and careful hands. The film feels as though it was released far earlier than 1959 but that is in no way a bad thing in fact it's quite a pleasant surprise. 7.510".

	schema:reviewBody "The Wreck of the Mary Deare is an exciting piece of cinema. Although not a masterpiece and it was clear no Oscars were going to be won here we are with all presented with a classic yarn that has a montage of rich ingredients.The first forty minutes of the film is pure unadulterated peril on the high seas as salvage man John Sands Charlton Heston boards the apparently derelict Mary Deare during a massive storm in the English Channel.On investigation Sands finds that part of the ship has been burnt out and gutted and the entire crew have abandoned ship. Just as Sands is about to take his new prize in tow Acting Captain Gideon Patch Gary Cooper appears the one crew member to stay behind put out the fires and fight the Mary Deare through the rough seas to safety.However it becomes clear to Sands that reaching port is the last thing on Patch's mind as he purposely steers and beaches the ship onto the Minquieries a plateau of deadly rocks  a ships graveyard Patch assures the confused Sands that this self destruction of his ship was done for a specific reason and begs Sands not to give away her final position until an official court of enquiry.Sands and Patch are eventually picked up and are met on shore by a gaggle of police and maritime insurance agents desperate to know the final fate of the Mary Deare and a rescued crew with an altogether different version of events of the one that Patch himself tells.Sly second Officer Higgins brilliantly portrayed by the great Richard Harris tells of Patch's poor seamanship since assuming command and his panic at the fire and the rushed decision to abandon ship which has caused the death of so many of the crew.Sands then questions whether he has 'backed the right horse' especially as Captain Patch already has a reputation for 'losing ships' in the past. However he stays true to his word and fails to divulge the valuable information he holds on the final resting place of the Mary Deare There follows a maritime court of enquiry where after days of restraint Patch is able to speak his piece and put the cat amongst the pigeons. Patchs testimony tells of how the ships fire and the evacuation was orchestrated by the Mary Deares owners and carried out by Higgins and other unscrupulous members of the crew so that they can claim not only against the loss of the ship but also it's valuable cargo. However Patch is convinced and can provide the necessary evidence to prove that the real cargo had already been offloaded at Rangoon and replaced with crates of stone.This evidence is the substituted cargo itself now secured in number three hold of the Mary Deare. This he explains is why he beached the ship on The Minquieries so she will lie in shallow enough water for the hold and the aforementioned crates to be officially examined thereby proving the deception. But when his calls for an official examination fall on deaf ears he and Sands take matters into their own hands and venture out to the Mary Deare to supply the said evidence themselves.Also Minquieries bound is the desperate Higgins under orders from the the equally desperate owners to finally sink the telltale ship and silence Patch forever into the bargain.Can Sands and Patch prove the truth before Higgins and Co or the ships final plummet into the murky depths take their lives? With notable support from Micheal Redgrave Alexander Knox and Virginia McKenna it is really an exciting couple of hours worth of cinema. From the high sea adventure through the courtroom drama to the typical finale of the good guys meeting the bad guys The Wreck of the Mary Deare stands up as a good old fashioned ripping yarn.".

Just as Sands is about to take his new prize in tow Acting Captain Gideon Patch Gary Cooper appears the one crew member to stay behind put out the fires and fight the Mary Deare through the rough seas to safety.However it becomes clear to Sands that reaching port is the last thing on Patch's mind as he purposely steers and beaches the ship onto the Minquieries a plateau of deadly rocks  a ships graveyard Patch assures the confused Sands that this self destruction of his ship was done for a specific reason and begs Sands not to give away her final position until an official court of enquiry.Sands and Patch are eventually picked up and are met on shore by a gaggle of police and maritime insurance agents desperate to know the final fate of the Mary Deare and a rescued crew with an altogether different version of events of the one that Patch himself tells.Sly second Officer Higgins brilliantly portrayed by the great Richard Harris tells of Patch's poor seamanship since assuming command and his panic at the fire and the rushed decision to abandon ship which has caused the death of so many of the crew.Sands then questions whether he has 'backed the right horse' especially as Captain Patch already has a reputation for 'losing ships' in the past. However he stays true to his word and fails to divulge the valuable information he holds on the final resting place of the Mary Deare There follows a maritime court of enquiry where after days of restraint Patch is able to speak his piece and put the cat amongst the pigeons. Patchs testimony tells of how the ships fire and the evacuation was orchestrated by the Mary Deares owners and carried out by Higgins and other unscrupulous members of the crew so that they can claim not only against the loss of the ship but also it's valuable cargo. However Patch is convinced and can provide the necessary evidence to prove that the real cargo had already been offloaded at Rangoon and replaced with crates of stone.This evidence is the substituted cargo itself now secured in number three hold of the Mary Deare. This he explains is why he beached the ship on The Minquieries so she will lie in shallow enough water for the hold and the aforementioned crates to be officially examined thereby proving the deception. But when his calls for an official examination fall on deaf ears he and Sands take matters into their own hands and venture out to the Mary Deare to supply the said evidence themselves.Also Minquieries bound is the desperate Higgins under orders from the the equally desperate owners to finally sink the telltale ship and silence Patch forever into the bargain.Can Sands and Patch prove the truth before Higgins and Co or the ships final plummet into the murky depths take their lives? With notable support from Micheal Redgrave Alexander Knox and Virginia McKenna it is really an exciting couple of hours worth of cinema. From the high sea adventure through the courtroom drama to the typical finale of the good guys meeting the bad guys The Wreck of the Mary Deare stands up as a good old fashioned ripping yarn.";

	schema:headline " How Would Hitchcock Have Made It?";
	schema:reviewBody "The Wreck of the Mary Deareis a British film made by a British directorbased upon a novelby a British writer Hammond Innes mostly set either in Britain or aboard a ship in theEnglish Channel and with a predominantly British cast. And yet it stars two major Americanactors Gary Cooper andCharlton Heston. The reason apparently is that Alfred Hitchcock was originally slated to direct the movie but pulled out claiming that the novel couldn't be filmed without turning the story into a boring courtroom drama. Hitchcock was fascinated by crime especially the psychology of crime but the criminal justice process whether it involved police work or the courtroom procedure held little interest for him. The task of directing the film eventually went to another British director Michael Anderson.The film's central theme however is a characteristically Hitchcockian one the fight ofa man wrongly accused to clear his name. The man in question is Gideon Patch an Americanborn sea captain with the British Merchant Navy who is accused of incompetence after his crew mutiny and abandon ship leaving the vessel to sink Patch alone remains on board desperately trying to save the ship. The structure of the film owes something to that of The Caine Mutiny from a few years earlier in that the action begins at sea and then moves to a court hearing on land. This film however begins in medias res when a salvage man John Sands boards the stricken andapparently abandoned Mary Deare in the middle of a storm only to find that Captain Patch is still on board. We never actually see the mutiny or the earlier part of the voyage even in flashback but hear about them later both in the conversations between Patch andSands and at the subsequent court of inquiry into the loss of the vessel. In order to clear his name Patch needs toprove that the ship was sabotaged and the mutiny arranged by the owners as part of an insurance fraud. This was to be Gary Cooper's penultimate film his last The Naked Edge from two years later was also directed by Anderson and he gives a fine performance. When we first see Patch on board the stricken vessel he first seems dangerously obsessive perhaps even mad but we later come to realise that he is one of the few men of integrity in this film. He receives good support from Charlton Hestonas Sands. By 1959Heston was a huge star this was also the year of BenHur but he occasionally agreed to appear in supporting roles to work with a director or costar he particularly admired. For example he had taken a fairly minor role in The Big Country just for the experience of working with William Wyler. There is also a good contribution from a young perstardom Richard Harrisas Higgins the ringleader of the mutineers. Anderson was something of an uneven director. He is most famous for having made The Dam Busters one of the most beloved of all British war films but he also has some fairly secondrate entries on his CV such as Logan's Run and Orca which also starred Harris. The Wreck of the Mary Deareis also in some ways an uneven film. In one respect Hitchcock was correct the courtroom scenes are not very interesting. Cecil Parker as the Chairman of the Inquiry is particularly dull. The main interest lies in the action sequences particularly those near the beginning in which Patch and Sands are desperately trying to save both the stormbattered ship and their own lives. Although the film was made more than fifty years ago the special effects are very well done and these sequences remain thrilling even today. The look of the film shot in a muted palette dominated by greys browns and greens also seems appropriate to the film's theme of dark deeds and conspiracies. It would have been interesting to see how Hitchcock might have treated the story. His film would probably have been very different from Anderson's but in one respect I am glad he never got to make it. After dropping out of this film he moved onto a new project which eventually became North by Northwest one of his greatest achievements. 710".

The sets and special effects are extraordinarily good and exceptionally realistic for the era and everyone should be gripped by this point. We then move to the first and most crippling thorn in the side of this film Richard Harris. His role is small but important and played with all the subtlety of a lead balloon. With an accent that varies from brummie to cockney to South African but is defiantly never Irish he dominates every scene in which he appears in a way that  thanks to his acting  his character somehow never quite manages. We then move to what should appear to be a gripping peak Cooper's day in court. This is a critical part of the story but minor subplots instead of being used to build up or sustain the tension instead provide distractions and disperse much of the energy. The court case which is deliberately anticlimactic should serve to drive the momentum of the story forward but comes across as a sort of ineffectual interlude until we are allowed to return to the drama of the final reel. Here again all is fine and things begin to build up again until Harris is required to take the menace and terror up a further notch. He fails. There is drama but it's nothing to what it might have been. The film closes with a nondescript scene tying up loose ends and includes the line I think perhaps there will be serious charges against the owners in London. Well gosh really!".

	schema:reviewBody "From the great suspense Best Seller about the ghost ship Mary Deare based on the novel written by Hammond Innes  being well scripted by prestigious Eric Ambler . This intriguing as well as exciting flick packs crisp performance  thrilling scenes  suspense  courtroom drama  twists and turns . This interesting sea adventure focusing on a wreck is set in the British Channel  there John Sands Charlton Heston  along with his colleague  from a small rescue ship called Sea Witch  meet the freighter Mary Deare drifting . Although there's only a little fire  the whole crew seems to have left the vessel  however there is an officer  the only crew member on board . John's already looking forward to a large salvage fee  but then he meets a first officer named Patch Gary Cooper still on board . Sands can't get back to his tug boat and stays with Patch while Patch grounds the Mary Deare . Although he doesn't understand yet what happened on the Mary Deare  Sands allows Patch to persuade him not to talk about what he saw on board and to drag out the official investigation of the incident . Patch in order to prove his innocence and to vindicate his good name decides to investigate the deeds and as a result the events go wrong . This is a alright suspense movie in Hitchcockian style where intrigue  tension  suspense appear threatening and lurking in every corridors and interior and exterior from a freighter . The best scenes turned to be when the stars appeared at end of the film in underwater scenarios and fighting enemies . The wreck of the Mary Deare originally was to be shot by Alfred Hitchcock but he turned down the offer to make North by Northwest . Almost all the studio work for the film was done in Hollywood with Californiabased Britishers playing supporting parts . However  the lengthy scene of the inquiry was filmed in Britain following a small amount of British location work  Londonbased actors and a British crew were employed for these scenes . Nice acting by Gary Cooper as a disgraced merchant marine first officer called Gerald Patch who elects to stay aboard his sinking cargo ship to demonstrate the ship was deliberately scuttled . However  Cooper had frequent illnesses during the shooting . Good performance from Heston  as usual  as a boat salvager who comes up a seemingly empty ship one night .

	onyx:emotionText "From the great suspense Best Seller about the ghost ship Mary Deare based on the novel written by Hammond Innes  being well scripted by prestigious Eric Ambler . This intriguing as well as exciting flick packs crisp performance  thrilling scenes  suspense  courtroom drama  twists and turns . This interesting sea adventure focusing on a wreck is set in the British Channel  there John Sands Charlton Heston  along with his colleague  from a small rescue ship called Sea Witch  meet the freighter Mary Deare drifting . Although there's only a little fire  the whole crew seems to have left the vessel  however there is an officer  the only crew member on board . John's already looking forward to a large salvage fee  but then he meets a first officer named Patch Gary Cooper still on board . Sands can't get back to his tug boat and stays with Patch while Patch grounds the Mary Deare . Although he doesn't understand yet what happened on the Mary Deare  Sands allows Patch to persuade him not to talk about what he saw on board and to drag out the official investigation of the incident . Patch in order to prove his innocence and to vindicate his good name decides to investigate the deeds and as a result the events go wrong . This is a alright suspense movie in Hitchcockian style where intrigue  tension  suspense appear threatening and lurking in every corridors and interior and exterior from a freighter . The best scenes turned to be when the stars appeared at end of the film in underwater scenarios and fighting enemies . The wreck of the Mary Deare originally was to be shot by Alfred Hitchcock but he turned down the offer to make North by Northwest . Almost all the studio work for the film was done in Hollywood with Californiabased Britishers playing supporting parts . However  the lengthy scene of the inquiry was filmed in Britain following a small amount of British location work  Londonbased actors and a British crew were employed for these scenes . Nice acting by Gary Cooper as a disgraced merchant marine first officer called Gerald Patch who elects to stay aboard his sinking cargo ship to demonstrate the ship was deliberately scuttled . However  Cooper had frequent illnesses during the shooting . Good performance from Heston  as usual  as a boat salvager who comes up a seemingly empty ship one night . Heston was impressed that Gary Cooper still performed his own stunts  including remaining submerged for long periods of time despite his age and obvious ill health . Richard Harris hated the constant delays while making the film so much that he refused to return to Hollywood for five years . Very good support cast formed by notorious English actors such as Michael Redgrave  Emlyn Williams  Cecil Parker  Alexander Knox  Virginia McKenna and John Le Mesusier .

	schema:reviewBody "Although Gary Cooper doesn't appear on screen for the first ten minutes or so this movie is clearly his. Charlton Heston is billed second and while his part is substantial Cooper ultimately gets the meat of the movie. It's downright striking when Cooper as Patch first appears. This seawary captain looks nothing like the dapper romantic lead we associate with Cooper. He's grizzled tired and dirty from head to toe. Cooper never got his universallypraised swan song moment before he passed mainly because critics at the time panned a wonderful little movie called Love in the Afternoon based solely upon the age difference between Cooper and Audrey Hepburn.You may not even notice but there's very little dialog for the first forty minutes of this movie. There's such an eerie feeling and so much going on visually that dialog isn't even necessary. The special effects are stunning in this film. Everything in this picture unlike contemporary movies looks utterly believable. The beginning in particular has a few breathless sequences which certainly stand the test of time visually.This picture is directed very capably by Michael Anderson it nearly became an Alfred Hitchcock production before Hitchcock decided to make a little film called North by Northwest instead. No matter Anderson of Logan's Run and Around the World in Eighty Days fame does a fine job at the helm. Heston plays his part Sands very well free of the grandness and scope that people usually peg him for from the epics. Richard Harris also takes the villain role which could have easily come off as silly and made it dangerous and creepy.I give this movie a 9 because I think the script could have used a couple lighter moments between Cooper and Heston. The ending scene while a little short was especially welldone. It takes on added emotional weight by the fact that this film would be Cooper's second to last. Watch this movie for Heston. Watch it for Harris. Watch it to see the pairing of two heavyweights in Cooper and Heston but especially watch it for Cooper.".

	schema:reviewBody "Cooper retains his commanding on screen presence in his shared screen time with the rising star Charlton Heston in this moderately entertaining adventurecourtroom drama. Cooper is an acting captain Gideon Patch abandoned by his crew as the cargo vessel The Mary Deare is apparently on its way to sinking. Salvagers including Heston's Sands see the ship and plan to possibly attain from it whatever value it might hold. Sands doesn't expect to meet Patch on board considering how badly maligned it looks but that isn't even the beginning of what he will be a part of before the film is over.Airplane parts that were to be transported are believed by Patch to be the reason behind systematic ruination of the Mary Deare explosions among other potentially purposeful acts to sink the ship. When confronting his captain about the criminal activity he considers by the crew Patch is dismissively defied of his concerns. What happens between Patch and this captain how the crew leave the ship under suspicious circumstances why Patch would want to purposely drive the Mary Deare into the dangerous French Les Minquiers coral reefs to conceal its location a British court inquiry on what happened to the ship and on board it Patch's abilities at commanding a water vessel of any kind Patch's needed alliance with a jaded Sands who continues to trust less and less in the man alone and the eventual return to the Mary Deare of Patch to prove his theory is correct about the reason behind sinking the ship to Sands all factor as key plot developments that drive this film. Heston does show here it was only a matter of time before he would be a big star Ben Hur was this same year but he concedes to the absolute star power of a dying Cooper who is still a charismatic icon. I think the best part of the film is the opening of it as the friction between Cooper and Heston's characters are heightened by the ship's condition and ongoing weather conditions both dangerous to them accompanied by the approaching coral reefs as well. The ship itself looks quite damaged taking on water and looking quite aged. Heston trying to help keep the ship from total decline and eventual sinking while Cooper seems dead set on beaching the Mary Deare produces hotheaded backandforth. I like that there's this obvious gradual build up of respect although distrust during the trial somewhat fractures the good will starting to emerge between the two macho stars.That integrity and pursuit of proving that a greedy slug named Higgins a young Richard Harris was chief among the crew in helping his company sink the Mary Deare really establishes another Coop character so symbolic to that very recognizable archetype he was known for throughout his career. Seemingly a man with the whole world against him this is the kind of part that seems fitting at the very end of Coop's career he'd be dead the very next year. Coop's assertive nature at the beginning as Heston inadvertently stumbles onto a major situation when boarding his ship the latter becoming an unwitting participant in the Mary Deare's beaching and secretive location is intriguing. Also I think you can understand why Heston's salvager would be puzzled and frustrated with Coop's acting captain particularly as the treatment and hidden agenda of the Mary Deare is concerned. The courtroom portion of the film I understand is important to build the plot and place Coop under a lot of scrutiny but it kind of grounds the film after that really adventurous thrilling opening involving the cargo ship and how it was under a severe deterioration due to how the crew treated her. I think Cooper gains our sympathy as a wronged man trying to identify a crime and use the inquiry as a means to expose corruption. The insurance that would've made the company a lot of money due to the ship's sinking thanks to the pricey cargo Coop is up against a powerful entity. This isn't a bad MGM product even if its superb opening kind of loses momentum when the two men return to land for the inquiry. Michael Redgraves is rather wasted as a lawyer but Ben Wright is amusing as the tug boat captain of Heston's salvager The Sea Witch. Wright has one of those captains who listens to everything his ship's mate has to say and he's always around during the whole Mary Deare business as it involved a salvage so possibly valuable. While a capitalist Wright's tugboat captain becomes a crucial ally to Cooper when all is said and done thanks to Sands' involvement. The stuffy inquiry and how Coop seems guilty by everyone trying but failing to emphasize his innocence and spotlight criminal behavior through the series of happenings on the Mary Deare produces that gulp in the throat that proves its worth to the overall presentation of the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "Someone should have showed Charlton Heston how to do a rope climb. When his character John Sands attempts to board the Mary Deare during that storm he uses only his arms to make his way up the length of cable. Same thing when he tried to leave the ship during the storm. You would think it would be intuitive to wrap your legs around the rope to maintain a better grip and provide additional support. It was one of the first things we learned in high school gym class. Heston strikes me as the athletic type so unless that was the direction he got it didn't make sense.Disparate elements throughout the story eventually come together to flesh out an insurance scam that the owners of the Mary Deare attempted to pull off with Gary Cooper's Captain Patch looking like a bit of a lunatic trying to make his case in court. It doesn't help that he's already been proven a hot head in previous incidents marring his judgment as a ship's captain but with Sands' help the pair manage to prove that his initial instincts were correct. I don't think I've seen Richard Harris in a villain portrayal before he takes to the role of Lieutenant Higgins without a qualm about leaving men to die to cover for a bogus insurance settlement.The principal draw for the film obviously is watching two screen icons do their thing  Charlton Heston and Gary Cooper. In his next to last film role Coop looks a bit tired but up to the challenge. Both have appeared in better pictures but this was a bit of a change of pace. It's a good story that switches gears from a violent sea storm to a tense courtroom drama. If you're prone to seasickness you might need some Dramamine in the early going.".

It doesn't help that he's already been proven a hot head in previous incidents marring his judgment as a ship's captain but with Sands' help the pair manage to prove that his initial instincts were correct. I don't think I've seen Richard Harris in a villain portrayal before he takes to the role of Lieutenant Higgins without a qualm about leaving men to die to cover for a bogus insurance settlement.The principal draw for the film obviously is watching two screen icons do their thing  Charlton Heston and Gary Cooper. In his next to last film role Coop looks a bit tired but up to the challenge. Both have appeared in better pictures but this was a bit of a change of pace. It's a good story that switches gears from a violent sea storm to a tense courtroom drama. If you're prone to seasickness you might need some Dramamine in the early going.";

It may not be rocket science but it will please kids for sure.  For adults the physical nature of this comedy is tempered by a world weary Murray who really does make the film worth watching.  He is a funny guy and although he is on autopilot here he is still very good.The film rests solely on his shoulders and he just about carries it off. The rest of the cast may well be made of faces but they are all in minor roles.  People like Piven Garofalo Fiorentino Jerry Alder Presnell etc are all round the edges making it look tidy but really do little. McConaughey has a bigger minor role but he isn't very good.  His character is funny but he doesn't quite carry it off and I wonder if he is embarrassed by it now.Overall this sort of thing usually stinks the place up and this one doesn't.  It's nothing special but is amusing enough to pass the time.  This is mainly due to Murray doing his usual worldweary cynical act  we've seen it before but that doesn't mean it's not still funny.".

Mr. C's mantra and book is called Get Over It as Jack personally had a broken childhood that proved difficult. You see his father drowned when Jack was a boy and his mother Anita Gillette raised him as a single parent. Now however Jack is an aspiring Anthony Robbins with a beautiful fiance. Hold the phone! A lawyer contacts Jack by letter to tell him his father recently passed away and left him an inheritance. WHat ? ? Mom admits she lied to Jack because his father Kirby was too irresponsible to hold down a job so she left him and invented the tragic tale of his demise. But hey maybe money can heal so Jack travels to the east coast to visit the lawyer. After some tricky moves by this attorney Jack signs a contract. But Holy Dumbo Batman Jack has just inherited a circus elephant named Vera. It seems papa's last job was with the circus and his great act included a trained elephant. What the heck is Jack going to do with a pachyderm? Yet he must take possession of Vera immediately. After spending the night in a junkyard with Vera Jack finds out that a zookeeper in Los Angeles would like Vera very much as she is returning some elephants to their natural habitat. Thus the cross country trip of trips begins. From raiding a whole salad bar for the elephant's meals to riding in cattle car Jack and Vera try to make it to the west coast in time. Will they? This darling film is an instant classic. Murray has rarely been better than this ordinary Joe thrust into extraordinary circumstances. Piven Gillette Janeane Garafolo and all the other cast members are fine too. As for the elephant Vera what a charmer with loads of talent. She makes everyone WISH they had such an inheritance come their way. With a broad attractive look at the various regions of the USA as the viewer follows the duo's trip the scenery is a pleasure too. Please get this great movie for you and your loved ones in the very near future. Its a first choice for the whole family young and old.".

Mom admits she lied to Jack because his father Kirby was too irresponsible to hold down a job so she left him and invented the tragic tale of his demise. But hey maybe money can heal so Jack travels to the east coast to visit the lawyer. After some tricky moves by this attorney Jack signs a contract. But Holy Dumbo Batman Jack has just inherited a circus elephant named Vera. It seems papa's last job was with the circus and his great act included a trained elephant. What the heck is Jack going to do with a pachyderm? Yet he must take possession of Vera immediately. After spending the night in a junkyard with Vera Jack finds out that a zookeeper in Los Angeles would like Vera very much as she is returning some elephants to their natural habitat. Thus the cross country trip of trips begins. From raiding a whole salad bar for the elephant's meals to riding in cattle car Jack and Vera try to make it to the west coast in time. Will they? This darling film is an instant classic. Murray has rarely been better than this ordinary Joe thrust into extraordinary circumstances. Piven Gillette Janeane Garafolo and all the other cast members are fine too. As for the elephant Vera what a charmer with loads of talent. She makes everyone WISH they had such an inheritance come their way. With a broad attractive look at the various regions of the USA as the viewer follows the duo's trip the scenery is a pleasure too. Please get this great movie for you and your loved ones in the very near future. Its a first choice for the whole family young and old.";

But it works mostly because of Bill Murray's performance.A man who has to unload his father's trained elephant does not make for a promising story comic or dramatic. What makes this film work is Murray's generally laidback performance. His character  a motivational instructor who teaches patient and thoughtful behavior  displays such. He rarely gets badly upset and there's little of the frantic slapstick one would expect from other actors. I suspect Roy Blount was consciously writing such a story. When a reviewer states that the film misses the obvious sight gags its premise suggests  well that's the point of it right?This isn't a film that demands a second viewing. But it's far better than you might expect and its refusal to assault the viewer is welcome. It's a perfect film when you don't want to watch anything demanding.PS I just love the parents who say this and other films are good family films because they lack sex violence adult language etc. Unfortunately most such films are garbage that pervert a child's taste.".

I was also delighted to find a young Matthew McConaughey playing a hilariously over the top lunatic of a truck driver. It's worth watching just to see his performance and I wonder if this is the role that got him noticed. Seriously folks if you ever get a chance WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!".

	schema:reviewBody "Bill Murray plays a motivational speaker whose circus clown father passes away and leaves him an elephant. Now he's got to take a road trip with the elephant so he can sell it. Ridiculously farfetched premise with a lifeless performance by Murray and a supporting cast that seems hellbent on outshining him making themselves look like a bunch of hams in the process. Matthew McConaughey is especially bad. I mean he really stinks. Not really a family movie despite the corny animal buddy plot. Also not very funny for a comedy. I think I laughed out loud once the whole movie and chuckled maybe twice. If you're a big elephant fan you might get more enjoyment out of it. But for the rest of us it's pretty dull.".

It truly seems that most of the time a camera crew is simply following him around as he finds odd situations to get himself into and then without a bit of effort make us laugh and feel that special something in our hearts.This is one of those movies and the odd situation he finds for himself is trying to get rid of an elephant left to him by his estranged and recently deceased father. This results in most of the movie being Bill talking to the elephant not too much response from the big gray costar but he does have a presence. And despite some of the other reviews saying otherwise it works and it works great for Bill Murray fans. It's as if he really is playing it offthecuff and it makes it all work.I really liked sprocketbox' metaphor of the elephant being the grieving process. Having lost the best friend I ever had about a year ago my elephant hasn't gotten much smaller and so his metaphor hit me between the eyes frankly. There isn't an hour of a day when I still don't turn around and think There's something I have to remember to tell  about or That's something  would find funny and so on. That elephant is still there no matter where I turn.This is a movie well worth seeing and not just for Bill Murray fans.

As a long time fan of the early books and audio tapes which have been a great success here in Germany for decades naturally I had certain expectations for this first movie version of a Three Investigators story. And by certain I mean I already knew this was the first big international movie from Studio Hamburg the production company and so I could imagine the style to be quite a commercial asmainstreamaspossible one. After all it's a franchise product isn't it? Well I was not wrong.To all the fans Don't expect an authentic Three Investigators movie. Okay there are some nods to the old school fan community but they're sparse and don't really go with the flow and then that's about it. It's a decent movie for children although not really appropriate for the very young ones some scenes may be too frightening and it still can be interesting for the parents or of kind of an academic interest to the usual grownup fan but there are too much points where the protagonists just don't behave like the original characters would have. Also they don't really look that much as how the characters are described in the books. Bob doesn't even wear glasses for whatever reason...It's very obvious the movie is designed for this target audience notoriously called kids. Not children that is but kids. It could have been worse of course at least the boys don't wave mobile phones around wear baggy pants and listen to hip hop via iPods only once it starts to get too silly when they pull an itching powder blowgun with even a laser pointer mounted on top!. The makers fortunately chose to display a setting which is quite timeless in appearance. But then they try just too hard to please by putting in some diehardish action scene some jamesbondish some missionimpossiblish and some indianajonesish stuff and even  how misguided could they get  ROMANCE! While in the original story the three boys become friends with another boy here this is changed to be a girl a decision obviously led by marketing considerations. And the first comment one of the boys makes when they first see her believe it or not is something along the lines of Wow what a hot chick! Though the boys are displayed as very young ones as young as one could possibly imagine the characters from the most early books. When the original Three Investigators met girls they dealt completely different with these encounters. They simply had no business with love interests back then they were serious detectives only concerned to their mystery cases! It seems the writers of the screenplay had a merely superficial understanding about what made the Three Investigators special from the start  or they were pressed just too hard for prostitution.By the way the story has almost nothing to do with the original book episode of the same name. Besides the three main characters there are only two other persons which also appear in the original story Peter's father and Faraday. The actual villain even turns out to be one from completely different episodes. While the elements which make up the case are typical for TTI stories mostly it all comes around just too forced too artificial. At least for the fans I guess. For everyone else the movie might be a nice family fun ride the children in the audience laughed at all the moments where it was intended but then nothing particularly special. The only thing that would make this movie stick out namely it being a TTI adaptation of all things is what doesn't work that well. But on the other hand to make this work well might be an impossible enterprise considering how hard core the fan community has become over the many years and how diverse and inconsistent the TTI universe has become anyway.We'll see how the producers will pull off the next installment which they said is already underway...".

	schema:headline " A good movie but not the book not at all";
	schema:reviewBody "Yesterday I had the opportunity to watch 'The Secret of Skeleton Island'. To keep it simple I liked the movie. Nonetheless the movie is obviously made for a family audience kids younger teens. As Wikipedia says 'The Three Investigators' are a juvenile detective book series good mystery books for kidsteens. The movie tries to be the same. In my opinion they succeed even though the changes are more than obvious. 'The Secret of Skeleton Island' as a book is up to 5 percent in the movie. 95 percent are modernized relocated etc. For those you know and love the books or tapes you will not be bored because you don't know the story. The question is is it a good thing? What was changed? The movie has plenty of humor. It is funny yes but do we want to remember 'Home Alone' by seeing 'The Secret of Skeleton Island'? Bob seems to know more than Jupiter. That is odd. The investigators are younger than expected. Yet filming several movies will let them grow into it. The location of the movie is South Africa. Quiet interesting. It enriches the movie. The 4th kid is a girl. That's OK if you forget the puberty scenes. What was good about it? As I already said. South Africa was a good choice even if the topic eventually comes to the different races. Jupiter appears to be a little Sherlock Holmes just a little bit and mentally grownup. I liked the popping up of hints. Hints towards other cases e.g. 'The Stuttering Parrot' or 'Terror Castle'. From the beginning of the movie you have the impression of other movies  James Bond music starting scene  Indiana Jones cave. The only thing I still can't answer myself are the changes good and do I want it similar in 'Terror Castle' or more like the book?".

	onyx:emotionText "Yesterday I had the opportunity to watch 'The Secret of Skeleton Island'. To keep it simple I liked the movie. Nonetheless the movie is obviously made for a family audience kids younger teens. As Wikipedia says 'The Three Investigators' are a juvenile detective book series good mystery books for kidsteens. The movie tries to be the same. In my opinion they succeed even though the changes are more than obvious. 'The Secret of Skeleton Island' as a book is up to 5 percent in the movie. 95 percent are modernized relocated etc. For those you know and love the books or tapes you will not be bored because you don't know the story. The question is is it a good thing? What was changed? The movie has plenty of humor. It is funny yes but do we want to remember 'Home Alone' by seeing 'The Secret of Skeleton Island'? Bob seems to know more than Jupiter. That is odd. The investigators are younger than expected. Yet filming several movies will let them grow into it. The location of the movie is South Africa. Quiet interesting. It enriches the movie. The 4th kid is a girl. That's OK if you forget the puberty scenes. What was good about it? As I already said. South Africa was a good choice even if the topic eventually comes to the different races. Jupiter appears to be a little Sherlock Holmes just a little bit and mentally grownup.

	schema:headline " Details accurate plot inaccurate";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm a huge fan of the original book series so I was very enthusiastic about seeing this movie which I finally saw in the form of an Englishdubbed version online. Even as a kid in the 1960s I fervently wished these books would be made into movies and I finally got my wish though I had to wait over four decades to that to happen. To summarize my impressions of this movie I thought it was fairly good but throughout I kept wondering when specific scenes and events would happen but they never did although some of the details were quite accurate. The plot is so different from the original book's plot that it was difficult for me to enjoy the story. After all a plot is the essence of any story so to alter the entire foundation of a very popular book is to invite failure which in fact seems to be what resulted since the filmmakers didn't even recoup their investment yet from what I read and old fans are generally coming away disappointed.Some of the more memorable events for me in the original book were the skull talking to the boys in the cave the boy Chris Markos being trapped in an underwater cave by a freak accident finding gold doubloons hidden in a blow hole Jupiter catching a cold Pete waking up and not recognizing right away where he was crowds of treasure hunters flocking to the island and Tom and Chris and the Ballingers fighting at the end over the various frames to cover up an old holdup. None of that existed in the film.In the book plot a film was being made on the island and the boys were invited there by Alfred Hitchcock to be filmed while scuba diving but in the movie an amusement park was being built on the island and the boys were there by invitation by Mr. Crenshaw Pete's father. In the movie the setting was changed from the southeast coast Atlantic Bay of the USA to South Africa and the Greek boy Chris was replaced by an African girl Chris. There were no underwater scenes at all to my disappointment. The movie climax involved a hang gliding chase where Victor Hugenay uncharacteristically tries to kill the boys chasing him. African racial issues were also fairly prominent in the movie such as it being dangerous for white boys to enter a black township which was a little too much realism that killed the innocent and charming character of the book series for my taste.However I believe the filmmakers expertly meshed the different world of the 1960s with the world of the 2000s by not introducing too much high tech equipment they kept foul language toned down to innocent levels and they thankfully avoided any flatulence humor. They also kept the essential sense of adventure intact with the presence of a large uninhabited island that contained caves both of which are guaranteed to fire any boy's imagination. The youthful romance was kept innocent as well.The details that were kept fairly accurate were the Jones Salvage Yard and the secret gate to headquarters and headquarters itself though it contained a modern plastic chair the Investigators' business card though it contained the acronym T3I that wasn't in the book Jupiter's pensive gesture though that consisted of fingers under his mouth instead of pinching his lip all of which were delightful to see. The film character of Jupiter was appropriately coolheaded formal and intellectual to be convincing to me though not chubby as in the book. The ages of the boys in the film seemed a little young to me but still quite convincing since if they were any closer to puberty they would have had a different view of the world likely a different set of interests and people in general would react to them differently.Miscellaneous observations... The romantic angle was interesting since such an angle was never present in any of the books. Even boys of ten would be starting to become interested in girls so that was realistic enough for my taste even if not true to the books. As others noted the theme music had a James Bond theme sound due to its halfstep melodic sections which I thought fit well since it related to action and investigation without being too much of a ripoff of Bond film music. The references to presumably upcoming adventures a stuttering parrot in the salvage yard Jupiter calculating jelly bean volumes and Jupiter mentioning a haunted castle were all delightful. I'm a little disappointed that whiz kid Jupiter would erroneously assume that Gamba was the entity being confined to Miss Wilbur's room a risky assumption I detected right away. The itching powder gun was very cool but unrealistic in several ways. At least the plot's twists and deceptions of the characters were true to Robert Arthur's style which was true to the style of the old books.I'm enough of a fan to keep watching upcoming Three Investigator movies no matter how bad they become but sadly after four decades I still find myself wanting to see the books converted to film accurately not like this.".

The actors have grown out of their roles. If the series ever does continue I recommend leaving it to Nickelodeon who would probably put Rocky Beach California back in California. I still have hopes of a good studio bringing The Three Investigators into the 21st century and doing justice to the books.I have both movies and I will watch them again in the future.

In our country this series recognized by Rakib Hasan. We called it  Tin Goyenda  Kongkal Deep On this movie acting of 1st Investigator was brilliant also others did great too. Music was just great. They used some rural songs of South African territories. We didn't saw any Special effects on this Movie. No horror  nudity. 100 for kids and Family Movie. Personally i want's to say Casting wasn't good enough. Three investigators weren't brave although it was described in book they were very brave. Dialogue wasn't good enough. I wanted more thrilling scenes on this movie I had expected more from this movie. I can say  it was nice try. We expected more adventures from movie. We didn't found nothing ! For a tight budget movie crews were did great. Thanks for their efforts on this movie. Sorry 5 out of 10!".

Jupiter Jones is supposed to be super smart a little heavy and the leader. to make matters worse Jupiter is aggressive when dealing with adults in the books he is polite and considerate. in the movie he is just a quiet boy that may or may not lead the team. the other 2 boys are worse! the movie starts with Mr. Crenshaw picking up the team from the airport but the book has them kidnapped and marooned on an island. its not a theme park they are building its a movie they are making. in the book Chris is a boy in the movie Chris is a girl. because they changed the sex of Chris they added in a romance between the 3 boys. in the books the boys were not old enough to care about girls. they even changed the missing treasure from lost golden doubloons to a silver crown.on the whole the movie is worth watching if you don't know the back story. if you have ever read the books you will be greatly disappointed in the movie. it is rated PG.".

But everyone loves a good story and good acting. This is where the Investigators fall short.While watching the movie I was reminded of those old family movies we used to see in the 60's and 70's you know the kind? With an implausible plot poor lines studied expressions and gestures and the eternal eversopredictable story outcomes. Still you watch because maybe you're bored or have nothing else to do or you like to perceive the scenes unfolding and be able to say I knew that! This is just that kind of movie. Judging from the cheesy infantile plot it seems it was made mainly for the very young viewers maybe preteens who are still not old enough to piece a basic plot together and make solid decisions. So they just watch not to understand really but just to see what happens next. I wonder however if this last remark holds much truth because I am a drama teacher and coach and I see many of my 6 7 or 8 yearolds with minds that work much faster than what is implied in this movie. There were several scenes where you'd have to be either really young or a partial moron not to figure out.These teen Investigators then come up with the most mindbending solutions to puzzles without too many apparent clues drawing post007 conclusions from thin air. Terror Castle was no castle and there was no terror in it other than the creepy environs and Gothic atmosphere. The story wants to portray some kind of 'paranormal' experts and 'crime detectives' the only thing I found 'paranormal' was these youngsters playing a potentially 'dangerous' game of 'mom and pop heroes' in bad taste. What the scary Sheriff was needed for on those abandoned grounds was not explained nor why his daughter was fascinated with reincarnation and what she was doing in the castle to begin with. Everything they seemed to need to carry out their quest seemed to either pop into view or 'magically' appeared in their backpacks. After a while of this you start wondering if there's something you need to get done to get away or if you should just fall asleep.It wasn't awful but I won't give this one more than a '3'. Your mileage might differ but if you watch it see if you don't agree this one is best left in the 'forgettable' bin.".

There are amazing things the movie creators made work in this movie.The owner used steam heat to run the things he created. A elevator lights fireplace moving shelves and more. The story is very scary at times. The kids go into Terror Castle and meet Caroline who thinks she is psychic and believes in ghosts. The boys don't know what to make of her. The girl's father is a Sheriff and does not like these kids. Later Caroline helps them.A couple of things I did not like about this movie was the inflation of physic stuff ghost and curses. Also the scary scene with running darkness and background stuff in the dark just lasted too long.In the end the the belief in ghost in the goings on in the castle are put to rest until they hear a suspicious noise at their meeting place but you might say the psychic stuff and the ghost end up dead and buried.The story has a nice ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having read The Three Investigators in the 70's  80's I've wondered what they would be like in the 21st century. Well this is it. Sort of. But first you have to get over the fact that other than the words 'Steven Terrell' and 'Castle' there is nothing in the movie that resembles the book. You also have to get over Bob being a curly haired redhead without glasses.While this was the first book it is the second film that was made. The first being The Secret of Skeleton Island. Like the first film this is a German production filmed in South Africa. They slipped up at the end of the movie when the Rolls Royce drove on the wrong side of the road for California but the correct side for South Africa. As with the first film most of the plot points were ridiculous. With access to 21st century technology they had GPS but why didn't they do an internet search to find out who Steven Terrell was? In the book they did the research and went in knowing everything about him. Why move the castle from the Hollywood Hills near their home to the Sierra Nevada Mountains? What's the deal with the psycho sheriff? Is that view Germans have of Americans? If you have a county sheriff he as to be psycho? The tie in with Jupiter's parents was also ridiculous. And the most ridiculous of all was having the same villain as the first movie. What is it with Germans need for a French villain? Any movie that makes me use the word ridiculous this much can't be rated higher than 5 stars but I'll give it 6 because The Three Investigators are a part of my life and I'll watch anything about them like Harry Potter if you read the books you'd understand. Had I watched this movie under a different title and didn't try to associate the movie with the book characters I would have enjoyed it more. At some point I will watch it again and enjoy it more as I've numbed myself to the flaws. The characters are done well except for Bob no offense to Cameron Monaghan's acting. He just isn't Bob.".

But first you have to get over the fact that other than the words 'Steven Terrell' and 'Castle' there is nothing in the movie that resembles the book. You also have to get over Bob being a curly haired redhead without glasses.While this was the first book it is the second film that was made. The first being The Secret of Skeleton Island. Like the first film this is a German production filmed in South Africa. They slipped up at the end of the movie when the Rolls Royce drove on the wrong side of the road for California but the correct side for South Africa. As with the first film most of the plot points were ridiculous. With access to 21st century technology they had GPS but why didn't they do an internet search to find out who Steven Terrell was? In the book they did the research and went in knowing everything about him. Why move the castle from the Hollywood Hills near their home to the Sierra Nevada Mountains? What's the deal with the psycho sheriff? Is that view Germans have of Americans? If you have a county sheriff he as to be psycho? The tie in with Jupiter's parents was also ridiculous.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a charming film very well acted and with great production values. But like the screwball comedies of the thirties and the musicals of Fred Astaire it isn't for everyone. Of course a romantic comedy which is based on the magical ability of a crab to inspire Gellar to feats of culinary greatness is a premise which might be hard for some to swallow. But I think its worth the effort and it's no dafter than many successful comedy of earlier days. For those who follow such things there are three great references to the films of Fred Astaire. First is when Flannery is choosing the floor design for his new restaurant. The wavy black and white design is straight out of Yolanda and the Thief 1946 MGM where in a number called Coffee Time Fred Astaire and Lucille Bremer dance on a huge floor of exactly this design. As if to hammer it home Flannery's boss reacts by saying  it looks like something out of an MGM musical. Reference number two is to The Belle of New York 1952 MGM where Fred Astaire and VeraEllen kiss and float up to the ceiling. This is directly quoted in a kitchen scene where under the influence of the crab Gellar and Flannery kiss and float to the ceiling. These references are interesting because both films have fantasymagical themes and both are somewhat looked down on in Astaire's oeuvre. The third reference is to Shall We Dance 1937 RKOwhere in the Gershwin number of the same name Fred Astaire is confronted with a long line of Ginger Rodgers masked lookalikes. In Simply Irresistable Gellar appears reflected in a long line of mirrors with Flannery temporarily confused as to where she is with both of them standing in a set that seems right out of Van Nest Polglase's Art Deco creations for RKO. Here the reference seems to be to the magician's art of illusion. Anyhow after all that you should have a feel for whether this film is for you.".

Sarah Michelle Gellar and Sean Patrick Flannery both do an excellent job. They make a great onscreen couple together and you can even see the chemistry between.All together I liked this movie.

The story is very sweet filled with lots of love and humorous situations. Since I like movies where some sort of food plays an important part I just love Woman On Top! then I loved this one too. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Sean Patrick Flannery both do an excellent job. They make a great onscreen couple together and you can even see the chemistry between.All together I liked this movie.

It's supernatural themes seem to get left behind when there's a moment of pesky plot to spoil the visual pleasure and I'm not convinced that anyone on screen wanted to be there at all. Also why does a young woman on the verge of bankruptcy dress so well and have such impeccably styled hair? And why would she wear designer outfits whilst making sauces? It's odd.

Gellar although not one of my favourite actresses normally seems to possess a basic level of acting ability in Buffy but it is not apparent here.  Sean Patrick Flanery is also very tedious in this film. They are supposedly in love but the two leads show no chemistry and in fact seem generally bored throughout the film.  Not that I can entirely blame them given that the dialogue means that it would be extremely difficult for them to seem at all like believable human beings. The story was just absurd and the special effects particularly the infamous crab were just painfully bad.  The director does not seem to have made any effort at all. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece but I was hoping to be entertained in some way by this film but it's truly bad.  I lost hope about 20 minutes before the ending and left which is quite unusual for me as I like to finish what I start.  However this is a film which justifies walking out.

Penelope Spheeris's prior works Decline of Western Civilization and Suburbia were genuine and earnest portraits of punkrock music the first from a documentary perspective of the performers and the second from the subjective fictional live of the fans of the genre. this is an attempt to launch these concepts into the language of mainstream genre cinema and succeeds better than adequately. Admirably exceptionally debate and quibble about the adjective. no matter what. this is approximately 1 12 hors of fun movie watching with that little extra to think about. And I occasionally entertain the bizarre notion of building a religion around Daredelvis. If one respects a youth culture as an anthropological phenomenon tis film shines out as the punk take on westerns almost in the way that LITTLE BIG MAN' was a 60's hippie western".

Apart from this small points it is full of good humour and I certainly enjoyed it. I do not watch films for messages for me that just escapes the point. Film is escapism that is why it exists to take us out of ourselves to make us laughcry and smile. This is what DUDES does. We follow 3 punks cross country and their encounters with different people. They are products of the multicultural mix that is New York the scene of all three bored in the VW driving thru the desert is truly hilarious. The second half of this film is bit more bleaker with dream sequences et al but still this is remains a joy. I was left with a good feeling after the end of this film and do so every time I revisit it.".

For the remaining two instead of heading to California they decide go after the gang. This is one very odd slapdash journey narrative with broad humour but an even brutal tone and crosscultural conflict as the modern punk scene meets old west philosophy as actors Jon Cryer Daniel Roebuck and Flea find themselves along for the ride. I'm not that much of a fan of Cryer but this is definitely the best thing I've seen him in. Also showing up in the cast is Catherine Mary Stuart. For a road movie scenery is important and here the Arizona backdrop provides many picturesque sequences. Director Spheeris crafts out some surreal dynamics from the visuals and sets up some good stunt pieces. Pumping soundtrack edgy script and kooky characters only added to this cult film's spontaneous and jarring charm.I'm so sick of waiting for the world to end.".

	schema:reviewBody "I bought this movie for 1.99 at my local video store and while I was expecting it to be better considering that it was directed by Penelope Spheeris it didn't turn out to be too bad. It certainly is an interesting picture. DUDES starts off comedic and light with three punk rock friends Jon Cryer Daniel Roebuck and Flea all good in their roles heading out to L.A. to find a better life. 20 minutes into the movie the film becomes more dramatic when they are attacked by a group of rednecks led by the nasty Missoula Lee Ving. Missoula kills Flea by shooting him in the head and the rest of the movie has Jon Cryer and Daniel Roebuck looking for revenge. It's hard to say exactly what genre DUDES fits under. It's a mix of genres. It's part comedy part drama part western and part action adventure. The mixing of genres is not entirely successful though it does make DUDES a somewhat fascinating motion picture. It's unlike any other film from the 80s that's for sure. With some more character development and better dialogue DUDES could have been pretty good. The ingredients to a good picture are here but the screenplay is not as strong as it should have been. There's still some stuff to like about DUDES. There are some decent laughs the music is very 80s yet enjoyable the action scenes are handled quite well and the revenge plot though clichd is fairly intriguing. I'd be interested in a DVD release with a makingof documentary since I'm sure it would be just as interesting as the film is. However that will never happen since it seems nobody has ever heard of this movie. Slightly recommended. 510".

	schema:reviewBody "Fun offbeat 80s puck rock comedydrama about two New York punks Jon Cryer and Daniel Roebuck who travel out west and run afoul various rednecks bikers and lawmen in a southwest desert community on their way to LA. Dudes was directed by Penelope Spheeris who made the seminal punk rock documentary Decline of the Western Civilization but this film isn't as much a document of punk culture as it is an oddball 1980s counterculture time capsule. Despite the two lead actors being decidedly unpunk rock the film does feature legitimate musicians Lee Ving FEAR as a biker John Densmore The Doors as a cop Flea The Red Hot Chili Peppers FEAR as a punk buddy of the two leads and also an appearance by The Vandals during the film's opening. Ving is a particular standout as a nasty loudmouth biker. Seeing him this film really made me want to see him in more although his filmography is sadly pretty short and primarily supporting roles though I really do want to find a copy of his appearance on Who's the Boss. Dudes also gets time capsule value with the casting of Catherine Mary Stewart Night of the Comet and The Last Starfighter as a local wrecking service owner who helps the dudes when their Volkswagen Beetle needs fixed. Also of note is that this was the fourth feature film shot by cinematography by Robert Richardson who'd later go on to be the regular director of photography for the likes of Oliver Stone Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino. Overall Dudes is not as gritty as Spheeris' Suburbia nor is it as entertaining of a counter culture comedydrama as Something Wild but the end result is an interesting time capsule that held my interest. There's also a decent soundtrack that features everything from Jane's Addiction to Carl Perkins.".

He is searching for peace and quiet but unable to avoid his reputation and the showdownchallenges it invites .This is a mature  humourless Hollywood Western with Ford as the gunman turned sheriff attempting and inevitably failing to runaway from his past . It carries a surprising feeling of authenticity for a Western of this twilight period . The filmmaker is good at staging some action sequences  however is slowmoving and developed with dry sense of entertainment . The picture is produced in medium budget by Metro Goldwyn Mayer where the director Richard Thorpe spent 33 years in the same studio and he was to become the longestservicing filmmaker in their story . In time he became known as the studio's one take because of his rapid shooting schedules . The flick relies heavily on tiring relationship between Glenn Ford and Angie Dickinson who plays a Saloon owner  formerly callgirl . There are good supporting portrayals from Gary Merrill as tough cardsharp  Royal Dano as drunk Indian chief and Jack Elam in his usual role as outlaw .The picture is professionally directed by Richard Thorpe  though with no originality . Richard liked making escapist movies and many of them have rousing action scenes  handled with great confidence . He directed lesser Western and thrillers when he moved into features in 1924 and did little of note before joining MGM in 1935 . Thorpe made routine studio fare until 1950s when he was given more major assignment . He then made various bigbudget productions financed by Pando S Bergman among his best known films are all the MGM Tarzans following his arrival at the studio in 1935 and a series of swashbuckling adventures in the early 1950s featuring Robert Taylor  the most successful of these were three swashbucklers made in England as Knights of Round Table  Ivanhoe and Quentin Durward .

Even though in no way outstanding this is a solid film that is well worth watching for genrefans. Dan Blaine Glen Ford the Marshal of a small town in the West has the reputation of being the fastest and most precise shot around. Since he has been sheriff the formerly dangerous area has become calm. Blaine whose beautiful and rich girlfriend Angie Dickinson owns a local saloon is therefore highly respected in his community. One day however a young gunslinger named Lot McGuire Chad Everett comes to town with the intention to challenge Blaine in a duel. While he wishes to duel with the sheriff McGuire is an otherwise friendly and likable guy. Blaine therefore wants to dissuade the young man from his wish...Glen Ford is very good in the lead and Chad Everett also delivers a solid performance as the young gunslinger. Beautiful Angie Dickinson is as always great in the female lead. The supporting cast includes the great genre actor Jack Elam who also fits in his role very well. The film is overall entertaining and definitely worth the time. When it comes to Westerns from the late 60s however the Italian Westerns are usually incomparably better than those from the United States. While everybody is a bastard in Italian Westerns of the time all characters are kinda good in this film which makes it less interesting to me. The Last Challenge sure is a solid and entertaining little western but it also confirmed what I already knew  American Westerns from the late sixties can not compete with their Italian counterparts as the Spaghetti Westerns beat them in all respects. Nevertheless a decent film. 610".

The story is good some moments are a little slow but in the end. The story finally takes shape. One problem in the film. The Producers don't give enough substance to the Marshall. There's not enough gun play to establish the Marshall expertise as a law man. Angie Dickenson's character doesn't give the strong woman role. Like Miss Kitty in Gunsmoke. Chad Evertt's role should have been more dirty.Byron".

Marshal Dan Blaine Glenn Ford gave up a 'notion' from girlfriend Lisa Denton Angie Dickinson in order to go fishing! What?? No way or at the very least couldn't he have found time to fit both activities in during the same day? Well the theme here has been done in hundreds of Westerns and for my money the one that does it best is Gregory Peck's 1950 film The Gunfighter. I'm talking about the young hotshot gunslinger trying to make a name for himself by outdrawing the fastest gun with the best reputation in the territory. The twist here has the opposing gunmen Lot McGuire Chad Everett and Marshal Blaine meeting up on the dusty trail as strangers and sharing a meal and some camaraderie before their identities are revealed to each other. Once that's done all bets are off as to McGuire's true intentions regarding the lawman.I liked Everett in this one just a few years after appearing as Deputy Del Stark in the TV Western 'The Dakotas an intelligently written series given the era. Come to think of it another Dakotas alum appeared here too Jack Elam as the underhanded trail bum who accepts Miss Denton's offer to take out McGuire before he even reaches town. That was another dynamic I haven't seen before and made for a confrontational scene between her and the Marshal before the final showdown.Even though McGuire previewed his ability with a weapon during that rattlesnake scene Blaine never wavered in his conviction that he could take out the undisciplined young gunfighter. For a while I thought the picture might have been setting us up for some conflicted resolution to the final face off but when the time came I was surprised how quick and efficient the whole thing went down. No wise guy dialog between the pair of gunfighters just one man outdrawing the other in classic fashion. But this time the traditional ride into the sunset occurred with the Marshal throwing away his gun into the opponent's coffin and the girlfriend left to nurse a weary heart over a miscalculation that sealed her disappointment.".

It had to be good. It wasn't...it was awful! The tired plot ageing gunfighter trying to escape his past with a new young pistolero wanting to prove himself has been done many times before and better but I thought the stellar cast might bring something new to the film...wrong! Poor old Glenn Ford looked his usual worldweary self a bit too much in this film and Jack Elam played his regular character that he's played many times down the years which is OK if the movie's a good one...if it's not it doesn't work for me. The most ridiculous waste of talent was the part Royal Dano played not just an Indian but a drunken one that wouldn't have been out of place in Blazing Saddles. On top of all that the film actually looked horrible...it had none of the sharp colourful camera work that the others I mentioned had in fact it looked like a 'B' movie to me. The best thing about this film was Angie Dickinson who looked great throughout it. For me Shane in 1953 set the standard for future westerns and Rio Bravo '59 and The Magnificent Seven '60 kept up this standard with 'grownup' scripts good casts and attractive locations. For me The Last Challenge had none of these ingredients. The only other western I've given a negative review is The Unforgiven with Burt Lancaster and again a good cast...bad but not quite as bad as this one.".

It's an aggressive company where speed is everything. Doing too few runs in a day? You're out. Red is the most experienced trucker he can do 18 runs in a day. Tom soon makes friends with Lucy the secretary and Gino a driver. But the record of Red intrigues him and he wants to break it. Gino advises against it but he helps Tom when he wants to go through with it. Soon trouble begins when Red and the other drivers form a united front against Tom. Just when Tom has enough and decides to pack his bags Lucy tells him Gino had a terrible accident. She also tells about the corruption of Hawlett Trucking.";

Its chief asset however is the remarkably strong cast. Stanley Baker as the excon determined to expose his corrupt bosses brings a quiet strength and sincerity to his role as a basically decent guy who makes the wrong choices. It is interesting to compare Baker's performance here with his acclaimed portrayal of the ruthless hardened gangster in Joseph Losey's 'The Criminal' made three years later.Patrick McGoohan shines in an early role as the psychopathic lead driver exuding genuine menace. And as for the priceless supporting cast Herbert Lom Sid James Gordon Jackson and Sean Connery in one of his earliest roles..need I say more.  To sum up Hell Drivers is a minor classic of postwar British cinema and deserves more recognition than it has formerly feceived.".

	schema:reviewBody "Stanley Baker heads a remarkable cast of high quality British based actors in a rattleing good yarn of corruption and grim macho rivalry. The towering Welsh actor looks and acts every inch the quiet spoken smouldering tough guy characterTom Yatelya role that he was seemingly born to play a combination of working class hardman reluctantaccidental criminal and passionate lover. A role too that he played in slightly differing forms in several other classic British crime flicks of the 1950's such as ONLY THE GOD DIE YOUNG but in HELL DRIVERS he has distilled the persona to perfection. Tom Yately an itinerant ex con taking the only job he can find with his dubious background. This leads him to a trucking firm who deliver ballast gravelstoneand insist on their drivers all apparently similar down at heel ex cons and drifters running insane risks at illegal speeds in order to earn enough bonus pay to survive and with the promise that if any of them can deliver more loads in a day than the obnoxious foreman Red the prize is a solid silver cigarette case worth a small fortune. Tom lands a room in a rough boarding house where most of his workmates also live and so work and it's pressures and rivalries are with him constantly.The landlady is a tough old bird and well capable of dishing out whatever is required to keep order.And she needs to! The other drivers are prone to constant fighting and lowbrow practical jokes one of which lands Tom in a classic confrontation with Red played by Patrick The Prisoner McGoohanwhich gives the film one of it's truly great moments of cinematic fury. As the story developes Tom ducks out of a dance hall brawl rather than risk his parole and becomes ostracized by the other drivers who have all been involved and who resent him for his apparent cowardice. Only his the rather more reasonable Italian ex POW Gino HerbertPink Panther Lom remains loyal. There is however the complication of Gino's girl Peggy Cummingswho works at the truck yard. Unlike Ginoshe sees herself as a free agent and makes a pitch for Baker.I won't spoil the plot which does have some good twists and turns but I will say that it all ends in rather dramatic satisfying if not unexpected violence. McGoohan as Red gives a superb performances  one of psychotic cigar chewing  glowering animal menace. He makes Red the kind of foreman from hell that Noone would argue with. His acidspitting delivery of lines boxerlike stance and unkempt appearance simply ooze evil. Its a raw edged version of the rather more sophisticated No.6 he later made famous in The Prisoner . Red could easily be No.6s mentally unstable cousin!Gino is played with warmth and sensitivity by Lom who's truly a class act so much more so than his most famous Role of Inspector Dreyfuss in the PINK PANTHER films would have us believe. Peggy Cummings as Lucy his girlfriend is also superb bright quick sassy and very attractive. Something of a teaser and everything of a femme fatale full of barely suppressed passion. Her love scenes with Tom are unusually sparky for a 50's British film.Of the others where do you start? Sean Connery is there in his pre007 days. He's good but not yet great but he looks the part as in fact do every one of the cast who were all chosen with great success. CarryOn star Sid James clowns about in some scenes but has a raw edge that reminds us what a damn good straight actor he could be when given the role while Gordon Jackson puts in a similarly gritty performance long before his lasting TV fame of THE PROFESSIONALS. The yard boss played by the original DR WHO William Hartnell is another fine piece of casting in what must rank as one of the best British films of the 50's. The story is unusual a change from the whodunnit's kitchen sink dramas and Ealing Comedies that were standard fare at the time. The script isn't too peppered with cliches and fairly crackles with tension at times. The action scenes both with the actors and with the trucks are sharply directed aside from the old trick of speeding up the film at times which was common pactice untill quite recently and always always looks false!and every scene is well photographed to portray a grim earthy workingclass world. The characters are real and the performances are superb. It's a fine ensemble piece with a strong but not overpowering star role. Baker is in command but the others do not wither in his shadow and it can't have been by accident that the same star and director later worked together with major international success on ZULU.".

The characters are real and the performances are superb. It's a fine ensemble piece with a strong but not overpowering star role. Baker is in command but the others do not wither in his shadow and it can't have been by accident that the same star and director later worked together with major international success on ZULU.";

It's a British equivalent of the numerous and enjoyable American drivein movies of the fifties with a rockandroll sensibility and a fine young cast. And what a cast  Baker is solid in the lead Cummins makes a great sweatergirl and Lom the wonderfully nasty Hartnell Ireland who was only twentyone and McCallum are all terrific. McGoohan as the thoroughly loathsome and twisted Red is electrifying  his whole body seems stretched too tight and he spits out his dialogue like bile. This is one of the best villains in all British cinema and an absolute mustsee performance. The other stars of the movie are the horrible tenton tipper trucks roaring along the muddy roads in packs like angry supercharged elephants. Geoffrey Unsworth's Vistavision camerawork is sensational and I particularly love the way he uses so many rear shots following actors into spaces and creating great depth to the photography. Wellscripted by John Krause and the talented Endfield  a South African who worked in Hollywood but got blacklisted and moved to the UK and is billed here as C.

He and his colleagues witnessed much of the film making and apparently had quite a laugh at some of the antics of the actors trying to move the trucks about! If they had realised what the actors' pay was in relation to their own and what the future held for the likes of Sean Connery and Patrick McGoohan perhaps they would have laughed a little less!!As a lad my greatest delight was to accompany my father for the day and on odd occasions I got to drive the truck about in pits and quarries just like in the film and we would occasionally stop off in one of the numerous transport 'caffs' that existed in those days  with biscuits in glass jars menus written in chalk Coca Cola and jukeboxes in every one!! What I can tell you is that disregarding the 'storyline' with its necessarily exaggerated drama and the nearpsychotic behaviour of some of the characters the atmosphere scenery and setting of the story is spot on.The film picks up nicely on the period that I witnessed myself at the time in the UK when the bleak postwar drabness was gradually being turned round by hard work and long hours put in by just the sort of drifting diverse workforce including exPOWs that was portrayed with some pretty fine character studies. The grittiness of their existence and the way they coped with the pressures of the day was depicted very well  pubs sold a lot more ale and a lot less 'chicken in the basket' in those days! It was a time when 'black  white' Britain was becoming 'Technicolour' and little black cars like the Austin 7 in the film that keeps popping all over the place were slowly being eased out by the arrival of smart new models which could even be had in different colours!! Ten years from the time this film was made colour was everywhere and Britain had become 'psychedelic'!!Obviously the events depicted in the film would not have been allowed to go on long before they attracted the attention of the police but it may interest you to know that for a brief while some of the exmilitary petrolengined trucks that were in use just after the war could be made to run faster than the police cars of the day and if you could get away from them they couldn't 'nick' you!! Also one small thing that doesn't seem to be picked up on by any of the comments I have read is that the trucks seemed to be running an awful lot of material into a building site that would have struggled to use it all!!I have been delighted to read through some of the favourable comments here and agree that this film is an underrated gem  it obviously touched me as it was all like yesterday for me but it also stands in its own right as a superb 'modern melodrama' with a starstudded cast action humour a love angle violence death road chases and the bad guys getting it in the end!!And it's now almost 50 years old...!!Ten out of ten  for a lot of reasons.....".

Something that ups the stakes considerably more as Tom and Red clash on and off the road.A true British hard boiler is Hell Drivers that is chocked full of machismo. Who would have thought that a film about lorry drivers transporting gravel could be so exciting? Directed by Cy Endfield Zulu Hell Drivers has something of the quintessential working class about it which is good to see and is no bad thing at all. Gritty in texture the film although a crime film in essence has good character substance. Tom played by the criminally undervalued Stanley Baker is a guy trying to move on with his life his past misdemeanours hang heavy with him courtesy of a nice family thread that exists within the picture. But here he is trying to earn a hard days pay only to find that crime thru no fault of his own wont leave him be. There's also a crucial thread of bullying essayed by the hulking and fabulous Patrick McGoohan. And of course there's the women caught up in this macho world observers to daily recklessness coming to terms with affairs of the heart as much as the daily grind.Set to a back drop of cafs boarding houses village dances disused quarries and tight winding roads Endfield and his crew have the working class atmosphere spot on. For sure it's the roaring trucks that bring the excitement but it's the working class everyman and woman heart that drives Hell Drivers along. But be that as it may it's the trucks and the men behind the wheels that the film is most remembered for. Endfield shooting the road beasts front and rear really puts us out on the road with them. That we are involved with the characters and their surroundings for better or worse really aids the experience such is the authentic feel that Endfield has crafted.A roll call of Great British talent lines up alongside McGoohan who may have been born in America but was an honorary Brit due to his work on TV show The Prisoner. Into the Baker led beef stew comes Sean Connery Sid James William Hartnel Alfie Bass Wilfrid Lawson David McCallum and Gordon Jackson. With Herbert Lom adding a continental aspect as the crucial and emotionally driven Gino Rossi. The girls are played by Peggy Cummins Jill Ireland and Marjorie Rhodes with Cummins particularly standing out in amongst this hairy knuckled world.On release the film garnered mixed reviews but with each passing decade Hell Drivers has broken free of its cult only status. To which it now stands tall as a true British classic that thankfully got a DVD treatment in 2007 to finally do it justice. 910".

A group of down on their luck men finding work love and friendship where they can do what they have to do to earn enough money to keep them from crime more or less particularly when faced by venal employers who cheat and lie to them daily. There is no union for these men no legal recourse no Health and Safety Executive they have nothing except themselves and the tenuous camaraderie they forge in the down and out bed and breakfasts they have to live in. Driving trucks to ferry gravel from a quarry to a building site they cut every corner and take their own and every other road user's life in their hands as they struggle to get that one more run that might get them one more pint in the pub. A veritable who's going to be who of British actors  Sean Connery David McCallum Herbert Lom okay Czech but work with me... William Hartnell far from the lovable Dr Who Stanley Baker Patrick McGoohan and Sid James in a rare straight role all grimly play men on edge pushed to their limits  and sometimes beyond.Oh yes  until 1965 there were no speed limits on British roads outside urban areas which in some respects explains the lack of police.".

Every one of the all star cast put in great performances most notably Stanley Baker pitting his wits against the perfect bad guy in Patrick McGoohan. The speeded up film of the trucks skidding round corners set to a frantic score may not win any special effects oscars but is genuinely exciting. The plot is not very complex but the fantastic characters portrayed in this film bring it to life. With a plethora of top class supporting actors in Sid James Alfie Bass David McCallum not to mention a young Sean Connery and many others this film has 'classic' written all over it. The film is full of lines that you will find yourself saying long after you watch it. So if you see this film coming up on TV watch it video it and watch it again!".

I thought the final scene were McGoohan and Hartnell go over the cliff and the camera cuts back to them in the cab bracing themselves for the impact was horrible! The scene I think still has the ability to shock. Films up to that point would not have cut back to the baddies in midair like that waiting for their inevitable end.

I remember enjoying it but feeling immensely betrayed because my TV hero John DrakeNumber Six had become a bad guy. And not just bad but pathological! Patrick McGoohan made his movie name playing villains and they don't come more psychotic than this one. As the premier driver and the foreman his character cuts a lonely figure. His company uses him to pressurise its workers his colleagues hate his guts but are too frightened of him to do anything about it. His supervisor has made him complicit in a wages fraud that has turned him into a thief as well. By the end of the movie he has been driven to attempt murder. Poor Red his initial is G. but we never get to know his Christian name Redmond.The only time poor Red finds happiness is at the Village dance. He has no interest in the girls. He drinks deeply of alcoholic solace and in due course finds release in a saloonbar brawl. In physical communion with his fellowmen Red briefly finds popularity because his nemesis Tom Stanley Baker flees the fighting and so is thought to be a physical coward. Tom's apparent shame leads to the rest of the men supporting Red. This stasis cannot persist for very long and it doesn't by the end of the film Red is dead.Watching Patrick McGoohan in such a full role at such an early stage of his career left me with a small selfrevelation. I never tire of watching him. There are many who seem to find him overpowering his acting 'overthetop'. Something about watching Red after all these years made me feel that I could see what Patrick McGoohan does. He takes a role as scripted and finds a way to 'be' that person. Red was written to be a raving uncomplicated madman...so that is how he is presented. I think that must be why I always enjoy watching McGoohan. He has created that separation so that you are not watching Patrick McGoohan 'as' Red. You are watching Red. This is what Red is. I wonder if that is why all those years ago I felt so betrayed. John Drake and Number Six were 'my' Patrick McGoohan to a greater or lesser degree. When I watched Hell Drivers the first time I expected 'my' Patrick McGoohan and got Red. Nowadays I watch Patrick McGoohan movies because he never plays Patrick McGoohan he plays whoever he is meant to be. That is interesting. When I feel the need to see 'my' Patrick again I can always watch Danger Man or The Prisoner.".

A stranger with a past walks in to town and finds that getting on with his life is not going to be possible due to outside dynamics . It lacks the colour and feel good factor of George Stevens genre masterpiece and possibly the internal conflicts but as a piece of gritty melodrama the film delivers The plot revolves around excon Tom signing up for a road haulage firm and blacklisted American director Cy Endfield shoots the movie in a combination of film noir and British realist drama style . The scenes involving lorries zooming along English country roads with intrusive music does seem somewhat melodramatic but rightly Endfield concentrates on the character driven plot . Most of the drama centres around Tom's place within the firm's hierarchy where he's at the very bottom of the food chain and is singled out for the attention of violent bully  Red  Redman . Tom's lack of popularity nosedives further when he decides to walk away from a punch up at a dance hallThis is a very well acted film . Stanley Baker isn't an obvious choice for a mild mannered everyman but he pulls the role off very well . There's a host of faces who'd be well known in 1957 like Hartnell  Lom  James and Jackson alongside lesser known faces such as Connery and McCallum . Best performance is by Patrick McGoohan as Red the workmate from hell who is the stuff nightmares are made from . He also has a strangely prophetic line where he states he's not a prison warder ! If there's a problem with HELL DRIVERS it's that the story has too much melodramatic roots and is tied up a little too easily . Being a firm that is breaking the law Tom knows too much for his own good so the bad guys of the firm have to silence him which leads to an ending that seems at odds with the film's social grittiness . If the firm was law abiding Tom would still have found himself with the same problems from his workmates but Tom leaving the firm to work for a new company would have been very anticlimatic".

Underrated Cy Endfield resident of England after he was blacklisted realized this fascinating  propulsive film . Cy also directed good flicks such as Child in the house Mysterious Island  Try and get me Hide and seek De Sadeand Sands of the Kalahari. Certainly the most visually impressive and successful of Endfield's films is Zul 1964 the epic story of the Battle of Rorke's Drift in 1879 between a small contingent of British troops and a vastly superior force of Zulu tribesmen. Endfield lost interest in filmmaking after shooting the antiwar movie Universal Soldier 1971  his last movie .".

Cy also directed good flicks such as Child in the house Mysterious Island  Try and get me Hide and seek De Sadeand Sands of the Kalahari. Certainly the most visually impressive and successful of Endfield's films is Zul 1964 the epic story of the Battle of Rorke's Drift in 1879 between a small contingent of British troops and a vastly superior force of Zulu tribesmen. Endfield lost interest in filmmaking after shooting the antiwar movie Universal Soldier 1971  his last movie .";

Hurtling down narrow roads with a load of gravel he impresses his driving instructor enough to get offered the job. However when he starts the following day he faces the entrenched hierarchy of drivers with the 1 man being a driver so totally consumed with his status in the company that he routinely risks his life by taking dangerous shortcuts across a quarry with exposed cliffs in order to get the most loads of all the drivers in a day. A rowdy lot they all live in Ma's boarding house and take their suppers in a nearby diner where an attractive waitress takes a liking to the new guy who makes the mistake of taking 1's chair at the head of the table. In one scene at a village dance the drivers start a giant brawl when they pick up on the local respectable women who were already there with other local and respectable guys. The office secretary falls for the new man while leading on an Italian driver who's a lot more sensitive than his coworkers are who befriends the new man as well creating an interesting if unnecessary subplot. The new man's brother is a cripple who runs a store with his mother a bitter woman who has disowned her excon son. Filmed on perpetually cloudy and wet days the film is dark and brooding and offers a few memorable roles notably Patrick McGoohan as l who snarls through just about every scene up to the bitter end. Stanley Baker as the new guy has his ups and downs in a complex role but shines in his scenes with Herbert Lom as Gino and Peggy Cummins as the desirous secretary Lucy. The real star is the action and photography Geoffrey Unsworth set amidst as stark and noir looking greyness as anyone's ever likely to see.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you're looking for a Howard HawksJohn Waynestyle western the Missouri Breaks may not be for you. It is in my opinion the most sadly underrated western ever.This film didn't get the treatment it deserved when it came out in the 70s in part because its two stars coming off movies like the Godfather and Chinatown were box office powerhouses in their prime when uniquely paired together. I don't know what film could have matched the expectations of the critics especially a western that was probably more low key and offbeat than anticipated.I will never forget the first time I watched this movie and how pleasantly shocked I was at how good it actually is.Brando's portrayal is so wonderfully eccentric it gets more and more enjoyable with repeated viewings. Nicholson's meanwhile exemplifies the charisma that we associate with him being at the top of his craft during the ChinatownCuckoo's Nest era in his career.While the two big name stars don't disappoint the rest of the cast is stellar. Kathleen Lloyd gives the kind of performance from a lesser known actress that has me scrambling for the video guide wondering what other films she might be seen in. Randy Quaid's role is fascinating for being so early in his career. But Harry Dean Stanton delivers an especially understated yet weighty performance as Nicholson's closest partner.The dialog is often humorous especially one scene between Lloyd and Nicholson where he drawls Keep the dang thing I don't want it! The Missouri Breaks has extremely interesting individual characterizations with authentic settings that take you back to a credible old West that is not Hollywood backlot. The story is funny at times but extremely tense as it approaches its climax.Nothing irks me more than a movie that is wonderful in all aspects expect for the score but that is not an issue here. John Williams' music with occasional emphasis on the harmonica fits well with the style of the movie.If you appreciate the genre this is entertaining and worth owning. It's the kind of western that should be watched several times to appreciate some of the more subtle nuances and details.".

Our protagonist Tom Logan Jack Nicholson is the de facto leader of a gang of funloving outlaws in postCivil War Montana pistoleros who make their living stealing horses from wealthy ranchers laughing all the way a bit like Robin Hood's Merry Men only Logan and his boys keep the money and spend it on whiskey and whores. Egomaniacal rancher David Braxton John McLiam captures and hangs one of Logan's gang which retaliates by returning the favor to Braxton's ranch foreman on the same noose. Intent on ridding the country of horse thieves and avenging his friend's murder Braxton sends for Robert E. Lee Clayton Marlon Brando the most feared of the Regulators mercenary frontier detectives famous for their ruthlessness and their ability to kill suddenly and without warning from long distances with their trademark Creekmore longrifles.Posing as an aspiring cattlerancher Logan buys an abandoned ranch next to Braxton's property to serve as a relay station for moving stolen horses across the plains. He is left to mind the ranch while his buddies move the latest take of horses and while busying himself reviving the ranch's garden and orchard Logan begins a relationship with Braxton's daughter Jane Kathleen Lloyd. Jane suspects that Logan is an outlaw which makes him only more appealing to her as she has grown to resent her father's tyranny particularly after witnessing the slow death of the young horse thief from Logan's gang. Enter Robert E. Lee Clayton one of the strangest and most curious of Marlon Brando's acting creations. 'The Missouri Breaks' was Brando's last starring role before 'Apocalypse Now!' 1979 and was preceded by 'The Godfather' 1972 and 'Last Tango in Paris 1972. Like Coppola and Bertolucci director Arthur Penn Bonnie and Clyde clearly sensed that the best thing to do with Brando the Mad Genius was to sit back and watch. From the moment Brando's Clayton appearsbursting in on the funeral of the murdered foreman dressed like a western dandy in fringed leather coat and scarf bellowing and yanking the corpse up out of the open casket to borrow a few of the ice cubes used to keep the body from decomposing as a compress for a toothachewe know we are in for some vintage Brando.Nicholson is typically likable but he isn't given much to work with 'The Missouri Breaks' is clearly Brando's show as he systematically works his way through Logan's gang farting spritzing himself with perfume dressing in drag as a frontier granny singing love songs to his horse and delivering odd soliloquy's while constantly munching on carrots. Lee Clayton is comic but he is also sadistic and perverse. Brando seems to be having the time of his life and it's a genuine pleasure to watch one of the most brilliant and magnetic screen actors of all time given free reign to fashion the lunatic Clayton.Like much of McGuane's fiction 'The Missouri Breaks' has a muted understated tone disturbed only by acts of brutal unsentimental violence. The scenes and dialogue are meant to reflect the stark beauty of the Montana plains along the fall line of the great Missouri River the title of the film refers to the long stretch of the river between the plains and the mountains the corridor by which Lewis and Clark made their way to the Pacific. The plot is fairly predictable once Lee Clayton arrives and starts hunting the horse rustlers and so the film's main pleasure is in the acting performances of which only Brando's is truly exceptional. Nicholson can do no wrong but Tom Logan is a relatively bland inarticulate character and hidden behind an unruly beard Nicholson's facial expressions can't compensate for the minimalistic dialogue to create a more distinct character. There is little apparent chemistry between Nicholson and Kathleen Lloyd who followed this film up with winners like 'Deathmobile' and 'Skateboard The Movie' before settling into a long string of guest shots on TV. Given all the fun Brando seems to be having Jack must have felt gypped.'The Missouri Breaks' is all about Brando and is wellworth watching just for his scenes. It also features an excellent soundtrack by John Williams 'The Missouri Breaks' interestingly was Williams' project between 'Jaws' and 'Star Wars' and fine supporting performances by Frederic Forrest 'Chef' in 'Apocalypse Now!' Randy Quaid a very much underrated dramatic actor in his younger pre'Vacation' days and cultfavorite Harry Dean Stanton 'Wise Blood' 'Repo Man' 'Paris Texas' as Logan's fellow horsethieves. Jack is Jackone of the greats with a career that easily stacks up to Brando'sbut here unfortunately he's stuck playing the straight man to Brando's nutcase making the movie a disappointment for viewers hoping to see two of film's finest actors at their best.".

	schema:reviewBody "Seeing the movie for the second time after a break of some twenty plus years I realized that I was watching a film that deserved more attention than it has received over the decades. Apart from the fact that it contains one of the finest lines in cinema You know what woke you up? You just had your throat cut! most reviewers have logically zoomed in on the obviousthe swaggering performance of Marlon Brando at the peak of his career and an overshadowed but endearing performance of Jack Nicholson. Yet the film belongs not to these two worthies but to Arthur Penn the director.Penn seems to be constantly attracted by characters that are out of the ordinarythose who are constrained either physically or mentally The Miracle Worker The Chase The Little Big Man Night Moves etc.. He loves antiheroes. In The Missouri Breaks there are three antiheroesa rustler a crossdressing bounty hunter and a gay rancher who reads Tristam Shandy but serves as judge and jury as he metes out death sentences to make his little world better to live in.One would assume in a film studded with such unlikable characters that Penn would paint them black. Penn does the oppositehe manipulates the viewer to sympathize with the bad guys. Nicholson's horse rustler is smarthe knows the circumstances when a gun would have a bullet in it. He knows how to court a woman by brewing Chinese tea in the Wild West. Brando's bounty hunter is equally eruditehe carries a book on ornithology while horseback as he watches eagles seek its prey through binoculars just as he follows desperadoes before he moves in to his kill. The ranch owner with a gay lover on the ranch is a good father and well read with 3500 works of English literature in his library. What a weird set of antiheroes! One would have expected good women to balance the bad guys. The women of Penn have shades of grayMissouri Breaks is no exception. The leading lady seems to be fascinated by the bad guys and demands sex. Another rancher's wife has illicit sex with a guest.The final sequence of two important characters leaving for different destinations after checking out where they would be 6 months hence leaves the viewer guessing of what would happen. Penn's films tend to end with a perspective of a detached outsider making the characters quixotic and the end open to several viewpoints. Brando was a treat to watchonly his Quiemada Burn appealed to me more among all his films. Interestingly in both films Brando had problems with the director and took matters in his own hands.The music and screenplay are in many ways a tribute to the rising fame of the spaghetti Western and therefore quite stunningalso because of the very interesting and intelligent use of sound editing. The opening fifteen minutes of the film underline this argument although this is a Penn film and not a Sergio Leone film.All in all this film is a major western as it has elements that never surfaced in most otherswomen who were not mere attractions the effect of carbines on those shot by them and of course the slow death by hanging in contrast to the lovely countryside stated by the leading lady. This western entertains in a way most others do not. Exceptions are William Fraker's Monte Walsh Will Penny and Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller. Thank you Mr. Penn and all those that contributed to making this deceptively interesting film so enjoyable.".

	schema:headline " Much better than most would have you believe";
	schema:reviewBody "This film has suffered some pretty undue criticism. It gets the dreaded BOMB' rating in Leonard Maltin's guide followed by The worst film of a great director.' I haven't seen more than a couple of Penn's other films so I can't comment on that but it is hardly a bomb. Sure it is a little slow moving and it doesn't quite feel like the themes of the film were totally panned out but most of the film is very good. I'm assuming Brando's the problem with most of the film's detractors. Wow is his performance weird here. If you ever wanted to find the missing link between The Godfather and Apocalypse Now here it is. He plays a bounty hunter of sorts hired to discover some horse thieves and murderers. This character is very eccentric and I'm guessing that Brando had a lot of artistic input on this one based on his later career. He's basically a psycho killer and he seems much more lawless than the criminals he's seeking. He also speaks with an Irish brogue some of the time. Personally the waxing and waning accent is my only real problem with the role and I'm not a big accent baby anyway. It's a tiny flaw in what is otherwise a very interesting performance. Brando creates a very memorable character. Jack Nicholson plays his rival. He's almost ready to go straight having found a nice small ranch and a girlfriend Kathleen Lloyd. His performance is subdued and I really think Nicholson is best when he's like that. This isn't his greatest performance but it is subtle and it's very good. The flaws of the film are offset by the number of great scenes in it. Almost every single actor gets one scene alone with Brando and both Randy Quaid and Harry Dean Stanton deliver excellent performances especially in those scenes. Nicholson's two best scenes are also alone with Brando. I would guess than he had something to do with their costar I do think Brando deserves some credit for the excellence of these scenes. Penn's direction is nothing to write home about. I love the two other films I've seen by him Mickey One and Bonnie and Clyde but let's face it he was more or less ripping off the Italian and French cinemas of the time respectively. Missouri Breaks is much more straighforward in that respect and perhaps it is here that it could have used a boost of energy. 810.".

Up till that point Brando has been depicted as a ruthless and fiendish killer. Now Penn practically fills the screen with the pastywhite flesh of Brando's vulnerable blubbery back. This comical expanse of flesh visually begs a sucking wound from Nicholson's .45 but he declines to plug Brando then and there probably thinking he can best him later in a fair fight.

	schema:reviewBody "Hey I like Jack's sick humor in all this. It's hilarious.Rustler gang led by Jack Nicholson is stealing cattle owned by John McLiam. McLiam brings in a professional 'regulator' Brando to go after them. Of course during this whole thing Nicholson has an affair with McLiam's daughter played by Kathleen Lloyd which helps complicate things. There's all kinds of Brando maneuvering going on against Nicholson's gang including Randy Quaid being left to drown in the rapids by Brando John Ryan getting shot at long range while he's screwing a homesteader's wife Frederic Forrest getting killed long range while he's sitting in an outhouse taking a dump and Harry Dean Stanton being burned out of his house in the middle of the night and being stuck in the eye and killed by Brando's Xshaped shiv. Brando's being weirdly methodological about the whole thing sometimes wearing a prairie woman's dress and bonnet while killing off Nicholson's gang but his accent is also unconvincing. He goes from Irish to Western to English so I guess that's to let the audience know he has a big screw loose or something. Now it's up to Jack to hunt down Brando finally catching up with him while he's asleep and then slitting his throat. And there's also good shootout scene at the end where McLaim who everyone now believes is infirm with a stroke pulls out a gun while he's sitting in a wheelchair and shoots the unawares Nicholson. Nicholson then shoots back killing McLiam. The film ends with Nicholson his arm in a sling and Lloyd parting ways.The critics universally hated this film calling it the worst thing that Brando Nicholson and Arthur Penn have ever done but I happened to like it.I found the story engaging and gritty wondering what was going to happen next to Nicholson's gang as each one of them gets killed off. I even managed to ignore the dumb idiosyncrasies that Brando was making although I think it's a shame he had to resort to using them at this stage of the game.Besides most of these people look like they haven't taken a bath in a long time. Except Brando. laughs 7 out of 10.".

The story  is  not  important. It's just fun to see Brando pulling out a bag of tricks and seeing him have fun.One small trick is that he is always eating or chewing on something as he talks. This may have been an insider joke because at this stage in his life he was fat. Nickelson  might have done better acting .So if you want to see Brando having fun see this movie. If you are looking for movie with great story see something else.This movie is on my list as one of the best.I give it   an 8 of 10.".

Through long glacial and grand Penn's film seems preoccupied with small moments and gestures. It's a tiny tale directed with an odd selfimportance.The plot? Jack Nicholson plays a minor criminal who eventually decides to settle down on a small farm. The problem? A bounty hunter played by Marlon Brando begins to delve into Nicholson's past. One by one Brando kills Nicholson's buddies until the duo meet for a final showdown. Sounds generic? The film approaches all its clichs from odd angles subverts all expectations and stretches and elongates sequences which would otherwise be brushed past.More interesting is Marlon Brando's character Robert E. Lee Clayton. During this period Brando was creating a number of absolutely ridiculous but downright entertaining characters The Godfather Burn! Mutiny on the Bounty etc and his Lee Clayton is no different. Part madman part genius flamboyant incomprehensible cruel wild professional whimsical effete sadistic strange and deliberately at odds with the naturalism of the rest of the cast Brando's Clayton steals every scene he's in. He toys with his cast like a cat toys with a ball of yarn.What's interesting is that Brando completely contradicts the intentions of screenwriter Thomas McGuane. McGuande wanted a film about people and not canvases. He wanted something lowkey slow and human to capture the tempo and tone of the real West. Brando however then came in and completely rewrote his character demanded huge changes invented his own weapons and improvised and rewrote much of his hilarious dialogue. The result is a film which seems to be pulling in two completely contradictory directions.It's hard to know what else The Missouri Breaks is about. Maybe it's about things breaking up and breaking apart. Everyone in the film is torn apart loses something and traditional western archetypes seem to be set up only to eventually be confused made impotent or disposable. Lee Clayton himself seems to be portrayed as a watcher a man always using binoculars and telescopes and who eventually intrudes upon the film from outside tearing things up as he does so. He overwhelms everything and seems recognised as a threat only by Nicholson who tries his mightiest to get rid of this weird little man who disobeys all rules.On the negative side the film is revisionist and subversive in only the most trite and banal ways Nicholson never convinces as a man of the period and the film is far too long for such thin material even if its length does lend a strong portentous weight to its climax. The film contains a number of great sequences perhaps the best of which sees Brando donning an old woman's bonnet and dress delivering odd dialogue whilst a burning log cabin lights up the night sky. Other odd moments include Brando kissing a horse and even singing it love songs. He truly was bizarre.7.910  See The Long Riders Terror in a Texas Town The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid Lonely are the Brave and Broken Lance. Worth one viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Starring two titans of cinema in Marlon Brando and Jack Nicholson The Missouri Breaks sees Arthur Penn Bonnie  Clyde direct the screenplay provided by Thomas McGuane Tom Horn and John Williams composes the score. In the supporting cast are Harry Dean Stanton Randy Quaid Kathleen Lloyd Frederic Forrest and John McLiam. With all these people in place the film was one of the most anticipated movies of the year. Anticipation that was not met at the time as the film became a critical and commercial failure. However time has been kind to the piece and now it shows itself to be far better than the iffy reputation that's afforded it.The story is a sort of working of the Johnson County War that surfaced in the early 1890s in Wyoming where newer ranchers tried to settle but were set upon by the more established cattle barons of the land. One of the tactics by the wealthier ranch owners was to hire gunmen to terrorise anyone they saw as a threat. Here in Penn's movie we see David Braxton McLiam ruthlessly deal with anyone who he sees as a threat to his property. However when someone enacts revenge on him by hanging his foreman Braxton hires himself a Regulator named Robert E. Lee Clayton Brando to seek and destroy as it were. This spells bad news for the rustling gang led by Tom Logan Nicholson especially since Logan has started to form a relationship with Braxton's daughter Jane Lloyd. Somethings gotta give and blood is sure to be spilt.The most popular word used in reviews for the film is eccentric mostly in reference to Brando's performance. The big man was growing ever more erratic off the screen and sure enough he changed the make up of his character and improvised at his leisure. Yet it does work in the context of the movie. With his dandy nastiness playing off of an excellent Nicholson turn McGuane's richly detailed screenplay gets added bite particularly during the more solemn parts of the story where patience would be tried were it not for the brogue Irish Clayton. With Penn at the helm it's no surprise to find the piece is an amalgamation of moods. Poignancy hangs heavy for the most part as we deal in the ending of an era and the need to move on. But Penn also delivers much frontier action and snatches of cheery comedy. Then there is the violence which doubles in shock value on account of the leisurely pace that Penn has favoured. It's sad to think that one of the best splicers of moods was so upset at the reaction to his film he quit cinema for the next five years.The film well more realistically the reaction to it possibly sounded the death knell for the Western genre until Eastwood  Costner refused to let it die. The 70s was an intriguing decade for the Oater with many of them veering between traditional and revisionist. But of the many that were produced the ones that dealt with the passing of the era where the protagonists are soon to be relics of a tamed wilderness have an elegiac quality about them. Penn's movie is fit to sit alongside the likes of Monte Walsh The Shootist and The Outlaw Josey Wales. Yes it's quirky and is slowly driven forward but it has many qualities for the genre fan to gorge on. 7.510".

	schema:headline " ...and you come under the headin' of what I do for a livin'...";
	schema:reviewBody "Coming off the success of The Godfather and Last Tango in Paris one can only imagine what may have possessed Marlon Brando to team up with Jack Nicholson in an off the wall film like The Missouri Breaks. Nicholson himself had already reached super stardom with Chinatown and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest so this project wasn't so much a risk for either actor as an opportunity to explore some 'outside the box' boundaries of a genre generally calling for shoot 'em up action and a clear delineation between good guys and bad guys.The thing is there are no good guys here. Nicholson's character Tom Logan is the leader of a gang of horse rustlers and Brando's Robert E. Lee Clayton is a Wyoming regulator from Medicine Hat hired to take him down. Even Clayton's employer Braxton John McLiam operates outside the law as it were taking frontier justice to it's limits in an early hanging scene.

	onyx:emotionText "Coming off the success of The Godfather and Last Tango in Paris one can only imagine what may have possessed Marlon Brando to team up with Jack Nicholson in an off the wall film like The Missouri Breaks. Nicholson himself had already reached super stardom with Chinatown and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest so this project wasn't so much a risk for either actor as an opportunity to explore some 'outside the box' boundaries of a genre generally calling for shoot 'em up action and a clear delineation between good guys and bad guys.The thing is there are no good guys here. Nicholson's character Tom Logan is the leader of a gang of horse rustlers and Brando's Robert E. Lee Clayton is a Wyoming regulator from Medicine Hat hired to take him down. Even Clayton's employer Braxton John McLiam operates outside the law as it were taking frontier justice to it's limits in an early hanging scene.

The first movie they made together The Chase was a longwinded murderous tale with Brando as a sheriff after a fugitive. The Chase was coherent but their second collaborationwhich is less of collaborationThe Missouri Breaks is a complete mess done on a big budget. The saga about horse rustlers wears out its welcome and what might have been a grand western is reduced to mediocrity by an eccentric performance by Marlon Brando that goes haywire. He dresses in a variety of wardrobe as Lee Clayton a 'regulator' who is hunting down Tom Logan Jack Nicholson and his gang of horse rustlers. The only thing interesting about this mishmash is the idea that the outlaws win. Thomas McGuane's screenplay is like rustled horses stampeding all over the place with Brando improvising his scenes and dialogue. The supporting cast with Randy Quaid Frederic Forrest Harry Dean Stanton and John Ryan is sturdy enough and the scenery is rugged and thorny. Brando's regulator wields revolvers rifles and an object that looks like the plus sign in an arithmetic equation to kill both animals and men. John Williams of Star Wars fame wrote the orchestral score before he scored Star Wars and it is lowkey. The Missouri Breaks is an odd meanspirited shoot'em up with little to recommend it aside it being a western for western completists to say that they have watched. The drama is mitigated by the screenplay's incoherence. Jack Nicholson gives a good performance. As for Brando he doesn't steal the show so much as sabotage it.".

Wonderful part played by Harry Dean Stanton. He looks and sounds like an old horse thief.Lots of good humor in the dialog.Brando plays the strangest hit man ever seen. He is a professional killer who is gay speaks with a lispy Scottish accent and does inexplicably odd things. He wears a granny dress in one scene a Chinese coolie hat in another but he is deadly from very long range. Brando seemed to enjoy himself in this one. In his last scene he talks to his horse as if she is a coy mistress.A young Randy Quaid plays a dopey cowhand very well. There was only one part I think was miscast  John Ryan was too New York for a Wild West film. Beautiful cinematography. Lots of cowboy action  train robbery stealing horses shootouts and wide open spaces.Funny scene in a bar where a man is tried for his crimes. It is different in tone from the rest of the movie because it is a parody of the old west played by people from the era who are in on the joke. It stands out because it's not really part of the same movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "Robert Mitchum is the new Captain of a destroyer on patrol in an area of the South Atlantic where there will be little chance for any action or so the crew thinks. This is a new command for him he lost his last vessel and was 21 days on life raft. Mitchum though he was in the merchant marine before World War II is as new to the navy as most of his crew.Lurking beneath is Curt Jurgens in command of a UBoat. Jurgens is a career navy man who's already given much for the fatherland two sons lost. His submarine is on courier duty not looking in fact for any combat.But they find each other and The Enemy Below is about the cat and mouse game each of them play in trying to destroy the other.With twelve years in between the end of World War II and the present it was now possible to portray Germans as three dimensional people something rarely done during the war years. Jurgens at this time was a very big star on the European continent and was now getting roles that would introduce him to American audiences. He's very good as the professional but tired UBoat captain who just wants to get home.He's matched all the way by Mitchum who's got a lot of doubts now having lost one ship already. The crew has some doubts too but Mitchum proves worthy of the command he's been given.The Enemy Below won the Academy Award that year for special effects. No ships in a tank these are real vessels being used for this film. Look for good performances by supporting players Theodore Bikel as the Executive Officer of the submarine David Hedison as the Executive Officer of the destroyer and Russell Collins as the ship's doctor on the destroyer. You might note a small role for Doug McClure at the beginning of his career.".

My other faves are Platoon Full Metal Jacket Decision Before Dawn wOskar Werner and Richard Basehartmost excellent! and of course Kubrick's Paths of Glory wKirk Douglas Adoph Menjou and George MacReady.More than a bloodandguts war movie though it has plenty of terrific action scenes it's more of a manvsman cat and mouse story. Absolutely excellent direction by Dick Powell and some terrific cinematography. Terrific scene between Jurgens and Theodore Bikel who plays his Exec. Officer that is nothing but facial gestures and eyebrows.A very moral tale it shows that even sworn enemies serving their countries in wartime can show respect and compassion toward each other especially since they're all menofthesea sailors. Conversations between Mitchum and his ship's doctor and between Jurgens and his exec officer mirror each other. Note the scene of the American sailors pulling the German sailors aboard their lifeboats near the end Mitchum helping rescue the Uboat captain and his exec after ramming them.Great tale wellscripted acted directed and shot.

Considering the era in which it was made I was pleasantly surprised by its straightforward story and solid production. Rather than have some superfluous romantic subplot dragging it down it instead concentrates on the professionalism of those involved on both sides. Robert Mitchum and Curt Jurgens portray the opposing Captains impressively as men who take no pleasure in the prospect of killing but carry out their jobs to the best of their considerable abilities. The supporting cast include Theodore Bikel David Hedison and a very young looking Doug McClure.   A combination of good technical credits sure handed direction good acting and a sympathetic depiction of the German crew ensure that the film holds up very well today.

That destroyer is no movie set. You'll find very few backdrops and special effects here except for underwater shots of the enemy Uboat and even those are above average. It all seems ahead of its time somehow the brilliant color footage the musical score and the attention to detail.The Enemy Below is a fascinating study of WW2 antisubmarine warfare. Although the ending is a little corny the antiwar message is timeless and quite appropriate. Especially now Oct. 2004 as America is being dragged into another real conflict.

	schema:reviewBody "USS HAYNES real name WHITEHURST DE634 in the opening scene as the credits roll has weighed anchor and stood out from Trinidad that morning and is well out to sea. Which means she's operating in the Caribbean Sea Frontier Area.A sailor heaves two buckets of garbage over the stern. If it was a real war situation let's just hope that there's nothing amongst the potato peelings bottles cans etc with USA stamped all over them. A Uboat captain on surface patrol would love nothing better than to scoop up garbage intelligence. A tipoff that allied ships maybe not far ahead? It's surprising what information can be gleaned from garbage.There's curiosity among some crew members about the new captain Murrell Robert Mitchum. In the officer's wardroom someone stated that the XO Lt Ware David Hedison should have been promoted to CO of HAYNES. Ware's only experience was sailing a yawl in the Miami yacht races in peacetime. Similar peacetime experience as Sub Lt Lockhart aboard COMPASS ROSE in The Cruel Sea.A possible Uboat contact appears on the radar screen. Murrel orders the bridge watch to get on the sub's tail and watch every course change he makes and follow at the same speed. Camera shots now cutting between the pursuer and the pursued become interesting.The Uboat captain Von Stolberg Curt Jergens reminisces with Heinie Schaffer Theodore Bikel his second in command and old friend. ...but now it's be a good warrior and never think Heinie. They may be fighting for the New Germany the Master Race. But there is a feeling of unease in Von Stolberg's heart and mind about the system. Nothing good will come out of this war win or lose. There's no honour in it. Memories will be ugly. We will die without God. Only Heinie is within earshot of the captain's opinions. He would probably not voice these opinions in front of Lt. Kunz the officer aboard who struts and responds to orders Nazi fashion. Von Stolberg shows silent contempt for the Master Race when on leaving the control room he drapes an oilsoaked towel over the Fuhrer's name which is stencilled on the overhead air conditioning trunk suspended over the chart table.Captain Murrel again shows he's no slouch when he correctly calculates the time it will take for the submarine to dive level to periscope depth launch torpedoes and running time to target. There are tense looking expressions on some of the crew's faces as Murrell presents HAYNES broadside on to the submarine at reduced speed. The tempting target suddenly turns hard to port and shocked amazement is on the destroyer men's faces all heads swivelling from left to right and eyes glued on the two torpedoes as they gurgle along the destroyer's starboard side and close aboard. Murrell proves his ability. He's as capable as the submerged opponent he's trying to destroy.The Uboat goes deep after the depth charge attack and rests quietly on the sea bed. HAYNES heaves too right above her. Silence all round. A chess game is in progress in the sub's control room and Von Stolberg looks on with faintly amused contempt as Kunz buries his nose in a copy of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf. Aboard HAYNES a studious naval rating probably a bookworm is reading Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Heavier reading than Mein Kampf and about an empire that lasted a lot longer. The camera pans right to show a smiling commissioned officer reading a Little Orphan Annie comic. It speaks volumes about the background mixture of men thrown together in times of conflict.The Uboat gets his licks in at the Destroyer Escort with one torpedo out of a full spread. That one strike amidships at the ships's very vitals its forward fire room is all that is needed to finish her. With enough power remaining Murrell manages to close the distance with his surfaced opponent and strike the submarine forward of the conning tower.Respectful courtesy is immediately apparent between the two captains as they sight each other for the first time. They salute they have fought the good fight. In conflict courtesy between warriors like days of old comes to the fore. Men of both sides are mariners and war or no war the brotherhood of the sea rises to the surface. There are souls to be saved from this cruel sea and hostilities take second place as deadly opponents become survivors and are hauled aboard the whaleboat.Von Stolberg reading the burial lesson in German over the remains of Heinie Schaffer before committing him to the deep seems very appropriate. German dialogue throughout the film with English subtitles would have been distracting spoiling the concentration.The German side was given fair treatment. Something that has often been lacking over many years. The image of strutting boneheaded Nazi automatons often bordered on the ridiculous. Thankfully there was Only Kunz aboard the submarine who seemed to symbolise the Master Race.Robert Mitchum turned in one of his best performances as did Curt Jurgens who incidentally was interned in Germany in World War Two for not embracing the Nazi system. Dick Powell a crooner in the thirties an accomplished actor in the forties proved himself as an accomplished director with this production.On ramming Uboats? RN destroyer HESPERUS sliced U357 in 1942. VISCOUNT closing at 26 knots finished off U661 1942. Lend Lease BUCKLEY class DE HMS AYLMER dispatched U1051. Other DE's CALDER BENTNICK and MANNERS were in on the kill January 1945. All ships survived. Ramming was officially discouraged in the Royal Navy because of damage incurred. Captains balled out in a gentle manner by higher authority. Don't dare do it again!....Until next time. There's a good chap. And good hunting! And if that wasn't openended encouragement to do it again I don't know what was!".

Aside from the color Enemy was also better technically crafted overall. But for me what puts Enemy well over Run Silent is the very effective characterization of the enemy Uboat Commander portrayed by Curd Jurgens. In Run Silent the captain and the crew of the Japanese destroyer hunting the American sub were practically faceless unknowns.I notice that the Uboat commander has a von in his name indicating a noble lineage. Same as George Ritter von Trapp of the famous singing familya baron who commanded a Uboat in WWI. I understand the Kriegsmarine attracted a better class of educated and highly cultured people which is why the infamous Heydrich was cashiered from the German navy under the Weimar Republic. Incidentally the US Navy was led to victory in the Pacific by another descendant of the Prussian junkers class the petty nobility whose members usually made a career of the military. That would be Chester von Nimitz although his immediate ancestors gave up the von when they settled in the New World.

	schema:reviewBody "Inexorable duel of great stars into a submarine and a destroyer . During World War II an American destroyer escort 'USS Haynes' it was played by the real 'USS Whitehurst' captained by a tough skipper Robert Mitchum meets a German UBoat commanded by an intelligent captain Curt Jurgens . Both captains are good ones and the engagement lasts for a considerable time . Both of them pursuit one another and square off in the South Atlantic . This movie's closing epilogue states Twentieth CenturyFox wishes to thank the Department of Defense and the United States Navy for their assistance in the production of this motion picture. Thrilling as well as exciting battle of wits between two skippers who gradually come to respect each other . Both of whom are a compellingly balanced match as two clever as well astute captains . This nailbiter is a tightlyknit drama centered on the relentless sea maneuvers of a destroyer going after a submarine and vice versa . The film is famous as one of the best WWII submarine movies though some scenes at sea however suffer from the utilization of obvious models in a just as obvious studio tank . Interesting screenplay  being based on the novel by D.A. Rayner and the book and it's dustjacket can be seen at the beginning of one of this movie's trailers . German player Curt Jurgens made his major mark on the international scene and it was American movie debut for German actor . The cast spent about a month filming on board this vessel. Many of the crew of the 'USS Whitehurst' appeared in this movie. Secondary cast is frankly good such as Theodor Bikel  Frank Albertson  Russell Collins  and this picture marks the feature film movie debuts for David Hedison as Al Hedison and Doug McClure . 20th CenturyFox production notes for this movie from the AMPAS Library declare that the 'USS Whitehurst' was a battlehardened veteran from the Second World War which had during World War II been stationed at Pearl Harbor Hawaii. Harold Rosson's colorful and vivid cinematography  including spectacular maritime scenes  though set in the South Atlantic Ocean of World War II this movie's ocean scenes were filmed in the Pacific Ocean. . The motion picture was stunningly directed by former movie star Dick Powell who efficiently captures the claustrophobic up and undersea tension  this was one of the final theatrically released movies of director Dick Powell who soon after worked exclusively in television. This suspenseful sea epic represents one of a select group of a few World War II submarine movies which have won the one single Academy Award in a technical category that's just only the one Oscar in either special effects or sound editing. These movies include Crash Dive  Torpedo Run and U571. The nonWW II submovie The Hunt for Red October also won just the one Oscar as did the WW 2 part submovie 49th Parallel  but for Best Original Story . Furthermore  other important films about submarine are Run Silent Run Deep Crimson tide by Tony Scott with Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman K19 with Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson and the best Das Boot 1982 by Wolfgang Petersen with Jurgen Prochnow .".

If one as ever navigated or plotted via radar you know that if you've vectored off course  e.g. zigzagged for any length of time to get back on your original course it would not be the same exact 140 as it started.I can't wait for this movie to be released on DVD and in Wide Screen.".

On many other Navy flicks even where welldone you can't help but imagine the actors walking away from their ships at the end of the day's scenes  and proceeding about a hundred paces out the door and into the Hollywood parking lot. Not so here.In all the history of talking pictures from 80 or so years ago there probably haven't been any two famous leading actors more reserved lowkey and phlegmatic than Mitchum and Jergens. They might even be 12 in either order on such a list.However and especially together as the American and German adversaries this style works perfectly  and an alreadyexcellent production is all the better for it. Again in other naval films the captain spends much of the time shouting frantic directives and you still know he's doing this only a few hundred feet from his car in the lot outside the sound stage. Bob and Curt bring a calm deliberate realistic and intelligent perspective to their characters.In addition the American and German captains were not the extremelyopposite caricatures so often portrayed in war films.This picture has shown frequently recently and I've enjoyed it every time I was able to catch it.".

Tautly directed by actordirector Dick Powell the film depicts a strategic catandmouse maneuver between the captain of a German Uboat and the captain of an American destroyer escort in the South Atlantic during World War II. The two captains engage in a war of strategy which leads to growing mutual respect although neither has ever laid eyes on the other. Torpedoes depth charges and zigzag evasion are deployed in a deadly game of marine warfare and the film's special effects won an Oscar although they are unimpressive by contemporary standards. The fine screenplay by Wendell Mayes adapted from a novel by D. A. Rayner the crisp editing by Stuart Gilmore and Curt Jurgens's sensitive performance as the German captain all merited Academy attention but were overlooked.The two captains engaged in a battle of wits to the death are seasoned veterans and carry baggage from their pasts. The American captain well played by Robert Mitchum helmed a freighter that was torpedoed and sank with his new bride aboard he spent days adrift on a raft and only recently returned to active duty aboard the escort ship which has largely avoided action until now. Curt Jurgens displays considerable depth as the war weary German captain who disillusioned by the new German order. Both captains have sounding boards nearby to verbally express their inner thoughts. Mitchum talks with the ship's doctor played by Russell Collins while Jurgens bares his soul to his shipboard friend Theodore Bikel.The drama moves back and forth between the surface ship and the submarine below as each captain tracks the movements of his foe attempts to anticipate his next move and out maneuver him they play a high risk game of chess with the loss of their ships and the lives of their crew if checkmated. The Enemy Below is engrossing throughout its relatively short running time the tension builds both above and below the surface suspense mounts and viewers will be drawn into the drama until the end. For fans of submarine films and of Robert Mitchum The Enemy Below is essential viewing and all viewers will likely come away with a new appreciation of the talents of Curt Jurgens.".

	schema:reviewBody "Enough has been said about this film in the other reviews but I would like to draw attention to two scenes that have remained with me since I saw The Enemy Below as a boy. When some of his crew show the signs of stress when under constant bombardment from above the sub captain Von Stolberghas a Germanic drinking song played as loudly as possible through the sub's PA. He then encourages the crew to sing along. It will give the sub's position away but the captain defiantly stares upwards and hopes that his overt and seemingly reckless response will have a psychological effect on his enemy above. On hearing the music the destroyer's green first mate tells captain Murrell played by Robert Mitchumthat they are having a ball down there and that his psychological warfare was not working. Murrell smiles and shakes his head in admiration of the sub's commander and wryly remarks Oh it's working all right. I almost wish it wasn't. One human being empathized with another  two enemies implicitly understood each other. The scene is worthy of the famous scene in All Quiet on the Western Front in which the German soldier first stabs the French soldier and after recognizing his humanity tries to save him from dying. After being saved by his enemy from being blown up by the sub's detonatora despondent Von Stolberg says to Murrell that it was his fault that he survived by throwing him a rope. Murrell apologizes and replies that next time he won't throw him the rope. Von Stolberg sternly retortsI think you will. These men know each other beyond what they do in war. Each man has done his duty  his job  but they have not let the war rob them of their humanity. Even though they have tried to destroy each other they admire each other's skill and character. There is a message of hope but it delivered by two hardnosed actors Mitchum and Jurgens who don't play it for sentiment.It is a moving depiction of humanity and it lifts the film up to a higher level of thought.".

Not made for promoting the war effort as Destination Tokyo and Torpedo Run were this movie is the story of two veteran Captains and their ships. Having served on submarines I appreciated the realism of the Uboat the crew and the captains tactics. All were very realistic. Robert Mitchums tactics as the Destroyer captain were very realistic. I enjoyed the respect each captain shared for the ability of the other and I especially enjoyed the realism of the hunt and final attack. To conserve torpedoes it was customary to finish a struggling target with the deck guns only if the target was a cargo or freighter with little weaponry. This tactic was not usually used on a heavily armed destroyer unless a safe position could be taken to prevent becoming the target. The tactic of ramming was also commonly used by all ships in WWII. I enjoyed the ending because in war not terrorism when the outcome of a battle is certain the foes become people once again and the human spirit overcomes the ideological differences and the victor and the vanquished come to each others aid. There are countless stories of this happening during WWII and if the UBoat would have been the victor I would have left with the same feeling.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the middle of the Atlantic ocean during the Second World War two experienced sea veterans confront each other. The first is America naval Captain Murrell Robert Mitchum who has already seen his share of misery and tragedy. Lt. Ware David Hedison is his able secondincommand. Captain Murrells' wife was lost at sea when a German UBoat sank the ship she was on. Now returning to duty Murrell hides what feelings of revenge he has and attends to the task at hand. The second is an experienced German naval Officer named Von Stolberg Curt Jurgens who learned his considerable skills as an undersea commander in the First World War. His best friend and second in command is Heinie Schwaffer Theodore Bikel. Both have good crews. This film called The Enemy Below is an honest portrayal of men at war depicting the conflict from both prospectives. Neither side is given a 'Hollywood edge' and thus allows both sides to exemplify exceptional skill and steadfast fortitude. When Murrell and his Destroyer confronts Von Stolberg and his Submarine both discover they are up against an exceptional commander. As such they display considerable expertise in trying to destroy one another. The consequence? The first to make a mistake will sink the other. The audience realizes this is what war is all about.

The first is America naval Captain Murrell Robert Mitchum who has already seen his share of misery and tragedy. Lt. Ware David Hedison is his able secondincommand. Captain Murrells' wife was lost at sea when a German UBoat sank the ship she was on. Now returning to duty Murrell hides what feelings of revenge he has and attends to the task at hand. The second is an experienced German naval Officer named Von Stolberg Curt Jurgens who learned his considerable skills as an undersea commander in the First World War. His best friend and second in command is Heinie Schwaffer Theodore Bikel. Both have good crews.

	schema:headline " Which Enemy?";
	schema:reviewBody "I take the title to be the kind of pun that Richard Matthieson was fond of using. In one sense the enemy is of course the submarine commanded by the clever Curt Jurgens. In another sense the enemy is more obliquely identified in a philosophical conversation that Robert Mitchum commander of a Buckleyclass destroyer escort has with the ship's doctor. Mitchum goes on for several minutes about how men seem to have an unconquerable evil part of them so that if you cut off the head of a snake it just grows another one. Let's say that Enemy Number One is the submarine that lies beneath the surface of the sea. Enemy Number Two is the reptilian brain that lies beneath the cerebral cortex. Mitchum plays his role straight competent and all business. Jurgens on the other hand has been exhausted by the war and disillusioned by the political ideology he and his crew are risking their lives for. He drinks too much brandy at one point and maunders on about how during the first war it was all a kind of game in which the KaEl would say Torpedos  loss and sometimes they'd go and sometimes not. The American crew are all clean cut and good humored. The Germans are sloppily dressed and sweaty. Jurgens is clever enough to elude the DE but betrays himself by continually coming back to the same course the one which leads straight to home and Mitchum outwits him. Good points? I can't offhand think of a film about the US Navy that has such realistic seagoing atmosphere. The color photography is superb. The wind blows on weather decks and makes everyone's hair and clothing flap as it does on a ship at high speed. The twists and turns of the game being played by the two skippers generates a good deal of suspense. Weaknesses. All the German sailors are ordinary human beings except the one Nazi aboard whom Jurgens finds disgusting. And because of his background as a folk singer it's difficult to forget the ethnicity that Theodore Bikel brings to his role as executive officer. And we see a lot of depth charge attacks from the submariners' point of view with bolts springing loose a panicky crewman chronometer crystals cracking water squirting forth all of which are already familiar from earlier movies including Destination Tokyo. Then a scene that I've never figured out. Mitchum has been charging in to drop a few depth charges on a regular basis then turning away after the attack. After one such incident Jurgens says to Bikel Now I'll tell you something. Each time he comes in to attack he turns away. He doesn't always turn the same way but twice he did. This allows the sub to prepare to launch torpedoes if the DE turns the same way again. What does that all mean? If you only have two ways to turn after an attack right or left how can you not turn the same way once in a while? If you turn the other way every time you finish an attack you make yourself predictable and therefore vulnerable. The explanation makes no sense but I suppose is offered just as an excuse for permitting the fish or eels as the Germans called them to be launched. After the torpedoes wound the DE mortally Jurgens surfaces to finish the ship off with his guns. Mitchum who has planned for this says He's coming up. That's the first foolish thing he's done. It makes us even. I don't get that either. It was routine for Uboats to sink defenseless ships with deck guns in order to conserve their torpedoes. It happened every day and night. The last thing I consider a weakness is the final scene. True both the DE and the Uboat are destroyed but the outcome is hardly a tie. The image of the American ship perched atop the smashed submarine is unforgettable and too powerful to represent an even loss. And on top of that so to speak the movie ends with the two skippers face to face aboard the American destroyer that has rescued them. It's a clich of antiwar movies that have humanized the enemy as this one has done. We respect one another and we're all alike under the skin and in war there are no winners  except that we win. The Americans will be free to go on fighting the Germans are all prisoners of war those that have survived. Torpedo Bay has an Italian submarine and a British destroyer pitted against one another. The crews meet on shore and develop a mutual respect. In the end it is only with the greatest reluctance that the submarine blows up the destroyer saluting the ship as it sinks. It's an Italian movie. In Zulu the bravery and stamina and self sacrifice of the African warriors leave the British soldiers in awe and it is only out of desperation that the Tommies mow them down like wheat. It's a British movie. In Die Brucke a handful of German schoolkids are put into uniform and told mistakenly to hold a bridge against an attack by an enormous force of wellarmed Americans who are by no means brutal savages. The kids suffer terrible losses and in the end the bridge ironically is blown by German troops although the Americans have been driven off and the bridge held. It's a German movie. The Bridge on the River Kwai has Japanese troops that are as human and sympathetic as the British prisoners. But the bridge is destroyed. It's a British movie. I don't need to go on about this. The Enemy Below like the others has a latent feelgood quality for an American audience. How would they have felt if the two opposing crews had been sailing away on another German sub?".

As for the other technical flaws I'm not really sure.

Overall it is one of my favorite WWII movies and my favorite WWII film in the navy genre.";

	schema:reviewBody "Duel at Diablo filmed in 1966 has a cast of both American and international players and touches of violence coupled with prejudices.  It makes for an interesting mix and provides the viewer with a tense depiction of the usual struggles of the Apaches against the US Cavalry. James Garner plays Jess Remsberg an Indian scout now out looking for the man or men that raped and killed his Indian wife.  Sidney Poitier adds an excellent portrayal of a former Army sergeant who has quit the job of soldering in exchange for breaking horses and selling them to the Army.  Bill Travers and Bibi Anderson provide the international flavor in the cast and Dennis Weaver gives the viewer a chance both to detest him and feel some sorrow for his warped prejudices toward those he considers inferior or below his status.The group of troopers heads out across the desert to another fort in the area but are headed off by a group of Apaches that have jumped their reservation.  Garner does find out the identity of the man who was responsible for the rapekilling of his Indian wife but in order to extract his revenge he must first make it to the canyon of Diablo and rescue the beseiged group of Army troopers from being killed by the Apaches.Good tense story sweeping vistas of the Utah landscape and two actors Garner and Poitier delivering masterful performances.".

I recalled the exciting cavalry charges etc. and I even remembered the opening refrain of the strange musical score. I really enjoyed this movie unlike most of my childhood favorites. While the movie itself is alot like a John Ford Cavalry opera it plays out alot differently.  This one has more in common with the modern action movie I think than with most Bwesterns of the 1960's.  The fast pace of the movie unearthly fates of the dead antiheroism of the protagonist James Garner and well done scenes of horseborne combat combine to create a WesternAdventureMorality Play that I certainly recommend. There are multiple forces at play here.  Among them the bizarre scorched desert scenery Garner's quest for revenge for his dead Indian wife while pining over the married woman disgraced by her captivity with the Apaches The underlying loyalty of Poitier's former soldier character to his former comrades despite his overtly selfserving statements contrasted with the underlying selfpromoting purposes of Bill Traver's role as military commander.  Too I see shades of this one in 1993's Geronimo by Walter Hill burning vistas Apaches hidden in the ground Garner's Remsberg character in Duval's Al Seiber etc. The musical score is offbeat for standard western fare but who needs more drum beats flutes and rattles?! I think the score compliments the movie well and is perhaps the best indicator that this production thinks outside of the box even if it remains within it subjectively. This may not qualify as a classic but I definitely think its a great action flick and a breath of western fresh air with intriguing insights into race warfare culture and the winning of the west.".

Like all Westerns the plot has its flaws  with an Indian war party off the reservation they would not have sent a shipment of ammunition through a narrow canyon guarded by only one squad of green recruits on unbrokenpartly saddle broken horses. But so what? In the classic Western Stagecoach the Indians would have shot the horses pulling the stage and then finished off the passengers as opposed to shooting at the people in the coach. Also Sidney Poitier's silver vest remains immaculate throughout the long desert journey and several pitched battles.However the movie moves so fast that you never really have time to stop and remind yourself that you have to suspend disbelief to watch it.Next the Good. On one level it's a classic cavalry vs. Indians story. But viewed through a different lens than in earlier Westerns the Indians are shown with some perspective if not total sympathy which probably makes this one of the first Westerns to get beyond a one dimensional view of them. There are a variety of interesting subplots which flesh out the major characters and keep things twisting turning and moving along between the combat scenes. In fact almost every one of the characters is angry about something creating lots of tension between them. James Garner's character is looking for the men who raped and killed his Indian wife Dennis Weaver's Will Grange is angry about almost everything including that his wife was held captive by the Indians Sidney Poitier's Toller now a civilian is mad that circumstances forced him to accompany the cavalry on this mission ....Garner and Poitier give excellent performances and the other actors rise to the occasion helping us forget that they are in fact Scottish or Danish.At the end of the movie the various subplots are tied up and the issues are resolved with in one case a very surprising twist.On top of that you have a wonderful almost superb for this movie Neal Hefti score which always seems to correctly reflect the mood of the scene. It fits the movie even better because it makes heavy use of Westernmilitary instruments guitars horns drums ....Finally the Ugly. There are some fairly graphic scenes here although not exactly like in the Wild Bunch or Saving Private Ryan. The Apaches could torture with the best of them and some of that appears in this movie although we're spared the closeups.All in all I must say that this is one of my long time favorites. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!!".

The film also has a brutal hard edge to it when it comes to the violence death and the mayhem that takes throughout. The score gives a sense of desperation and inevitability which enhances its hard edge. Unlike many films of the genre there is no clear cut protagonist or antagonist.

	schema:reviewBody "The first  more watchable of 2 intense Westerns from Ralph Nelson Diablo is one of the starkest examples of the tough realistic Westerns that became popular in the late 1950s. Professional scout Remsberg Garner is out for vengeance on the civilized men who butchered his Comanche wife. His quest is interrupted when he's tasked to accompany an Army ammo convoy led by ambitious Lt. McAllister Travers. Along for the ride are wrangler  exsergeant Toller Poitier shopkeeper's wife Ellen Andersson a former captive of the Apache who's regarded with disgust by her white neighbors and her embittered husband Weaver. They're intercepted by a large war party of the same Apaches who once held Ellen captive. As with films of this kind from The Last Wagon to Ulzana's Raid the male lead is a white man who understands the plight of the Indians sympathizes with them but nevertheless works for the whites. There's nary a letup in the darkness  intensity. Ellen the tortured exploited victim of both sides is no love interest while the only humor in the film comes in occasional rueful exchanges among the tough guys. But there's plenty of action in scenes as welldone as any of the period  budget. What makes Diablo stand out is the clever seamless depiction of the strategy as the ambushed convoy spars with the wily ruthless Apache. It's far more engrossing than almost any war movie including those with budgets many times larger. Andersson doesn't have much to work with but Garner  Poitier play their tough guys with just the right balance between expression  terseness. Weaver makes the most of his limited opportunity to develop the selfish husband who feels sorrier for himself than his wife over her horrifying torment. Diablo delivers action  adventure that never lags along with a strong dose of historicalsocial awareness but it's not the ticket for a light evening's entertainment. Director Nelson plays the colonel commanding the relief force.".

The themes that were explored in such films as The Searchers Trooper Hook and Two Rode Together are really explored far more here. There's also a little bit of Stagecoach in Duel At Diablo with Garner like John Wayne on a vengeance quest against the people who murdered his family.Sidney Poitier's part is interesting in that there really is no racial reference as far as his blackness is concerned. In fact Poitier having been in the army and fought the Apaches has just about the same attitudes towards them as the white characters do.This is a good western maybe a great one but not one for the faint hearted.".

Considering his appearance in one of my favorite films In The Heat Of The Night a classic study of racism and cultural fear I wondered how he reconciled the role of a former black military officer helping the cavalry protect a supply wagon through Apache territory with all the attendant characterizations of the red man as a hostile savage brute. But Toller Poitier did have character as demonstrated by the apology to Remsberg James Garner after learning of his wife's fate that was an excellent scene.Dennis Weaver surprised me with his portrayal of Will Grange showing a range of ability that far surpasses my singular impression of him as Matt Dillon's deputy Chester Goode. He figures in somewhat of a story twist when it's revealed that he had a hand in the death of Remsberg's wife. The showdown you were expecting for the entire film managed to play out in a manner that kept Garner's character honorable even if revenge was served. It was an effective way to handle the conflict.You know I'm surprised that an obvious continuity issue hasn't been noted yet regarding the picture. When Remsberg leaves the soldiers for Fort Concho he's riding a gray horse across the desert but in the scene when the horse collapses from heat exhaustion it's brown. A similar error occurs in the Western Comanche Blanco near the finale when William Shatner's horse changes color. It makes me wonder why film makers or even the principal actor can't remember how the scene started out so it can be finished without an obviously conflicting ending. They must have other things on their mind.At least it was gratifying to see that mathematical accountability came into play regarding the strength of both the Indian band and the cavalry. As the soldier forces dwindled references were made to that effect and you had a sense of the attrition. Contrast that with other Westerns where it often seems like one side or the other winds up with just as many men as they started with.You know it wouldn't have taken much to turn this one into a John FordJohn Wayne cavalry Western. Most of the elements were there except the peaks of Monument Valley and a romantic interest for the leading man. Still the inclusion of Ellen Grange Bibi Anderson as a conflicted white woman with an Apache baby added another layer of intensity to a film already chock full of angst driven characters. You knew she would make it to the end of the story the question being at what price.".

James Garner is the scout determined to find out who violated and butchered his Apache wife Sidney Poitier is the former officer turned gambler roped into coming along and Bill Travers is the stoic Cavalry lieutenant supervising the mission.It's great fun to see Mr. Poitier in this kind of setting and he handles his role with his standard dignity and smoothness while Garner is likable and charismatic as always and Travers does well as a basically good man who knows the odds are stacked against his men. The supporting cast is equally impressive beautiful Bibi Andersson is Ellen the wife of bigoted trader Willard Grange Dennis Weaver who has her own compelling subplot she'd once been kidnapped by Apaches and bore one of the tribe a son to whom she tries to return especially as Willard and other townspeople insist on giving her the cold shoulder. Also appearing are William Redfield as Sgt. Ferguson Bill Hart as Cpl. Harrington and John Crawford as Clay Dean. Director Ralph Nelson who'd previously directed Poitier towards a Best Actor Oscar win for Lilies of the Field appears on screen as Col. Foster using the pseudonym of Alf Elson and Richard Farnsworth has an uncredited bit as a wagon driver.Viewers can take note than even while these Indians are portrayed as the antagonists we can still feel sympathy for the way they are treated the same way we feel sympathy towards Ellen. Filmed in Southern Utah this is an absolutely gorgeous film extremely well shot by Charles F. Wheeler and given a nicely rousing score by Neal Hefti. Smart and fun at the same time Duel at Diablo does not have one dull moment to speak of delivering one huge set piece around the midway point and two concurrent showdowns for the big finish. Highly recommended to action and Western fans.Eight out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Out in the desert Jess Remsberg comes across Ellen Grange trying to get back to her Apache husband.  He rescues' her and returns her to her husband Willard who is too ashamed of her to accept her back.  While in town Jess gets roped in as a scout to help Lt McAllister drive across the desert with a troupe of rookie troops to reach Fort Conchos.  Horse trader Toller is also dragged along to finish breaking the horses he sold to the fort. Each has a different reason for going to Conchos  Jess is looking for revenge on the man who killed his Indian wife Grange for trade etc.  However when Chata's men attack the troop find themselves fighting for survival.As with many viewers I imagine I was drawn to this film by the strong list of names in the cast.  From the early scenes it is clear that this film takes a sympathetic view of the Native Americans and doesn't allow them to be portrayed as barbarians and such.  However after a few characters are set up who say nice things about the Indians the film then falls into standard fare where Chata's men are murderers torturers and without any real character to speak of within the script.  Aside from the rather apologetic muddle it gets itself into the basic plot is OK and ends up robbing most of the characters of nay of the decency that they might have had.  The focus is a series of gun battles between McAllister's men and Chata leading to the inevitable showdown and gradual picking off of each other's men.  It isn't great but it does the job in a rather gaudy fashion even if it's substance' is damaged by the poor subtext which can't decide it if wants to be PC or just brutal and with plenty of shoot outs.Other reviewers have commented on the film's brutality but mostly that is implied.  Some death scenes are brutal in your imagination but generally it isn't anything too different from what you'll else anywhere else.  The direction is also pretty workmanlike and has few if any touches that are really clever or unique however much worse is the score  it's very much of the sixties music and it doesn't fit the film.  What does really work is the cast.  Garner is good value and plays it pretty straight.  His revenge plot and his anger is not very well delivered though and he gets an easy out. Poitier's casting is a little ironic as he is the only one who doesn't seem to have any rage towards other races and has no anger directed towards him for his race.  He is cool and tough but has little meat on his bones. Andersson is a little wishywashy and is only given plenty to do in the early scenes where she defends her captors.  Weaver is good and unsympathetic and Travers is a weird bit of casting.  Never the most charismatic of leading men here he is a strange mix of a character and is accent is just strange and distracting  he can do broad and heroic' though and that is all that is really asked of him.Overall this is a workmanlike western that actually would have been more enjoyable if it had done it's apologetic subtext with more conviction.  It doesn't though and actually ends up just muddling it for the first half and then falling back into more familiar territory of Bmovie westerns. However it is still noisy enough to be fun and the presence of a number of famous faces help to make it feel better than it actually is.".

	onyx:emotionText "Out in the desert Jess Remsberg comes across Ellen Grange trying to get back to her Apache husband.  He rescues' her and returns her to her husband Willard who is too ashamed of her to accept her back.  While in town Jess gets roped in as a scout to help Lt McAllister drive across the desert with a troupe of rookie troops to reach Fort Conchos.  Horse trader Toller is also dragged along to finish breaking the horses he sold to the fort. Each has a different reason for going to Conchos  Jess is looking for revenge on the man who killed his Indian wife Grange for trade etc.  However when Chata's men attack the troop find themselves fighting for survival.As with many viewers I imagine I was drawn to this film by the strong list of names in the cast.  From the early scenes it is clear that this film takes a sympathetic view of the Native Americans and doesn't allow them to be portrayed as barbarians and such.

Bibi Andersson who practically glowed in Ingmar Bergman's movies is only a subsidiary character and looks like just another Hollywood blond. James Garner could be a fine actor when the role was right and Sidney Poitier was one of the most skilled of his generation. I have no idea why they dressed him up in a cowboy hat fancy vest skintight trousers and black boots.But what can you do with a B script that's enlivened by a few unusual incidents. Here are two unusual incidents. The Apache are chasing a cook wagon. And what do they do? They SHOOT ONE OF THE HORSE and the wagon has to stop! Hallelujah! Finally a move script allows the Indians to figure out that if you want to stop a wagon you don't necessarily have to pick off the guy driving it.Here's another incident. Dennis Weaver is a miscreant who finally sides with the good guys. It doesn't save him from being brutally tortured over a fire by the Apache to the point at which he later begs the cavalry men to kill him. The Apache by the way weren't racists. They were indiscriminately brutal as many other Western tribes were. Weaver may have been roasted alive but others were deboned beginning with their fingertips.But these scenes can't redeem a B script that has a lonesome patrol fighting overwhelming odds and being picked off one by one until the final and inevitable rescue by the rest of the cavalry. Want to know what would have been REALLY innovative? They all die. But then who would have paid to see the movie?Very nice location shooting though among bluffs that alternate gray strata with rust and the horses for some reason look beautiful not like just any old horse.".

	schema:reviewBody "This bold treatment of the usual cavalryversussavages story was widely recognized for it's occasional moments of sadistic violence and it's contemporary racial conflicts.  I see many reviewers also made mention of the offbeat score by Neal Hefti whose best known work is the Batman theme for television and his theme for THE ODD COUPLE it tends to work well for the most part with director Ralph Nelson's overall tone in DUEL AT DIABLO. The cast here is an eclectic but good one.  Garner is particularly convincing as a tough and worldweary scout.  DUEL AT DIABLO has a bitterness of mood but is generally exciting and entertaining.  This picture seems to be a prelude to Nelson's later far more brutal and overthetop cavalry movie the notorious SOLDIER BLUE.".

	schema:reviewBody "Welcome to gory bed or victory. Some gripping action and battle scenes filmed on magnificent locations in southern Utah desert. The guilt or revenge driven and money hungry citizens are accompanying a cavalry unit through Indian lands and trying to get a load of weapons and horses for those who need them at the other end of the journey. Some matrimonial and parental questions involving a halfbreed baby also need to be settled from the side of the white as well as the Apaches. The movie respectfully tries to make some goodhearted points at racism and greediness but much of it is left open somewhere half way or gets left under the feet of the roaming action. Or maybe there simply isn't any real answers.At the beginning I got the feeling like I was watching a western TVseries instead of a movie. That's probably because of the rather heavy use of period sound music. You get Apaches and whites dangling in the desert and the soundtrack is alive with the sounds of surf guitars and bongo drums. Not the best choice to my mind and I wandered if the makers had wanted to lure in young viewers or just had a bad taste. Don't get me wrong. I love the music and sounds from the sixties but there are right as well as wrong places for it. Fortunately the soundtrack picks up tremendously along with the pace and action once we're on the way and far in the desert.Good actors are able to bring some greatly needed life and interest into routinely scripted characters and situations. Sidney Poitier and Dennis Weaver have the biggest tasks of using their admirable skills and so make the most admired impressions. A kind of friendly nod to John Ford's cavalry westerns can be sensed from Bill Travers' Irish lieutenant. The biggest failure is that the few meaningful Indian roles have mostly been left in the traditional state of the wooden ones the nonchalantly stiff enemy. For a dedicated friend of westerns this is a pretty decent entry in the genre. But others might well find it a lot less meaningful or worth a watch.".

Well he didn't succeed at either but it wasn't for lack of trying. Jones herself was in a peculiar position similar to her husband's. She got an Oscar for her first feature film after she changed her name from Phyllis Isley to Jennifer Jones. Selznick knew that she couldn't play saints all her life as she did in The Song of Bernadette. So for this western answer to Gone With the Wind as Pearl Chavez she plays about as opposite a character from Bernadette Soubirous as you can get.Duel in the Sun got mixed reviews by the critics but the public ate it up. It's the story of the McCanless family parents Lionel Barrymore and Lillian Gish and sons Joseph Cotten and Gregory Peck. Cotten is the good son Peck the bad one. In fact as Lewt McCanless Peck played his worst character until Josef Mengele in Boys from Brazil.A kissing cousin of their's Jennifer Jones comes to live with them. She's the offspring of an old beau of Lillian's Herbert Marshall and the Indian wife he ran off with back in the day. Lillian and Herbert were kissing cousins also.As Pearl Chavez Jen gets the McCanless boys testosterone going into overdrive. Take one look at her and you can hardly blame them.One of the not so hidden subtexts of Duel in the Sun is racism. Jennifer's good for a quick roll in the hay but marriage is out of the question at least for Gregory Peck. Barrymore's and Peck's racism is overt the others not quite so but it's still there. The negotiations with Louis B. Mayer for Lionel Barrymore must have been interesting. Selznick's former wife was Irene Mayer Louis's daughter.One thing with Selznick he spared no expense. He got the best in talent for this film. Dimitri Tiomkin did the score King Vidor the direction Ray Rennahan the color photography which is absolutely stunning. He even got Bing Crosby to record Gotta Get Me Somebody to Love with Les Paul's guitar. Peck sang it in the film Crosby's record sold a few platters.He even got Orson Welles to do the offscreen narration if you don't recognize that voice. It misses being a classic mainly because Selznick couldn't keep his hands off it. Sometimes the acting is about as subtle as a sledgehammer from all the performers. I'm willing to bet it's Selznick more than Vidor.Yet it's good entertainment and Duel in the Sun does have its moments.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is like a painting by an old master that hangs in a museumwe may not be moved by it but we can still appreciate the artistry. Its most notable feature is the director King Vidor master of silent film making. As you might expect many of the important scenes have little or no dialog. In one scene between Lionel Barrymore and Lillian Gish he rambles on about their life together while she strains to get out of her sickbed and crosses slowly to him the entire distance transfigured by the depth of her love for him. Gish was a great star of silent film with a wonderful expressive face full of compassion and grace. In another scene that happens under quite different circumstances Jennifer Jones crawls to Gregory Peck the man she loves also without words evincing great sorrow and quiet dignity. In both cases the women prove they are far more noble than the men who love them so badly. Jones also has a mobile face together with a beautiful resonant voice. No film that has these two ladies at its center should be missed. In addition the film has two marvelous scenes that at the time of its making would have been just as impressive as some of today's special effects wonders In the first about 20 armed horsemen face a crowd of railway workers including some chinese clothed in authentic period dress with a steam engine in the background. As the tensions mount a troop of mounted cavalry about 100 strong ride onto the set filmed on location judging by the saguarros and ocatillos in Arizona. This was a tour de force of filmmaking at a time when shooting on location was rare. In the second scene a train under a full head of steam jumps the tracks and plows down an embankment. Filmed in early technicolor this movie has lush exteriors and panoramas of rich desert color. Two more character actors should be mentioned both of whom steal every scene they enter Butterfly McQueen the maid whose comments are both simple and profound and Walter Huston as the crusty sheriff who doubles as a preacher during a funeral.".

As the tensions mount a troop of mounted cavalry about 100 strong ride onto the set filmed on location judging by the saguarros and ocatillos in Arizona. This was a tour de force of filmmaking at a time when shooting on location was rare. In the second scene a train under a full head of steam jumps the tracks and plows down an embankment. Filmed in early technicolor this movie has lush exteriors and panoramas of rich desert color. Two more character actors should be mentioned both of whom steal every scene they enter Butterfly McQueen the maid whose comments are both simple and profound and Walter Huston as the crusty sheriff who doubles as a preacher during a funeral.";

She disrupts the household causing problems between two brothersone named Lewt Gregory Peck who's bad and Jesse Joseph Cotten who's good. She also is hated by the father Lionel Barrymore and protected by the mother Lillian Gish. Beautifully filmed in Technicolor this is a fun movie. The dialogue is full of howlers and for it's time this was pretty strong stuff. The emphasis is on sex and that bothered audiences in the late 40s. An entire dance by Jones was cut out and the release of the film was delayed because of the content! Today it's very tame and pretty funny.Jones is horribly miscast as Pearl. She's very beautiful and wears tight revealing clothing all through the film but her acting is terrible. She sneers and glares her way through all her scenes and seems incapable of saying any line believably. Peck is surprisingly very good playing an evil man. Cotten and Gish are stuck with thankless good person roles. Barrymore REALLY chews the scenery. And the opening narration is by Orson Welles!This movie was made by David O. Selznick to showcase his then girlfriend and future wife Jones. Purportedly he made this with serious intentions. It was a big hit but most critics dismissed it as trash. Today it's just a true camp classic. Hysterically bad but beautifully filmed and loads of fun. The climax especially is a howler. A great party flick.In it's own way this is a definite mustsee.".

What this restoration has done is to place the viewer back to 1946 at the premiere itself.Selznick's vision was huge romantic and sumptuous.  He had the means to spare no expense or effort in realizing this grandiose concept.  The result is a sweeping drama set in the west yet rising above the normal trappings of most movie westerns.First a trio of photographers headed by the peerless Lee Garmes and assisted by Ray Rennahan and Hal Rosson provided a rich and colorful canvas of romantic artistry and beauty.  Then a screenplay by producer Selznick emphasized the Gothic and overripe emotions with great relish.  If you're going to do it do it was the attitude.  Let the trash explode on the screen.  Added to this formidable group of artists came director King Vidor beautifully directing a carefully chosen and extremely talented cast and creating some magnificent and memorable set pieces.Lastly came the legendary composer Dimitri Tiomkin crafting a superb score exuding the pent up and released emotions of the characters and painting the hot and sultry essence of the desert setting.  The way to fully experience the Selznick vision is to take the time to position one's self before the DVD monitor adjust the sound volume to near peak level and absorb the score from the first note of the 15minute Prelude the 5minute Overture through the 144minute drama and continue until the final crashing chord of the 5minute Postlude Exit Music.  Only then will the true meaning and power of Duel in the Sun be realized.It's a oneofakind film work and a lasting tribute to that mad disorganized titanic and great genius of film production Selznick.".

She really demonstrates the weakness of the flesh that human beings deal with many times. She wants to be good but succumbs quickly to temptations almost every time.Gregory Peck also plays against type playing an arrogant pig in this movie. It was the first time I had ever seen him play the bad guy and it looked strange. Lionel Barrymore also shines as the bigoted tyranttype father. Who was the good guy? Joseph Cotten who almost always gives a good performance as the other actors just named. Add Herbert Marshall Lillian Gish Walter Huston and Charles Bickford and you have some cast!Some of the cinematography is nice too reminiscent of film noirs with the shadows and light and a number of night scenes.Yet despite all these positive things going for it it is not a film I would watch many times because it drags in spots and is too long app. 2 hours 20 minutes. It also gave a cheap shot to the traveling lay preacher in here but that's nothing new in films.All in all not one of my favorites. I guess I would rather see Jones and Peck play good guys.".

Gregory Peck and Joseph Cotton went through the paces of what they were asked to do as rivalry brothers.  But you kind of knew their hearts weren't in it.   Then there was the presence of Butterfly McQueen in her usual Gone With The Wind type performance.  Charles Bickford in an undistinguished role was wasted as was Herbert Marshall and Sidney Blackner all good actors. An impressive cast when the titles came on but what followed was not what you wanted to see.I got tired of seeing Jennifer Jones strutting about making faces of some indian halfbreed.  Boring.  Oh I liked the horse the pinto that she rode.  He was terrific.  Best to see this on video.  Doesn't come off that bad.  But it is a cornball western farce.".

Charles Bickford in an undistinguished role was wasted as was Herbert Marshall and Sidney Blackner all good actors. An impressive cast when the titles came on but what followed was not what you wanted to see.I got tired of seeing Jennifer Jones strutting about making faces of some indian halfbreed.  Boring.  Oh I liked the horse the pinto that she rode.  He was terrific.  Best to see this on video.  Doesn't come off that bad.  But it is a cornball western farce.";

	schema:headline " Magnificent and Colorful Western It Works as Drama and Tragedy Both";
	schema:reviewBody "More critical nonsense has perhaps been written about Duel in the Sun than about any other U.S. made film. It is a big intelligent and wellacted western. It had the great King Vido as the director for much of its beautiful footage plus contributions by several other veryfine directors. it was adapted from a good little novel by Niven Busch with a script credited to Oliver H.P. Garrett as adaptation to the screen and to Ben Hecht and David Selznick for the screenplay. Th sterling cinematography was done by the great lee Garmes Harodl Rosson and Ray Rennahan with production design by J. McMillan Johnson and art direction by James Basevi. Costumes were the work of famous designer Walter Punkett. Dimitri Tiomkin did the music and producer Selznick spared no expense to make this project work. He also quarreled with Vidor over the production and is probably responsible for the literate but needless fatality element and narrated prologue that alter the production a bit but do not harm it badly. The argument by socalled critics has been about scale. Selznick trying to repeat his triumph with Gone With the Wind they argued kept trying to make his films 'bigger'as if that were the key to an evengreater achievement in cinema for Selznick. But in this novel the author is the one who suggested that the saloon in which the central character's mother dances was very large I believe Selznick took this and the size of the desolate country within which the action takes place as cues for him to increase the physical scale of the drama. And for the most part his decision seems to me to have been unarguably a good one. Many of the shots from Vidor and the other directors are legendaryriders racing along the tops of hills in silhouette against colorful skies spacious interiors at the Spanish Bit ranch the sumphole sequence the great dance sequence that ignites the action at the film's beginning the train wreck disasters and many more... The storyline can actually be stated rather swiftly. Pearl Chavez is the daughter of an exotic female who dances and is married to a ne'erdowell cultured fellow a distant cousin of the wife of Senator McCanles owner of a huge ranch in the 1880s. After her father kills his mother over a lover and is hanged Pearl is sent to live with the McCanles family. From the first one son Jesse a lawyer is attracted to her and she to Lewton the wild cowboy scion of the family. She worries a lot about sin but to no avail since the viewer never sees any. What happens is a land dispute which alienates Jesse from the senator and sends Lewt on a rampage against the railroad who has challenged his father's empire of cattle and dictatorial pseudobenevolent despotism. he is also angry that Pearl has sent him away after being his lover. Realizing that she is as responsible as anyone for what Lewt has become blaming her own sexuality for his wrongness she goes after him and they shoot each other to rags on a desolate hillside as they were perhaps fated to do in a U.S. mental environment of pseudoChristian surrealism that helped make the Judge Lewt and Pearl what they felt they had to beand also set Jesse the normative mind in the piece as an outsider watching the dissolution of their hopes. The critics who have called the film neverdull bizarre and a product of Selznick's tampering with the script have all been obviously correct but as some have noted when it is big the film is very good and memorable. From the great theme song to the powerful scenes much of this reengineeredfatalistic drama works. In the leads Gregory Peck is handsome and showy which he needs to be to outshine his attractive but lesscharismatic brother very ably portrayed by Joseph Cotten. Lionel Barrymore does well as the dictatorial senator and Lillian Gish as his wife proves to be very skilled indeed. Herbert Marshall as Scott Chavez and Tilly Losch are extremely fine other very able supporting actors in the large cast who show to advantage include Walter Huston as a sinkilling preacher Charles Bickford Sidney Blackmer Butterfly McQueen Joan Tetzel Scott McKay Harray Caray and Otto Kruger. The central performer in the film is Jennifer Jones. I found her quiet and intelligent portrayal to be outstanding in every regard she was lovely repressed sensual bright feral and tormented by turns. If Selznick intended this film as a showcase for his wife's wide range of acting abilities I suggest it worked just about as intended. What is 'bizarre' about the film as a project I suggest apart from Selznick's torturing a simple melodrama into an epic drama and very cleverly too is that he then tried to reduce his splendid project to a diatribe against sensuality in order to turn its ending into a work of fate or a commentary on human weakness. The two strains work against one another in the film at certain times diminishing however only a little of the film's unusual power only channeling it toward occasional exaggeration. A splendid piece of filmmaking by Vidor and every one of the actors and creators involved in its realization".

	schema:reviewBody "Say you're 44yearold Hollywood producer David O. Selznick and it's been seven years and a World War since your last Technicolor feature Gone with the Wind which beat out not only The Wizard of Oz but Mr. Smith Goes to Washington Stagecoach and Wuthering Heights for the Best Picture Oscar of 1939. How does a nice Jewish boy from Pittsburgh top that? Why with Duel in the Sun so overblown and grandiose that it's acquired the nickname Lust in the Dust. The screenplay was written by Niven Busch whose wife was Teresa Wright for whom the female lead role was intended as a departure from her terminally wholesome image but in a spectacular piece of bad timing she became pregnant early in production and had to drop out. Selznick then offered the role to his 27yearold gorgeous Gentile girlfriend Jennifer Jones the former Phyllis Walker whom he later married. I don't know if the film's historical background is accurate but the action is set against the coming of the railroad to the Texas ranchlands and the opposition of the ranchers to the government's appropriation of rightsofway by eminent domain for their cronies the railroad magnates. Jones plays Pearl Chavez a halfbreed whose father kills Pearl's mother and her lover and is sentenced to death. Pearl goes to live with distant relatives on a ranch in Spanish Bit Texas and the sultry beauty's arrival immediately stirs up trouble in the already dysfunctional household aggravating tensions between the brothers Jesse and Lewt like lewd get it? McCanles. Jesse Joseph Cotten is the good but gutless son and Lewt a very young Gregory Peck is handsome and charming but also arrogant insecure and violent. Intrigue treachery and murder follow in Pearl's wake friends and family take sides and Pearl is torn between the two brothers who are welldefined good and bad characters. An attempted fratricide ensues leading up to a climactic confrontation at Squaw's Head Rock in the Mexican desert the lust in the dust part.This is filmmaking at its best and worst. The best The sets costumes outdoor locations and cinematography are magnificent except for one or two inexplicable goofs such as a brief scene where Lionel Barrymore in the center foreground is perceptibly out of focus. I've seen this film both in a theater and on TV and the richness of Technicolor comes through even on a TV screen. Even the computerenhanced color effects of modern films can't surpass the brilliance and subtlety of the old 3strip Technicolor process. There has just never been anything like it. The director was that old veteran of both silents and talkies King Vidor. The location shooting unusual in those days when productions rarely ventured off the studio backlot is spectacular. Some scenes such as the lineup of the U.S. cavalry across from a line of angry ranchers on horseback along a stretch of unfinished railroad track and the derailing of a train on a hillside are breathtaking even today. You do notice certain differences in the old technology for example there is a tracking shot of Pearl and Lewt on horseback where it may have been impractical to lay track for the camera which jiggles up and down in a way that you never see in these days of the Steadicam.The worst The overheated baroque melodramatic plot and the operatic stylized dialogue that had them on the edge of their seats in the 1940s will have you rolling in the aisles either with mirth or in severe intestinal distress in the 2000s. The casting is often equally absurd The Tulsaborn Jennifer Jones in brown body makeup playing a halfbreed. The Londonborn Herbert Marshall playing her father a Texas Creole. The Viennaborn Tilly Losch also in brown body makeup playing Pearl's mother an Indian. Gregory Peck does his best and maybe it's because of my memory of his later generally sympathetic roles but he is only marginally believable as the bad son Lewt.Lionel Barrymore had for a number of years been confined to a wheelchair because of crippling arthritis but that didn't stop him from working and he supplies his usual hammy melodramatic performance. Joseph Cotten does a serviceable job as Jesse although he seems too old for the part and in fact he was about the same age as Selznick so maybe there was symbolism there. Lillian Gish is excellent and the always brilliant Walter Houston chews up the scenery every chance he gets in his small role. No big splashy Western would be complete without Charles Bickford and Harry Carey and they look and act their parts perfectly here. The score by the legendary film composer Dmitri Tiomkin resembles the work of John Williams in that it more than makes up in enthusiasm what it lacks in subtlety.".

	schema:reviewBody "A halfIndian girl named Pearl Chavez Jennifer Jones is torn between the two sons of a wealthy cattle baron. Jesse Joseph Cotten is the educated mannered 'nice' one. Lewt Gregory Peck is a ladies' man and a bad boy. We can tell which is which because the good one typically wears lighter colors and the bad one wears darker colors. Helpful. Pearl just can't resist Lewt no matter how bad he treats her. Leave your political correctness at the door folks. This one's got a little something to offend almost everybody.Extravagant epic western from David O. Selznick was an attempt to achieve the same success of Gone with the Wind. It's pure tawdry hokum. Yet another starring vehicle for Selznick's protg and future wife Jennifer Jones. I've never been a huge fan of hers. She's certainly attractive enough with her high cheekbones and radiant smile. I even find her lisp endearing. But she was a very limited actress. Usually she was cast in sensitive parts where she spoke most of her lines in a whispery tone while soft music played. Here she plays to the rafters hamming it up so loudly she makes Hedy Lamarr's performance in White Cargo seem subtle. Starring with Jones are Gregory Peck and her frequent costar Joseph Cotten one of the few male leads the jealous Selznick trusted around his lady love. Cotten is perfect when wasn't he? but Peck is miscast and overacts even worse than Jones. The absurd ending with those two is justifiably infamous. The rest of the cast is made up of exceptional talents like Lionel Barrymore Lillian Gish Walter Huston Harry Carey and Herbert Marshall. The Dimitri Tiomkin score is fantastic. The sets and costumes are lavish as they should be given the high production values this one had. The Technicolor is gorgeous. The script is laughably awful. Some of the dialogue these poor people have to say is just cringeworthy. Overall it's a movie low on substance but high on spectacle. It keeps you interested throughout despite its flaws and maybe because of them. Definitely warrants a look but not everybody's cup of tea for sure.".

This one's got a little something to offend almost everybody.Extravagant epic western from David O. Selznick was an attempt to achieve the same success of Gone with the Wind. It's pure tawdry hokum. Yet another starring vehicle for Selznick's protg and future wife Jennifer Jones. I've never been a huge fan of hers. She's certainly attractive enough with her high cheekbones and radiant smile. I even find her lisp endearing. But she was a very limited actress. Usually she was cast in sensitive parts where she spoke most of her lines in a whispery tone while soft music played. Here she plays to the rafters hamming it up so loudly she makes Hedy Lamarr's performance in White Cargo seem subtle. Starring with Jones are Gregory Peck and her frequent costar Joseph Cotten one of the few male leads the jealous Selznick trusted around his lady love. Cotten is perfect when wasn't he? but Peck is miscast and overacts even worse than Jones. The absurd ending with those two is justifiably infamous. The rest of the cast is made up of exceptional talents like Lionel Barrymore Lillian Gish Walter Huston Harry Carey and Herbert Marshall. The Dimitri Tiomkin score is fantastic. The sets and costumes are lavish as they should be given the high production values this one had. The Technicolor is gorgeous. The script is laughably awful. Some of the dialogue these poor people have to say is just cringeworthy. Overall it's a movie low on substance but high on spectacle. It keeps you interested throughout despite its flaws and maybe because of them. Definitely warrants a look but not everybody's cup of tea for sure.";

In contrast the restored Technicolor was truly great and looked as modern as todayor even better. Technicolor was and is the best. Really beautiful color and the very best thingthe only great thingin the entire film.The story was so trivial and ridiculous in its view of love and barely cloaked sex and was also an hour too long and nearly as moronic as could be at the end as the I love you I hate you I shot you oh no I shot you and then you shot me excuse for dialog made me laugh out loud and wonder what they were smoking when the actors said it and the bosses approved it. Most viewers laughed at it and panned it too when it premiered but due to its gigantic scope for the era it did help lead Hollywood into the huge epic western films of the '50s. So it did do something right albeit indirectly and unintentionally.The obvious manmade totally fake howl of a coyote near the end summed it all up for me... fake coyote howl fake Southern California and Arizona locations standing in for Texas fake sunsets and rain clouds painted in fake horseback riding.....all typical effects for that day yes but they appeared really cheesy in a super expensive film that proved that SelznickVidor could not see these detractions for what they were and could not make a realistic film to save his life no matter how much he spent. Thus Selznick made a cartoon dud starring his truly gorgeous girlfriendhe was married the beautiful Ms. Jones.".

Yes stupid. It's hard to imagine having that big a budget and such wonderful actors and still having a 2ndrate film. That's because Joseph Cotton Gregory Peck Lillian Gish Lionel Barrymore and Charles Bickford and all the rest of this fine cast couldn't overcome the basic fact that the script is silly and trashy. Now I do not mean trashy as in dirtyI mean it more like a cheap dime novel with a lot of innuendo and sass. While this might have worked well as a Bpicture as a firsttier film it just looks all wrong. As a result the characters some of the stars must play are 2dimensional and stupidand completely miscast. Jennifer Jones as a sex kitten? No way could she pull this offremember folks this is the same actress that played St. Bernadette! And Gregory Peck as a whoremongering evil son? Nah...he just seems like he's too nice a guy to play such a jerk. Unless you are a diehard fan this movie is imminently skipable. This film only barely merits 4 stars because it is pretty to look at the ending is very good and a few of the performances are excellent such as Joseph Cotton as the good son.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is common for people to say that DUEL IN THE SUN was an attempt one of several for David Selznick to repeat his greatest production success in Hollywood. He had produced GONE WITH THE WIND and tried repeatedly to duplicate it. It was impossible. I feel the closes he got was with SINCE YOU WENT AWAY which is still a very moving film showing the alterations World War II caused on the home front. But his films with Hitchcock including REBECCA and SUSPICION and NOTORIOUS and SPELLBOUND and DUEL IN THE SUN and A FAREWELL TO ARMS all fall short. This does not mean the films are negligible. Most of the HitchcockSelznick partnership films are damned good and one finds even A FAREWELL TO ARMS worth watching. But GONE WITH THE WIND despite the stereotypes Margaret Mitchell put into it showed the collapse of a whole way of life in this country a century earlier due to the Civil War. It can't be reproduced in a western  the west was an entirely different problem of survival in a hostile atmosphere  not one that had built up a set of institutions unfortunately including slavery and traditions that were just destroyed.Still DUEL IN THE SUN tries hard and succeeds to some extent. The story is one of racism in 19th Century Texas. The McCandless Family Lionel Barrymore Lillian Gish Joseph Cotton and Gregory Peck are Texas royalty in a sense with a huge estate. It is supposed to be the equivalent of Tara in GONE WITH THE WIND. Into their world comes Lillian's cousin Jennifer Jones whose father was Mexican the father was Herbert Marshall. Marshall kills his wife and her lover at the start of the film and is hanged his execution scene is very moving actually as he willingly accepts his death but regrets the loss of his contact with his daughter. Barrymore hates the girl  she is part Mexican and part Indian he refers to her as Pocahontas at one point and he hates her dead father who may have had an affair with Gish. Barrymore favors his son Peck over the more civilized Cotton and the latter is aware of this. Peck is quite charismatic but he is also quite a murderous type. Luke McCandless was the wickedness villain Peck played prior to the film THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL thirty years later. Jones' Pearl Chavez is also wicked in her ways using her attractiveness to destroy men Cotton and Peck are both interested in her as is Charles Bickford. She likes Cotton but her inner sense realizes that she and Peck are very much the same and she wishes to win him. But Peck is too uncontrollable and he and Jones rarely get their chemistry together properly.There are some good moments the death of Gish when she confronts Barrymore on her death bed and the wind and rain push her porch rocking chair back and forth as she leaves this world. Or when Peck destroys a railroad track with dynamite and starts humming I've Been Working On The Railroad!The film got the nickname since taken by a comedy that starred Divine and Tab Hunter back in the 1980s of LUST IN THE DUST. This was due to the odd conclusion of the film. 194647 was a year where twice men and women killed each other in films. Orson Welles who narrates the start of this film would direct THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI the following year wherein Rita Hayward and Everett Sloane shoot each other in a crazy house hall of mirrors. But they really hated each other in that film. Here a desperate Jones shoots Peck to prevent him from killing Cotton and he returns the favor. Both bleeding to death from multiple wounds they crawl to each other and die in a final embrace. The mutual shooting has been subject to much interpretation. My guess is that the two characters were just so supersexed that it was impossible to imagine them riding off together into married bliss. Possibly they just had to destroy each other  certainly nobody else could have satisfied their desires. Whatever the reason it was the final reason that the film remains so memorable to this day.".

The Senator and Laura Belle have two sons Jesse Joseph Cotton and Lewton Gregory Peck. Jesse is a lawyer and is very thoughtful while Lewton is a violent spoiled manboy.

This all leads to a tragic shootout where death seems to be the only salvation.Recommendations Legendary director King Vidor creates an epic western more in line with Gone With The Wind than Stagecoach.

The acting is very good from the usual suspects Gregory Peck Lionel Barrymore Herbert Marshall Joseph Cotton Walter Huston as the PreacherSinkiller Charles Bickford as Sam Pierce the man who may be Pearl's last chance at happiness Harry Carey as Lem Smoot an old friend of the Senator's and Butterfly McQueen as Vashti the maid. With all that talent around I still must state that it is Jennifer Jones and Lillian Gish that make this epic worth watching. Jennifer Jones does a brilliant job with one of the most complex characters I have ever seen put to film and Lillian Gish especially in her final seen with Lionel Barrymore is so exceptional that words escape me. I can not imagine these two performances ever being replicated or improved upon. A visually stunning film with two great performances to sweeten the entire experience. Well worth a look.".

It was Irving Berlin's biggest stage success both quantitatively and qualitatively. It sure had the most hit songs coming out of it maybe the most for any Broadway show.Because they had Garland so they thought at MGM for box office producer Arthur Freed felt they could go with an unknown for Frank Butler. Both John Raitt and Howard Keel tested for the role and Keel won the toss. Then Keel broke his ankle falling off a horse on the set and they shot closeups and around him putting pressure on Judy Garland's fragile psyche. On top of that Frank Morgan who was playing Buffalo Bill died suddenly in the middle of the film. Most of it had to be reshot when Betty Hutton was borrowed from Paramount.Annie Get Your Gun was the perfect musical to appeal to the Rosie the Riveter crowd who competed and won in a man's world during World War II. Those women who became feminist icons certainly identified with another feminist icon in Annie Oakley.The real Annie Oakley was not as brassy as her character in Annie Get Your Gun. By all accounts Phoebe Annie Mosee aka Annie Oakley was a quiet retiring woman when away from the spotlight. She let her skill with weaponry do her talking.Irving Berlin wrote so many hits out of this film it's staggering. Ballads like They Say It's Wonderful and The Girl That I Marry were recorded by many artists down to the present. My Defenses are Down also sold quite a few platters back in the day.But of course the theatrical profession got its anthem when Irving Berlin wrote There's No Business Like Show Business. There's a really fine recording of it that Bing Crosby Dick Haymes and the Andrews Sisters did of it with the flipside being Anything You Can Do also another gem from this show.Some songs didn't make the cut. A good one that Ethel Merman did called I Got Lost in His Arms is absent from this film a pity. And Berlin wrote a song called Let's Go West Again which was to be done on the cattle boat by Hutton and the ensemble was cut. Al Jolson made a recording of it for Decca though.Louis Calhern and Edward Arnold as Buffalo Bill and Pawnee Bill play a fine pair of frontier rogues. Calhern captured the character of the real later Cody quite well.With feminist issues by now means settled Annie Get Your Gun is maybe more relevant now than when it first came out.".

For me the main reason for this is Betty Hutton's performance  I'm no fan of her bombastic delivery and don't understand why so many comediennes of the era felt it necessary to pull faces and eschew their femininity in order to obtain laughs. Judy Garland was a fine movie comedienne as well as a firstrate singer and she never resorted to the overblown style of Hutton and her ilk. Garland would have been much better in the role had her health been good but from the numbers she did film it's clear from her gaunt features and skeletal frame that she was not well and this illness is sadly reflected in her performance. Watching her in these outtakes it's difficult to believe that only ten years before she had portrayed Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz.The trouble with Hutton's style is that when she is called upon to come over all sensitive for her romantic numbers she has to become a completely different person someone whose gentle sensitivity is totally at odds with the comical hayseed that she is portrayed to be most of the time. She even loses her hillbilly accent. Her love interest here is Howard Keel who booms out his numbers with gusto but comes across as bland when sharing the screen with her which makes their romance that much less believable. The highlight of their pairing  and the film  is 'Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better' a comedy number that elevates the film above the ordinary for a while. Like Keel Louis Calhern is curiously understated in his role as Buffalo Bill but Keenan Wynn gives a fine performance as Charlie Davenport Bill's righthand man.".

She has plenty of energy and she is able to be engaging without looking as if she's taking things too seriously. It's odd to think what the movie would have been like if Judy Garland had stayed in the role since she would surely have given Annie a much different persona.The story has a few good moments but for the most part it is a relatively predictable way to pass the time between the songs several of which are very good. Howard Keel works all right as Frank Butler but whether it is him or the way the character is written it's hard to care much about Frank despite his good points. There are some good moments of tension between the two leads but it doesn't ever really seem to capitalize on the best possibilities. In particular the closing sequence seems a bit too pat to be satisfying.This is the kind of musical that is best to watch when you just want some reasonable variety entertainment and are not going to be too critical of the content.".

	schema:reviewBody "The only reason to recommend this fluffy film is the great works of Irving Berlin. The fact that Berlin wrote the score and songs for the musical makes it the more impressive. Some film musicals pick the ideal songs from the existing works of a song writer.Other than that there is not much to the film. The art direction is disappointing for a MGM film musical despite of its huge budget.

	schema:headline " The HuttonKeelBerlin musical comedy romance masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "I have fond memories of this film as it was our senior class play with a great but not as great cast. Not surprisingly this film version of the Irving Berlinscored Broadway play of the same title was among the top box office draws of '50 and clearly is the pinnacle of the film career of bombastic star Betty Hutton although she subsequently was the female lead in The Greatest Show on Earth which was voted the Oscar and Golden Globe awards for best film of '52. Initially there were a number of problems settling on who was going to play Annie and Buffalo Bill and who was going to be the director. Judy Garland was slated to be Annie with Frank Morgan as BB thus reteaming 2 of the stars of The Wizard of Oz. In addition Busby Berkeley who had directed 3 of the 4 Mickey  Judy musicals was the original director. Well as it turned out none of these 3 got very far into making this film. As with the 4th Mickey  Judy musical Judy clashed with Busby. Hence it was again decided that he was the more expendable. But Judy's tardiness continued thus she was soon fired as well. Morgan died just as filming was getting underway. Garland's contemplated replacements included Doris Day Betty Grable and Betty Hutton all vivacious blonds with musical and comedic talent. Unfortunately all were tied to other studios. MGM was able to strike a deal with Betty's Paramount studios hence she ended up with the role. DD was greatly disappointed but eventually was given the consolation prize of Calamity Jane with a rather similar role with Keel again the male lead. This was only Keel's second film role and his first that featured him singing. He was tall quite handsome with a great strong baritone voice thus scripting Betty to mug insanely when she encounters him in the early going. Keel had had extensive experience starring in some of the top Broadway musicals including Oklahoma. Nonetheless Betty got more of the solos with them doing several impressive back and forth duets as in They Say It's Wonderful and Anything You Can Do. In a later interview Betty reported that most of the MGM crew including Keel strongly resented her taking Judy's place and treated her as a virtual outcast even though at a much later reunion of the surviving cast members she was praised for her performance. Keel of course would go on to star in several additional high profile musicals including  Showboat Kiss Me Kate Seven Brides for Seven Brothers as well as Calamity Jane.Your opinion of this film will probably largely hinge on your perception of Betty. Most people seem to either love her or hate her with few in between. I'm obviously in the first group. This was clearly her masterpiece not to discount Keel's and Berlin's contributions. Comparing the outtakes of Judy's versions of two of the singing scenes I hope you will agree that Betty's versions are clearly more interesting with her exaggerated expressions and mannerisms. Some complain that she grossly overacted. But that was just her style of being funny and dramatic as is true of most comedians. Some complain about her singing. True occasionally her voice was too weak or often included an intentional raucous component but that was to emphasize her mood or enthusiasm. She could put over rousing songs  like There's No Business Like Show Business with great gusto and expressiveness. She could also make weepy ballads sound convincing. One particularly memorable scene has her clownishly imitating Keel's prior The Girl That I Marry then dissolving into a weeping continuation of the song as she compares herself with his stated ideal in a wife. Who else could have done that as effectively?Yes the 'Indians' were sometimes portrayed as 'wooden Indians' or as howling savages. But the staid Sitting Bullthe usually humorous J. Carrol Naish gave her sound adviceand a defective rifle in her pursuit of Frank ButlerKeel. Some may see the idea that a woman should let her guy feel superior to herself as sexist. But especially in the times of the real Annie women were supposed to generally stay in the background. Even today this is unfortunately often sound advice. Ironically the real Frank Butler was an exception to this rule. Women who are unusually talented or ambitious need to be smart in picking a man who is comfortable in supporting them. Often an older mansuch as Frank who has already achieved success or fame and is in a position to further her career is the right choice.Of course as in the case of the '36 Annie Oakley considerable liberty was taken with the details of the historical Frank  Annie relationship. For instance Annie didn't become Frank's stage shooting partner until some years after they married and they didn't join BB's show until 10 years later! Annie was nothing like the flamboyant Betty nor Ethel Merman in the Broadway version!. She was a dutiful conservative Quaker. Actually BB sometimes also featured another young shootingtrick riding sensation in Lillian Smith who much more resembled Betty's version of Annie in being flamboyant and a flirt!Other films you may enjoy from this era that feature women in traditionally men's roles include Comanche Territory Against All Flags The Ballad of Josie Calamity Jane Montana Belleand Montana".

As we all know Judy Garland was originally cast as the guntoting Annie Oakley but was replaced with Betty Hutton due to ill health. Now Hutton of course is not in the same league as Judy and she's really not a great actress. She's constantly mugging at the camera and has a look of being permanently surprised. But her overacting suits the role of Annie and she's a really integral part in the success of this lively musical in a western setting. Backwoods girl Annie's shooting abilities are discovered when she outguns champion sharpshooter Frank Butler Howard Keel in a smalltown contest. Of course the two as in real life fall for each other after all didn't Gun Crazy show us a year earlier that through history couples that shoot together stay together...but may not stay alive for very long!. Competitive rivalries play out in a good oldfashioned battle of the sexes before true love wins out and I thoroughly enjoyed the sparring. The film has a sort of anticlimatic final scene. Throughout the film Annie has asserted herself as Keel's equal and Keel and Hutton belted out that great number Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better. So when she wins Frank with a gun that is rigged against her isn't a reversal of everything the story is trying to establish? She lets his ego win out. But then she has an ego too and women didn't get much chance to express let themselves in those days usually let alone with shooting. The numbers are mostly wonderful especially the classic There's No Business Like Show Business. Keel is charming and a hunk. The MGM soundstage stands in as usual for all the outdoors action but as this has a show setting and most of the backdrops are actually for a show it doesn't stand out so much apart from that gloriously fake train love scene.".

Yes Betty Hutton is over the top but her energy carries the show just as every stage production of this show requires an energetic Annie. Howard Keel is wooden but sings well. The rest of the characters are rather onedimensional so there is not much for the supporting actors to work with. The plot is operatic. One must suspend belief in order to enjoy it. Feminists must hate it especially as it perverts the historical truth about Annie Oakley. Annie won against him formed a partnership but became the star Frank being her manager and assistant a great achievement for a woman in the late 19th century. Perhaps the postWW2 era required a message for working girls to get back to the kitchen after they had run industry during the war. Also politically incorrect is the treatment of Indians native Americans please!. There are some great lines but there are also some exchanges that made me cringe with embarrassment. Again we need to accept these as attitudes of the time. It is interesting to read the comparisons between Hutton Mermann and Garland. I think that Betty Hutton was right for the screen role. Ethel Mermann did a great job on stage with the original libretto which is much more raunchy than the one needed for a General Exhibition film. Mermann would have given the film a totally different slant. The outtakes with Judy Garland show that she could not have handled the part despite a nice voice. Lacking in energy the scenes that were shot were flat and they were the best parts of the show. There was another song written for the film Let's Go West which ended up on the cutting room floor. Not a memorable song but without it there is a long section without music touring Europe. The film flags here. This is a stage musical that has been filmed. Showboat suffered for a similar reason. Perhaps not until The Sound of Music and Camelot did American musicals look like they were filmed on location. I found the miming  dubbing quite poor my modern standards and I am surprised that some of the scenes were not reshot as Betty Hutton clearly forgot some of the words. There is also a bad piece of editing in Doing What Comes Nacherly where one take is clumsily butted onto another. I haven't seen any later versions of Annie Get Your Gun. Are they any better? I doubt that they could be.".

The pace is pretty good the jokes come pretty quickly so you don't too much time to think things through. And again this is not a movie that is grounded in Reality.

Gets what in the end? Screwed of course. That is one of the most factual taglines I have seen in a long time. Within the short running time of this comedy every last character becomes screwed in one way or another. No other commentary better fits the promotions of this production. Former Saturday Night Live star Norm Macdonald is an unhappy chauffeur named Willard Fillmore. He is employed by his dead father's mistress the wealthy but cruelspirited Virginia Crock Elaine Stritch who owns a enormous bakery corporation and a cute little dog. Ms. Crock never grants Willard gifts raises nor does she compliment him for his hard and loyal services. Rusty P. Hayes David Chappelle is Willard's best friend a pot smoking young man destined to earn minimum wage for the rest of his seemingly pitiful life. The two buddies decide they have had enough of Crock's inhumanity and are ready to get even with the witch. They plan to abduct her precious canine to hold for a million dollar ransom. With the help of a deranged morgue attendant named Grover Cleaver Danny DeVito the unlikely pair set out for revenge and criminal riches.  As their after dark heist for Crock's pet takes place Willard and Rusty's dim minds cannot handle the pressure. The unsuccessful seizure results in severe bleeding a misinterpreted reimbursement note and a crime site appearing as though a brutal murder has taken place. All of this and yet the mission's target ends up escaping the captors and finding its way back in bed next to Crock. Virginia Crock discovers a room in her mansion ransacked and destroyed therefore when she reads the ransom note regarding the assumed capture of her dog she thinks the reading indicates Willard himself is the hostage. When Detective Tom Dewey Daniel Benzali becomes involved with the missing persons' case Rusty gets an idea instead of abducting the dog they should agree with what the presses are addressing. Complicated chaos ensues leaving nearly every character screwed by the time the film's finally roles around.  Screwed works mostly in part of the flawless casting choices. Danny DeVito makes the film alike in his character to his diabolic portrayal of the Penguin in Batman Returns with exaggerated gestures and irresistible makeup and costume. No other actress could have captured the spiteful annoying character of aging Ms. Crock like Elaine Stritch who gives a specific style to Crock that we love to hate. Norm Macdonald once again proves he cannot act worth a hill of beans but he sure provokes amusing material through his character.This production is of nothing intellectual or deeply engaging nor is it anything thoughtprovoking in the least. The deadpan dialogue is bland lacking creatively and liveliness. There are also undeveloped characters scenes and subplots irrelevant to the story and even some humor unworthy of a smirk. However Screwed has one major element that makes it effective the movie induces some big laughs. Many of today's comedies fail to bring about a single chuckle in an audience and this movie frequently made me guffaw giggle grimace and at certain points laugh until it hurt. Judging Screwed in this method the film is worth the watch.".

Complicated chaos ensues leaving nearly every character screwed by the time the film's finally roles around.  Screwed works mostly in part of the flawless casting choices. Danny DeVito makes the film alike in his character to his diabolic portrayal of the Penguin in Batman Returns with exaggerated gestures and irresistible makeup and costume. No other actress could have captured the spiteful annoying character of aging Ms. Crock like Elaine Stritch who gives a specific style to Crock that we love to hate. Norm Macdonald once again proves he cannot act worth a hill of beans but he sure provokes amusing material through his character.This production is of nothing intellectual or deeply engaging nor is it anything thoughtprovoking in the least. The deadpan dialogue is bland lacking creatively and liveliness. There are also undeveloped characters scenes and subplots irrelevant to the story and even some humor unworthy of a smirk. However Screwed has one major element that makes it effective the movie induces some big laughs. Many of today's comedies fail to bring about a single chuckle in an audience and this movie frequently made me guffaw giggle grimace and at certain points laugh until it hurt. Judging Screwed in this method the film is worth the watch.";

They blasted the plot in response I ask you readers who watches a Norm McDonald movie for its plot?  They blasted the acting in response I ask you...well you get the picture.What I'm trying to say is this movie is hilarious.  McDonald Chapelle Devito Sherman Hemsley et. al. are there to make you laugh not to court the Academy for their respective Oscars and they succeed marvellously. Screwed's pace is just perfect the laughs are fast and frequent although you are given a slight breather just before the next joke hits.  Some of the jokes don't work as in any comedy but more often than not they hit the mark flawlessly.  Yes gore innuendo vulgarity all of it appealed to the 18 year old author of this review and got him laughing.In conclusion this movie rules and I'm ashamed that the critics millions of Americans put their trust in have condemned Screwed.  Apparently they were just to highbrow for it and forgot how much fun a good vulgar comedy can be if one leaves his inhibitions at the door and stops trying to be the artaristocrat he thinks he is.".

I just don't understand how they could make this movie and throw feces all over the memory of the first one. The only thing the movie had going for it was that the two guys who played Lloyd and Harry looked like Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels if you kinda squinted and turned your head at the right angle.

I just don't understand how they could make this movie and throw feces all over the memory of the first one. The only thing the movie had going for it was that the two guys who played Lloyd and Harry looked like Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels if you kinda squinted and turned your head at the right angle.

It's the first day of high school and Harry who previously has been home schooled by his mother needs someone to show him the ropes. Lloyd who lives in the school's basement with his adoptive dadschool custodian Ray turns out to be just the guy. They unknowingly fall into the web of the corrupt Principal Collins and his girlfriend head lunch lady Ms. Heller who want them to be the first students in a phony special needs class in order to bilk 100000 in grant money for themselves. Harry and Lloyd go out to look for more students for this new class they catch the attention of Jessica Matthews a hardhitting reporter for the school's newspaper who suspects foul play. The plot sounds like it has some potential but the execution is very bad. This has to be the most pointless film of 2003 and one of the least funniest as well. Most of the jokes just fall flat and apparently the filmmakers weren't trying at all. I can see now why Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels backed out of this one. They are replaced by Eric Christian Olsen and Derek Richardson. Derek and Eric both play their roles dumb they just try to hard most of the time and aren't funny. Eugene Levy is embarrassingly bad and this has to be his worst film ever. Mimi Roger's role is small but its nice to see her on screen. She is also one of the few saving graces in this film. The rest of the cast is mostly unfunny except for Bob Saget who does have some funny moments. Troy Miller does a poor job of directing and writing as he didn't seem to really put a lot effort in. People are defending this film saying that you can't take every film seriously. I wasn't taking this film seriously and it still wasn't very funny. There might had been a laugh here or there but that's it. The original was fine and didn't need a prequel to explain what happened before and this film just ruins the original. The running time is also a good thing as its only 82 minutes long though sometimes it feels longer. Is this film better then the original? No not even close and this comedy should be forgotten. In the end this film is not worth the time or money to watch and its better if you just skip this. Rating 3.310 rent the original instead.".

It is worth the money to go see this if you don't take yourself too seriously.I think that the people that made this movie are having the last laugh it will go over 30 million by the end of next week.  For a movie any movie to bring in 30 million bucks on about a 15 million dollar budget is a coup.  After this is all said and dumb with the DVD sales and the HBO licensing this movie will make a cool 50 million bucks profit easily.Stop taking yourselves too seriously go watch a stupid movie and laugh your ass off.  Hell if we can sit through a funny movie maybe we can all lighten up a little in these way too serious world.";

The harder they try the worse it gets. Also the story is nothing. Even a children's movie has got a more intelligent story line than this film. Dumb and Dumber are such a great characters. As well as in the previous real movie as in the cartoon. Unfortunately they really don't take advantage of it because the movie is even dumber than the characters.So only watch this movie if you are really and I mean REALLY bored! Else don't even bother to think about it! That's why I rate is 110.".

The movie talks upon the adventures and misfortunes of two no brain teenagers from the beginning their acquaintance  when Harry Derek Richardson and Lloyd Eric Christian Olsen meet themselves at high school . The picture narrates the various pranks  the mischiefs with schoolmates and teachers Eugene Levy . The respective parents Mimi Rogers and Luis Guzman try to resolve the problems without success . They are idiot pals who are continuously doing jokes and seeing lustfully by the opposite sex . The film mingles irony  chuckles  giggles  comedy and numerous sex jokes . And of course  there's very bad taste  being the extreme when happen the incredible scenes on the crap in the bathroom . The comedy is cheesy and grossout but has some moments here and there . The film is an embarrassing and absurd mess  the plot is ridiculous and monotonous and is formed by several humor set pieces  being quite disagreeable and graceless . There are some steamy hot scenes and some memorable and hilarious happenings of dirty humor which will rejoice the rogue aficionados to these kinds of things . Neither the players  nor the filmmaking seem to be nice  and the storyline is utterly embarrassing  but  curiously  it has some amusing moments and I found myself laughing in some times of the movie . Eric Christian Olsen was repeatedly denied the role of Lloyd because the producers thought he was too goodlooking . It was only after seeing some homevideo footage of Eric in full makeup improvising a scene with alreadycast Derek Richardson that they gave him the role . The cast secondary is pretty good  such as  Luis Guzmn  Rachel Nichols  Eugene Levy  William Lee Scott  Shia Labeouf  Bob Saget  Julia Duffy and Mimi Rogers . Lin Shaye was the only cast member to star in both the original Dumb and Dumber and the sequel . The motion picture takes part of the large group about filthy and dirty humor  such as  Scary movie  American pieand sequels . The previous film Dumb and dumber is much better  plus  there were Jeff Daniels and Jim Carrey who are greatest actors  here the protagonists are unknown . Rating  It's a awful turkey . Disconcerting as well as inferior sequel and bottom of barrel . Yawner and snooze is continued.".

	schema:reviewBody "First off I have to say that Dumb and Dumber is one of my alltime favorite films.  I've seen it countless times and it's just as funny as it was the day I first saw it.  That being said I was delighted to hear that a prequel was going into development in late 2002.  The fact that Carrey and Daniels were not returning was a bit upsetting at first but the fact that it takes place in 1986 would just make them feel out of place and I was more than willing to give new actors a chance.  After the official trailer people bashed the flick relentlessly vowing never to watch it because it looked like pure shit and nothing more.  I on the hand couldn't wait until June 13th.I was there opening day and I have to say this is hands down the funniest film I've seen in a long time.  There were a few nods and references to the original and Derek Richardson and Eric Olsen really perfected the parts of Harry and Lloyd.  Everyone seemed to love the Bob Saget cameo myself included.  Funny funny stuff.There were a couple of major problems however.  First of all there are anachronistic errors littered throughout the music being the most distracting.  Artists like Vanilla Ice and Good Charlotte certainly were not around in '86.  Another problem is the editing.  Test audiences weren't big fans of this film as it was trimmed down from 115 minutes to 82 minutes. Luis Guzman and Mimi Rogers had decentsized roles but in the final product their presence was just about wasted.  They even went as far as to delete a musical number and scenes from Lloyd's childhood i.e. how he eventually came to live with Ray.But despite being historically incorrect and having major editing issues the film was still full of laughs and ends up being an enjoyable way to spend an hour and twenty minutes.".

I entered the theater with a highly skeptical attitude toward this prequel to a classic movie that I love for its total randomness stupid hilarity and countless other details Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels brought to the part. The movie began with some of the most terrifically horrible ads I've ever seen in my life and I was losing hope for this movie rapidly if this was how they were going to front the audience before playing it. And then it began...and I was extremely impressed! The actors sincerely looked and acted like teenage versions of they're predecessors and as such a great on screen team the laughs never subsided when Lloyd and Harry were in the scene.I found only a few faults that would irritate the average moviegoer and criticizer of this movie as they bugged me ever since I left the theater. One is that Lloyd Jim Carrey's old part is very controlling of Harry and is a 'jerk' the majority of the way through the movie which really got on my nerves. In addition Harry seemed too laid back and just let Lloyd treat him somewhat negatively. Also there was almost no plot line! In the first 1994 movie there was an ultimate goal a reason for the movie. In this prequel there was one but it seemed as though New Line Cinema Stuck it in there just for spite. Thirdly they didn't film it in the same way as the first! In Dumb and Dumber every place the characters went several funny things happened there that the viewer remembered later as the 'Cafe scene' or the 'beer scene'...In Dumb and DumberER each clipping was significantly shorter leaving the audience to figure out later what happened or why something occured which is in truth an insanely poor moviemaking technique that irritates.Besides those problems however and despite this movie being very different than its wellloved predecessorit's hilarious! Many parts I found myself not able to breathe from laughing so hard and maybe you need to be a teenager as I am to fully comprehend the jokes but it was hilarious in its own way. This is a movie you'll want to take your crew of friends to and laugh at all the sickening stupidity and overall dumbererness of the first adventures when Harry met Lloyd. I was impressed as it excelled past the standards I set for this flick and maybe you will think so as well. Give it a try and go see it! An 8 out of 10 stars. Fantastically humorous and well..dumb!".

Anywayz I went into this movie with my brother and we laughed out loud. Yeah there were some not so funny scenes but it was still hilarious! Especially Bob Sagat! Eric Christian Olsen play Lloyd Christmas very well but Derek Richardson is alright. I didn't think Eugene Levy gave his best but Cheri was very funny! And that Rachel Nichols lady is mighty fine! Anywayz all in all this movie made me laugh I wasn't disappointed and I'm going to buy it when it comes out on DVD! I do have a life but I can't put a movie down that easily like Dreamcatcher but this movie I didn't feel sorry for! But yes this movie could've done better with the Farrelly Brothers! I hope they get the thought to making a sequel and bring back Jim Jeff and Sebass! Although Dumb and Dumberer is funny stuff my man! 4 stars out of 4 starsSincerely Sidekick Jolly!".

	schema:reviewBody "One of those films that will astound you in that it actually got made. The script and direction here are poor and some of the 'comedic' performances are nonexistent. But then again dialogue wise nobody has really anything to work with. The first film was made on the basis of a strong script. This sorry mess is made simply on the basis of a 'good' idea that being lets cash in on the first one.The studio probably commissioned this after seeing only a treatment or maybe even just a pitch which probably went something like Dumb and Dumber made a lot of money. Lets make another one. If that's the case then they should have got some performers who are good at improvisation but alas.To the film itself.....the leads do a good impersonation of Carey and Daniels but lack the comedic flair and material. It must have been a tough job I admit but the Loyd Christmas character struggles to get any laughs at all. The Harry takeoff fairs better though. The one scene in the film which had me laughing was set in the school babe's house when she invites Harry round for dinner. But this was about the only one which had the whole audience or indeed even part of it going. It involved some pretty base toilet humour but in this movie you take the chuckles where you can. As for the plot. What can I say?! Its a prequel to the aforementioned original set during the terrible twosome's school years. And really that's about as much info as you need in terms of the character's motivations.In regards to the other more notable cast members present here Eugene Levy stole the show in 'American Pie' but most of his scenes here stink of being painfully underwritten. He almost looks embarrassed to be in it. Also the rest of the kids in the special needs class just ain't funny. For a start they don't actually do anything and when they do get screen time they are about as charismatic as a career stoner. And when we find out that the Asian foreign exchange student is actually American the general reaction is not laughter but more wondering 'Who is she again?' I don't know why Mimi Rogers and Luis Guzman are in this. Their roles are small and uninteresting. I think that's meant to be the joke. Ha Ha. Also that Loyd's dadGuzman is an Hispanic for some unexplained reason. Wacky! The role that must get the most criticism though is that of the store clerk. This guy's timing and general acting if you could call it that are just terrible. He stinks the house out . I can only imagine that they found him on the street and were unlucky to uncover America's worst performer. I mean what kind of audition  if any did he go through for this? He has a gratingly monotone voice and a face you would like to hit.In summary you can see 90 of the laughs coming and when they do come they ain't funny the ending has huge plot holes in it that are never explainedI know. I may have taken it a bit too seriously and even the outtakes struggle to raise a snigger. The film has the same poor pacing and direction of 'Dude.Where's my car?' but is even less funny than that piece of h!t. 310".

The movie was actually made about three years before it was released but had alot of production and marketing problems. There are some pretty good suspenseful moments for this low budget film. Fatal Charm does have some weak moments due to the script but that's to be expected. The performances are pretty good especially Peterson's. Mary Frann  from Newhart plays a less than perfect mother. Although she no longer acts professionally she is one of her best performances. I do suggest renting this movie if you happen to run across or don't have anything better to do.

	schema:reviewBody "Not exactly a horror film but definitely not for the squeamish. Dumplings follows the tale of a Hong Kong dumpling maker and a TV actress who feels past her prime her husband is having an affair with a younger woman. Dumpling maker Aunt Mei has a secret formula that can restore youth and extend life. The audience is gradually let in on the secret ingredient and the details grow more and more gruesomely explicit as Aunt Mei maintains her cheerfully glamorous housewife demeanour. When you know this is a really sick movie the director piles it on thicker and thicker casually filtering in lurid details amid a beautiful montage. OK you've been warned. The description above should tell you whether you want to stay away or make a beeline for the next showing.The exquisite cinematography and much of the resulting elegant and sophisticated look of the film can be attributed to Christopher Doyle whose work includes such visually stunning gems as 2046 Infernal Affairs The Quiet American and In the Mood for Love. Dumplings might be in poor taste but it is served up with delicacy and finesse and with much of its 'horror' deriving from the believability of the basic plot.As you come out of the cinema other members of the audience may look at you as if you are the most depraved person in the world for sitting through 90 minutes of such stuff so just remember they did too . . .".

	onyx:emotionText "Not exactly a horror film but definitely not for the squeamish. Dumplings follows the tale of a Hong Kong dumpling maker and a TV actress who feels past her prime her husband is having an affair with a younger woman. Dumpling maker Aunt Mei has a secret formula that can restore youth and extend life. The audience is gradually let in on the secret ingredient and the details grow more and more gruesomely explicit as Aunt Mei maintains her cheerfully glamorous housewife demeanour. When you know this is a really sick movie the director piles it on thicker and thicker casually filtering in lurid details amid a beautiful montage. OK you've been warned. The description above should tell you whether you want to stay away or make a beeline for the next showing.The exquisite cinematography and much of the resulting elegant and sophisticated look of the film can be attributed to Christopher Doyle whose work includes such visually stunning gems as 2046 Infernal Affairs The Quiet American and In the Mood for Love. Dumplings might be in poor taste but it is served up with delicacy and finesse and with much of its 'horror' deriving from the believability of the basic plot.As you come out of the cinema other members of the audience may look at you as if you are the most depraved person in the world for sitting through 90 minutes of such stuff so just remember they did too . . .";

Not because it didn't impress me or repulsed me as it did others but it simply got lost in the shuffle of so many other great features of 200405 that I'm still making my way through. The film opens up with Ling Bai going through the airport with the camera loosely following the pinko decorated lunch box then letting her into the frame and a thought immediately rushed into my head what was the last time that I really enjoyed anything with Ling Bai?. Seems like an easy enough question. Couldn't possibly have been a film called She Hate Me or the atrocity that was My Baby's Daddy. Her appearance on VH1's career decapitation of a show But Can They Sing? clearly won't be raising her stock as a serious actress yet there's still something mystifying about her. Enough to actually fit into the eeriness of this film.My intuitions got reassured as Miriam Yeung walked into the perfectly disarrayed blockades of projects of Hong Kong where the director captured the cold blue ambiance and already achieved something out of almost nothing. Ling Bai effortlessly portrays Mei a selfemployed cook and she is her own best advertisement and her dumplings? well they just maybe the best cure for anyone wanting to preserve and restore his or her youthfulness. Miriam plays Mrs. Lee a retired actress willing to pay the high price for these special dumplings financially and morally. She is actually the complete opposite of her character in real life agewise but her voice and naturally mature looks achieve plausibility and especially come in handy with the progression of the story. Not a bad stretch for Miriam who spends most of her acting time in fluffy romance comedies.Her primary cause of seeking rejuvenation is to regain the affection of her husband Mr. Lee played by Tony Leung Ka Fai who just happens to be an unemotional womanizer and a health nut himself. The pacing of the film might be a slight nuisance to some while not as stagnating and demanding as Ming Tsai's 7 to 400 Blows or Hsiao Hou's Caf Lumiere. At the same time don't expect a charade of gory outbursts done purely for the sake of shocking you as the film takes a concentrated approach and builds up tension quite well before the tasteful no pun intended moments of desolation.Even well after the revelation of the dumplings' main ingredient this film stood still and needs to be commanded for its surprise but fitting choice of actors and their refreshingly good acting chops as well as its atmospheric cinematography crafted by Christopher Doyle who smartly avoided overserving us with his usually unusual bag of tricks. Not a film that I'll need to view over and over again but who said that good films are only measured by the number of times one can enjoy them?".

The film is exquisitely shot with some amazing angles and closeups surrounded by beautiful cinematography and set design. He manages to bring the viewer into the world of the characters making the theme all the more real and disturbing. Fruit Chan accomplishes this realism by juxtaposing Aunt Mei's blunt and complacent attitude with Mrs. Li's deterioration into desperation. Definitely not for the squeamish or easily disturbed. To some this topic will be upsetting. However for those who like something a little different or fans of such directors as takashi miike or chan wook park you will love it.

For example in 'Pulp Fiction' the content includes a lot of random and 'accidental' violence even against totally innocent people but the way it is portrayed prevents you from taking it seriously. It is like the violence in a cartoon such as 'Tom and Jerry'. It provokes laughter rather than disgust.Dumplings is such a movie. It portrays a young sort of woman 'aunt' Mei who earns her living making dumplings that rejuvenate the eater effectively giving him or her eternal youth as long as they are regularly eaten. Now the catch is in the 'special ingredient'. I won't reveal what this secret ingredient is although it becomes clear very early in the movie but it is one of the sickest ingredients that I have ever seen read about or heard of. The unique feature of this movie is that it is able to utilize this horrible element without becoming a movie that is either simply disgusting like 'Braindead' or slapstick such as 'Ichi the Killer'. On the contrary it is actually a quite funny story about the interaction between Mei and her clients and about their increasing dependence on her dumplings.But what makes the movie really worth it  to me at least is social commentary that it includes. The real issue is not the 'special ingredient' of the dumplings but the fact that people are so desperate for 'youth' that they're willing to do everything for it. In a society totally focused on the external norms like wealth beauty and appearance it is no surprise that the internal norms like law morals and compassion atrophy and get discarded like a snake discards his old skin. This externalization of norms however is not criticized or punished but rather advocated by the film not necessarily by its maker as natural and acceptable indeed inevitable. It is this highly subversive and thoughtprovoking element of the film that makes it truly worthwhile.".

Fearing the decline of her looks to be able to keep the attention of her husband she seeks out the meals the dumplings in the title of an estranged exdoctor who feeds her with the belief that she has the answer to eternal youth. Revelations and twists and turns darken the proceedings as the film goes on which I won't mention to not spoil the show but it is unlikely that you will see a darker satire than this all year.Excellent acting sharp script and an unsettling score all combine to make a revelation of a film. The camera work is sharp and the message is powerful yet never hamfisted. The nearest equivalent I can think of is Death Becomes Her the US film with Bruce Willis Meryl Streep  Goldie Hawn but that is more light hearted in tone. This has humour but far more blacker than that movie with themes that touch not only rich society but also the working class as well. A great movie which I would highly recommend!".

With cinematography by Christopher Doyle who did last life in the universe and 2046 it looks amazing the crazy colours and dazzling visuals are offset by disturbing ideas and gross out scenes. What follows is a story of the length people will go to in pursuit of vanity. Well acted well paced and always unnerving you are never sure where the film is going to go from the start to the madness of the final chop ending. Fans of the twisted and people used to the bizarreness of Asian extreme films will really be swept along in the story and all the disgusting closeups that add to the horror. Adding also is the crispy clear sound that has such attention to detail that the slightest noise even one as banal as a clock suddenly takes on an eerie feel. Overall a brilliantly played out film but one for those with a strong stomach.".

Fans of the twisted and people used to the bizarreness of Asian extreme films will really be swept along in the story and all the disgusting closeups that add to the horror. Adding also is the crispy clear sound that has such attention to detail that the slightest noise even one as banal as a clock suddenly takes on an eerie feel. Overall a brilliantly played out film but one for those with a strong stomach.";

Much as Se7en became known for its What's in the box? sequence this movie has become infamous for What's inside the titular dumplings? the answer of which is far grimmer than the severed head of a terrible actress. It's played very well with the revelation ensuring that many lines of dialogue create shivers and every crackly crunch of a dumpling being munched on inducing squirms in most audience members. Sure it's a one trick pony but when the trick involves sledgehammering one of humanity's ultimate taboos then you don't really need another.Dumpings is about a woman who's desperate to get rid of some wrinkles and give her skin that youthly glow in order to hold her husband's interest. Of course any husband worth a damn would oblige by dropping trou and offering up a batch of the world's most effective face moisturiser but this guy's too busy with business and shagging women on the side to perform this kindly service. Their relationship is somewhat typical of the phenomenon whereby male wealth and female beauty go hand in hand. It's how we end up with the sugar daddy concept and why we see Donald Trump types marrying faketanned faketitted models a third of their age females across the globe striving for ultimate beauty just so they can spread their legs for a guy old enough to be their grandfather in return for a diamond necklace. The sacred bond of marriage has become in many cases nothing more than a form of socially acceptable prostitution. I now pronounce you scumbag and whore. Now sign your certificate and start trading services.So Dumplings comments on this societal plague that sees a woman's beauty as a quantitative valuation of her overall worth but it's also about the need to prolong one's youth to the detriment of others mainly the youth themselves. The idea of leaving a better world for our children has been discarded in favour of a me first attitude where scrambling for every possible way to make the most out of life contributes to a legacy that damns the children before they've even left the womb. The Beatles told the baby boomers that all they needed was love but the baby boomers weren't listening. They don't want love they want a nicer house. Then they want the car they've always dreamed of but then they need another car to drive to work. Of course that means they need a new house with a double garage and while they're at it why not buy another house as an investment property. The next generation inherits a world where luxuries have become necessities because you can't possibly be happy unless you own lots of stuff right? Right? So you'd better work your ass off to get those things or else other people will think you're a failure. Screw weekends that's 2 whole days that you could be working to buy more things. Oh but make sure you get to the gym at 5 am because you're no spring chicken anymore and remember your next Botox treatment is on Sunday. Follow that through to its logical conclusion and you have a whole bunch of great looking parents spawning the most spoiled privileged generation of kids in history who are cutting themselves out of sheer boredom and apathy toward their own selfworth. Future fetuses being masticated between the teeth of superficial hereandnow happiness because the human race forgot that all it needed was love.What does that have to do with Dumplings? Nothing really. Got a little sidetracked. Sorry 'bout that. Incidentally it's a good movie. You should check it out even if you've already seen the short.".

It is pretty disgusting though so don't think about watching it unless you've got a strong stomach.It's impossible to explain the plot in any detail without giving away the gruesome surprise. But fortunately our director Fruit Chan has explained all. It is apparently all about modern women's obsession with staying young. Well possibly although to judge by the camerawork it's more a feature length homage to Ling Bai's chest than her gift for experimental cooking.What it really boils down to is that classic older man married to older woman falls for younger woman who turns out to be old enough to be older woman's mother but has discovered an evil formula for staying young involving well never mind you'll find out story. Nothing complicated there.Tony Leung Ka Fai gives Ling Bai's chest along with the rest of her his wife and his other lover his customary and lascivious attention. So it's pretty much as you were all around.But what the hell I enjoyed it. It's well acted with relish in fact pretty well plotted has a couple of suitably gruesome plot twists and I felt genuinely involved with the characters. My faith in Christopher Doyle's camerawork has been given a partial rebirth after the cheesiness of Hero. And of course  as a man  it was nice to feel vindicated in the belief of ones total nonresponsibility for at least one of the world's ills.As a genuine discussion of the issues of feminine youth obsession it might come across as a bit shallow. But then it's basically a fable. Fables need a simple message. And this film has just that blame women.So if you're a woman just remember this is all your fault. Nothing to do with men like Leung Ka Fai at all. It's you all down the line you evil swine.".

Sure it introduced a coprophagiac mermaid and such notions but the thing had a kind of life elements passed by one another and through and by these motions it defined life.So imagine my expectation for this project that combines such a promising a filmmaker with the most interesting cinematographer working today. Doyle has the ability to create an inner animation a pulse of the retina's veins within the vision of the filmmaker  if he has a vision.But this project has a closed world. Its a simple narrative completely unlike Toilet except for being unreal. Less so but in the same magical direction. There are three main characters a wealthy man his aging wife a former actress and a sort of magical witch doctoress who serves up the dumplings that reverse aging. Actually it merely enhances the body for sex an interesting substitute.The story actually matters here we have to invest in these characters where the Toilet characters were tokens moving bits of a larger machine. So we expect the story to give value as a story. It doesn't. What it does is set up a few scenes three athletic sex scenes one abortion and the penultimate scene which is intended to be the most disturbing. But because we have no human connection to the thing it loses the effect.There's one interesting device. Lots of energy is spent in hearing the eating of the dumplings. We also hear the noises of bodies joining. Its quite shocking  explicit and obviously deliberate as the sex scenes are staged in such a way that there is less to watch than film convention usually provides so you notice this sound. They are pretty much the same the dumplings and the copulation.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.".

	schema:reviewBody "Dumplings is a film that takes eating dumplings to another level. When going to watch this movie I thought it was going to be a little weird but after seeing it it was nothing that I expected. The dumplings were made out of babies and embryos.The concept behind the film is interesting. These specially made dumplings are created to make women appear younger in age. It makes the characters look even more obsessed with their looks. Although the want to look younger is a normal thought it is how it is done and the images shown in the film that make the film both eye grabbing and uncomfortable.One of the most disturbing parts is when a girl comes in to get an abortion. The way it is performed is uncleanly and painful. Blood spills everywhere as if it were a gory horror film. After the abortion is performed the bloody almost fully grown baby is placed in a filled sink. Later it is shown being processed and cut up to be put in the dumplings.Normally watching people eating food isn't bad to watch however after seeing all that is done to make it when the camera zooms in to a woman's face slowly eating the dumplings the site of someone chewing becomes nauseating. Sitting there watching her eat seemed like the longest scene in the film.I strongly recommend this film to watch how ever if you have a week stomach I would stay away. More movies should be made like this. It is interesting to see an ordinary daily action turn into something twisted.".

It makes the characters look even more obsessed with their looks. Although the want to look younger is a normal thought it is how it is done and the images shown in the film that make the film both eye grabbing and uncomfortable.One of the most disturbing parts is when a girl comes in to get an abortion. The way it is performed is uncleanly and painful. Blood spills everywhere as if it were a gory horror film. After the abortion is performed the bloody almost fully grown baby is placed in a filled sink. Later it is shown being processed and cut up to be put in the dumplings.Normally watching people eating food isn't bad to watch however after seeing all that is done to make it when the camera zooms in to a woman's face slowly eating the dumplings the site of someone chewing becomes nauseating. Sitting there watching her eat seemed like the longest scene in the film.I strongly recommend this film to watch how ever if you have a week stomach I would stay away. More movies should be made like this. It is interesting to see an ordinary daily action turn into something twisted.";

Dumplings is disturbing in its taboobreaking subject matter and unflinching in its depiction of events. Rather than deliver Ringustyle supernatural shocks and surprises Dumplings is a much more realitybased movie with only traces of the magical included. Slowpaced but atmospheric and beautifully produced this won't be to all tastes.A strong 7 out of 10.

I feel nauseous just thinking about it and ever watching it again is out of the question. Whether you view it as a modernday parable of the ageold quest for eternal youth as a grossout comedy a satire of antiageing products or as a bleak horror film about cannibalism in China you're guaranteed to have a reaction to what has to be one of the bravest films I can recall watching.It's a wellmade movie. Fruit Chan is proficient at the technical aspects and he also elicits a couple of fine performances from his two leading ladies. Bai Ling dominates proceedings with her ultrasensual turn as Aunt Mei but the story really belongs to Miriam Yeung whose quest for youth and jealousy of her husband's infidelity leads her to some very dark places. The film was originally conceived as part of a trilogy of short films under the THREE EXTREMES banner and later expanded to full length and it does have the feel of a short  this is a mood piece rather than a focused narrative and there's little in the way of action.Still  it's no secret that the story is about dumplings that contain human foetuses that help restore youth. The whole idea is completely disgusting and watching people eating said dumplings is utterly repulsive. There are graphic abortions here too along with some horrible egg things that people enjoy eating so I'd advise viewers to eat NOTHING before watching as you're liable to bring up your lunch with this one. DUMPLINGS is a disturbing little movie that's all too effective.".

The promotion for this film says that Mrs. Li the protagonist is motivated by vanity but this is not quite the case. She is simply so twisted by the need to please her man and in effect to survive that she will commit the most horrifying crime imaginable. I am NOT excusing her behavior she chose her path for herself and could have turned back once she realized what was going on but I think that Fruit Chan is trying to show that society is sick not simply Mrs. Li. There are also interesting class issues going on. The literal image of the rich making a feast of the poor in order to be rejuvenated is powerful if disgusting.THIS SAID I had to walk out of this movie and have a nice cup of tea. I just couldn't stand any more dead babies being chopped up. Fruit Chan spares no one and cares nothing for decency. This movie got me thinking which I suppose is a good thing but I'd have maybe rather read this as a novel than see all the gory details in a movie. It is a good film well made and says something important about the way we live now but it is not enjoyable and unless you know what you're in for ahead of time and still want to see it I would advise you stay home.".

The big secret had me near throwing up and that same element is here in this feature version but there's some added twists in the extra 45minutes worth of screen time. The biggest storyline added to this version is the husband who we didn't see too much of in the short. He plays a much bigger role here as we see him in a couple different affairs and this here sets up why the woman would keep eating the dumplings even after learning what they are. A couple sex scenes are also added but an even bigger addition is the director's statement about women and age.

Their 'When The Children Are Asleep' is a charming highlight. Claramae Turner does an outstanding job on 'You'll Never Walk Alone'. Cameron Mitchell is a slyly villainous Jigger. Filming of the 'June Is Bustin' Out All Over' number in Boothsbay Harbor Maine is a production highlight and choreographer's dream.Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones are in excellent voice for 'If I Loved You'. What more could you want? An exceptional movie musical that ranks with the best of Rodgers  Hammerstein's works.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Carousel for the very first time in its first release when it played a double bill with Oklahoma. You can't do much better than that for an introduction to the American Musical Theater. It would get a perfect 10 had it been done with the original two leads that were set for the show Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland. Judy backed out before production started and Sinatra shortly after that so Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones got to do a second RodgersHammerstein classic. Carousel is based on the Ferenc Molnar play Liliom and the original setting is in Molnar's native Hungary. On Broadway it was done by Eva Le Gallienne and Joseph Schildkraut and later in revival by Ingrid Bergman and Burgess Meredith. One man who did it in summer stock was Tyrone Power who if a straight dramatic version of Liliom had ever been done would have been perfect.Whether he's Liliom in Hungary or Billy Bigelow in 19th century New England the part is one for a heroheel that Tyrone Power patented on the screen. Probably Gordon MacRae benefited in no small way in having Power's favorite director Henry King in charge of Carousel. Richard Rodgers was also used to writing for a heroheel having done Pal Joey with his former partner Lorenz Hart. Billy is that kind of guy a carousel barker and boy toy to owner Audrey Christie when he spots Julie Jordan and her friend Carrie Pipperidge a couple of mill workers. It's love at first sight and marriage shortly after but Billy's not a guy to change his layabout ways and it ends in tragedy.One reason that Sinatra was also so right for the part was that he had made a successful hit record of Billy's Soliliquy back in 1945 when Carousel debuted on Broadway. It was a groundbreaking piece of musical theater that Dick Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein were responsible for in the Soliliquy. Billy's just been told by Julie he's about to become a father. In an almost 10 minute number he bares his soul to the audience and singsthinks aloud the moves he's going to make. The song is almost operatic in quality it takes a real singing actor to put it over like Sinatra like MacRae is here like John Raitt in the original cast on stage.Though it's not Julie's song Judy Garland had a successful record with You'll Never Walk Alone. I'm sure she would have sung it in the film had she seen it through. It's probably the big hit song from the score still an inspiring number today.Rounding out the cast is Cameron Mitchell as Billy's no good pal Jigger Robert Rounseville and Barbara Ruick as Mr. Snow and Carrie the second leads and from the Metropolitan Opera Claramae Turner as Julie's cousin Nettie who does sing You'll Never Walk Alone.Two more who are perfectly cast are John Dehner as the officious mill owner that employs the girls and the heavenly starkeeper Gene Lockhart in one of his last roles.Even more than in Oklahoma Agnes DeMille's ballet numbers are used to advance the plot. From the exuberant June Is Busting Out All Over to the dance that Billy and Julie's daughter does all are done with taste and style.Carousel is both tragic and yet uplifting and inspiring. It's a musical for all the ages to come.".

I feel that film is overrated. The problem I have with it is that it stacks the deck in trying to convince us of the value of human life. George Bailey is a successful banker not exactly rich but successful enough that he contributed a lot of material things to people's lives including a housing development named after him. He also saved his brother's life so his brother could save the men on that ship etc. etc. The message is that you are of value if you have done the sort of things they build statues of people to honor.  On top of that without George everybody in this town is nothing. They are all drunks or crooks or prostitutes. They have no capabilities of their own. They are all dependent on George Bailey.I much prefer Carousel whose hero is a bum. If you were to ask nearly everybody in town a town that has done just fine without him as a matter of fact what Billy Bigelow contributed to their lives they would say nothing if they remembered him at all. The only people who would have anything good to say about him are those that he loved and who loved him. And that is the bottom line. If a person can be redeemed by his ability to love and to inspire love in others we all have a chance. If you have to have a bank and town named after you the bar is too high for most of us.As a musical this is as good as it gets. If I loved you' is rivaled only by Some Enchanted Evening' as a love song and it means more as it's revealing of the character of this crude man who can't express what's in his soul and this shy girl who wants only to love and be loved. Soliloquy' is the dramatic highlight in the history of the musical as Billy works out all his hopes and dreams in his mind and vows to do anything he can to make his daughter's life special. By over reaching his bounds he does the opposite. What's the Use of Wondering' expresses the doubts anyone entering a relationship has and is doubly moving as it's sung by Julie for whom we know the song will have special relevance. When You Walk Through a Storm' offers hope to us all. Those old guys at graduations are really worth listening to.".

Gordon Macrae is the carousel barker Billy Bigelow who falls in love with the lovely millworker Julie Jordan portrayed by the talented Shirley Jones. The road to happiness is paved with wife abuse criminal acts and tragedy not the usual items found in musicals.The score of Carousel is probably one the greatest ever composed for the musical theatre. If I Loved You is sung by the couple in a lovers' lane setting where their attitudes and emotions are conveyed by Rodgers' bittersweet melody and Hammerstein's wonderful lyrics. June is Bustin' Out All Over is danced and sung by the ensemble of youthful denizens of the Maine town where the story is set. The choreography is delightful somewhat reminiscent of the athleticballetic dancing in 7 Brides for 7 Brothers. Gordon Macrae's moving performance of Soliloquy along the rocky seashore with its crashing waves is nothing short of perfection. Frank Sinatra was originally to have the role but to be frank he looked a little silly in the costume worn by the character as seen in a still photograph shown in a documentary about Rodgers and Hammerstein.The cinematography is spectacular using the Cinemascope 55 process. Of course the film must be seen in its widescreen version available on laserdisc and soon to be released on DVD. I first saw Carousel at the Roxy Theatre when it opened in 1956. The huge screen seemed like a window looking out on the world of these starcrossed characters. The sound was stereophonic and still is in its video incarnations.Supporting performances are also fine. Cameron Mitchell is Billy's bad influence. Barbara Ruick and Robert Rounsville have magnificent voices and sing the lovely When the Children Are Asleep against the panoramic scenery of a June sailboat ride to a clambake. At the clambake the chorus lead by Claramae Turner sings the heart out of A Real Nice Clambake. Turner also sings the anthem You'll Never Walk Alone at a tragic turning point in the film.The best way to see Carousel is in a theatre but see it. It is sometimes shown on American Movie Classics cable channel in its original widescreen version. Lean back and enjoy.".

	schema:headline " This ranks as my favorite Rodgers and Hammerstein";
	schema:reviewBody "For years I searched for this film on TV plus the old Magnetic video copy released during the late 1970's.  However other than the occasional pay channel it was never on.  Local channels would play all of the other Rodgers and Hammerstein films but this one was not one of them for some reason.  I had heard the score before.  It was perhaps Rodgers and Hammerstein's most RECORDED score.  There were two major Broadway cast albums both starring John Raitt as well as a variety of studiorecorded albums.  It was even done for TV in the 1960's with Robert Goulet a version I hope eventually will be released.  The score is one of the most beautiful to listen to and the lyrics are inspiring.  The movie leads Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones are perfectly cast and their singing voices beautifully fill the roles.  They are even better in this than they were in Oklahoma!. As Julie's best friend Carrie Barbara Ruick is a perfect contrast to Jones' innocent Julie.  She is unintentionally flirtatious yet not easy like Gloria Grahame's Ado Annie in Oklahoma!.  Those two roles are very similar in the sense that they are both the second leads with a comic twist but I found Ruick's Carrie more developed character wise.  As her leading man Robert Rouseville's Mr. Snow can seem a bit stuffy but his character is a product of his times quietly macho not in the romantic sense but that a girl like Carrie simply wanting a home and family would be perfect for him.  Cameron Mitchell's Jigger Crane the Jud Fry of the story comes on as a somewhat lighthearted villain it is his actions which will ultimately affect the destinies of our lovers Julie and Billy.  As the pricklish Mrs. Mullins owner of the carousel delightful Audrey Christie was perfectly shrewish.  Finally as the sweet and wise Aunt Nettie Claramae Turner was wonderful as the musical's voice of reason a role often scene in Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals.  Her rendition of You'll Never Walk Alone is unforgettable.It is totally believable that Julie and Billy would fall for each other. They are both attractive young adults.  Yes he did beat her and she stayed with him in spite of this.  This was the 1870's and women did stay with the men they loved in spite of things like this.  One of the reasons things like this are important to be seen today is to show how far women have come. In the mandominated New England of that time women were secondary citizens so it is realistic to portray Julie in this light.  Sad yes but a part of history.The New England sets are breathtaking particularly during the June is Bustin' Out All Over number and in the climactic clambake.  They are beautifully photographed making the film mesmerizing to look at. Between the sumptuous singing of MacRae and Jones and the wonderful cinemascope technicolor the film is simply outstanding.  I find it hard to find any faults with this film and could simply watch it over and over.".

As Julie's best friend Carrie Barbara Ruick is a perfect contrast to Jones' innocent Julie.  She is unintentionally flirtatious yet not easy like Gloria Grahame's Ado Annie in Oklahoma!.  Those two roles are very similar in the sense that they are both the second leads with a comic twist but I found Ruick's Carrie more developed character wise.  As her leading man Robert Rouseville's Mr. Snow can seem a bit stuffy but his character is a product of his times quietly macho not in the romantic sense but that a girl like Carrie simply wanting a home and family would be perfect for him.  Cameron Mitchell's Jigger Crane the Jud Fry of the story comes on as a somewhat lighthearted villain it is his actions which will ultimately affect the destinies of our lovers Julie and Billy.  As the pricklish Mrs. Mullins owner of the carousel delightful Audrey Christie was perfectly shrewish.  Finally as the sweet and wise Aunt Nettie Claramae Turner was wonderful as the musical's voice of reason a role often scene in Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals.  Her rendition of You'll Never Walk Alone is unforgettable.It is totally believable that Julie and Billy would fall for each other. They are both attractive young adults.  Yes he did beat her and she stayed with him in spite of this.  This was the 1870's and women did stay with the men they loved in spite of things like this.  One of the reasons things like this are important to be seen today is to show how far women have come. In the mandominated New England of that time women were secondary citizens so it is realistic to portray Julie in this light.  Sad yes but a part of history.The New England sets are breathtaking particularly during the June is Bustin' Out All Over number and in the climactic clambake.  They are beautifully photographed making the film mesmerizing to look at. Between the sumptuous singing of MacRae and Jones and the wonderful cinemascope technicolor the film is simply outstanding.  I find it hard to find any faults with this film and could simply watch it over and over.";

Carousel is just about the only musical made during this period that deals with darker themes i.e. date rape domestic abuse. One could say that it even argues in favor of birth control. Carousel will never look dated because its themes are timeless and apply to the human spirit no matter what year it is. Everybody can identify with Billy to a degree and everybody can not help but feel a deep respect for Julie by the end of her personal journey.

	schema:headline " Great musical passable flick and George Bailey still resonates more than Billy Bigelow";
	schema:reviewBody "Of the quintessential RodgersHammerstein musicals this one comes in just behind Oklahoma South Pacific and the King and I. From a jazz musician's viewpoint it offers fewer enticing songs than anything by Rodgers  Hart and most of the collaborations with Hammerstein as well. Yet in the context of the times a song such as You'll Never Walk Alone helped heal provide consolation and hope to the ones who were left behind after the war. If I Loved You is certainly a gorgeous melody and sensitive lyric but the highlight at least for any expectant father has got to be Soliloquy. Listen to Sinatra's unsurpassed timeless reading of this one as well as You'll Never Walk Alone on The Concert Sinatra.Sinatra's instincts were right in backing out of this movie which is the most wooden flat artificial and leaden of all the filmed adaptations of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals it makes Sound of Music look like Citizen Kane. It's simply not good moviemaking partly because the filmmakers got carried away with the technology thinking that bright colors and a wider Cinemascope image requiring two final takes of each scene the reason Sinatra split would be realism enough for the public. That's one reason this film contrary to another reviewer's evaluation can't compare with Capra's It's a Wonderful Life. But he also misses the point about George Bailey. True he's not the bum that Billy Bigelow is. But he's become so selfrighteous about his indispensability to his community that he commits suicide all because of the loss of a mere thousand bucks. In the movie version of Carousel Billy falls on his knife accidentally after the stickup goes awry. Billy comes back as an angel to provide comfort hope and encouragement earning his wings by doing well by his daughter. But George Bailey has earned too many wingsin fact his good deeds and his savior complex are his problem. The wingless angel Clarence is sent on a mission to Bedford Falls to restore to George Bailey his humanity with all its flaws and failings. Compared to Carousel it's a darker more profound story about tragic pride even archetypal given its parallels with Sophocles' Oedipus Rex and ultimately it's more cathartic and life affirming since it conveys faith in a world not overrun by Mr. Potters ordinary people do have the capacity to be unselfish and forgiving. This is not to cast aspersions on the deeply felt sentiments of the Rodgers and Hammerstein masterpiece. It's just unfortunate that Carousel was not filmed in the 1940s by a creative inspired giant like Frank Capra.".

He was sweet and sensitive in the appropriate parts and rough and boisterous in others. Although he didn't admit it until his death you could tell throughout the entire film that he really did love Julie Jordan.  Their duet If I Loved You was similar to People Will Say We're in Love from Oklahoma! but it also had its own personality.As for supporting actors the actors who portrayed Cousin Nettie Carrie Pipperidge and Enoch Snow did an excellent job becoming the character and bringing their roles to life.

Doris Day was the producers' first choice for Julie but she was having health problems at the time and was unavailable. These circumstances created the reunion of Oklahoma stars Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones who even though this film was made right after Oklahoma seem much more adult mature and sexy than they did in the previous film. For the uninitiated CAROUSEL is the story of Billy Bigelow a carnival barker who offers Julie a free ride on his carousel one night and the attraction between the two is instantaneous...almost animal...they both get fired from their jobs as a result but they don't care. I love the relationship between Billy and Julie as opposed to Curly and Laurey because Billy and Julie's relationship is clearly sexual evidenced in Julie's pregnancy. There is violence and fantasy mixed with the romance here to produce one of the loveliest musicals ever filmed. MacRae and Jones shine alone and as a duo...the If I loved You scene is enchanting as are his Soliloquy and her What's the Use of Wondrin?. Barbara Ruick is cute as Carrie Julie's best friend Robert Rounseville makes a robust Mr. Snow Cameron Mitchell is amusing as Billy's shady pal Jigger and Claramae Turner's rendition of the show's most famous song You'll Never Walk Alone is breathtaking. Filmed on beautiful Maine locations director Henry King has brought us a lush and lovely musical that has everything a musical should offer even if it is a tad overlong. Still worth the trip.".

Some of the lines in You'll Never Walk Alone go like When you walk through a storm hold your head up high and don't be afraid of the dark. Which is really true of any of our lives and it easy to make connections with the troubles in our life to the troubles in theirs that are reflected in this outstanding musical. Be ready to be moved in many different ways. Both were amazing while songs like June is Bustin' Out All Over provided a bit of happy relief.

Liked the part at the end where Julie is older  more mature wiser.  Still misses her ne'erdowell husband.Loved the boat song with Julie's two friends  When the Children Are Asleep.  A tearjerker but how true.This story gives a midwesterner a view of late 1800s New England life about uneducated young people.  A female mill hand and a male carousel barker. No wonder they had no money.  People were going to college in those days but not very many apparently.  Billy's other moneymaking alternative was to steal.  So sad.Gordon MacRae had such an awesome voice.  Shirley Jones' voice is beautiful as is that of Claramae Turner Cousin Nettie.  The big group dance off Nettie's roof is totally excellent  breathtaking.

The director made the decision to forgo realism for the sake of attractiveness. That's OKthe sky is light blue the sea is dark blue and every boat is perfectly painted. Even the docks are clean and tidy including the boxes piled up and ready to be part of the plot when required. Very colorful albeit antiseptic. Still you can accept that as the director's concept.The problem is that it's not easy to accept a musical about domestic violence when the female lead tells her daughter more or less that when someone you love hits you you don't really feel it.

Was I supposed to sympathize with the characters in any way whatsoever? Did it have anything more than drivel to say about love or redemption? I can't think of any positive answers to those questions.Begin with a girl who falls in love with a total bum because he puffs out his chest a lot a loser who makes no secret of his utter lack of respect for women. Throughout the song If I Loved You which was a nice song btw if removed from its context I couldn't get her stupidity out of my head. Next a marriage where the guy treats her with utter disdain and abuse and somehow she still loves him even though he has yet to show a single redeeming quality in the movie.When he finds out she is pregnant he actually pauses for reflection on his life. During Soliloquy I thought perhaps this would be the beginning of a redemption story. Alas he turns to crime and gets himself killed. When in heaven or whatever it is he puffs out his chest again and declares that he won't apologize for anything at all. This is one of the most awful characters I have ever seen.So finally he is given a chance to go back and make things right for his nowgrown daughter and needs to be browbeaten into taking that chance btw how does he do it? First he ends up slapping her which apparently brings fond memories for her mother. It is possible dear she says with wistful smiles on both their faces for someone to hit you hit you hard and it not hurt at all. What?? The ghostly bum then goes to his daughter's graduation and whispers into her ear to believe the graduation speech then walks away selfsatisfied. Oh job welldone man!One reviewer said that the characters had emotional maturity of fiveyearolds and this hit the nail on the head for me. There was nothing redeeming about them except perhaps that the wife  like me watching this film  patiently suffers and the complete loser of a husband never cheats on her as far as we can see. Was this supposed to be a love story? I don't get it.The music was good though and because of that I regretfully gave the movie as high as a 3star rating.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have had the relatively rare privilege of performing Carousel on stage uncut and with a full orchestra.  The original Carousel that Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote for the stage is practically an opera employing extended musical scenes that cover great stretches of plot and character by alternating music and dialogue.  When one sees the Carousel on stage with good voices and the original orchestrations one begins to understand why this is considered one of the greatest musicals ever written.Carousel on film is not nearly as overwhelming.  The story is still there as are the songs for the most part.  But they are just songs in the movie scenes distilled to the bare bones of the melody on which the original sequence was based.  You don't get the feeling after hearing them sung that you have learned anything new about the characters excepting of course Billy Bigelow's Soliloquy which is left entirely intact.For example the If I Loved You bench scene between Julie Jordan Shirley Jones and Billy Bigelow Gordon MacRae lasts almost fifteen minutes once the music starts.  What the characters don't tell us about themselves the music does throwing melodies left and right until it finally culminates in the release of the famous love song.  The scene has built up to this moment until it becomes the only way that Julie can tell Billy that she loves him. In the movie however it is all talk until Julie starts singing If I Loved You.  The song seems to come much more out of left field and does not seem nearly as satisfying.  Billy repeats the song and the scene ends.  As a result their falling in love with each other doesn't make much sense because the scene really hasn't built up to it.Several songs which delineate the supporting characters are either severely truncated such as the musicalcharacter sequence between Carrie Pipperidge Barbara Ruick and Enoch Snow Robert Rounseville or cut entirely such as Blow High Blow Low which could have been a choreographer's dream. As for the choreography itself surely June is Bustin' Out All Over could have been staged with a little more imagination instead of confining itself to the roof and deck of Nettie Fowler's spa.  And it does feel confined. This is a song about abandoning the human spirit to the glories of the summer season a feeling that covers much more territory than just a dining patio.I do like the casting in the film although I believe that they were badly underdirected.  Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones seem a little lost here. Their talent is not in question as evidenced by their stellar performances in the movie version of Oklahoma!.  Clearly this movie which had the potential to be a cinema classic was helmed by someone who didn't understand the genius of Rodgers and Hammerstein.  In other words don't try to fix what ain't broke.".

It is fascinating to see the source material for Carousel. What amazes is how much of the dialog was retained for Rodgers  Hammerstein's musical adaptation.Sadly the much desired recent release of this film as a Bluray has turned out to be a major disappointment. So the above DVD is the best rendering of this wonderful musical that we are likely to have.".

	onyx:emotionText "There are several things that make the 50th Anniversary DVD Edition of CAROUSEL worth up grading for1 Finally the picture is Anamorphic processed resulting in a more detailed image.2 The excellent Turns on the Carousel featurette is very informative and interesting.3 The delightful commentary track with star Shirley Jones and filmmaker Nick Redman is a joy to listen to.4 The option to play the songs only or listen to the isolated musical score.5 And most of the all the opportunity to see a very nice print of the 1934 French motion picture Liliom featuring a very young Charles Boyer directed by Fritz Lang with music by Franz Waxman who would shortly do the score for the now classic Bride of Frankenstein. It is fascinating to see the source material for Carousel. What amazes is how much of the dialog was retained for Rodgers  Hammerstein's musical adaptation.Sadly the much desired recent release of this film as a Bluray has turned out to be a major disappointment. So the above DVD is the best rendering of this wonderful musical that we are likely to have.";

This mix doesn't gel well at all and leaves the film feeling a little lost at times.Josh Brolin who plays Ewan McGregor's friend in the film plays a character you feel like you have seen a hundred times before in teen slashers plays by his own rules pretty unlikeable but has his good side and you have your suspicions about him by the first scene. Ewan McGregor gets the paranoia spot on but is by and large quite forgettable the same could be aimed at Patricia Arquette.For its faults there is still enough on offer to merit a watch. The scenes which take a more horror style approach work very well in the morgue and do give quite a tense atmosphere at times. Also Nick Nolte turns in an eyecatching and enjoyable performance despite playing a role which you feel he could do in his sleep he's playing a gruff detective. And Brad Dourif is perfectly cast as the creepy duty doctor his knowing performance raises a smile.The film has enough to keep you watching to its conclusion but will leave you disappointed at not being able to fully deliver on what could've been a very affecting thriller.".

My favorite performances however come from two supporting actors the one is Brad Dourif playing a weird autopsy doctor the other is the uncredited John C.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Nick Nolte for all intents and purposes looking like Boris Karloff as the Frankenstein monster but without the use of makeup is police inspector Thomas Cray who's in charge of a special police task force trying to find and capture dead or alive a serial killer. The killer for some weird reason has a habit of cutting out the eyes of his dead victims all women and then raping their corpses. It seems that the killer wants to quit the business of serial killing but at the same time wants the police and the law to leave him alone and stop hunting him down so he can enjoy his retirement. This sets up the story for young law student Martin Bell Ewan McGeror who just got a job at the local medical examiner building as a night watchman where all the recent murder victims of the killers are kept. The killer plans to frame young Martin as can then be free from being tracked down and arrested for the crimes that Martin will be jailed for. Nightwatch has it's share of cheap thrills and a number of twists and turns in it's story but their very unconvincing in how the killer who you can spot almost as soon as you see him is so hard for the police to find when his actions are so insane and weird just like those of the murderer.The filmmakers put two people into roles that would make you think that their the real killer of the people in the movie. One is so obvious that you just know that he didn't do it and is just a red herring put into the movie to get you and the police off the track of the real killer. There's also a fact that he the killer once worked in the medical examiner's office some time ago and was dismissed for messing around with the corpses. All that is in the medical examiners record department which should have been a dead give away to everyone involved just too who he really is. There's also some scenes in the movie that focus on a photo of Lewis Paine thats pinned to the wall in the night watchman's office one of the people executed for the murder of President Abraham Lincoln in 1865. This seems to indicate to the audience that he or his ghost may have something to do with the killings but in the end nothing ever comes of it and he's completely forgotten well before the movie is over. There's also a very mixedup subplot in the movie between Martin's friend James Josh Brolin and a hooker he picked up at the local bus station Joyce Alix Koromzaywho he's trying to get Martin to have an affair with her. This moronic attempt by James is to give him a high since it seems that the normal high he used to get with women by having sex is no longer there and even having the hell beat out of him to get high doesn't work either.Joyce's relations with Martin which are almost next to nothing has his girlfriend Kathy Pat Arquette leave him and in the end. Sure enough Joyce ends up being a victim of the on the loose serial killer and Martin becomes the prime suspect just like the killer wanted in the crime. The ending of Nightwatch had the usual damsel as well as good guy both in distress with the crazed killer having them both tied down on a table in the mortuary and about to cut both their skulls open with an electric slicer. It's then when the person who was made to look like the killer during the entire movie coming to their rescue minus a thumb blasting the real killer away and sending him to his just reward. Nightwatch is a watchable horrorsuspense movie but it's hard to take seriously at all due it it's very predictable and unconvincing story and the killer is so obvious that you can easily spot him well before the movie reveals his true identity.".

This seems to indicate to the audience that he or his ghost may have something to do with the killings but in the end nothing ever comes of it and he's completely forgotten well before the movie is over. There's also a very mixedup subplot in the movie between Martin's friend James Josh Brolin and a hooker he picked up at the local bus station Joyce Alix Koromzaywho he's trying to get Martin to have an affair with her. This moronic attempt by James is to give him a high since it seems that the normal high he used to get with women by having sex is no longer there and even having the hell beat out of him to get high doesn't work either.Joyce's relations with Martin which are almost next to nothing has his girlfriend Kathy Pat Arquette leave him and in the end. Sure enough Joyce ends up being a victim of the on the loose serial killer and Martin becomes the prime suspect just like the killer wanted in the crime. The ending of Nightwatch had the usual damsel as well as good guy both in distress with the crazed killer having them both tied down on a table in the mortuary and about to cut both their skulls open with an electric slicer. It's then when the person who was made to look like the killer during the entire movie coming to their rescue minus a thumb blasting the real killer away and sending him to his just reward. Nightwatch is a watchable horrorsuspense movie but it's hard to take seriously at all due it it's very predictable and unconvincing story and the killer is so obvious that you can easily spot him well before the movie reveals his true identity.";

Only Copycat and Sisters manage to be more annoying in their absurdity and only Saw is worse. And it's a pity because the first hour is genuinely eerie with a fittingly claustrophobic mortuary as the ideal setting. I am a very jaded viewer but some of those early mortuary scenes really get under your skin. However after an hour it all goes downhill and I mean steeply. The relentlessly stupid plot twists rob you of all patience and the movie just keeps sinking to new lows. All logic is thrown into the wind and the viewer's intelligence is insulted and pounded upon repeatedly with more force than that baseball bat could ever have generated  the one used by Nolte and McGregor. I'd be the first to sign up if they were looking for volunteers to take that baseball bat and bash the heads of the writers of this nonsense. Nothing here adds up. Absolutely nothing. Nolte was molesting corpses decades earlier and the writers of this film would have us believe that this man could years later become the city's chief police investigator! Making him the killer is as absurd as giving Thomas Edison credit for inventing the wheel as laughable as a conspiracytheory plot from the XFiles and as stupid as Kim Basinger's book on how to solve all of world's problems if she'd ever write one. The very notion that a man  so disturbed that he indulges in necrophilia in mortuaries  would have the sanity interest patience and willingness to climb all the way to chief investigator in a police department only to start a savage murder spree is simply a mindbogglingly dumb farfetched concept to me.And how the hell did he even start with the framing of McGregor? This is an essential piece of the puzzle that is badly missing here McGregor JUST HAPPENS to get a job where he meets Nolte. And McGregor's best friend Brolin JUST HAPPENS to know a prostitute who is Nolte's play toy and later victim. It can sure be a small small world in a Hollywood stinker! And to add some silliness Brolin is some kind of a deranged thrillseeker who acts like a total lunatic all the time. Obviously he is the decoy for the viewer we are meant to treat him as the suspect. But how dumb do they think we are? And how the hell did Brolin get into the mortuary when he carried out his practical joke? And how the hell did Nolte manage to drag out a body of one of his victims within seconds of McGregor entering the room without McGregor noticing it the fact that he had his walkman on andor was singing andor talking doesn't make it any more believable? And what's with this annoying scene where Arquette JUST HAPPENS to walk into the mortuary at exactly the moment when McGregor is hitting Nolte with a baseball bat and predictably starts thinking her boyfriend is the killer??! More annoyances came from the scene in which Brolin's reaction to McGregor's telling him that the latter is been suspected of murder is to laugh! Or the one in which he cuts off his own thumb in order to free himself and save the others. Sure... why not?? I am being handcuffed to this metal pole and as a result can neither save my friends nor myself... What do I do...? I know!... I'll cut my thumb off! How come I didn't think of that before!?... Nolte makes the best out of his role but due to the bitchingly silly script he appears to be hamming it up too much at the end  but what choice did he have? McGregor is solid too apart from his onandoff accent which was it now? American or English?.".

Especially given that before I was born my father was a night watch man we call them security guards stationed at a mental hospitaldetox's and had to walk the grounds do rounds etc. It was not his favorite job. Eventually something better came along we call that a career and he was out of there.So as me and my father sat down for this  a tale about a night watch man in an eerie place  just ripe for creepy vibes  we were quite interesting in seeing where this story would go. There was so many possibilities but that's where our interest left because soon this movie was settling into the comfortable groove of predictability with the clich formula of 'people dying and the main character is the chief suspect'. Sigh. Then we meet this guy's best friend. He's semiwacko at least from my perspective. He's wild weird unpredictable and gross. So naturally he's either a huge red herring or he just got my early vote for the perverted sexual killer.Things progress we're given little snippets of factual information that pass as sly attempts at clues and then suddenly this best friend is mature calm and in other words completely different than forty minutes ago. So he takes a back seat in the race for the perverted sexual killer and we're left with waiting to figure out who the killer is when at this point I don't care. The movie has already become stale it slides even further before the end and I'm left trying to believe this could have been a whole lot better.".

Nightwatch is a remake of this film in almost any sense of the word. Much like the recent Psychoremake the director simply tried to recreate his original film. In this perspective McGregor was very well casted because he looks a lot like the original Norwegian actor who played the role of Martin. A lot of scenes in the movie I might say almost all of them! are exact copies of scenes in the original movie. It's almost scary sometimes it even looks like they used the sets and props all over again. Joyce's apartment the 'bathtub room' Martin's little office etc This goes very much into every detail. The mysterious photograph in martin's office is THE SAME as in the original film. Rumour goes it's an early picture of the director himself. Little things like that are all through this remake the moths in the lamp the flickering light in the hallway.So did the crew succeed in making an exact copy of the original film? NO WAY! It might look the same but this version lacks any form of tension. Everything that works so well in the original film just seems silly or stupid in this version. I still can't put my finger on it...I don't know what it is it just doesn't work!Even though the movies have more than one thing in common there are also a lot of differences. For instance the sick little game going on between Martin and his best friend isn't really worked into Nightwatch well. In Nattevagten this goes much further. This 'game' is much more important in the original film. Mind you something I found rather strange is the scene in the bar when the girls get harrassed. In Nightwatch the two bullies are a black guy and a latino. In the original film however both guys are WHITE! What's up with that???. Nattevagten ends with a real funny epilogue like wedding scene totally cut out of Nightwatch.Watching Nightwatch after you've seen Nattevagten is like watching your local high school's drama club perform Shakespeare. Sure the words are right the actors look the way they should but it just doesn't work the way it was supposed to be. If you haven't seen Nightwatch do yourself a favour go rent the original movie Nattevagten!!! Sure the weird Norwegian language takes a little getting used to but you'll get into it eventually. If you have seen Nightwatch and hated it go get Nattevagten as well. You won't be disappointed. If you have seen Nightwatch and LIKED IT go rent NATTEVAGTEN NOW and be in for the movie experience of a lifetime!!!".

The scene is a creepy one as she does all of the talking while the camera angle is of the eyes of the guest. Before climbing onto a table she asks her customer if he still wants her to play dead. The unseen man pulls out a large knife and stabs her to death.Martin Bells Ewan McGregor a law student has just taken a job as a night watchman 8 pm4 am in an eerie city morgue. A strange and eccentric retiring night watchman Lonny Chapman escorts Bells throughout the main premises telling him anecdotes and advising him to get a radio. The building unoccupied at night houses not just a morgue but also a forensics lab where dismembered human body parts are preserved in jars filled with formaldehyde. The hallway is long. In the morgue's cold room above each covered body is an alarm cord in case the corpse rises ! according to the retiring watchman. The room door has no inside handles. The watchman's rounds include a time clock on the far wall of the cold room so that he has to enter the entire room to get to it. The night watchman himself works alone in an office at a large lobby unlit after hours. Moths trapped in the office lighting provide a flickering look. On the office wall is a 19th century photo of Lewis Powell aka Lewis Payne one of the assassins of Abraham Lincoln. The creaky elevator sticks while strange noises sometimes emanate from the building. The morgue is indeed an ominous place. And for the first part of the film there is genuine eeriness in the second half the movie collapses. In the city a serial murderer is on the loose he kills prostitutes. Police inspector Tom Cray Nick Nolte stops into the morgue to advise Bells that a fresh body a murdered young lady is being delivered. The killer removes the eyes of the dead women. The cop might have added that a molester of corpses is also running amok. One night the emergency red light in the watchman's office flickers. Bells has to check it out alone as the night doctor is not available for 30 minutes. It turns out that Bells' unhinged friend James Josh Brolin has made one of his practical jokes. He had somehow slipped into the morgue one evening and hidden under a sheet on a gurney in the cold room and slowly raised himself as from the dead. Boo! I scared you! Other strange events also occur and they make little sense. One of these involves the body of a dead prostitute that was dragged down the corridor to the exit door leaving a trail of smeared blood everywhere. Why one may ask? And how could the killer sneak in and do what he did including cleanup? And how did Martin miss seeing it the first time he was there in the welllit cold room? When I first saw this I thought it could be the watchman dreaming but no. Anyway soon Bells realizes that he is being framed by the killer. By the way the murderer once worked in the medical examiner's office years ago and was dismissed for necrophilia. How can Bells trap the real killer? The script is below par. Character development is weak and we never know the motivations of McGregor Patricia Arquette his girlfriend Katherine Brad Dourif the duty doctor Nolte or anybody else. Brolin's purpose is to serve as the red herring. The use of This Old Man KnickKnack PaddyWhack song has a reason that will escape many although during the denouement the killer whistles the tune alerting the Patricia Arquette character to her precarious situation. We never do discover the significance of Powell's photo in the watchman's office. The main achievement of the movie is the creepy and claustrophobic atmosphere of the morgue. But the film could have been done so much better! Remade from the Danish film Nattevagten 1994.".

	schema:headline " Even the marvelous Ewan cannot save this sloppy necroouting.";
	schema:reviewBody "Seeing this movie I came away convinced that three teams of writerseditorsdirectorscomposersactors worked on this film.  The first team believed NIGHTWATCH was supposed to be a grim dark thriller  a wrenching journey into the human abyss a la SE7EN.  The second team believed it was supposed to be a selfconscious tongueincheek takeoff of the thrillerhorror genre a la SCREAM.  And the third team believed it was supposed to be a cuttingedge hipperthanthou  dark tragicomedy a la TRAINSPOTTING with corpses instead of heroin.  Once the teams were assembled they were all randomly assigned the scenes for which they were responsible and then not allowed to communicate with each other.The result NIGHTWATCH  at turns creepy grisly intentionally hilarious Unintentionally hilarious ridiculous insulting and downright embarrassing. Good scenes alternate with dreadful scenes great bits of dialogue intermingle with cringeinducing lines that even the actors look ashamed to utter fantastic visual motifs are undermined by cheap schlock.  The only scenes in which I covered my eyes were the ones in which I was mortified for the actors themselves the dinner scene with the prostitute comes  ahem  to mind.  The scary jump scenes on the other hand are telegraphed so clumsily that you can set your watch by them.  And the final obligatory everyone meets in the parking lot after being stiched up by the paramedics scene contains one gaping logical flaw  wouldn't the guy who has just sawed his own thumb off !!! to free himself from handcuffs be rushed to the nearest emergency room to have emergency surgery to reattach his thumb rather than sitting around in a bandage chatting?Most damning is the fact that it's a good 5050 bet that you'll figure out who the real killer is during the opening credits which themselves happen to be overlylong selfconssciously stylized and downright irritating. As a result the red herring character may as well be wandering around the film with a sandwich board on his body declaring RED HERRING.No one's character is explored in depth their motivations are paper thin when they are explained at all.  That leaves the actors with very little to work with.  McGregor just looks baffled most of the time tho' he does invoke the heebiejeebies of working in the morgue really well.

	onyx:emotionText "Seeing this movie I came away convinced that three teams of writerseditorsdirectorscomposersactors worked on this film.  The first team believed NIGHTWATCH was supposed to be a grim dark thriller  a wrenching journey into the human abyss a la SE7EN.  The second team believed it was supposed to be a selfconscious tongueincheek takeoff of the thrillerhorror genre a la SCREAM.  And the third team believed it was supposed to be a cuttingedge hipperthanthou  dark tragicomedy a la TRAINSPOTTING with corpses instead of heroin.  Once the teams were assembled they were all randomly assigned the scenes for which they were responsible and then not allowed to communicate with each other.The result NIGHTWATCH  at turns creepy grisly intentionally hilarious Unintentionally hilarious ridiculous insulting and downright embarrassing. Good scenes alternate with dreadful scenes great bits of dialogue intermingle with cringeinducing lines that even the actors look ashamed to utter fantastic visual motifs are undermined by cheap schlock.  The only scenes in which I covered my eyes were the ones in which I was mortified for the actors themselves the dinner scene with the prostitute comes  ahem  to mind.  The scary jump scenes on the other hand are telegraphed so clumsily that you can set your watch by them.  And the final obligatory everyone meets in the parking lot after being stiched up by the paramedics scene contains one gaping logical flaw  wouldn't the guy who has just sawed his own thumb off !!! to free himself from handcuffs be rushed to the nearest emergency room to have emergency surgery to reattach his thumb rather than sitting around in a bandage chatting?Most damning is the fact that it's a good 5050 bet that you'll figure out who the real killer is during the opening credits which themselves happen to be overlylong selfconssciously stylized and downright irritating. As a result the red herring character may as well be wandering around the film with a sandwich board on his body declaring RED HERRING.No one's character is explored in depth their motivations are paper thin when they are explained at all.  That leaves the actors with very little to work with.  McGregor just looks baffled most of the time tho' he does invoke the heebiejeebies of working in the morgue really well.  Nick Nolte who seems to be melting faciallywise doesn't sell his character from the outset  as a result you know intuitively that things are not what they seem.  Josh Brolin chews the scenery as the inexplicably unhinged best friend.  And Patricia Arquette  let's be blunt  can't act.  I don't care how minimal the role is.

If you do you will very quickly regret it when you see an engagement party with some sad powerpoint presentation of Segel's exes with an accompanying song. Yes because that is both believable AND hilarious!I was on an eighthour flight and I preferred to switch this off and stare out of the window. That should tell you everything.".

However even Jason Segel could not save this embarrassing trainwreck of a film.Just don't bother. If you do you will very quickly regret it when you see an engagement party with some sad powerpoint presentation of Segel's exes with an accompanying song. Yes because that is both believable AND hilarious!I was on an eighthour flight and I preferred to switch this off and stare out of the window. That should tell you everything.";

	schema:reviewBody "No groundbreaking ideas or themes are presented in The FiveYear Engagement but that doesn't mean it's not entertaining. Spurts of slapstick a dash of vulgar humor generous helpings of uncomfortable awkwardness and a pinch of melodrama seasons the film with a cross of genres and unexpected laughs. Although moments of sudden darkness cloud the generally lighthearted mood the greatest achievement for writerstar Jason Segel and writerdirector Nicholas Stoller is that the characters are never despicable and retain a likability that typically shirks away from roles designed to have dramatic dynamic ups and downs.Tom Solomon Jason Segel and Violet Barnes Emily Blunt are madly in love. Despite a repeatedly botched proposal they are destined to be wed. But what starts as a short engagement with immediate marriage planning eventually gets stretched into a couple of years. The lovers decide to move away from Tom's successful souschef job in San Francisco so that Violet can pursue a psychology career at the University of Michigan. Head professor Winton Childs Rhys Ifans manages to extend Violet's position there spreading the engagement into a fiveyear stretch that weighs heavily on Tom's contentment and Violet's ability to handle his perceived lack of success in the new environment.With most of Segel's comedies embarrassing situations and an inescapable level of coarseness replace genuine creative humor. This film is no exception frequently using sexual jokes carnal activities venereal insinuations and Segel's own seemingly contractually obligated nudity to fuel the hilarity. The dialogue supports this brand of badinage although fortunately it's the underlying allusions to psychological analysis that stand out when the wit is weak. Commentary on the different ways men and women cope with problems is particularly intuitive. Also one of Violet's focuses in the psychology department is to conduct an experiment in which subjects fill out forms about their personal stresses. They are then observed either eating stale donuts or waiting for fresh ones to arrive after being falsely informed that such new refreshments would be provided. She determines that people with troubled pasts are more likely to snag an old donut than those without turmoil in their lives. Throughout the film occasionally quite blatantly the notion that Tom and Violet's relationship correlates to the donut experiment arises. Indeed many of the relationships depicted in the movie are representative of wanting something new or being content with something that is imperfect yet satisfying in the moment.The conclusion wraps up all the dilemmas too neatly utilizing contrived methods of repairing debacles and adding nonsensical solutions of pure fantasy. It's still affable in production despite the strict adherence to the romantic comedy formula never betraying the sense of general decency about the characters even the love triangle is broken up without the antagonist resorting to anything unusually cruel. The supporting roles of Chris Pratt as moronic buddy Alex Alison Brie as crybaby sister Suzie Chris Parnell as a stayathome daddevoted hunter and Brian Posehn as a candidly foulmouthed deli employee are largely more memorable than the leads although Blunt is always watchable. A scene in which Blunt and Brie converse while imitating Cookie Monster and Elmo respectively is impressively silly and probably the most unforgettable skit. Suzie essentially sums up the familiar joviality of The FiveYear Engagement when peptalking Violet into showing some enthusiasm This is your wedding! You only get a few of these.

Makes me wonder if today's screenwriters opt to cop out on creativity on purpose. Or  have they no imagination? Do they assume the theater audience has none? Trust me a few things left to the imagination can be far sexierand probably funnier and entertaining than the inyourface stuff. And tossing the F word around like confetti at Mardi Gras is boring.

If you're like me you will not care one bit since all they seem to do is bicker and have absolutely no chemistry anyway. There also is not one likable or even redeeming character here. Even Tom's best friend Alex Pratt and Violet's sister Suzi Brie who hook up after she is impregnated on a onenight stand are so shallow and badlywritten as to induce a malaise of immense proportion.And Segel who helped bring the Muppets back to the big screen an effort I have praised is the worst culprit of all as his Tom is basically one of the biggest jerks in recent comedy history yet despite his aggressive repulsiveness Violet cries several times during the proceedings I love you so much I love you so much.Love is an emotion few will feel about The FiveYear Engagement which is about the length of time one will believe they have actually spent watching this claptrap.".

But by half way through I realised that this pacing does not work for this film because there is not enough happening to keep us interested through the slow points. The characters are not highly complex the drama isn't compelling and neither is their relationship or any of the relationships around them. I feel as though half of this film should have been left on the cutting room floor a very poor job in editing as well as script editing. This seems to me as a first draft. I loved forgetting Sarah Marshall and feel as though the producers probably rushed the script of 'The Five Year Engagement' into production before it was developed. So what we are left with is a very slow very boring and sometimes plain laughable movie. I never walk out on movies and I walked out on this one because I felt the horror couldn't go on any longer  and surely it would come to an end soon only to realise there was another hour to go.

The female lead is an annoying selfish character while the male character is wimpy and feels sorry for himself.The movie is extremely self indulgent...it was written by the director and by the star. I don't think they wanted to leave any scenes out. The movie meanders for over two hours. It could have easily been a 90 minute film.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is strickly a 'by the numbers' date movie the only problem is a lack of comedy. Considering the cast it should have had some moments but the lack of any real funny gags or joke is surprising. The only thing I can think of is they cut out a lot to avoid a NC17 rating so it might be interesting to eventually see an unrated version but I doubt the result would change things that much. I would consider this movie more of a drama than a comedy because it deals with the reality of moving from one city to another and the fact that you may think you have a career it all really depends on the time and place. If they marketed the movie as a drama I would have not expected to be amused but the whole campaign is centred around the laughs surrounding an engagement but there is nothing funny about frostbite and amputation of body parts. It is starting to look like Jason Segal isn't as funny as everyone thought and as he gets older he will be less and less funny who really wants to watch someone in their 40s act like a teenager because he is funny now sometimes doing that kind of comedy but this movie demonstrates that is the only comedy he is successful at. The supporting cast was the only interesting part of the plot and where the movie worked and the only reason this movie gets a very generous one star out of ten.If you have 20 you want to waste find a casino or some scratch and win tickets you WILL have a better time with either one as opposed to this flop.".

	schema:headline " FiveYears... Could Have Been Shorter Though";
	schema:reviewBody "The FiveYear Engagement sees Jason Segel continuing to try and cement his place as one of Hollywood's greatest comedy actors following The Muppets and Jeff Who Lives At Home with the help of writing partner Nicholas Stoller. Segel's latest offering comes in the form of a romantic comedy when exactly a year after meeting Tom Segel proposes to his girlfriend Violet Emily Blunt but unexpected events keep on getting in their way as they attempt to tie the knot with one another.With most films of this genre you get the same thing over and over again boy meets girl boy and girl fall in love boy and girl split up boy and girl get back together and live happily ever after. In The FiveYear Engagement what you get is an in depth look at the ins and outs of a stable relationship as it journeys through the ups and downs of life. I think that this is a great idea and shows that relationships don't always run smoothly as plenty of other films would have you believe. I also believe that The FiveYear Engagement separates itself from other comedies aimed at an adult audience by being cleverer and although we do get to see Jason Segel's rear end on more than one occasion a lot of the comedy is very well written and obviously well put together.There is clear chemistry between the two leads of the film Jason Segel and Emily Blunt which is obviously helped by their off screen friendship and the fact that the two of them have worked together previously. Segel puts in a great performance but I don't think that we ever get to see the best of him like we have seen in The Muppets and television sitcom How I Met Your Mother. He is a very fine comedic actor though and brings out some good laughs here I'm not a fan of Emily Blunt too much and at times her comedy efforts seemed a little forced. Also her accent seems overly British even though it's authentic how weird is that? The FiveYear Engagement starts off very well with some hilarious moments and really sets you up for what should be a laugh a minute film from start to finish. A lot of this is the emphasis put on the characters of Tom's colleague and friend Alex Chris Pratt and Violet's sister Suzie Alison Brie. Whilst their relationship offers very little to the film as a whole their individual contribution to scenes are very well delivered. Chris Pratt is wonderfully funny in almost every scene in which he features and a particular scene featuring Pratt's Alex delivering a presentation of Tom's former girlfriends is my favourite part of the film and a brilliantly written and acted scene. Unfortunately their characters seem to fizzle out and so does the film itself.There is a reason that most romantic comedies are only an hour and a half long the plot cannot sustain a two hour movie without lagging. The FiveYear Engagement does try and stretch over two hours and you would think that with five years of a relationship to tell then it would easily manage this without getting too boring. You would be wrong. It gets to a point where you think it could be coming to an end only to realise there is still about half an hour left and after a while the laughs become a sparse item. Don't get me wrong The FiveYear Engagement at times is hilarious and it is definitely a great romantic comedy with real stock in the lead characters but it tails off towards the end. It is still though definitely worth watching!".

Some of the fringe characters I talking to you Dakota! tended to be overly done and onenote. They could have been scaled back to fit their place in the movie thus adding to rather than subtracting from the story. Math in a movie review? Who would have guessed? Tom's job hunt problems seemed to be oriented toward setting up jokes than based in reality. A man with his background would have landed a position in Ann Arbor in a New York minute. However Violet's drama was much better written and more believable.Once back in San Francisco everything picked up again and you began rooting for the home team to finally make it to the goal line.So go enjoy the beginning and end but be ready to take a 30minute nap in the middle. Maybe the Director's Cut with actually cut out the boring parts. One can hope.".

They depict these two as great communicators deeply in love but for the life of them cannot work out their futures together and as stereotypes in Hollywood go Segel then proceeds to fall completely apart now becoming a rabid hunter coupled with really bad ironic facial hair. We almost turned this horrid thing off it weren't for the voyeur in us try to see the movie could get any worse. It did. The two scenes Segel actually uses the knife is to basically butcher the living hell out of onions. Ugh. Laughs were to a minimum and crass and unrealistic gags were never ending.

Every male character and I mean EVERY one is a caricature of one type or another of men as slacked jawed mouth breathing imbeciles who might likely forget to breath or constantly soil themselves were it not for the highly intelligent wise beyond their years always sexy and dynamic no matter what women whose lives are limited because of them.Spoilers Begin HERE Pretty standard fare now from Hollywood in which the never ending indignation heaped upon one particularly dimwitted male by his manipulative but clearly superior romantic interest is somehow intended to somehow be funny.In this version one particular clod played by Jason Segel is made to look like the bad guy once again because despite his best groveling boot licking and subservience to his fianc up to and including giving up his promising career in San Francisco and putting his entire life and their plans on hold in order to follow her like a love sick puppy to Michigan so she can pursue her post graduate work  the underlying implication that everyone knows academia is so much more inherently worthy than any other career one might choose its a given he would do this strikes one like a sledgehammer  he has the unmitigated gall to react badly when she oh so nobly reveals her recent indiscretion to him with her department head and mentor. Shame on him and how dare he try to shackle her sexuality or some similar clap trap they like to spout in LA these days.The course of this film is so utterly predictable that no sooner had Rhys Ifans' character been introduced my wife declared oh well I guess we know who she's hooking up with already. Not to worry though despite having shattered Segel's life in multiple ways and after having spent several sleeping her way into a highly coveted job but not realizing it because she's so innocent and clearly entitled to the job Emily Blunt has earned she will ultimately rescue Jason from the clutches of a 23 year old bombshell and their empty obviously meaningless relationship. But hey that is after all how how real life works and we all know that every man is just waiting to have the constant affection and physical attention of a younger beautiful woman replaced by the stiletto heal lash and leash held by the hand of the much less attractive but clearly more introspective and deep academic. pfffth I'm sorry but I'm laughing as I type this. Not because anything in the film but because I do realize this is how Hollywood view the world. Of course their reunion won't come because she realizes she made the mistake and did her exwrong of course not she perfect so that's not possible. No it only happens after her mentor is revealed to be just another sex crazed power hungry male who ends up telling her she's easily replaced by the next class of groupies and Jason Realizes how badly he needs the presence of his former emotional dominatrix in his life in order to be complete and runs of to purse her.I'm probably repeating myself having commented on other equally appalling antimale films of the romantic comedy genre but if you laugh at any point in this movie or found it the least be redeeming you should probably seek our professional help to get to the bottom of your deep seated hostility toward men.".

Jeremy Irons was especially shocking his performance was very pathetic and flat as if this would be a bad movie for three year olds. That was not acting that was a torment ! I cried every time he appeared on the screen.Thora Birch was also far far below her level in 'American Beauty' obviously unable to tell how one should put a little life into her bad dialogue and flat character and somehow even thinking that that was her own fault.If at all the thief Snails Marlon Wayans from Scary Movie had quite some good moments in his slapstick scenes the only good moments in the whole movie. Unfortunately they don't last long. Wayans seems to have a talent to shine even in the worst movies however.The performance of the main actor was also bad. His dull and cheap sunnyboy behavior really nerved me and I saw absolutely no reason for his 'being special' but far more for 'being untalented'.The effects where better than the story but really not that exciting either.Some people say fantasy is about stereotypes but that doesnt mean you can forget all rules how to make up a good story ! This story was not worth getting on the screen. This story was also not worth getting such good actors and effects. This story was nothing but crap !And I can't believe that Jeremy Irons and Thora Birch are such bad actors they have proven they can do far far better ! I can only guess it must have been the director who forced them to do such bad performances.Definitely not recommended for anyone except maybe children below ten. Oh wait they're not allowed ? No loss.".

I honestly can't understand why someone so talented as Jeremy Irons would be going so over the top. It's clear however that he isn't enjoying himself in the movie so maybe he's getting revenge against the movie by acting so terriblyThe most annoying performance goes to Marlon Wayans. His shrieking cowardly character uncomfortably brings up images of stereotypes from the 1930s. At least he doesn't say Feet do your stuff!  though he sure comes close.2 The bright glitterly look of every scene. When you think of sword and sorcery I think we all think of things rough and with grit. Not here.3 The movie constantly rips off from other better movies most notably from the four STAR WARS movies4 The characters. Why the hell were the dwarf and elf in this movie? They could easily have been written out without consequence. And the main thief hero is one of the blandest heroes I've ever seen in the movie.5 Virtually all the special effects sets etc. are AWFUL. Sometimes they look even worse than those seen on the Xena and Hercules shows! Though those two shows at least have the excuse of having lower budgets  and they make up for the cheap effects by having better scripts characters and acting!6 And speaking of scripts...thos script is terrible! Mainly it's because the story itself hardly makes any sense!".

But good lord this might be the worst movie I've ever seen.Lots of people have shredded this movie in a lot of ways so I've got little new to contribute to the mass lynching. But three quick summary points The acting was embarrassing  the Jeremy Irons was clearly chewing up the set with a bad Christopher Lee impression and Thora Birch really really wanted to be elsewhere. Whichever Wayans got drunk enough to sign this contract was cringeworthy and the best thing he did was die although he took too long getting about it.The special effects were hilariously bad. The CGI for the sets was a distant second to Wolfenstein 3D and anything involving 'magic' could've been better accomplished with a handful of colored yarn.Finally the plot was UTTERLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE. Our heroes are sent to find the Rod of Thingummy because the Empress is about to lose her Whatchamacallit. As they mosey along everyone says 'good lord don't find the Rod of Thingummy it's a horrible evil'. In fact the only person that could be benefited by the Rod of Thingummy is Lord Sinister Big Bad. Still our idiot heroes keep on trooping around trying to find the Rod of Thingummy. THEN the Empress doesn't even LOSE the Whatchamacallit in the first place so there's NO need for the Powers of Good to get the Rod of Thingummy anyway. BUT THEY KEEP GOING. So inevitably they get the Rod of Thingummy more warnings about 'don't find it' coming in along the way and HEY the BAD GUY STEALS IT FROM THEM.Furthermore that's what turns the tide of the war! The Empress was WINNING until our stupid heroes find the Rod and give it to the bad guys what's up with that? Champions of the Realm?! They're idiots and are personally responsible for the destruction of the city.Which is may I add a good thing as whatever Commodore 64 was building the cityscape graphics was clearly overheating at that point anyway.Avoid at all costs.

	schema:reviewBody "Ridley and Snails are thieves in the underclass of their world. Breaking into the magic school to steal they are captured by Marina but when her master is killed the thieves find themselves drawn into an attempt by the evil Profion to use the power of a lost sceptre to seize control from Empress Savina who is trying to reform and make all men equal.It is hard to really judge the plot of this film because I'm sure it could have been a rollicking engaging swords  sorcery affair and it is only the delivery here that has turned it into a massive insulting pile of rubbish. The way that the characters have to explain every single action in BIG LETTERS for the audience was something that grated on me and took me from thinking of it as lazy writing to finding it offensive that the writers thought I was too stupid to follow the story myself. Instead of being a strong narrative the film is just a basic adventure for kids with effects and noise to keep them distracted. As such it is still only soso because even children might struggle to care about the unimpressive CGI backgrounds and action set pieces. It'll please the very undemanding genre fan under 12 years old but unlikely many others.The characters are another major failing  who thought that writing obnoxious annoying or smug characters across the leads would cause an audience to be engaged by them? With this to work with is it any wonder that the cast are roundly poor? Whalin must have thought his luck was in when he landed this role but he messes it up with a performance that shows he is out of his depth and unsure of himself. McLellan is bland and quite irritating for the majority of the film but her faults pale in comparison to a trio of performances that stick in the mind as the worst of the film. Irons hams it up with all the carelessness of a pro who knows an easy payday when he sees it  he is hilariously terrible at times. Payne's blue lipstick seems to have affected his voice and every line is delivered as a sneer  it is never menacing and quickly becomes tiresome. However the worst performance is form surprise surprise Wayans who made me understand what Spike Lee's Bamboozled was getting at. He is a shrieking mugging ethnic clich  even worse than he usually does and even more annoying. The odd cameo from O'Brien or Baker do nothing to stop the rot and the cast add to the impression that this was cheaply made without much love.Overall a poor film that will probably only appeal to kids. The plot is badly delivered and the effects are not as impressive as director Solomon was clearly banking on them being. The cast are lost in the middle of it all and not a single on of them gives a performance that you could call good all in all producing a pretty poor attempt at a blockbuster.".

One very important thing that should be remembered when watching any scifi or fantasy movie is that it probably doesn't have a good budget. Or casting or effects or maybe anything good at all. You should go into these movies and i do mean ANY scififantasy knowing full well that there is a very good chance it is lacking in production value. With all that said and done this movie was an awesome amount of fun to watch. As a regular dice roller i found the plot to be consistent with an average game or at least with enough of the games elements to do it justice. Yes the acting could have been better. And the writing. But it was FUN. I had a fantastic time the entire time i was watching it. I laughed i cried not really and i joked about it afterward. My point is this movie is bad for the sake of being bad. I highly recommend it for any one in need of a fun hour and a half. It's probably best watched with friends for mst3k reasons. Just don't let any pretensions ruin a fine movie for you.".

One of my cousin's friends had brought in a rental DVD and presented it to us with a smile stating it was the best movie ever created. Looking at the title a rush of excitement hit us as we realized that Dungeon's and Dragon's a game we had all loved at one time or another had finally been made into a respectable movie. As we opened the DVD an aura of evil emanated from it and although we noticed the clear evil coming from this DVD we were expecting the best movie ever created. However the moment the screen turned on our cousin's friend slinked away muttering something about the apocalypse. What followed was quite possibly the worst movie experience of my life. After this horrid event I didn't watch a movie for about 6 mouth's and I was too scared to turn on the TV thinking that at any time the ear splitting screech of snails was to come upon me. Now... at first we were slighty amused by it. However as time went on we realized the grand mistake we had made for watching this disgusting excuse for a visible object. DO NOT READ THE FOLLOWING IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS. ALSO IF YOU ARE TO READ THIS YOU MAY WANT TO BUY A COUPLE OF VIALS OF HOLY WATER TO THROW AT YOUR COMPUTER AS YOU DO. Alright... First off Problem one Snails. WHAT KIND OF A HUMAN BEING IS NAMED SNAILS??? His mind blowing screeching of RIIIIDELLLLYYYY is just plain and flat out horrifying. The acting? Throwing mine own dung at the wall would be more entertaining. The special effects? Half the scenes looked like they we're drawn with crayons. The random dwarf? Who was that guy? He just appeared drop kicks the guy with the blue lips and then runs away to join the lard filled team. Next... If any of you did see this then you better bathe in the river Jordan p you may recall how they found the thieve den. THEY FOLLOWED A OUT OF PLACE BLUE HEADED GUY!!! How they heck did they know he was a thief? Was it is skin color? Does that mean every thing blue steals? ... Alright then you may remember how when trying to enter the cave The dwarf runs into the barrier. After clearly hurting himself doing so JUST TO DOUBLE CHECK!!! HE RUNS INTO THE THING AGAIN!!! Now there are far too many things to mention and I can truly say the only good part was when snails somehow randomly died ... O but the worst part... Was the ending. EVERYONE TURNED INTO RED ORBS AND FLOATED AWAY!!!!!! AMAZING!!! Does that mean their all dead? What the heck was that supposed to be? If one could give a negative score I could definitely see the digits after the negative sign on rating of this piece of garbage which is being as kind as possible to this worthless lard reaching around the sun. Don't WATCH IT!!! IF you do or did... I just don't know how you could live with yourself get yourself exorcised or something.".

I suppose next you're gonna tell me Thora Birch was that awful Empress right? She was?!?! My God how did they get those two fine actors to both be in this movie and act so badly in it? That's not right!Oh and it goes without saying that putting a Wayans brotherexcept Damon in your movie is equivalent to putting a dead rat in the water supply. He serves only as a tepid comic relief that painfully reminds me of Jar Jar Binks in Phantom Menace. Effectively killing what little spark of life this film could have had.Overall a nice enough idea completely ruined by lame CG effects and atrocious acting. Poor fuggly little movie. Stay far far away!My score 210".

	schema:reviewBody "Did you see the size of that Dwarf? This much anticipated movie of 2000 titled as the very popular roleplaying game should do much to further the question of What were they thinking? A great deal of the movie is spend in grandiose costume and CG sets with the actors primarily one Jeremy Irons as Profion an evil wizard over acting in the most laughable manner. Which is odd because Jeremy Irons has never really done anything remotely laughable.Irons had company in the theatre of the absurd acting style and that was with back up villain played by Bruce Payne as Damodar in blue lipstick and shaved pate delivering lines like a macho TimFrankenfurterCurry.And that is what is at odds with some of the primary components of this movie. I'm sure they did not want the villains to be completely laughable because they would have wanted them to generate enough fear or dread from the audience so they would be concerned for the welfare of the goods guys.Then you have the good guys Justin Whalin as Ridley and Marlon Wayans as Snails who are suppose to have the kind of lighted hearted swashbuckling devilmaycare attitude which has been a foregone clich' in the forms of Han Solo and Indiana Jones. However in DD the lead character Ridley was more like a generic Starbuck from the TV series Battlestar Galactica. Marlon Wayans as the reluctant Snails had lines that were suppose to be comic relief but were flat and lackluster.I do want to say that I am a huge fan of the Sword and Sorcery genre. I have read many of the great books from Robert Jordan The Wheel of Time series Terry Brooks the Shannara series and as well as the first three Dragon Lance novels by Margaret Weiss and Tracy Hickman. I really enjoyed those books. So don't get me wrong I do love the genre and I know what it takes to make a good Sword and Sorcery story yet I was expecting more out of this movie.The character of the Empress Savina played by Thora Birch was so visually reminiscent of Queen Amidala from the Phantom Menace that I could not help but be reminded of Amidala every time Birch was on the screen in those over the top costumes.The story to DD is real predictable. You know the standard OH my God the Princess Empresswhatever is in trouble and the evil mean guy is going to ruin everything for her and that will be terrible because she is so nice and concerned about her peopleand she's a hot looking unit to boot so we have to get some reluctant swashbucklers to go through a whole bunch of cool exciting stuff and find a magical thing that will make everything better just in the nick of time before evil mean guy can make the Princess or I mean the Empress lose everything and cry her pretty Hollywood mascara saturated eyes out.There is a scene in this movie where the character Ridley has to navigate a maze to obtain an important component in finding the magical thing to help the Princess err I mean the Empress. This was like a cross from Return of the Jedi and all The Indiana Jones flicks combined. I couldn't believe there wasn't one original pitfall in the whole thing.You know I always thought Dragons were supposed to be formidable and intelligent. At least in all the books I read they were. Remember George Lucas's early eighties production of Dragon Slayer? That dragon for its time was awesome and fearsome. The Dragons in this movie were so blatantly computer generated that there wasn't anything remotely sentient or frightening about them. I don't know if they want people to think that in the world of Dungeons and Dragons the Dragons look cool as unapologetically CG creations? The grand finale battle scenes were disturbing in that I kept thinking What are those Xwing fighters flying around out there? You see there were so many dragons flying around and spraying fire out causing other dragons to go crashing to earth like jets or Xwing fighters in a dogfight. It was very distracting as it had no look of realism. It just didn't feel like a movie that took place in the time of Dungeons and Dragons.By the way did you see the size of that Dwarf?".
