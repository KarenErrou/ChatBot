The film is based on a book by Robert Schneider who also wrote the screenplay. Having read both the book and seen the film I think the film was a decent adaptation. As one review I read said the director did seem to take a more stylistic and overall artistic angle on the story and as such much of the finest material from the book was lost.However the film itself is still an excellent piece of work and stands on its own aside from the book as a remarkable movie. I'm not sure I noticed anything about horrible sound effects but I remember first seeing this film several years ago on Bravo late one night and I could not get it out of my head for the next several YEARS ... until I discovered Amazon and was able to find an imported copy to purchase for my own. Only a year ago did I actually read the book which was incredibly engrossing and I encourage anyone who enjoyed the film to tackle the literary version as well.The cinematography and the overwhelming metaphysical essence present in this film are what truly sucked me in. The story itself is simply beautiful in the same way that any tragedy whether Greek or Shakespearean or whathaveyou is captivatingly melancholy. It resonates within you and makes your heart ache for days afterward. Personally I found the main character Elias to be the most fascinating element of the film. And of course the scene in which he opens the gates of heaven with his sheer musical virtuosity is riveting to behold. This film is truly a delectable treat for the senses.Anyone who is truly passionate about their talent or art will relate to the tortured artist persona that is Elias  the isolation the dedication to your craft in spite of other desires which we cannot displace and the embodiment of the emotional realm that so frequently serves as the origin of our inspiration ... this is what the story is truly about.

I once saw Stalingrad from Vilsmair and was sure that i wouldn't see Mrs Vavrova because i expected only men in this film. Poor me! Of cours Vilsmair found once again a role for his wife! So the tiny tender and silent Elsbeth a 17year old girl is played by a thirtyyearold woman like a man eating vamp from the countryside. Ridiculous!In the novel everybody admires Elias Alder for playing the organ in church like an angel. He plays the old church songs like no one did before and made the hearts of the people weak and happy. In the film he plays experimental music he beats the organ like a madman  i think that the inhabitants of a small austrian village would have beaten him out of the church if he did play that way! I liked Eisermann and Becker they are always good to watch. But it's a waste of time watching this embarassing movie if you like the book  and the book is really great!".

The acting in general is a little over the top and personally I think the female lead was a little too old for her part if you keep in mind that the male lead is around 22 and she's supposed to be younger.. although I'm willing to look past that...

It is written in a straightforward manner albeit with a strain of sentimentality common in popular German language fiction. As many have already commented somebody apparently convinced the author that when it comes to cinematic versions more is better. Too bad. 4 of 10.";

	schema:reviewBody "Schlafes Bruder or Brother of Sleep is a German film from over 20 years ago that runs for more than 2 hours and was nominated for a Golden Globe back then. It was also Germany's Oscar submission for the Foreign Language category but did not manage a nomination at the Academy Awards. Writer Robert Schneider adapted his own novel for the screen here and Joseph Vilsmaier directed. Now the 1990s are really not particularly known in terms of German cinema. The previous decades had Herzog Fassbinder Schlndorff and Wenders at what people would consider their peaks and the 2000s had the new wild wave of German cinema with the likes of Brhl and Diehl but in terms of the 1990s there really aren't many famous works from Germany. Vilsmaier may be the most defining director from the decade and this film here also because of its success may be among the most known German films from the 1990s today.It plays a couple decades in the past and is about the love between a young man and woman played by Vilsmaier's illfated wife Dana Vvrov. Andr Eisermann is also not really known to many anymore probably because he hardly appears in film anymore so the most famous cast member may be Ben Becker son of Otto Sander who plays a closeted homosexual in love with the protagonist here. And there is also some nice music in here orgasmic organ playing on several occasions. It's always nice to see films that go for realism over unrealistic developments even if that means no happy end and this is the case here as well. There were a couple moments when the film dragged but that's nothing unexpected for a movie that crosses the 2hour mark. Still the story and characters along with competent acting and Vilsmaier's good job behind the camera make this one worth a watch. Certainly not a film for anybody but I give it a thumbsup and recommend checking it out.".

It turns out that Taichi has begun to live with Ko the vet and his teenage daughter Misuzu after his freespirited mother Ritsuko has gone to Micronesia to work as a photographer. Many people have abandoned animals with Ko and paying customers are few with most of his income coming from frequently boarding a friendly dog that is almost part of the family. Taichi feels abandoned as well and clashes with Ko when the vet sees the new arrival as a burden especially after discovering that the fox is deaf and blind. However Taichi names it Helen after Helen Keller and attempts to bring her back to full health while teaching her about the world as sort of a young Annie Sullivan. Even though Taichi gets her ...";

	schema:reviewBody "Helen the Baby Fox belongs to the family of movies which feature cutesy animals and the relationship with their human protectors along the lines of movies such as Lassie and Free Willy. Interesting enough the subject of a fox besides fox vixens in many Chinese folk tales actually is a novelty in itself and having bestowed upon him disabilities adequately fueled plenty of heartwrenching moments.A young schoolboy Taichi Arashi Fukasawa is a social outcast in school with his vivid imagination he uses to spins incredible tales from. But these are the exact same fairytalelike stories which his mother Yasuko Matsuyuki spins for him as she gallivants to far out locations for her photography fix leaving the boy alone for most times. Fate would have him chance upon a baby fox which utters nary a sound which he likens to be in a similar situation as himself  abandoned.Again by chance Taichi and his new found friend encounters a veterinarian Takao Osawa and her daughter Ryoko Kobayashi the former quite reluctant to accept the baby fox for treatment constantly reminded that he should not allow his kind heart to rule over their need for some serious dough to keep his business from folding. Convincing the vet to allow Helen the baby fox to stay and receive treatment Taichi works on the farm to pay off his dues. And thus began a friendship amongst the clinic and with the many other adorable animals living on the clinic grounds.The movie seemed to have two contrasting facades and employed different techniques to highlight the different phases as the relationship between animal and boy strengthened. The imaginary world from Taichi's mind enhanced by special effects gets transitioned and conveniently forgotten as the story moved towards a more serious realworld and the issues at hand with regards to the fox. Things change as the boy becomes more assertive and responsible as he takes on the surrogate guardian role and the fox being given a new lease of life from one without hope.Fans of Crying Out Loud in the Center of the World would come to recognize Takao Osawa who plays the vet here. You got to give it to the Japanese for the many picturesque landscape shots which provided beautiful dreamworld like scenarios in making the countryside so enticing. And trust them too in activating the tear ducts of those with gentle hearts.There are veiled attempts to subtly add in messages like thoushaltnotabandonanimals oryourkids etc but I guess if you don't buy in you just don't. The pacing of the movie is relatively slow perhaps deliberately too but the ending just dragged unfortunately. A victim of the multiple ending syndrome I suppose it got worse as character relationships are suddenly revealed too little too soon without a warning in sight which probably could have distracted the audience as it was disjointed and too convenient to be plausible. Oh well. All in all it's a movie suitable for the whole family. One without the summer blockbuster violence scary images swearing and the likes. Just plain wholesome.".

For me what caught my attention about the movie was the ending theme song for the movie Taiyo no Shita by the Remioromen which was suited the feel good atmosphere about the movie. Saw the trailer and the music was the instant draw for me to the movie A poor boy who is left behind by his mother who in pursuit of her own ambition encounters a little fox after school one day. The two seem to have an interesting chemistry forged because they are seen as abandoned by those who should be rightfully taking care of them.The little fox herself as she was named as Helen later is a disabled one. Without the right care you would expect her to fall prey to the surrounding dangers. Yet the kindness of one little boy led to a completely different fate one which will leave you smiling when you walk out of the cinema at the end.I would recommend it for anyone who loves animal or if you're looking for a movie that has a lesson to be learnt at the end. A simple story that speaks in volume about the importance of caring for someone. If there was a movie that Disney wants to adopt into an American version ... I'm guessing this one has a shot.Oh yah forgot to mention this the soundtrack is pretty good too. Aside from the song i mentioned at the beginning the instrumental soundtrack is well done and you will remember it for the visuals that accompany the music. I personally enjoyed it for more the audio experience but that's just me. ".

It's just a story that confirms that love can be felt even by the animal. Taichi the boy loves this baby fox very much. And somehow the fox knows it and tried to live on despite its disability. They have only a few weeks to spend together but it was precious. OK I have to say that the movie has many flaws but it did warm my heart. I don't think it was a waste of time watching it. The scenery was breathtaking right from the beginning the boy's performance was natural the baby fox and the dog and other pets is so adorable and the story is beautiful. I know that some will find it too sweet but honestly I still have to say this is a good movie for your children and for you if you're someone who felt moved by just the sight of a baby animal.

I haven't seen any episode of the Keizoku TVseries yet so I cannot judge whether or not the film catches up with the show. The movie is definitely very strange but neither in a bad nor in a really good way. It is even not quite easy to determine the genre of this film. It is a murder mystery thriller of course but then again the movie features elements of different genres such as some supernatural and surreal elements and a wide range of comedy elements. There is a somehow tragically hilarious subplot of a retiring police chief who is in love with a teenage schoolgirl Lolita for example. I liked the surrealism and the humorous parts. Inbetween the plot the film often has some quick videoclip style sequences which I found more annoying than cool. The film also has too many plottwists in my opinion and the whole thing sometimes becomes a bit confusing. The atmosphere is intense however and sometimes quite creepy and I also liked the development of the characters. The main character female police detective Jun Shibata beautiful Miki Nakatani is very likable almost too cute for a policewoman. The film takes place on an island with a very peculiar looking castle on it a setting that makes the film quite atmospheric. The performances are good I especially liked Miki Naktani. Still it is quite hard to rate this film. The film has some great aspects but the videoclip style interludes were a bit out of place and the many twists were often very farfetched. I personally liked the film but I can't really explain why. My fellow fans of Japanese cinema can give it a try but I can't guarantee that anybody else is gonna like it. A matter of personal taste but definitely not your average murder mystery.".

The Hallervorden of the 1980s was a slapstick comedian who called himself Didi and made one film after the other with a similar plot.But if you just want to have fun perhaps when watching TV with your children in the afternoon you will enjoy this. Most scenes are like in comics or cartoons with gangsters wild chases explosions breaking glasses etc. I give seven points.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ach du lieber Harry or Oh My Dearest Harry is a West German Germanlanguage film from 1981. The writer and director is Jean Girault who is mostly known for his films with Louis de Funs and this one here is his rare excursion into German film which he made not too long before his death. The film runs for 80 minutes only and stars Didi Hallervorden in his mid40s. Today Hallervorden is 80 and in this movie here next to him the female lead is played by Iris Berben who is also pretty famous today in Germany. However seeing films like this one here I wonder why she is so wellrespected because lets be honest most of her work was either trash or forgettable and sadly this one here is no exception. I just don't think she is a particularly gifted actress at all. The supporting cast is better for the most part but the material is just too weak. I still believe Hallervorden does a good job and makes this at least occasionally a funny watch. But the story about a priceless rabbit a not so priceless rabbit a lost fortune two crooks disguised as priests and a bunch of doctors is really more confusing than entertaining. I personally got lost on several occasions in terms of the plot and where the rabbit and the money currently are. I don't think this is anywhere near the best Hallervorden made during his career but other than what he does not the 1980s were a decade for him in which he made mostly pointless goofball comedies. And I still believe these are better than what most other comedians did back then for example Gottschalk and Krger. But it's not good enough for me to recommend this. I give it a thumbsdown.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a funny comment by Gattler. He claims he knows Munich quite well yet hasn't seen any Graffiti there? Wow. Where did he hang out? With catholic church youth groups? Sad sad sad. Sheer cluelessness. The Hip Hop scene in Munich developed rapidly in the mid eighties. Maybe the near US Army Bases for which Run DMC performed as early as 1985 were part of the reason. Fact is back then not only amazing Hip Hop clubs like Area Eastside or California spread the word and had you shake your booty to hard beats  while most of the rest of Germany listened to U2 but more important the famous Fleamarket at the Dachauerstreet in Munich quickly became one of the hotspots of the best writers not only in Germany but in Europe. On its walls one could find astounding pieces from artists like Mode 2 and other legends from Europe's other graffiti capitals like Amsterdam and Paris. In those times at least 1 out of 5 trains in Munich were bombed with graffiti pieces. Wholecars wholetrains or just throw ups...you name it. The scene was alive like no other in Germany. Back then we used to make fun of Berlin. The only Graffiti they had over there were the political scribblings on the wall. Hip Hop? Hamburg and Cologne were alive too but back then....Munich ruled. This was the time director writer Florian Gaag grew up in Munich and became one of the leading spray can artists of the town. And that is the reason his movie  wholetrain is the most authentic passionate relentless and wonderful film about this still overlooked subculture out there. The movie doesn't explain much it doesn't apologize it doesn't portray the writers as nice harmless guys and it doesn't pretend to give any social reasons. It just rolls and shows you how it is. If you have real love for Hip Hop this movie is for you.".

The characters are complex wellwritten human beings and not just there as a backdrop to the graffiti writing. The whole cast give truly natural and intense performances the main four writers a crew of ethnic and native backgrounds showing a deep passion for their art. The film could also be seen as an expos on the ridiculous stance the German government and governments worldwide take on this subject. We gain real sympathy for these characters as their lives are torn apart mainly because the authorities choose to make life so hard for them.The cinematography was spot on a gritty yet delicate portrayal of life on the underground. Yet through the grey dusky palette we get bursts of colour that literally burn off the writers' canvases. The train sequences really are joy to behold.The subject matter of the film should not be seen as a deterrent to spectators unfamiliar with the world of graffiti writing. I for one am no aficionado on the subject but was drawn in and captivated throughout. The soundtrack also composed by Gaag really is the icing on the cake and is a glorious testament to the 67 years of work he has put in to this film. I implore you to give it a chance  you will not be disappointed.".

But for a rookie effort he got a pretty decent cast together as you will find names in the list of actors here like Matschenz Kempter and M'Barek who are still pretty famous probably even more than back then here in Germany today. Sprayers are a crucial subject at the core of this film but the longer it goes the more you will realize that this is really not at all the essence here what the film is about even if references subjects cloely related to this activity on several occasions like most of all trouble with the law and that's also with what the film is about to start. Anyway it is not a very long film by any means and that is good in my opinion because the contents were nothing I ever really warmed up to. Or the characters. And I don't think that has to do with my nonexisting interest in the subject of spraypainting and some of the culture that comes with it like for example the hip hop music. The actors probably tried their best to make it work and this is one reason too why the film is not a failure but the script just wasn't on a level to let them shine and get us curious about what happens to them next. And this is true from start to finish. The storytelling and editing did not seem smooth at all and maybe it shows the director's lack of experience. You really need to use this as a big excuse in order to give a positive recommendation to this movie. From a neutral perspective however I just can't. I hoped this would be better judging from its imdb rating but it rarely lives up to its premise. Watch something else instead.".

On the other hand the Graffiti seems real with Wholetrain which it wasn't in BeatStreet.Unfortunately the movie annoys in the end when the only whole train of the entire movie shows up. They show the train mixed with shots of some poor guys cleaning the train and destroying the piece of art  before you can even can get a longer glimpse of it.

Both powers take advantage of existing tribal rivalries and enlist local tribes the Delawares and Hurons on either side of their conflict. Chingachgook the last of the Mohicans is now living among the Delaware and is granted the hand of the chief's daughter after saving the old man's life. His marriage is postponed however when his betrothed is kidnapped by the Huron and Chingachgook sets out to recapture her with the assistance of his white friend Deerslayer. This rescue is complicated by the interference of white settlers out to make money by collecting Huron scalps and ultimately Chingachgook must unite the tribes against their common enemy the white man";

Joined by his trusted huntsman Deerslayer the two confront racist pioneers and brutal British soldiers in their quest. Deerslayer catches the desire of Judith and thus the jealousy of her suitor Harry. The action of the story functions like a seesaw characters continuously traveling back and forth between a house on the lake and the Huron camp until the violent climax.Richard Groschopp's last theatrically released film Chingachgook offers a fresh and entertaining look into a genre not familiar in the United States an Indian adventure film with German actors and direction. Constructed in a manner very different to American films it asserts a distinct foreign identity through an American locale. Its slow editing style allows the actors to perform in a large frame emphasizing their movements like dance. Dance is an element of the film that is explored by the director. What appear as silly dances routines placed sporadically throughout the film are referential to the beautiful and precise choreography of fascistera military parades and functions. This connection reveals Groschopp's ties to the propaganda films of Leni Riefenstahl working early in his career as a cinematographer for the Olympia films of 1936. Due to Soviet occupation of East Germany at the time of the film's production there are communist references apparent within the film as well. The Delaware and Huron communities are each portrayed as large cohesive units shown in wide angle shots to reveal the magnitude of bodies much like Vertov's and Eisenstein's work. A British attack on an Indian camp recalls images of the Odessa Steps scene from Battleship Potemkin1925 an obvious reference to Soviet influence on the culture of East Germany.Aesthetic beauty is important in the film. All of the well intending characters are physically attractive and are framed to reveal their sculpted and or shapely bodies. The personalities of the characters fall short of believable however their interactions with one another are humorous due to their flatness. For example Judith is attracted to Deerslayer's boyish good looks and to show her attraction she trips in front of him and falls conveniently into his arms. The painfully stereotypical relationship these two characters have make the film worth watching in its own right but the film has other merits. It is kinky melodrama with uberGerman looking Indians fighting German speaking redcoats. The effect this film had on me as a upstate New Yorker who grew up where the film takes place was one that I encourage others to experience.".

	schema:reviewBody "Chingachgook die grosse Schlange or Chingachgook The Great Snake or Der Wildtter is an East German movie from 1967 so this one has its 50th anniversary actually this year. And maybe some already realize from the title that this is another one of these GDR western films that were a bit of an equivalent to the West German Winnetou franchise back then. It runs for a bit under 90 minutes without credits and features German actors mostly which is not too common really for back then as many of these films had a half German half Yugoslavian cast. The exception is of course Gojko Mitic still an infinitely better actor than Brice in my opinion who plays the protagonist as always even if his performance was maybe not in the center of it all here as in other films because there is also big focus on Rmer's character and also 23 others. Besides that it is a really generic western as they always were back then. Visually it is fine in terms of landscapes makeup and costumes of course but storywise and when it comes to characters' shades there is nothing really welldone here. 100 good or 100 bad is the general route also in Winnetou films and this one here is no exception. But the story is also not a failure and those who really enjoy the western stuff from back then will maybe have a good time watching. It's probably not worse than what Reinl did around that time. The major difference is perhaps that these films never try to make a comedic impact at all while in the FRG films characters existed solely for the purpose of comedy next to Brice and Barker. So yeah as a whole I did not enjoy the watch a lot and that's why my general verdict is negative. I prefer the ItalianAmerican westerns from that time.".

	schema:reviewBody "I fundamentally agree with the other reviewers here two so far this is a hilarious and cute movie. Also it would not do anything just for a laugh and there are some more serious moods in the last third. One of the characters even contemplates suicide. And the best part is Kobayashi Satomi's flawless imitation of the male gestures something that has proved to be too hard for lots of fine actresses.But there is a point where the other reviewers seem to have seen another film they say that Kazumi was timid sensitive or insecure at the beginning. On the contrary! In my version she is loud obnoxious her behavior almost scandalous. Kazuo even reminds her that New students are supposed to be shy. But strangely the transformed Kazuo behaves just like described feminine but seems to host another timid girl's soul not that of the Kazumi we knew. This is why I would not say that Omi Toshinori's acting is as good as that of the female lead.During the film I expected the changed children to change their parents too. At least the mothers as the fathers are hardworking types rarely seen at home. Kazuo's mother who has abandoned herself during the years could have acquired some sophistication while Kazumi's mother could have turned out to be less stiff in the end. Putting these believable characters to good use. Well this never happens and maybe my expectations were too Western. Thinking of it it is rather rare in Japanese films that somebody of lower rank as a child employee private would change the life of somebody more important parent boss or officer. Another thing that might be a missed opportunity it is absolutely funny when Kazumi seems to think that Miss Kawahara has just made a Lesbian move on her 104 she makes a priceless facial expression. Regretfully this thread is cut short too soon and her concern turns out to be of a pure friendly nature.".

Also it would not do anything just for a laugh and there are some more serious moods in the last third. One of the characters even contemplates suicide. And the best part is Kobayashi Satomi's flawless imitation of the male gestures something that has proved to be too hard for lots of fine actresses.But there is a point where the other reviewers seem to have seen another film they say that Kazumi was timid sensitive or insecure at the beginning.

	schema:reviewBody "There is something special about a month in which two full moons appear. Blue month' was the term Johnny Pichler's grandmother used for this unusual occurrence and neither of them suspected the significance this bit of folklore would take on for him years later. A close look will reveal a faint rounded shape between the clouds at the beginning and the very end of Andrea Dusl's first feature film Blue Moon it signifies the period of time between Johnny and Jana's two magical encounters.Blue Moon is the story of how a longing was satisfied and a continent discovered a journey to the unknown East into a nearby world hidden behind the Iron Curtain which had led a separate existence in its own bizarre exoticism for decades. Director Andrea Dusl witnessed the opening of this new world from its very beginning she told Karin Schiefer. As soon as it was possible to cross the border without a visa she began taking off in the direction of Bratislava going a little farther eastward on each trip. It was fascinating' she remembers entering an untouched world which worked according to a completely different set of laws. There were people there like you and me but the stores sold different things the people had different desires and different paradises in their hearts.' The idea of compressing the story of this new country and the resulting feelings into a film became more compelling with each trip and Dusl had a highly unconventional idea with regard to the form. Eighty twominute fragments resembling commercial spots which she planned to finance herself would be released under the title Around the World in 80 Days. After six episodes' said the filmmaker I realized I would have to do things differently I crammed all the stories into a single film and that's how Blue Moon was made.' On the Trail of a Mysterious Woman Johnny Josef Hader first meets Jana Viktoria Malektorovych as she accompanies a shady Slovakian wheelerdealer near the Austrian border. She saves Johnny from a dangerous situation and runs away with him. The two characters without a past briefly come closer before she disappears just as suddenly as she had appeared the day before. Armed with a strip of photographs of Jana stamped Lviv a city in Ukraine Johnny begins hitchhiking eastward on the trail of this mysterious woman. In Lviv he chances upon a taxi driver who is apparently Jana's sister. A game of hide and seek begins sending the two on an emotional odyssey which violates the rules and regulations of the enigmatic Eastern world before the rise of the second full moon.The story of the blue month and brief childhood memories which Johnny relates in a voiceover is the only information provided about the protagonist's past. I wanted' according to Dusl to remove my hero from his place of origin and make a completely different person out of him. That's what makes uprooted people such interesting characters they're the only ones who can have really new experiences. My Johnny's actions in the present also tell us about his past.' Expressing himself regardless of the language was never one of Johnny's talents and so a video camera becomes a kind of substitute and an instrument of reflection and communication. The resulting interplay of alternating film and video sequences creates a narrative tension between the objective and subjective views of the protagonist's experiences.Naive and literally speechless Johnny gropes toward the vague goal of his desires all the way stumbling into the traps of an unknown world. However he does manage to save himself each time and quickly learns to use the new rules to his own ends. The director allowed the misunderstandings and even more the complete lack of understanding to remain part of this meeting of East and West in untranslated sequences in Ukrainian and Slovak. We're all' in her opinion so mired in constant comprehension. Everything is translated and subtitled. But I wanted some things not to be understood. That's the way it happens in real life The misunderstandings which result from not understanding something are the salt of memory.' Josef Hader who plays Johnny spent a few weeks putting the finishing touches on his character with the director and screenwriter. It was very atypical' remembers Dusl because Josef in an excellent way is not an actor. His work method is extremely spontaneous and impulsive there was always something new exciting and unconventional in a positive way.' And a second dream candidate was convinced Detlev Buck chosen for the part of Ignaz Springer a wily East German with no visible means of support joined the team after reading the screenplay and meeting his Austrian counterpart just once. Solely the female lead required casting in Kiev. Traps of an Unknown World Viktoria Malektorovych already a star in Ukraine conveyed precisely the power and vulnerability Andrea Dusl put into the character of Jana. For her role as a taxi driver who lost her entire family at the age of 17 when a ferry went down and who worked weekends for an escort service to make some extra money Malektorovych learned her German lines by heart and even signed up for courses at a driving school. The fact that Odessa was chosen for the story's conclusion is in part due to the rapid changes which have followed the opening of the East. The images created in the screenwriter's head during her many journeys required constant adjustment and were sometimes discarded as they could no longer be realized. In the beginning' according to Dusl southern Poland alone was so absurdly exotic but now Cracow looks like Florence and has lost everything of this sunken world.' But in Odessa she found a place which had retained its magic. dessa' continued the director makes one think of a place which marks the end of the world. A place where you can go no farther without getting on a ship or jumping into the ocean.' In the first scene Jana alone with her suitcase on rollers descends the legendary staircase in Odessa. I realized' explained Dusl that I had to use the stairs. Everybody knows them because that's where Eisenstein shot the famous scene with the stroller the soldiers and citizens of Odessa. It's a legend which has taken on its own life. I reduced it to what it really is a connection between up and down. When Jana goes down them it's like crossing a border. The stairs are for me like crossing the Iron Curtain. Standing on a staircase can change your perspective.'".

In particular the presence of Josef Hader one of Vienna's top cabaret acts and Detlev Buck a leading German actordirector will certainly strike a chord. But with careful handling Dusl's portrait of the former socialist empire as seen through concerned but often amused contemporary Western eyes should be able to reach beyond these cultural barriers to the overseas arthouse circuit. Certainly the performance of Viktoria Malektorovych deserves a wider international audience.Opening with an innocentlooking shot of the Odessa Steps one of cinema's most celebrated locations thanks to Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin the film traces the love story between a Ukrainian girl Viktoria Malektorovych full of surprises and an Austrian man Josef Hader she meets by accident. Started haltingly and on a whim it blossoms as the couple move further and further into the east from Austria to Slovakia and then all the way through the Ukraine via Lviv Kiev down to the Black Sea and Odessa. A third character a fasttalking German conman Detlev Buck down on his luck joins in for stretches of the road to flesh out the film's comments about the transitions taking place in this part of the world.Originally conceived as a series of shorts about Eastern Europe since the fall of the Iron Curtain Dusl felt her purpose would be much better served by combining them into one feature film. The plot that ties them together is pleasant although at times come across as a bit loose occasionally resorting to arbitrary subterfuges to keep the story afloat. But then what counts here is the writerdirector's reflections on what she feels is still terra incognita for many of her fellow Westerners. Somewhere between the strict political system of the past and the sudden freedom chaos and corruption of the present East Europeans are trying to find their own way of coping with the new economy the new morality and the old habits from which they have not entirely divested themselves.Collecting incidents that she obviously feels reflect on the bigger picture Dusl's notes are always sympathetic and often astute and entertaining. Metaphors such as the unfenced sheep which refuse to run away unless someone persuades them to or a moneyobsessed girl who keeps communist artefacts in her home are often used to reenforce the message. Additional commentary is provided by nuggets of grandma's wisdom introduced in the narration and by the constantly running video camera used to expand or underline certain points.The star of the show is undoubtedly Viktoria Malektorovych a young Ukrainian actress whose expressive face and body language do wonders for the lead role and hold the film together. Hader's laidback effectively understated performance and Buck's typically extrovert rascal offer all the support that she needs.Screen International's Dan Fainaru in Locarno 05 August 2002".

I've seen more AustrianGerman films than most North Americans and I keep an open mind knowing some real gems come along once in a while. The rating on this site also gave me that impression but frankly it didn't meet my expectations.This film is the perfect vehicle for the talents of Victoria Malektorovycha who steals the show. Sure it'll sell tickets because of Hader and Buck but neither shine here. Hader sleepwalks through the moviehe's far too low key often saying nothing or so little the audience is forced to guess what he's really thinking or feeling his lack of reaction at times makes you squirm. Buck is 'three's a crowd' and really just adds some comic relief to Hader's panface. The locations are interesting and the types of situations one might encounter in the Ukraine being held up in an alley driving around in an old taxi add to its sense of realism the trip from Austria through Slovakia and into the Ukraine is entertaining. The music is nicely choreographed and adds to the road trip feel.Where it fails is in the relationship between Malektorovych and Hader. We are supposed to believe she sees something in him. She dumped him for a reason in the hotel. Why should it be any different later? She clearly has some interesting connections probably to the underworld and possibly as a stripper. I saw nothing in him that would attract in her own words such a beautiful young women. He offers her nothing more than his time. The result is that the romance between them never properly develops.Some contributors to this forum obviously disagree but I was left unconvinced of their passion for each other especially when you consider the dramatic show of love at the end. If he loves her so much that he buys her a boat ticket why didn't he make his way to the dock before the boat sailed? Is he so dense that he believes the receptionist where the ticket was supposed to be picked up and just hangs around until the last moment?If you saw the movie ask yourself was their love deep enough to drive them to the extreme we see at the end of the film...with the fade to black? Had the director showed us something more than casual interaction between them I might have believed. Still putting the lack of character building to the side the film captures the essence of what one contributor calls European cinema and brings out a few laughs. 610".

Actually Hokkaido itself is a costar of this film as you see it rolling along out the car window. The acting is superb and the film is a major crowd pleaser. Director Yamada Yoji's films are kind of hit and miss to me I've only seen a few Torasan films but this one really kept me interested and along the way I cared about each character more.

The local tourist bureau could certainly use this movie as a promotional video as the lovely scenery of Japan's frozen north is handsomely on display here. Frankly it is about the only aspect of the movie that held my attention while waiting for Kensan and remained a considerable asset from then on.In case there can be any doubt I will state it clearly. Yes I can see that the young couple are mainly in this story as a foil for Kensan. But I still contend that they take up too much screen time and the film could only have been improved if their parts had been substantially cut. For instance the first twenty minutes could have been cut to five minutes or less with no appreciable loss.I hardly need say that Takakura puts in a subtle and moving performance for which he is justly famous. And the longer he is on screen the more the young couple improve. By the end they are almost bearable and the cowboy has even managed to develop some gentleness. Better late than never.Ken's character's past is gradually revealed and though there are no surprises here the journey is compelling and moving. Very sentimental but highly watchable.".

Because the film is not and easy one to watch. It has a very depressing message and there isn't any moment of mercy in the film. It is a very cruel movie not for everyone's taste. You can not speak of terms of enjoyment from this film. It grips you in your throat and never let go and in the end you simply feels breathless because of its intensity.I can not recommend or not recommend this film.

	schema:headline " Experimental documentarystyle study of depressed characters in a depressing suburb.";
	schema:reviewBody "Hundstage is an intentionally ugly and unnerving study of life in a particularly dreary suburb of Vienna. It comes from former documentary director Ulrich Seidl who adopts a very documentarylike approach to the material. However the film veers away from normal types and presents us with characters that are best described as extremes  some are extremely lonely some extremely violent some extremely weird some extremely devious some extremely frustrated and misunderstood and so on. The film combines several near plot less episodes which intertwine from time to time each following the characters over a couple of days during a sweltering Viennese summer. Very few viewers will come away from the film feeling entertained  the intention is to point up the many things that are wrong with people the many ills that plague our society in general. It is a thoughtprovoking film and its conclusions are pretty damning on the whole.A fussy old widower fantasises about his elderly cleaning lady and wants her to perform a striptease for him while wearing his deceased wife's clothes. A nightclub dancer contends with the perpetually jealous and violent behaviour of her boyracer boyfriend. A couple grieving over their dead daughter can no longer communicate with each other and seek solace by having sex with other people. An abusive man mistreats his woman but she forgives him time and again. A security salesman desperately tries to find the culprit behind some vandalism on a work site but ends up picking on an innocent scapegoat. And a mentally ill woman keeps hitching rides with strangers and insulting them until they throw her out of the car! The lives of these disparate characters converge over several days during an intense summer heat wave.The despair in the film is palpable. Many scenes are characterised by long awkward silences that are twice as effective as a whole passage of dialogue might be. Then there are other scenes during which the dialogue and onscreen events leave you reeling. In particular a scene during which the security salesman leaves the female hitchhiker to the mercy of a vengeful guy  to be beaten raped and humiliated thankfully all offscreen for some vandalism she didn't even do  arouses a sour almost angry taste. In another scene a man has a lit candle wedged in his rearend and is forced to sing the national anthem at gunpoint all as part of his punishment for being nasty to his wife. While we might want to cheer that this thug is receiving his comeuppance we are simultaneously left appalled and unnerved by the nature of his punishment. Indeed such stark contrasts could act as a summary of the whole film  every moment of lightheartedness is counterbalanced with a moment of coldness. Every shred of hope is countered with a sense of despair. For every character you could like or feel sympathy for there is another that encourages nothing but anger and hate. We might want to turn away from Hundstage to dismiss it as an exercise in misery but it also points up some uncomfortable truths and for that it should be applauded.".

It is one of the few films perhaps the only one that actually gave me shivers not even Pasolinis Slo to which this film bears comparison affected me like that. I saw echoes in the film from filmmakers like Pasolini Fassbinder and others. I had to ask myself what was it about the film that made me feel like I did? I think the answer would be that I was watching a horror film but one that defies or even reverses the conventions of said genre. Typically in a horror film horrible and frightening things will happen but on the margins of civilized society abandoned houses deserted hotels castles churchyards morgues etc. This handling of the subject in horror is I think a sort of defence mechanism a principle of darkness and opacity functioning as a sort of projective space for the desires and fears of the viewer. So from this perspective Hundstage is not a horror film it takes place in a perfectly normal society and so doesnt dabble in the histrionics of the horror film. But what you see is the displacement of certain key thematics from the horror genre especially concerning the body and its violation the stages of fright and torture it can be put through. What Seidl does is to use the settings of an everyday middle class society as a stage on which is relayed a repetitious play of sexual aggression loneliness lack and violation of intimacy and integrity precisely the themes you would find in horror but subjected to a principle of light and transparency from which there is no escape. It is precisely within this displacement that the power of Seidls film resides. Hundstage deals with these matters as a function of the everyday displays them in quotidian repetition rather than as sites of extremity and catharsis  a move you would encounter in said horror genre. One important point of reference here is Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Fassbinder also had a way of blending the political with the personal in his films a tactics of the melodrama that allowed him to deal in a serious and even moral way with political issues like racism domination desire questions concerning ownership sexual property and control fascism and capitalism etc. Seidls tactic of making the mechanisms of everyday society the subject of his film puts him in close proximity with Fassbinder like this German ally he has a sort of political vision of society that he feels it is his responsibility to put forward in his films. During a seminar at the Gothenburg Film Festival this year at which Seidl was a guest he was asked why he would have so many instances of violated subjugated women in Hundstage but no instances of a woman fighting back liberating herself. Seidl replied that some may view it as immoral to show violence against women but that he himself felt it would be immoral not to show it. An artistic statement as good as any I think. Thank you.".

Life is not that black and white. I cannot understand the constant desire for fast paced cutting. Go and watch a commercial if you need to but leave the rest of us with well made insightful films that speak about the bigger issues in life. This is a marvellous film that is disturbing and shocking but not in a gratuitous manner. I think it is in the tiny minutiae of life that these moments are revealed. I found the moment when the couple visit the grave and when the old woman does the striptease to be very moving. You need to look underneath the surface of the characters to see what makes them tick and Seidl has done this. As a result we have complex characters that seem too real for some viewers perhaps to stomach. I should stop defending the film. Just go and see it. Brilliant filmmaking.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is something special about the Austrian movies not only by Seidl but by Spielmann and other directors as well. This is the piercing sense of reality that never leaves the viewer throughout the movie. Hundstage is no exception. This effect is achieved not only by the depicted stories but also by actors playing. In Hundstage I have never had the feeling that these are actors playing but real people instead. So real is the visceral feeling of the viewer...Almost as if the grumpy pensioner or lonely lady in the movie are living below you in your block.Any person living in Vienna can without any doubt painfully recognize the people in the movie with their meckernsudern complaining their hidden sexual urges and the prolo macho guys. This is further reinforced by the Viennese dialect which is according to many especially made for complaining as a way of life. A special parochialism and arrogance typical for Vienna are also very well portrayed.The Viennese suburbs have a vivid presence in the movie with their stupor and drowsiness where nothing happens. Moreover they have been turned into a celebration of materialism with shopping malls and huge department stores. Inbetween are the houses of the people where they indulge into what they reckon is pleasuregiving activities trying to stay in touch with their human selves yet in vain. The examples are the sexual game of the old lady with the men which bordered on rape the prolo guy losing his nerves and hitting his girlfriend and the young woman who hitchhikes and irritates her drivers.The film has no soundtrack as it concentrates on the normalityabnormality of its images only. Another typical feature of Seidl and other Austrian directors is his showing of disturbingly sexual images. These include the stripping of the old woman for her husband the sexual scenes in the bath the sexual game of the lady with the two men in her apartment etc.In Hundstage Seild has portrayed the lives of people who eventually may be as much Viennese as they could be citizens of Paris New York or Madrid. The viewers should not despise or feel pity for the Viennese in the movie as they themselves could become victims of the same human estrangement and alienation albeit in different circumstances. In the end I believe Seidl's film is a warning to us about the terrible state of human relationships so brutally revealed in Hundstage. And if the viewer does not succumb to the reasons for this evil transformation Seidl has achieved his goal.".

More than two hours long and all the time developing the slow monotonous rhythm it could have been a real torture for the beholder but instead it offers something unique and very captivating.Here are few characters whose life paths constantly interlock in a little city in tragic coincidences. The old widower with his dog. The mad hitchhiking girl whose hobby is exasperating her companions with useless chatter. The middleaged couple whose only daughter had died in an accident some time ago and who hardly speak to each other despite their living in the same house. The hysterical guy torturing his girl who works in a strip club. The aging woman who gets bullied by her macholooking hairy boyfriend. Everyone is unhappy and that's the simple keynote. But almost no one stirs up sympathy. The world is sweaty driedup brutal senseless. And all the kindness it can provide is epitomized in the final striptease that the elderly maid is doing for the old man with the dog.The dog is certainly already poisoned to that time. The mad girl is raped. The aging woman is humiliated.The everything is bad slogan can seem trite but the director Ulrich Seidl proves it with cogency. Hundstage is probably the most dismal film of the 21th century so far but it works great due to its exceptional cinematic merits. According to what I know it's the first Seidl's feature film all his previous outings were strictly documentary. Spreading his meticulous attitude to things on this work Seidl attains the highest degree of realism maybe even what we use to call hyperrealism. Hundstage is stunning by all means and comes highly recommended for all artfilm fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is great. As often heard it is indeed very realistic and sometimes brutal but unlike some other people I am clearly not of the opinion that it is depressing negativistic or dismantling Austria as a protofascist society. Quite the contrary While there are indeed some very heavy scenes in HUNDSTAGE and some characters are to be called very bad persons at the same time you watch love beauty and humor in Ulrich Seidls film. And that's exactly what distinguishes HUNDSTAGE for me from other films that try to show the lives of the 'ordinary people' in an intense realistic way their hustle their wishes their dark sides Seidl clearly never tries to prove that the lives of the workingclass people are trash! In my opinion viewers who come to this conclusion seem to be very afraid of admitting that nearly nobody's live is as 'clean' and 'normal' as we would like other people to believe. And that every live has its dark and often depressing sides. The most beautiful scene The old Viennese man watching his old girl dancing 'the oriental way' as he is calling it. I think everybody who finds this scene ugly lacks a sense of beauty and should ask themselves what it is that's protofascist The characters in HUNDSTAGE or viewers who are turned off by the body of a 70 year old woman dancing with all her charms for her lover.".

And that's exactly what distinguishes HUNDSTAGE for me from other films that try to show the lives of the 'ordinary people' in an intense realistic way their hustle their wishes their dark sides Seidl clearly never tries to prove that the lives of the workingclass people are trash! In my opinion viewers who come to this conclusion seem to be very afraid of admitting that nearly nobody's live is as 'clean' and 'normal' as we would like other people to believe. And that every live has its dark and often depressing sides. The most beautiful scene The old Viennese man watching his old girl dancing 'the oriental way' as he is calling it. I think everybody who finds this scene ugly lacks a sense of beauty and should ask themselves what it is that's protofascist The characters in HUNDSTAGE or viewers who are turned off by the body of a 70 year old woman dancing with all her charms for her lover.";

An experimental documentarystyle study of depressed characters in a depressing suburb in Austria during a summer heatwave. A thoughtprovoking film and its conclusions are pretty damning on the whole.

Rather slowpaced it deals with everyday life's madness. A collection of 6 parallel stories  more like incidents from the most miserable people'e everyday life. It shows people humiliating other people and being cruel to other people. It shows the inability of people to communicate or talk with others. It is also one of those films that you have to watch again and again just in case you missed something. Hundstage is an intentionally ugly study of life in a dreary suburb of Vienna.

Over ten years have passed since this movie came out and time and viewing habits and expectations have obviously lessened many of the potential shock elements now.Indeed there's almost nothing new here that hasn't been said now. That aside no genre is seemingly unique now and Dog Days still appeals due to its fresh fizz and liberal attitudes.

Kind of like Tarkovsky films but different in a way. I myself can't say I had a lot of fun watching it. But it's an outstanding and very interesting experience for those who are only tormented by the clich that Hollywood offers. Hundstage sticks a finger right into your brain and scratches your mind all over. You can't simply sit back and watch it you'll be using exclamations or looking with eyes wide open throughout the film. A film that's similar to this in style is Nachtgestalten but it was considerably better and way less violent. This one for instance is not for children or those who are mentally tender or badtempered. Most viewers would most likely give either a 10 or a 1 to this film. I give it a 9 because I've seen the multiplestoriesinonefilm phenomenon in another film and it was better. But this one's an outstanding piece on its own.

It's an Austrian film following the lives of several depressed deranged and annoying people and their abusive relationships with each other. It's disturbing yet very wellacted and it's interesting to watch the crazy little things these characters do. Certainly not for the weakhearted this highly pessimistic film offers no conclusion or revelation at the end we just see the lives of these sordid individuals over the course of two days. Grade B".

Depending on the films in question this can be attributed to a number of things sometimes generic special effects and plotdriven Hollywood garbage like War Of The Worlds but in the case of overthetop uninteresting attempts at social commentary and a desperate struggle to put art back into cinema it's movies like Dog Days that are to blame.I normally have a very high tolerance for movies no matter how dull or pointless I find them ranging from good long ones like Andrei Rublev and Dogville to ones I've considered painful to sit through a la Alpha Dog and Wild Wild West. I shut this movie off 45 minutes in which is 30 minutes more than I actually should have. I wasn't interested in any of the characters whatsoever and found nothing substantial beyond a thin veil of unfocused pessimism. In an attempt to say something about the dregs of society this film too easily falls into being selfindulgent trite and exploitative in a very sincere sense. Granted I've seen many disturbing movies on the same subject but there are so many better films out there about depressing pathetic people Happiness Gummo Kids Salo Storytelling Irreversible that actually contain characters of great emotional depth and personality. Dog Days had none more than an eighth grader's distaste for society choosing to ignore any true intelligence about the way people actually are and instead choosing to be a dull awful and hopelessly unoriginal attempt at a work of art. This isn't a characterization of the unknown or a clever observation into the dregs of society it's just boring and nothing worth caring about.".

And while I did not think this was a bad movie I must say that I prefer his more recent works especially his Paradise trilogy which is quite a thing of beauty. Seidl's approach however is certainly visible in here too. His films always have a dark and slightly depressing take on love and especially sexuality. You should also not be surprised to see graphic nudity in here but I think it was working in the context as it simply belonged to the story. It is basically the Paradise trilogy packed in one movie as we follow the fates and sexual identities of a whole bunch of people that have very loose connections to each other. Nonetheless I have to say that I was not too well entertained while watching this film. It could have been shorter I think and still would not have lost and of its substantial message but this way it felt a bit overblown. And occasionally I also felt that the stories were just written in a way to be as controversial as possible and not really as means of telling a great movie. The actors still do a good job especially Maria Hofsttter once again. Finally even German speakers may have problems with the thick Austrian accents in here even if I found most of it was not too difficult to understand. So just in case make sure you have subtitles.

	schema:headline " An unblinking study of the human condition";
	schema:reviewBody "Austrian filmmaker Ulrich Seidl is known for his documentarystyle cinema that subjects the oftentimes dreary everyday life to a closer examination. In his famous Paradiestrilogy he studied Liebe Glaube and Hoffnung in 3 movies and showed how sordid reality can look when confronted with human ideals. In Dog Days there are no ideals  we observe people  most of them downtrodden and hopeless in their aspirations  surviving the hottest days of a merciless Viennese summer. 6 different episodes are intertwined to offer a disturbing medley of sex violence desperation examples of pettiness and greater evils a security salesman is confronted with a lot of pressure to track down a vandal  a mentally retarded woman hitchhikes through her day and gets on the nerves of the drivers  an estranged couple is forced to live together even though they have nothing to say to each other  a female music teacher feels fatally drawn to an antisocial brute is abused and gets her involuntary revenge later on  an old man who otherwise spends a lonely uneventful life celebrates the marriage anniversary even though his wife is long deceased  a teenage looking stripper is harassed by her pathologically jealous boyfriend These episodes are more or less interconnected rather less but certainly not as artfully interwoven in a masterpiece like Magnolia. It has to be questioned whether an overall message is intended except for the existentialist layer that mirrors the fundamental misery these people are in. The first premise of making such a movie was  according to the director  that conflicts are more likely to erupt under the sweltering conditions of a midsummer heatwave. Fittingly the characters appear to be permanently on the edge ready to yield to violent outbursts ready to leave the confines of common sense. The second premise that makes the movie special is that Seidl almost exclusively relied on nonprofessionals who were asked to improvise most of the scenes as there was no real screenplay.Apparently the desired effect was a heightened level of authenticity in the depiction of everyday reality. However as Seidl laconically remarked in an interview it is impossible to imitate reality in all of its horror and depravity. Well this movie certainly represents a valiant effort filming bloated beer bellies sweating in the unforgiving sun sets the aesthetic tone for a movie that does not shy away from showing not quiteattractive middle aged women and men engaging in a porno. The overarching theme is the subjugation of women in a maledominated society as almost every episode makes its contribution. Especially hard to watch is the excessive party where the female teacher is ridiculed and abused by her rowdy boyfriend and his younger pal. Hundstage is in many respects the very opposite of lighthearted entertainment  if there is love it is doomed to turn into misery. If there is comic relief it is only by the absurdity of what is shown and by the futility of human efforts. The undoubted authenticity is the strongest quality of a movie that may leave you with a bland feeling. Hundstage falls definitely short of true greatness as the story lacks coherence and the episodes seem arbitrarily chosen. However as an unblinking study of the human condition it works just fine.".

The first premise of making such a movie was  according to the director  that conflicts are more likely to erupt under the sweltering conditions of a midsummer heatwave. Fittingly the characters appear to be permanently on the edge ready to yield to violent outbursts ready to leave the confines of common sense. The second premise that makes the movie special is that Seidl almost exclusively relied on nonprofessionals who were asked to improvise most of the scenes as there was no real screenplay.Apparently the desired effect was a heightened level of authenticity in the depiction of everyday reality. However as Seidl laconically remarked in an interview it is impossible to imitate reality in all of its horror and depravity. Well this movie certainly represents a valiant effort filming bloated beer bellies sweating in the unforgiving sun sets the aesthetic tone for a movie that does not shy away from showing not quiteattractive middle aged women and men engaging in a porno. The overarching theme is the subjugation of women in a maledominated society as almost every episode makes its contribution. Especially hard to watch is the excessive party where the female teacher is ridiculed and abused by her rowdy boyfriend and his younger pal. Hundstage is in many respects the very opposite of lighthearted entertainment  if there is love it is doomed to turn into misery. If there is comic relief it is only by the absurdity of what is shown and by the futility of human efforts. The undoubted authenticity is the strongest quality of a movie that may leave you with a bland feeling. Hundstage falls definitely short of true greatness as the story lacks coherence and the episodes seem arbitrarily chosen. However as an unblinking study of the human condition it works just fine.";

The problem is that it never becomes a unity and that the order of scenes and sequences seems to be at random a cutandpaste job that could have had any other result. Indeed after seeing it twice I am almost convinced of it that a unsatisfactory linear thoughtout film was changed into the puzzle in the editing room. Egon Schiele was an enigmatic man but not a total puzzle and this film does not bring him any closer.The films also fails in conveying the eroticism and meaning of the Schiele's paintings the camera watches and glides over the models without any understanding of Schiele's intentions we only see beautiful naked bodies. If interested in Schiele you better buy a book with his works in stead.".

	schema:reviewBody "Egon Schiele  Exzesse or Egon Schiele Excess and Punishment is a coproduction between West Germany France and Austria and it's a Germanlanguage film but I also found a Frenchlanguage version which should not be surprising looking at some of the actors in here. This film is from 1981 which means it has its 35th anniversary this year. The writer and director is Herbert Vesely and this is one of his biggest successes as the film got selected to represent Austria at the Academy Awards over three decades ago. It did not manage to get nominated though. The movie runs for slightly over 90 minutes and features a handful of somewhat famous names such as Mathieu Carrire who plays the title character in one of his most known movies Jane Birkin Christine Kaufmann and Marcel Ophls an Academy Award nominee at this point already but not yet a winner. Fairly decent list of names I would say. Sadly this film is also once again proof that it is always about the script. Actors can be good or even great but if the material they are given is not convincing then it will be really difficult to hope for a quality outcome. This is sadly also the case here. It is the story of painter Egon Schiele and his very special relationship to women. He usually painted them nude which did not only have a huge impact on his professional life but temptation always lurked around the corner in terms of his private life. I guess that if you really love films about artists especially painters then you will not be disappointed here as this film is by no means a failure. However I also do not think it is a particularly creative achievement which will get you interested in films on painters. That's why I give it a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

We can see that a team was growing. We can see the intense sense of community and solidarity among them.The documentation doesn't focus on the soccer scenes alone. However it doesn't neglect them. We see the goals again the enthusiastic fans the hilarious atmosphere which infected the whole country.I'm glad we also see a lot of what happened apart from the football ground. It's interesting to see what happened in the dressing room while we the fans watching on TV were fetching another drink or going to the toilet or whatever we did during the breaks.Altogether I can recommend this documentation to everyone who had fun in the great summer 2006.

Jrgen Klinsmann puts up the same statements like a 7th league coach talking to a defender He will smell your breath all the time Arne!.In a nutshell after watching the movie I think if I would meet Podolski on the street court next to my house and if he really had time for it he would never reject playing some One on One soccer games with me and joking about passing girls ..".

Wortmann did a great job in silently observing the German team so you really felt as you were a part of this whole great event. Finally I'd like to say that everybody that enjoy the world cup as much as I did and who took part in the whole public viewing thing should go and watch this movie.

	schema:headline " Exploiting the World Cup to the max!";
	schema:reviewBody "I think this documentary is very typical of Germans in particular and of people in general. Now we have all seen the national team play the World Cup and we were very satisfied with the outcome of the tournament funnily enough when Germany made runner's up in 2002 people weren't as frantic about Germany and the German team as they are now after the World Cup 2006 IN Germany. And when I watched the matches I observed the unaggressive and unobtrusive birth of what news magazines called the NEW NATIONALISM. I didn't really take part in this but I didn't mind it either I just thought Oh O.K. why not after fifty years of forbidden patriotism let the baby have his bottle.But this documentary is overdoing it a bit. First of all I didn't like Snke Wortmanns DAS WUNDER VON BERN because it was way too corny as a movie and it didn't discuss the controversial link between German soccer and German nationalism shortly after WWII at all For example it didn't mention how Peco Bauwens the head of the German soccer association held a speech just after Germany won the World Cup in 1954 talking about the connection between physical education and nationalism in a way you'd probably only expect it from someone like Hitler.And now this A film that takes us on a trip into the locker room for the one and only reason to satisfy our curiosity. We don't really learn anything new about the strategy of coach Jrgen Klinsmann or about the physical part of soccer. This documentary quenches nothing but our thirst for the invasion of privacy. In a way it is not very different from Big Brother We do not satisfy ourselves any longer with seeing our soccer players on the field no we have to follow them everywhere into the locker rooms into the hallways of the stadiums' catacombs everywhere! I still don't understand why the soccer players let Wortmann invade their privacy to such an extent. I can only think of two reasons money and vanity! And Wortmann is a copycat too. He knew that a French director had had an incredible success doing a documentary on the French team in 1998 when the French won the World Cup. He knew that a lot of money was to be made on such a documentary and that this was an opportunity he couldn't miss.Now I know that people are going to say If you are so against it why did you go and see it. The reason is I am like everyone else. Sometimes when I go shopping I look at all these magazines such as GALA BUNTE and so on For the nonGerman readers these are magazines that solely discuss the private life of celebrities or wannabe celebrities and I catch myself reading or leafing through one or two of them. It's the same mechanism that comes into play when you witness a car accident You look! You watch the ambulance the casualties the police because you are so unbelievably curious. And this very same mechanism made me watch this documentary. I watched it out of pure curiosity but I didn't really learn anything watching it. And on meit had the same effect as a car accident I felt ashamed of my curiosity!".

	schema:reviewBody "This effort is half way to being a brilliant film. The cinematography is absolutely superb and there is much early display of techniques such as slowmotion and lowangle photography to capture action shots. The opening pointofview camera work on the train surely inspired Jean Renoir when he made La Bte Humaine.Unfortunately the film has virtually no story at all. What story exists serves merely as a vehicle for the spectacular photography and to that end the film is a success.Also weak is the acting. Leni Riefenstahl is as wooden as ever. Presumably she was chosen because her background in dance allowed her to do many of the stunts and comic pratfalls in the early part of the film when she is learning to ski. Unfortunately like Leni much of the comedy falls flat as it is too heavyhanded or poorlytimed. Her comicrelief costars offer just as little amusement so really it is down to the action scenes and fast pace to rescue this film from tedium.However it is the mountain that is the main star of this film and the snowy slopes succeed in conjuring up atmosphere. This is not a meditative film though about solitude on a mountain but rather each scene is cluttered with skiers chasing and entangling each other. There are no moments of spiritual reflection or solitude here but feelings of the sublime do creep through in spite of this simply due to the aweinspiring landscapes one sees.Overall this is not an essential entry in the mountain film genre as it is so slight but it is an inoffensive mild diversion so worth watching but not worth specifically seeking out. There are better films in this muchbeloved specifically German genre.".

We've already seen Norman drunk at a theatre but here he charms Esther and actually gets her into the movies before marrying her and watching his own career crumble.  March is excellent in this and the look of the film is surprisingly modern with its lovely technicolor and gadgets I particularly like the shower in the motor home Esther and Norman take on honeymoon.  Esther's move to become star Vicki Lester Oscarwinning actress is unbelievable but as her reallife tragedy unfolds compelling. And who can stay dryeyed at the end?

It's an acerbic and at times savage movie about the movies quite cynical for a major studio picture of it's day. It is very well directed by William Wellman who draws firstrate performances from the supporting cast in particular Lionel Stander as a heartless slimeball studio hack.

	schema:reviewBody "She is a freshfaced young star rising in the Hollywood firmament.  He is a downwardlymobile leading man whose fondness for the bottle has ruined his career.  The story is one of love and selfsacrifice within this most selfish of all industries.Roughly once every 20 years Hollywood remakes this paean to its own heartless glamour.  James Mason and Judy Garland starred in the 50's version and Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson on the 70's rendition but for sheer emotional impact this 1937 original is still the best.Technicolor was taking its first faltering steps with this picture and if the colour is a little sketchy in the first half this is forgiveable. Dorothy Parker had a major hand in the screenplay and in this movie about Hollywood artifice and the illusion of cinema intelligent use is made of an actual script at the beginning and end showing dialogue and screen directions.Janet Gaynor is very appealing as Esther Blodgett the naive North Dakota country girl who makes it as Vicki Lester megastar.  She combines a wholesome girlnextdoor charm with a strong talent for humour running through a string of funny voices in the Acme Trucking Co sequence and providing good impersonations of Garbo Hepburn and Mae West.The leading man who falls for her gamine innocence Norman Maine is played with dignity by Frederic March.  He does the drunk scenes realistically without hamming it up and conveys the pain of a man who knows he is hurting the woman that he loves.Hollywood's celebration of itself extends beyond the selfreferential use of a shooting script.  We see planes trains and buses bringing wannabe's to Hollywood and this is where the Technicolor really comes into its own.  The pavement outside Grauman's Chinese Theatre features prominently and the screen test captures the bustle of the assemblyline studio mentality.  Vicki jumps at the crack of the clapperboard as if the Hollywood monster is to be feared.  William Wellman's direction contains knowing ironic elements such as the 'wipe' which imitates the closing elevator doors.The stark shadow halfacross Esther's face in the first love scene is dramatic and symbolises the tenuous nature of the relationship with Esther in awe of the big star while Norman is all too aware of his fading powers. The scene in the night court is excellent in its restrained realism as a line of drunken derelicts is paraded before the magistrate.One small fault that came to my attention is the clumsy edit over the end of a reel as Vicki removes her puritan mobcap. Other than that the film is a flawless and accomplished piece of work.In the end after the great 'sunset over the ocean' scene Vicki decides to go on rather than be that thing that no American can ever agree to being  a 'quitter'.".

Gaynor is wonderful as the country girl who yearns for Hollywood fame.

The supporting cast is peerless with Adolphe Menjou May Robson one of her best roles Andy Devine Lionel Stander and Edgar Kennedy all good. The color photography is although maybe a tad washed out now still striking in its use of shadows. Great script and direction. One of the best. Gaynor and March deserved their Oscar nomination but May Robson was robbed by not being nominated. Her character was left out of the 1954 remake but she is the anchor of the 1937 version. A Star Is Born is a must for all film buffs especially for those who have only see Gaynor is silent films including the great Sunrise 1927.".

A Star Is Born is a must for all film buffs especially for those who have only see Gaynor is silent films including the great Sunrise 1927.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie has been done three times this one in 1937 then in 1954 and finally 1976. I've now seen only this original and only because I wanted to see a young Janet Gaynor for the first time. Beware however a 2012 version is now in preproduction although as we all know it may never be completed  Hollywood being what it is.Of course this story  rags to riches in the acting business  was done first by others  principally Katherine Hepburn in Morning Glory 1933 and oddly enough again in Stage Door 1937 and again with Katherine Hepburn ably assisted by a host of wellknown Hollywood actors including the tireless Adolphe Menjou who never seemed to mind playing a Hollywood boss in this and many other similar movies. The difference with Star of course is it's maybe the first movie to dig into Hollywood screen acting and make an attempt to lay it bare.So the story is banal as most rags to riches fantasies are. Equally however it's an exceptionally welldone narrative that strips the gloss off Hollywood  in a genteelly lowkey manner  to show 1937 viewers just what it took to claw your way to the top. And let's face it being released in the dog days of the Great Depression and as America geared up for war audiences of the day lapped it up. Hard times and war drums were on the way again the people needed to see rags to riches in action needed to know that hardship and sacrifice were just around the corner. And failure was not an option.Today's mainstream audience on the other hand would probably laugh at the perceived and implied naivety of the 1930s crowd.The acting  from Frederic March as Norman Maine the main actor in the story  such an appropriate name! who is already on the slippery slopes to alcoholic and acting oblivion just as he meets and falls in love with Janet Gaynor as Esther Blodgett as the aspiring Hollywood wannabee and both ably assisted by Adolphe Menjou as Hollywood producer Oliver Niles  raises it to the level of simplistic melodrama and without descending into bathos fortunately. And that's largely due to March who is outstanding  literally and figuratively  as the actor with everything to lose. Menjou does his usual highly professional turn  and never misses a turn or beat. And Gaynor? Well I'd say she was perfectly cast as the newcomer who makes good to a point her downtoearth homespun wideeyed trusting nature is personified with her looks tone and carriage  almost to the point of outdoing Shirley Temple.Oddly enough though Gaynor made her last movie in 1938 and did not reappear until 1957 with a guest appearance in Bernadine with Pat Boone whom some would remember.This production of Star in color certainly appeals to the visual senses displaying the lavishness that beckoned neophytes and to which stars become accustomed all too easily. In contrast it also shows  with comedy or gentle satire  the daily grind of making movies and is perhaps the genesis of the much overuse of outtakes bloopers and so on in some of today's productions. Photography editing and script  particularly the last  are all up to scratch as you would expect from a SelznickWellman venture. Dorothy Parker  who wrote the screenplay and who was one of literature's bete noire of the 1930s set  constructed some of the most memorable lines in Hollywood history especially those from Menjou. Worth seeing just for that alone in my opinion.Interestingly and coincidentally Nathanael West  onetime Hollywood screen writer  published The Day of The Locust in 1939 a novel that takes the Star story and twists it into a horrific nightmare. Not until 1973 however did John Schlesinger direct a screen version of the same name that has not been repeated see that one and find out why. Not to be outdone David Lynch film noire auteur extraordinaire has gone one further with Muholland Drive 2001 arguably the ultimate screen statement to date about the prostitution of screen art in the pursuit of fame and fortune and one of the grittiest horror stories ever put to film. Considering some of the scenes of both I wouldn't at all be surprised if Lynch has seen this version of Star.As a significant piece of Hollywood history this 1937 version should be seen by all film lovers and the starryeyed. Highly recommended.Then come down to earth with The Day of The Locust and deliver a coup de grace with Mulholland Drive both of which I've reviewed for this site. Enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "A Star is Born has had two remakes since this 1937 version but when this film is discussed this is usually the version that stands out. I guess if the story has a moral to it it's that for one star in 'shimmering firmament' to be born one has to die. It can be a funny end like what happens to Lina Lamont in Singing in the Rain or it can be a tragic tale as what happens to Norman Maine in this film. But Kathy Selden and Vicki Lester do go on.Esther Blodgett as played by Janet Gaynor is a symbol for all the young people women in this case who dream of seeing themselves on the big screen. Encouraged morally and financially by her grandmother May Robson Gaynor goes to Hollywood and experiences all the frustrations of a young hopeful. But fate is on her side in the person of leading man Norman Maine played by Fredric March in one of his best screen performances.Though Gaynor and March were both nominated for Gaynor the part of Esther BlodgettVicki Lester was no stretch for her. She'd been doing the part of fresh small town girls for most of her screen career this being the best of them. For March however he has to play a weak character something he had not really tackled before.I guess Hollywood knows itself better than anyone else and films about the industry can be scathing. The star is a creature with a fragile ego one moment a whim can move mountains a slip in public affections and no one wants to know you. March as Maine has been slipping for some time and he catches on way too late. But as March is going down Gaynor is on the up escalator and they meet mid point and fall in love. How they deal with their joint careers or lack thereof in one case is what A Star is Born is all about. March and Gaynor get good support from Adolphe Menjou as an understanding producer Andy Devine as Gaynor's fellow boarder at her place of residence and most of all from Lionel Stander as the cynical press agent who inadvertently puts the finish to March's career.Gaynor's final moment on the screen is one of the great classic events as she proclaims to the world she's Mrs. Norman Maine. And why March does what he does is will start an endless discussion of speculation. Watch this film and come to your own conclusion.".

This one is worth a look because of the great cinematography and the use of color for a film made in the early years of its invention. William Wellman deserves credit for his direction of a Hollywood story about itself.The mere idea of young and very naive Esther Blodgett making it big in Hollywood is stretching the imagination big time. This girl from the heart of the country yearns to be somebody in the pictures that are her escape from the dreary life she leads. To even think that she would have a chance in becoming a bit player is a stretch of the imagination but to have her become a star in her own right with her unsophisticated looks is even harder to believe. Hollywood of those years was a factory of dreams where many went to be part of it but for one Esther Blodgett there were thousands who were rejected.We watch as Esther is transformed into Vicki Lester a star larger than life who captures the public's imagination and goes to eclipse bigger stars such as Norman Maine her discoverer and the man she falls in love with. Norman's decline is very fast while Vicki's ascent into glory is even faster. His drinking habit will get the best of him at a time when help agencies such as A.A. didn't exist. Unfortunately for Vicki she ultimately has to pay for her own meteoric success.The cast is superb. Not being a fan of Janet Gaynor I have to confess that she strikes the right note with her EstherVicki role. She is totally believable even though we never even see her take an acting class much less see her waiting tables to help herself. Frederick March brings an intensity to Norman the self destructive star that makes us pity him.Adolphe Menjou is the studio head who sees a winner in the young aspiring actress and gives her the chance. Most surprising of all is the star performance of Lionel Standing as Matt Libby the studio publicist who is behind the creation of the new star. Andy Devine May Robson and the rest are equally satisfying.This film was a happy surprise in many aspects and will not disappoint.".

May Robson plays the role of grandma admirably enough but the beginning was unbelievably corny and the dialogue throughout the film is not particularly sophisticated apart from a retort or two from Fredric March. Without March I don't think I could have made it through to the end of the film. And I'm prepared to accept that Janet Gaynor is a great actress but she's so underwhelming as Vicki Lester. Judy Garland might not have been a stunner but as soon as she opened her voice to sing all was forgiven. And I think Gaynor's casting makes the whole film's premise extremely difficult to believe. I remember reading more than once that this film is still one of the most accurate portrayals of Hollywood at the time and it definitely touches on the cruelty of the star system which sees one actor catapulted into the stratosphere while another falls from great heights into the gutter. However I think there's a more cynical side to this movie's message.

	schema:reviewBody "If this movie's title was A Star Slowly Dies I would have probably given the film a better rating because the parts about Norman Maine were far better than the parts about Esther Blodgett.The central problem with the movie is that there is NO evidence that Blodgett became a star because of her talent. In the 1954 movie James Mason's Maine is blown away by the singing ability of Judy Garland's Blodgett. In this version Fredric March's Maine makes Janet Gaynor's Blodgett a star because he wants to get her into the sack. I'm not making this up.The start of Star sets us up for an Horatio Alger story  an ordinary woman who takes a huge gamble to become an actress despite most of her family's wishes. I waited for a scintilla of evidence that Blodgett had any acting ability or experience. Did she act in a community theatre? Why did she think she could be an actress? These questions and others are never answered.Blodgett's story is supposed to be inspirational. Instead it is depressing. After moving to Hollywood she gets a job as a waitress at a gathering of entertainers. There Maine a huge star meets her and finds her really hot. Subsequently he dates her and then gets her a screen test and a costarring role in his next movie although he's never seen her perform.This narrative is depressing because she became a star as a result of Maine objectifying her and a plainlooking woman with talent would have failed.In a good story the writers would have shown us that Blodgett was a great actress. Instead we're just told that she is. We're shown approximately 10 seconds of her first movie and she spends most of that time kissing Maine. But we do hear critics lavishly praise her. By contrast the 1954 version SHOWS us that BlodgettGarland is a terrific singer.As I watched the first half of the movie I was tempted to label it a failure. However it gets much stronger in the second half as it focuses less on Blodgett and more on Maine. Once a star he declines as she rises. His alcoholfueled psychological breakdown riveted me.In short Maine's breakdown was portrayed far better than Blodgett's rise. The movie also has an interesting sardonic take on the phoniness of the movie industry and how it treats even its stars with a total lack of respect.Interestingly one of the problems with the 1937 version of Star is that it is too short while the 1954 one is far too long. This is partly because the 1954 movie is a musical while this one is not. This version should have spent more time developing its characters.I gave Star Is Born a 6 balancing the 4 that I gave Blodgett's story with the 8 that I gave Maine's story.ZWrite".

	schema:headline " Not quite up to the remake but very little is.";
	schema:reviewBody "I had real fears about watching this film because the 1954 remake is one of my ten favorite films and absolutely perfect in every way.  It stars Judy Garland and James Mason in my opinion two of a handful of truly great actors and Garland's own tragedies gave the story an extra frisson and force.  It makes the greatest ever use of Technicolour intense excessive and emotional and its subject matter shook George Cukor out of his habitual gentility into his best direction unafraid for once to be vulgar.  It is a melodrama it is a musical and I love it to bits.  So you can imagine how initially this original felt inferior in every way. There was no musical numbers to take the load of emotions too intense to be verbalised.  Janet Gaynor seemed like a mouse compared to Judy's tornado. Fredric March was a wonderfully versatile actor particularly good in comedy but James Mason behind his trademark suavity sadism and insanity always had a sadness and resigned loneliness a great generosity of spirit that was just right for Norman Maine.  Worst of all Wellman's direction was far too discreet and distant making the storyline seem rather childish.And yet as it began to build momentum A STAR revealed itself to be a very wonderful film quite different from its remake.  For a start it's as much a comedy as a tragedy and there are many funny lines.  The film is very bitter about Hollywood and the sacrifices necessary for fame as one might expect from a script cowritten by Dorothy Parker although it lacks the attention to detail that would have made the film truly corrosive.  There is a seething cynicism that provides an interesting counter point to the film's weepy elements without ever betraying them the film opens and closes as a script laying bear the artifice and manipulation we are about to see mocking us for succumbing to the very canker it wants to expose.  There are subtle attacks on Hollywood antiSemitism  the very ethnic Henckel becomes WASPworthy Norman Maine.  Lionel Stander 'Moidah' Max from HART TO HART is a very bitter publicity agent whose treatment of Norman towards the end is truly hateful yet we must admit very funny.Far from being childish the film is very mature and is the most sensible and sensitive film about alcoholism until LEAVING LAS VEGAS.  There is no judgmentalism no trite explanations.  The great tragedy is precisely this mystery why should Norman  so attractive so talented so popular  give up everything at the height of his powers.  It suggest demons that are way out of the depth of conventionally pat Hollywood narratives.  Also sex is quite frankly present and they got the shower sequence  where March is quite clearly naked  past the Hays Office is a mystery and a delight.A STAR is a sublime melodrama building up to an unbearable tragic pitch. Even if you know what's going to happen it's hard to resist the tears. This is principally due to the magnificent acting.  Gaynor is truly great convincingly maturing from a callow ambitious smalltown girl to a great actress who must helplessly witness the dissolution of the man she loves. March is truly heartbreaking a worthy partner to James Mason.  Norman is so patently warm amusing loveable loving that it's unbearable and unfair to watch his decline his loss of control.  As forces beyond his control topple him he may lose his public dignity but never our respect.  Our world can't be all bad if it can find room for this masterpiece and its even better remake.  Well until we remember Mecha Streisand that is.".

Fredric March was a wonderfully versatile actor particularly good in comedy but James Mason behind his trademark suavity sadism and insanity always had a sadness and resigned loneliness a great generosity of spirit that was just right for Norman Maine.  Worst of all Wellman's direction was far too discreet and distant making the storyline seem rather childish.And yet as it began to build momentum A STAR revealed itself to be a very wonderful film quite different from its remake.  For a start it's as much a comedy as a tragedy and there are many funny lines.  The film is very bitter about Hollywood and the sacrifices necessary for fame as one might expect from a script cowritten by Dorothy Parker although it lacks the attention to detail that would have made the film truly corrosive.  There is a seething cynicism that provides an interesting counter point to the film's weepy elements without ever betraying them the film opens and closes as a script laying bear the artifice and manipulation we are about to see mocking us for succumbing to the very canker it wants to expose.  There are subtle attacks on Hollywood antiSemitism  the very ethnic Henckel becomes WASPworthy Norman Maine.  Lionel Stander 'Moidah' Max from HART TO HART is a very bitter publicity agent whose treatment of Norman towards the end is truly hateful yet we must admit very funny.Far from being childish the film is very mature and is the most sensible and sensitive film about alcoholism until LEAVING LAS VEGAS.  There is no judgmentalism no trite explanations.  The great tragedy is precisely this mystery why should Norman  so attractive so talented so popular  give up everything at the height of his powers.  It suggest demons that are way out of the depth of conventionally pat Hollywood narratives.  Also sex is quite frankly present and they got the shower sequence  where March is quite clearly naked  past the Hays Office is a mystery and a delight.A STAR is a sublime melodrama building up to an unbearable tragic pitch. Even if you know what's going to happen it's hard to resist the tears. This is principally due to the magnificent acting.  Gaynor is truly great convincingly maturing from a callow ambitious smalltown girl to a great actress who must helplessly witness the dissolution of the man she loves. March is truly heartbreaking a worthy partner to James Mason.  Norman is so patently warm amusing loveable loving that it's unbearable and unfair to watch his decline his loss of control.  As forces beyond his control topple him he may lose his public dignity but never our respect.  Our world can't be all bad if it can find room for this masterpiece and its even better remake.  Well until we remember Mecha Streisand that is.";

It is one of the best of it's era and was justifiably nominated for a swag of Academy Awards.Gaynor portrays smalltown dreamer Esther Blodgett who comes to Hollywood courtesy of assistance from her sympathetic determined grandmother. Trying to break into the movies she gets a job waiting at an Alister party where she happens to meet alcoholic matine idol Norman Maine March. Despite his drunken foolish state he finds her inherently appealing in a sweet attractive manner and arranges for her to get a screen test. After a name change hello Vicki Lester makeover and acting lessons she is soon starring with Maine in his latest picture and garners enormous public and critical praise. Inevitably as these films go Esther and Norman fall in love and marry. However as Norman starts to achieve great personal happiness his career goes down the plughole and even EstherVicki is powerless to stop his decline.March is terrific in a challenging role. He handles Norman's decline brilliantly March was always terrific at accurately capturing a character's emotional state. It is one of the best portrayals of an alcoholic that I have seen because March focuses on the pain the resentment that causes him to drink rather than just the ugly aftermath that a binge leaves in it's path. He makes Norman more than a superficial Hollywood star he makes him REAL. There's no Method applied to his work it's just darn good skill at characterization. March could play comedy equally well as drama so Norman is not a onedimensional tragic star in March's hands. Rather he is a multidimensional charismatic lovable yet ultimately flawed individual caught up in the moneyhungry giant that is Hollywood.One is reminded of John Barrymore in the character of Norman Maine. Barrymore was also a bigshot whose career declined heavily in the 30's because of his alcoholism. It was no secret in Hollwyood as to what he was. March a smart actor would have drawn on this in his portrayal.Ganyor the winner of the first Best Actress award is also very good as Esther BlodgettVicki Lester. Her natural sweetness and quite nature give Esther a unique spirit. Esther is not just a wishywashy typically 'nice' girl she is strong and willing to stick by Norman because of her faith and her faith in their love. Gaynor also does rather funny impersonations of Garbo Hepburn and West at a Hollywood party that reveal a knack for comedy. Yet it is almost impossible to see EstherVick's 'star' qualities in this film. Gaynor certainly keeps them under wraps and one has to stretch the imagination to imagine that Gaynor as capable an actress as she was could possibly out act the great March.Nice supporting work from Adolphe Menjou as a Hollywood producer and Lionel Stander is just poisonous as the vile Libby who while justifiably fed up with March and his chronic drinking and star tantrums has not a sympathetic bone in his body. May Robson as the Grandma is good also but a little tiresome after a while I think it's more how her character was written than her acting abilities. A nice bit of trivia she was a native Australian! The early Technicolour looks quite good but it is slightly primitive so one must overlook this fact to appreciate the film properly. There are some wonderful sequences here March's outburst at the Academy Awards Esther and Norma's first meeting March's final scene. The film loses a bit of class in the parts March is not present. This is understandable as he was such a dominant presence and magnificent actor. Gaynor perhaps couldn't carry a film by itself at this stage in her career which is ironic as her star was actually sliding in real life not March's. He was enjoying the best success of his career she would only make a few more motion pictures before retirement from the screen.A satire on the entertainment industry and also a heartbreaking character study of a marriage ravaged by the effects of alcohol and one partner's growing dissatisfaction with life.".

I've seen reviews stating this film pales in comparison to the remake due to the fact that you get to 'see' that Judy Garland's character can sing but you don't get to 'see' that Janet Gaynor's character can act. This is where I think the point of what this story is meant to portray is being lost by the viewer. The title isn't referring to the 'meteoric rise' of the female character it is referring to the tragedy she endures and how she chooses to overcome it that brings the birth of the 'Star'. In a way Norman Maine gave his life for his wife to be born he felt he was hampering her career and her life so he wished to free her. Janet Gaynor was a star long before this movie came out so it is really unfair to state that one can't believe she didn't appear to be someone that could have made such an impact in Hollywood. She'd been playing the naive type for quite some time she played it well here but she also portrayed her progressive maturity quite well and quite believably. As for me this version shines far above the remake because of the main character portrayals and for the outstanding supporting cast. This movie focused on the Gaynor character's experiences influenced by those around her mostly with March's character. The remake seemed to me to focus mostly on the Garland character a little too much not really getting the feel of those around her other than James Mason's character but even it wasn't as deeply explored and conveyed as the Norman Maine character of the 1937 version. This is not taking anything away from Mr. Mason's performance because there's no doing that he was a great actor. However the Frederic March portrayal was more compelling due to the fact the script allotted him to be plus Mr. March was a wonderful actor one of my all time favorites. Then you also have Adolphe Menjou May Robson Lionel Stander and Andy Devine all giving stellar performances. When you have a great cast like this with a script this well written and a great director like William Wellman whom had some very very great precodes under his belt it's a winwin situation. This movie deserved it's best picture award. And just reading comments on this movie especially in regards to the ending of the Norman Maine character through to the end line I tear up so corny but true. This was and still is a great film.".

And as almost always with these films I have to say that I did like the visuals in here the cinematography etc. Of course they still were far far from the means filmmakers have today but for 1930 it was not too bad. And this film is a great example of the transition between silent film and sound. This is a sound movie but talkmusicnoise was still not too frequent in here and it becomes very obvious that they were still getting used to the new possibilities. Unfortunately even if the lead actor was physically perfect for the role I cannot say I enjoyed this film beyond the visual side especially in terms of the uninteresting script. It feel almost always the same with these Fanck films sadly. All in all I do not recommend these slightly over 90 minutes. Maybe it is worth seeing if you have been on top of France's biggest mountain yourself or are just a major fan of the genre but I personally do not see the appeal in getting up there.

But no matter Sturme uber dem Mont Blanc is still a pretty interesting movie.

	schema:reviewBody "A few years before Leni Riefenstahl became a cardcarrying member of the 'I Love Hiter Fan Club' this German actress aviatrix and director carved out a bizarre little niche for herself. Although she only acted in less than a dozen films I can easily think of four in which the film was set in the frozen wilds! SOS Iceberg The White Hell of Pitz Palu White Ecstasy and Avalanche all starred Riefenstahland she made them one after the other! Avalanche also known Storm Over Mont Blanc begins in the Alps with some lovely shots. However some of the footage also looks like it's stock footage and shot using silent stock as the speed is too fast a common problem in the early sound era as silent film is projected at a speed slightly slower than soundand when the two are combined the silent shots appear to be moving too quickly. Despite this problem the film is quite lovely a few of the shots are amazingand you have to admire the film crew's persistence in getting these difficult shots in the snow on top of a mountain! There is another problem with this footage however and it's much more serious. It seemed as if the film makers were on holiday and filmed a lot of unimportant stuff that didn't further the story at all. Wanting to get the most of their holiday snaps they decided to put ALL of it in the film. It made the film look padded and cheapwhich is a shame as SOME of the footage was great. It also didn't seem to have any plot for the longest timeand what plot it had was quite tenuous! Plus some of the sound in particular the engine of the airplane sounded bizarre and dominated the shots in which it appeared. It was very obviously and clumsily added later. You'd think the folks at AAFAFilm would have done better as the German film industry was among the world's best during the silent era. Here they clearly were making a secondrate film.Overall the film is hardly worth your timeand I rarely say things like this. It just isn't well made and has little traditional narrative. Plus some of Riefenstahl's later snow films were very very good...but not this one. In so many ways this film IS SOS Iceberg when it comes to the plotthough this latter film is so much better. You can however admire some of the camera workas some of the shots are amazingly artistic. At least in this sense the film is a success.".

CALIGARI 1920 this is very much in the same remarkable and stimulating vein of painted sets and distorted perspective. For the record I am also familiar with Wiene's work via THE HANDS OF ORLAC 1924  another perennial whose U.S. remake would also feature Peter Lorre!  and the surviving condensed version of GENUINE THE TALE OF A VAMPIRE 1920. Incidentally I had always been intrigued by a solitary still from RASKOLNIKOV in a movierelated called appropriately enough The Movie! British periodical from the early 1980s but was more or less resigned to never being able to catch the real thing  even if a long time afterwards I am certainly happy now to have been proved wrong in this regard! To begin with the credits for this one are fairly hyperbolic not only is the fact that the cast emanates from The Moscow Arts Theater mentioned twice in hindsight the protagonist registers as a satisfactorily brooding presence but there is even a quite unique recommendation by the National Board Of Review stating that the feature presentation is An Exceptional Film! As was the case with the Sternberg picture the most notable acting is done by the student assassin protagonist the titular figure and the Police official who hounds him his suspicion borne from a passage in the former's own graduation thesis  where he opines that an extraordinary person has the right to commit a crime and not be punished for it especially if this would ultimately benefit mankind!. Again too Raskolnikov's confession occurs mainly due to the insistent pleas of the girl he loves daughter of a bureaucratturneddrunkard whose constant squandering has driven her to prostitution and his wife gradually offthewall!  in this case however it is somewhat overstated as the hero attains what is best described as religious mania though interestingly enough the same 'affliction' is attributed to the painter initially accused of the deed and who eventually takes his own life! The double slaying of a vile female pawnbroker  shown in hallucinations towering over a multitude of despairing clients  and her sister who just happens upon the scene itself is rather skimped despite the fact that Wiene takes care beforehand to have Raskolnikov sew an extra pocket inside his jacket where he can hide the murder weapon an axe and even shows him first stealing and subsequently restoring it! At any rate typically for a Silent of this vintage and style the film is sluggishlypaced by the way the comprehensive greentinting does occasionally obscure the detail from an already faded and battered print!  but for various reasons remains full of interest throughout its 87minute duration for what it is worth this is essentially the same as Sternberg's version whereas others would take the twopart or even TV miniseries route!.".

	schema:reviewBody "You will have an awful time with the Oldies.com version of this very rare film. Most scenes simply disappear into overcontrasty redtinged sepia. It's so bad at times that you can't even make out people's expressions. Most of the scenery gets lost in the darkness.That's too bad because this movie does confirm several things about Robert Wiene First that he was a mediocre director and that The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari was just a fluke and second that he was a master of both composing and filming expressionistic set design. By the time this film was made both modern plot devices and the flow of silent films were already several years in place. This means that the average viewer would be able to follow both the action and the inter title cards and that from one scene to the next the film would have a logical progression.This film doesn't do that. It's really hard to follow what's going on as there is virtually no continuity of either scene or plot. The characters tend to be assembled and encouraged to grandstand in front of the camera without regard to how things are moving along elsewhere in the story. It seems as if there's no head here as if no one read or understood the script. Certainly the actors weren't coached that way. In modern times we'd call that an amateur director. You can't even make the excuse that this problem is from the time period or is expressionistic acting. Not with Murnau and Lang operating in the same time period. This sort of thing may have worked on Caligari it simply doesn't work here. The story line is way too conventional for shots in the viewer's face and its director should have known that.On the other hand the set design is amazing simply incredible mind boggling good. It's as if they tried to reproduce the look of Caligari on a much larger budget. The multilevel 3D expressionistic sets must have been very impressive. Too bad you can't actually see them due to the poor print on this DVD.I went to the Murnau Stiftung in Wiesbaden Germany a number of years ago. The only complete print of this film is being held in Munich. Someone should get to it and release this film in better quality. At least you could spend your time marveling at the sets.Doinker".

It is one of the more but not most known filmmaking efforts by writer and director Robert Wiene. The English title for this one is Crime and Punishment and this is of course a much more known title as many will make the connection to Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel and Wiene who was born in Silesia Poland today when it was still German adapted this one for the screen here. The original version went for over two hours but the version of this film that you are most likely gonna get a hand on namely the DVD version stays slightly under the 90minute mark even. Intertitles exist in several languages the one I watched had them in English. This relatively late career effort by Wiene is one of the earliest films based on the Dostoevsky classic actually the second oldest apparently. So many films were made on this one but none of them really made it famous. This one is certainly among the top3 from all the versions out there I think and still it is fairly forgotten. Maybe the book is just unfilmable? I am not sure as I have not read it. Back to this movie here fittingly with the story's origin there are many Russian actors in here not just Gregori Chmara who plays the title character. Sadly also as a consequence of the low production values in this one I never really cared for the story or characters and I am somewhat glad it wasn't that long of a film. I'd really only recommend it to those rare people who love both the book and the silent film era. Everybody else can skip it for sure.".

Captives are executed or sent running naked into the woods. Neither side has a plan and characters the camera picks out soon die. A White Cossack officer kills a Hungarian and is executed by his own superiors when he tries to rape a milkmaid. At the hospital White officers order nurses into the woods dressed in finery to waltz. A nurse aids the Reds then they accuse her of treason for following White orders. Red soldiers walk willingly singing into an overwhelming force. War seems chaotic and arbitrary.";

	schema:reviewBody "The Red and the White is not a conventional war movie it moves at a continuous ceremonious pace like the melody of a slow march.  It creates an atmosphere where time seems suspended and the situation for all its violence changeless one side gains a victory and captures the other's position then they in turn are captured and then the balance shifts back again...  There is continual motion also as the fighters move to and fro through great spacious natural landscapes shot in sweeping blackandwhite Cinemascope the feeling for space is the most impressive feature of the movie I'm sorry to say that this effect only comes through well on the large screen. The abstraction is enhanced by a total lack of ordinary conversation which is usually intended to give the audience a sense of knowing the characters better even if those characters are totally stereotyped.  Here however there must be only halfadozen lines spoken which are not orders. It's hard to explain why all this should not be highly boring I guess either you are fascinated by it or you aren't.As to the charge of being nothing but propaganda certainly the Whites are presented in a much more unfavorable light than the Reds but I don't think we Americans can plead innocent to the charge of demonizing the enemy in war movies.  The scenes of atrocities committed by the Whites don't break the tone of the movie since they are shot in the same calm manner as the rest and there is no overacting.  Most of all there are no explicit lessons stated a sure sign of propaganda.  If you think this movie is propaganda you've seen nothing yet try one of the many Communistbacked films that really are heavyhanded and preachy like for example the East German Fnf Patronenhlsen set during the Spanish Civil War.".

And that is because it seems like a smart  elegant solution to the problem of portraying what I call disembodied consciousness keeping the viewer consistently tethered to the pointofview of a character is hard enough for most filmmakers but to break free of that and send us scudding through the air of the story? While keeping us engaged in story? Few manage very few.It is this I believe that viewers appreciate when they praise the 'hypnotic' qualities of someone like Tarkovsky this ability to start 'in character' and slowly expand ourselves to hover out of self to where multiple visions are possible  usually the world of story and sense plus the mechanisms transmuting the world into a story. If you are positioned the right way as a viewer this can achieve a feeling of ecstacy.And this guy is using Tarkovsky's camera to excellent effect and knows just how to position the viewer. What does this mean?His first job is to remove hard storytelling limits. Which war this is. Who is killing who. Who to be rooting for. What is the cause that justifies all this if any. We can surmise but staying within clean boundaries is not the focus. In place of that he supplies a more fluid notion of hyperreality  things happen presumably as they would if you were there explanations are absent but the consequences seem real. You may not know just who is out to kill you but you know someone is. This is a world with angry blood coursing through its veins.Now for the actual ecstatic expansion of narrative limits. It is simply superb the way he does it and still seems novel and powerful to me.The normal viewing mode is that already within the first couple of minutes of a film we scan the frame for a protagonist to latch onto trusting he will be our assigned avatar in the world of the film. The filmmaker provides expressive enough faces that we implicitly recognize as such that we follow for just the right amount of 'real' time to invest into then suddenly they are removed from the world maybe to resurface later. Characters are flippantly ordered shot make narrow escapes are summarily discovered again and so on.And a third expansion is of the way we see and navigate this world by having the camera trace circles around the story and float in and out of corridors in the air disembodied from any character.Though still in the experimental stage this is great work.You have bloodshed as your base layer what every other war film works from. You have this force in man in the gears of the universe that moves him to kill which there is no rhyme to beyond the perpetuating of motion. And you have that motion so powerful we see that in the frantic running of prisoners to escape the firing squad it enters the human world and mindlessly tears anchors from the ground and sends our eye skidding to the next turn of the world having stable form again and tears at it and with each groundless  spinning turn of this ballet we float farther and farther away to where it is all an abstract blueprint.Fluid hyperreality narrative and eye  each one placing you a step further from reasoning with this but deeper in the abstract experience of not just life of cosmic dimensions in the transitory dance of everything coming into being and going again.Humans are vanished and reinstated and vanish again with death as flippantly decided as someone dismounting a horse as though it's all a part of some inscrutable game to the amusement of capricious gods.Better yet this is samsara the cycle of suffering and defilements causing eternal transmigration to no purpose.".

October revolution led by Lenin to throw the provisional government which results in a civil war to end in three years with the formation of USSR a republic under VI Lenin. The white army was basically supported by Ruling class and Red Army was peasant's army. The backdrop of this film is the civil war at its peak during 1918 and characters are the victims or victimizers.The whole film is just confusion. It took me a long time understand who's who and what's what. I think thats what the intention of the director is because thats what was going on in Russia in 1918. The whole confusion of who's killing who and for what reason is so beautifully captured in the film. Its a unique film. There is no central character. There is no story but if you have a little sense of history or filmmaking you wont move for one and a half hour. The whole concept of lawlessness is pictured with such a brilliant finesse. By the time you sympathize with a character that story or the character itself is dissolved. Every scene is unique and has some kind of a surprise element. There is nothing which can be remotely termed as artificial. There are lots of things which are very interesting to notice. People are lined up in almost every scene none of the persons who is be shot runs away or beg for mercy its about Russia but from Hungarian point of view etc. Should be viewed by history students across the globe. 1010".

There is no story but if you have a little sense of history or filmmaking you wont move for one and a half hour. The whole concept of lawlessness is pictured with such a brilliant finesse. By the time you sympathize with a character that story or the character itself is dissolved. Every scene is unique and has some kind of a surprise element. There is nothing which can be remotely termed as artificial. There are lots of things which are very interesting to notice. People are lined up in almost every scene none of the persons who is be shot runs away or beg for mercy its about Russia but from Hungarian point of view etc. Should be viewed by history students across the globe. 1010";

	schema:headline " One of the greatest antiwar films";
	schema:reviewBody "Some points...1. Though Miklos Jancso's The Red And The White takes place in 1919 when Hungarian irregulars supported the Communist Reds in fighting the Tsarist Whites along the Volga River the film deliberately ignores any political or historical context and instead goes to great lengths to blur the identities objectives and motivations of its various characters.2. The film lacks characters and plot. Instead Jancso gives us war as cosmic ballet the audience witnessing the evershifting balance of power between sides a constant and repeated cycle whereby the defeated become victors and victors the defeated. Jancso emphasises this process by highlighting the various parallels between the two sides the way they both perform the same rituals of humiliation vengeance and forgiveness throughout the film.3. The film is positively radical in the way it unfolds. Imagine an expansive landscape adorned with forts forests farms and villages. Now place clusters of troops prisoners and civilians on this landscape and set them in motion. Finally imagine a constantly moving God's Eye camera that floats above this landscape gliding from one location or group of people to the next. There is no story here only a constant state of flux Jancso inviting us to become disembodied God's who study the rhythms of combat and the rhymes of war.4. Characters enter the story as quickly as they leave it their deaths occurring offscreen or at a cold distance. There is one character who ties the whole film together however appearing in the first scene and the last but never really assuming a central role. He is a Hungarian played by Andrs Kovk a familiar figure in Jancso's filmography. Significantly he's given a key statement in the film A man can fight and still be human. 5. Whenever a group of soldiers is conquered the victors force them to strip and run away seminaked often sniped as they do so. Throughout the film these acts of ritualised degradation are protested by ancillary characters. One symbolically hands back his rifle one refuses to aim properly during an execution one stops the rape of a peasant woman and one stops the execution of their own soldiers for cowardice. The message a man can fight and still be human.6. The theme that Jancso stresses throughout the film is the cyclical and futile nature of war. In the opening scene a Red soldier is shot by a White Cossack while his comrade makes an escape back to base where it is a Bolshevik commander who is now holding captured White troops at his mercy whom he releases at gunpoint but not before relieving them of their uniforms. Yet within minutes White troops have stormed the Red base and the communists are being forced to undergo the same humiliation of fleeing for their lives naked. This continuing shift of power and authority in the blink of an eye continues throughout the course of the film on an increasingly larger scale eventually captains are shooting captains and companies killing companies. This dynamic equilibrium and the waste of life becomes maddening to the point of exasperation yet effectively depicts the pointless carnage and cost of civil war.7. Jancos is constantly highlighting the randomness of combat. For example one officer is picked up for execution but is randomly saved when another officer arbitrarily sends him away. Time and time again little flukes occur which either spare lives or result in deaths.8. Janco's later films became very rigid and almost motionless. But here like most of his films throughout the 60s and 70s his camera is always in motion. The film is comprised of huge long takes his moving camera chartering massive chunks of land. Of all the masters of this style  Ophuls Tarr Mizoguchi and Angelopoulos  no one has ever taken it to the level Jancs achieved perhaps because he is determined not to explore the inner motivations of his characters. He is more interested in external motion as meaning.9. The choreography here is exquisite.10. The film stresses how victory leads to senseless humiliation both for the winners due to an absence of larger military goals and the losers.11. In one scene a brigade removes their jackets and runs hopelessly downhill toward a group of similarly white shirted soldiers. It's a point made by many war films  everyone wears the same uniform there are no sides  but effective all the same.12. The film ends with a close up shot of a soldier's face the audience asked to recognise the sorrow in his eyes. This final war movie shot has become a clich and I don't think it works here. Why not end the film one scene prior when the army charged headlong  with futility  down a hill? Why abandon the detached aesthetic of the rest of the film? 910  New DVD releases of this film add an explanatory title card along with a silly scene in which horses charge toward a camera before the beginning of the film. Ignore these additions completely. Worth two viewings.".

In fact one often loses sight of which side is which causing all combatants to meld together into a singular chaotic entity that simply fights because it must. It may be a reflection on drawn out conflict in general where the reasons for such exaggerated violence vanish and the world spins into a deranged circus of blood and flak. The long take as engineered by Jansco helps perpetrate the voyeuristic sense in the viewer.

This is a film that firmly clutches us by the chin and shouts No! You are going to watch this! There are no cutaways to safety here. Neither are there any closeups as Jansco keeps us as distant as he can so we have no individuals to sympathize with just humanity itself. Not until the final shot does the camera move into a specific soldier's face as if to remind us after 90 minutes of savagery that yes these people are human after all and they must endure the repercussions for their actions.".

	schema:headline " A great antiheroic film depicting the senselessness and brutality of the Russian Civil War. A very powerful piece.";
	schema:reviewBody "Characterized by visual stylization elegantly choreographed shots long takes historical rural settings and a lack of psychoanalyzing. The Red and the White is a very interesting wellmade movie from director Mikls Jancs. Set during the Russian Civil War 19171922 the RussianHungarian film was originally commissioned to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution in Russia in which the Bolsheviks aggressively seized authority. However the director chose to set the action two years later in 1919 to show the Communist Reds Army in a firefight with the Tsarist Whites Army over the control of some hills near the Volga River. While the movie remains one of the director's most widely seen and admired films this movie is very hard to follow. The reasons for this is because the film lacks a central character. Instead we follow a number of nameless characters from both sides on their quest to survive the battle. There is one character played by Andra Kovak who kinda ties the whole film together appearing in the first scene and the last however he was never really assuming a central role. Supporters of the film point out that the director aim was to prevent the audience from feeling emotionally identify with any one side. He didn't want anybody to seem like they were winning in the battle of ideologies. Like a chaotic stalemate game of chess. Both sides are just killing each other without any strong offensive. We see both forces try to take control of an area only to find himself or herself having temporary peace before being execution a minute later by the next invading force. While the movie doesn't show blood. The film hardly has any scenes where somebody wasn't shooting at somebody. Indeed the movie had no rest point from the violence. I guess it's supposed to tell the audience. That no matter how much control you think you have there is always somebody gearing up to take your place. While the repetitive action makes it a hard sit. It was done on purpose to show the meaningless nature of war. It's one of the most violent movies I have ever saw pre1970s. The movie also really surprised me on how much nudity it had for a pre1970s film. None of it was portray to be sexy. Those sexual abuse scenes were made to be disturbing and degrading. It really haunting imagery on the horrors of war. What I like about the film is while the list of characters is ever so changing the landscape barely moves. It's always set around the beautiful surroundings of the Volga River. You really get to see the large scale of the battle. I also like how the film rejects the war film convention and clichs. For example key moments of action such as the deaths of certain characters are sometimes shot with a long lens from a distance rather than in closeup making it unclear what has happened or who it has happened to. It's give the movie a feel of mystery. Not everything needed to be explain. The only problem with it is that it's hard to tell the different between the 'white' army compare to the 'red' army. There were times where I was often confused on what army I was now watching. It didn't help that the director's choice to use black and white made everybody look the same. I guess the choice was made to turn it bw to serve a deeper viewer's immersion in the historical settling or to show that despite your political colors everybody in war is a shade of grey. The artistic advantage of black and white did help heightens the impact of the film's violence. I love the fact that the film used a lot of long take unedited movie footage. Since the film has barely any cuts it transcribes the screen time as if it's real time. While this movie might seem lawlessness it does have one strong message show by the actions of a few characters throughout the piece such as the one refuses to aim properly during an execution the one who stops the rape of a peasant woman and one stops the execution of their own soldiers for cowardice. The message a man can fight and still be human. A very strong message indeed. While the film might look upon as communist propaganda to the untrained eye. It's barely was. While yes Whites are presented in a much more unfavorable light than the Reds. The movie hardly felt heavyhanded political preachy. During the Cold War Jancs was often criticized for being formalist nationalist and generally against the Socialist ideology. A frequent theme of his films is the abuse of power. His works are often allegorical commentaries on Hungary under Communism and the Soviet occupation. It was no surprise that the film was not well received in the Soviet Union. It was first reedited to put a more heroic spin on the war for its premiere and then banned afterwards. However in Hungary and the Western world it was more favorably received. The film was even listed to compete at the 1968 Cannes Film Festival but sadly the festival was canceled due to the events of May 1968 in France. Overall This is an Astounding piece might be a bit hard to watch to some viewers but if you get the chance to. Try watching it. It might change your opinion on war.".

While this movie might seem lawlessness it does have one strong message show by the actions of a few characters throughout the piece such as the one refuses to aim properly during an execution the one who stops the rape of a peasant woman and one stops the execution of their own soldiers for cowardice. The message a man can fight and still be human. A very strong message indeed. While the film might look upon as communist propaganda to the untrained eye. It's barely was. While yes Whites are presented in a much more unfavorable light than the Reds. The movie hardly felt heavyhanded political preachy. During the Cold War Jancs was often criticized for being formalist nationalist and generally against the Socialist ideology. A frequent theme of his films is the abuse of power. His works are often allegorical commentaries on Hungary under Communism and the Soviet occupation. It was no surprise that the film was not well received in the Soviet Union. It was first reedited to put a more heroic spin on the war for its premiere and then banned afterwards. However in Hungary and the Western world it was more favorably received. The film was even listed to compete at the 1968 Cannes Film Festival but sadly the festival was canceled due to the events of May 1968 in France. Overall This is an Astounding piece might be a bit hard to watch to some viewers but if you get the chance to. Try watching it. It might change your opinion on war.";

I put The Red and the White next to Come and See and Schindler's List in terms of quality and truthful brutal depiction of what war makes to people the perpetrators and the victims. Miklos Jancs's film stands above Spielberg's film mainly because it doesn't have the famous stars the Oscar winning film had rather than that we have unknown actors therefore we don't create oversentimental bonds with their personas but really for their characters and what they go through. That's the valuable aspect of the movie. Nothing and no one to cheer or support. But we can feel for the casualties of war all the lives wasted amidst the domination oppression and conquest of territories and people.The title seems to say it all but it doesn't quite an irony here specially if considered the way it was filmed. And not even shows it all. It's more than just Hungarian White fighting against the Communist Soviet Red the latter supported by Communist Hungarians during the WWI it's more about realizing that is people slaying people nothing making sense and one cannot tell which side is good or bad not even identifying who they are. Armies militaries and divisions come and go and you have to force yourself to figure out which is which and what they stand for. This is the director's intention in demonstrate that ideologies concepts are very subjective completely pointless except to kill and destroy. Subjective invisible yet powerful and destructive. Jancs ignores the use of closeups distantly filming the battles the war games coldly played by the Soviet then later the Hungarian's unmerciful revenge. He tries to keep us distant from the event but he also knows such is impossible since his images of cruelty and despair brings us closer to the tragedy of lost lives in the most atrocious way. Take a look at the agony of the young men who were given a small amount of time to escape from their executors to later realize it was all a trap prepared by the Soviet. They inflicted hope for like five minutes made them run towards a great wall and then killed them all. While doing all that they kept on smiling treating this like it was a game to be won with winners and losers.Unbelievable as it might sound The Red and the White isn't a dated picture. Even if most of us are quite stoic when it comes to violent films this manages to create a profound impact on us way after we have seen it. Its characters are filled with insensitivity carelessly displaying any kind of consideration even some of the victims as well those in a resigned way. We're the ones who have to care for everything of what's happening. Emotions are left to us but far from making us cry.

	schema:reviewBody "The Red and the White is a movie that could have easily been named Gunshot. It purposely runs without any sort of central character and almost everyone the audience meets is at some point shot to death. With very little important dialogue it seems like Jancs was more interested in letting guns do the talking. Which considering the magnitude of his project was a bold move.Mikls Jancs is a Hungarian filmmaker who was granted funding from the Soviet Union to make a tribute to the 1917 Russian Revolution. Rather than make a film that praised the Bolsheviks Jancs aimed his efforts toward a project that played no favorites. He wanted the audience to know that war is wrong arbitrary and absurd.The Red and the White takes place two years after the October Revolution 1919 in the hills overlooking Volga. The Red Army is made up of Hungarians who support the communist movement. The Whites represent the Tsarist that is fighting to remain in power over Russia. There are no main characters in the film Jancs chose to show both sides represented through nameless men and women for the purpose of keeping the audience at the distance. It is a film without heroes kind of like war.As you might have imagined a Russianproduced antiheroic film about the atrocities of war was not what the Soviet's had in mind. The film was quickly reedited before its release in the Motherland and then eventually banned for several years. Outside of the Union The Red and the White went on to become Jancs's most praised and popular film.The subject matter is grittier than your average war film from the time period. It features scenes of attempted rape killing of innocent people humiliation and death in abundance. In one scene Hungarian men are forced shoulder to shoulder onto the ground and shot onebyone in the head. Each time the next person in line is forced to witness a comrade die. And that is just one example. Death is the theme. And for what? The audience never really knows.One heavy criticism of The Red and the White is that it can be very difficult to follow at times. Characters are constantly being introduced killed and replaced at an extremely rapid pace. It is impossible to become attached to anyone in the film because no person is alive long enough to develop an onscreen personality. For me this is a perfect compliment to the feeling of despair that Jancs was trying to achieve. I am of the antiwar sort. One interesting thing about war film is that no matter how hard they try a filmmaker will almost always make war look like fun. I highly doubt it is fun. The Red and the White looks awful so it does its job. I do not need a hero I need reality.Aside from the daring concept the film is also shot in a visually interesting style. The camera lenses get a hefty workout of quickzooms in and out of focus. Some character's deaths are sharply detached from the audience after an unexpected fade or blur. The black and white is crisp and clean though I would like to see a Criterion release with well placed shading and emotionally appropriate shadows over hauntingly violent moments. The looming insanity of war is palpable from the overcastting darkness of the open hills.If I have to admit a flaw in The Red and the White I would say that there is not enough any blood. I am not sure if this was an artistic choice a budget restriction or if it had something to do with the Soviet's overhead  but with the amount of people being shot in the film you'd think there'd be some blood.Maybe I am a little too American in my taste for cinematic violence but if you want to push the absurdity of wartime there is no better strategy than showing an audience exactly what happens during wartime. When a person is shot their bones break their muscles tear and blood spills out of the wound. There is a visible entry and exist wound. But not in The Red and the White. Rather people merely grab their stomach in pain and fall to the ground. They kinda look like they have gas In terms of a war film The Red and the White is a unique look through the eyes of soldiers. It is a strong antiwar statement that hinds under the guise of a Soviet bandwagon film. Though it was dry at times I still found it to be visually striking and emotionally compelling. It is black and white. It is in RussianHungarian. I recommend you watch it anyway.".

It remains one of Jancs's most widely seen and admired films although audiences often find it exceedingly difficult to follow because there really is no plot or protagonist.Besides the clear antiwar message the film also has some incredible cinematography with Tams Soml's camera moving in and out of the action in very fluid motions. It seems very much ahead of its time and calls to mind the much later work of Seamus McGarvey in Atonement 2007.".

It remains one of Jancs's most widely seen and admired films although audiences often find it exceedingly difficult to follow because there really is no plot or protagonist.Besides the clear antiwar message the film also has some incredible cinematography with Tams Soml's camera moving in and out of the action in very fluid motions. It seems very much ahead of its time and calls to mind the much later work of Seamus McGarvey in Atonement 2007.";

	schema:headline " Allegory of Human Desire By Way of Depravity";
	schema:reviewBody "Sion Sono the rising star of Japanese cinema has been crafting a name for himself with a long line of excellent and unique movies ever since the cult hit Suicide Club including 2008's critically acclaimed Love Exposure.In 2011's festival circuit including the Helsinki International Film Festival the director was not represented by one but TWO excellent films Cold Fish and the movie under review here  Guilty of Romance.It is my claim that in Guilty of Romance we have perhaps the director's best work to date  a masterpiece depicting a psychological vertigo into sublime sensual desire and ultimately depravity.Guilty of Romance in the trappings of a psychological thriller is a surprisingly touching tale in the rough shape of an antique tragedy about repressed desire and the incapacity of human beings to ever find what they truly think they desire. The films touches on the wide scope of human emotions ranging from the sublime to the base from the terrifying to the ridiculous coexisting in every human being as a terrifying sublime possibility. All of us can be angels or demons. All of us can soar in the heavens or sink into the depths of hell. All of us are humans with our dangerous powerhouse doubling as cesspool of thwarted emotions and perverted desires seething under the calm surface of our everyday lives waiting to bubble up and turn our lives upside down  but only because our lives weren't stable to begin with and perhaps NEEDED a bit of disturbing!...All this material our all too human character is explored to great end in this movie. To understand the movie it helps to understand a bit of Freud and Lacan and of course Kafka who is mentioned in the story itself. But to really grasp and feel the movie one needs perhaps to have been hopelessly in love at least once in one's life or to have felt a comparably strong passion to understand the point where reason fails and desire takes over.Due to Sion Sono's uncompromising style to viewer needs to feel comfortable with his or her own emotional baggage because the brutality and horror of the plot can strike an unwary heart as obscene  but this is only a mirage since the themes of the movie I claim are perfectly ordinary and everyday just repressed from our everyday consciousness. The film to put it simply conveys human desire as a burning neverending vertigo of passion accurately enough that threatens to overtake human beings even when they think they have finally reached calm and quiet in some safe haven of the soul  like in the alltooperfect marriage of the protagonist which quickly gives way instead to an exciting adventure into the world of depravity which both liberates and ensnares our heroine. Desire for human beings is the pain that we love  and loving it hurts. If you've ever been in love you know what I'm talking about.The gist of the film is that there are desires deeper than words and customs can bear. Even words need to be made into flesh... And flesh demands its reward. Desire is the fuel that can spiral us into hell or lift us into the heavens...That's all that can be said about the story without spoiling it. It goes through various twists and turns that need to be experienced to be fully meaningful.If Love Exposure was Sion Sono's War and Peace then this film is his Mulholland Drive or Sunset Boulevard in addition to being a loose interpretation of Kafka's Castle  a terrific psychological thriller with spiritual trappings all shot in beautiful colourful hypnotic film. This film is simply gorgeous to look at. Every shot is like a picture frame you could hang on your wall. The film is edited together like a love letter to the most patient intelligent passionate and yearning person audience? in the world. This is not an easy film but this is indeed a very rewarding film both in the luxury of details and formally in the larger arch of the whole film's epic narrative.The film's absorbing soundtrack of Baroque and Classical music typical to Sono's work of late adds its own extra flair and is both appropriately placed and emotionally effective. Even the colour palette of the movie works marvels to reflect the changing psychological landscape of the heroine highlighting her descent to depravity. The fastpaced editing keeps things constantly fresh and the structure of the film is carefully constructed to provide an impeccable vista into a spiritual maelstrom that is psychologically lurid but realistic as an allegory of human desire  despite the absurd surreal and selfconsciously Kafkaesque flourishes that accompany the tale to its tragic depths.This movie has been accused by some reviewers as having no point beyond shock value. Indeed it is very difficult to convey the madness of desire without seeming overthetop. However the potent sensual shocking story functions an allegory of the perverted desire trapped within the heart of every human being and its excesses are thus justified. This fearless film I vouch is one of the top ten films about human desire ever made up there with Mulholland Drive and Sunset Boulevard and one of the best Japanese films of the new millennium. A great film like this is not for everyone as should be expected for the patient viewer its beauty will be revealed. Let the movie be appreciated by those with eyes to see and a heart to feel.Summa summarum a great film that reaches by way of depravity the heights of a surprising brutal masterpiece of a psychological exploration of human desire. It shows the capacities of the art form wrapped in the tight package of an entertaining ridiculous and bloodthirsty two hours well spent on a rollercoaster ride of alltoohuman desire.".

	schema:reviewBody "The awesomely inappropriately titled Guilty of Romance is Sono Sion's recent take on another dysfunctional family dynamic. It was billed as the final installment of a trilogy of movies the first two being Love Exposure and Cold Fish. However I'm not sure why these films are considered to be linked together in any way and Sono has been making movies like this for a quite a while. Aside from the aforementioned films Noriko's Dinner Table Suicide Club Strange Circus and several others all fit a similar mold.SPOILERS AHEAD!If you're not familiar with Sono's work you should be. He specializes in telling stories involving family and personal relationships from a peculiarly dark perspective. Often sensationalistic and packed full of cult like themes sex violence and depravity his films frequently leave an indelible impression on the viewer. It takes more than that to get my attention though and it's pretty clear this is a very talented director and writer who has delivered a number of spectacularly effective films over the years. Cold Fish is a wonderfully devious and subversive movie and I can think of very few films that can be compared to the epic and I do mean epic Love Exposure.Needless to say Sono's films aren't for everyone and many people will find them disturbing or distasteful. Oh and you'll definitely want to keep the kids as far away from these movies as possible. One almost has to wonder if there is something wrong with this director's mind or if there was some traumatic past experience that forever shaped his view of the world. It's hard to imagine that any rational person could or would want to tell so many bizarre stories about the darker side of a person's soul. Regardless of wherever he draws his inspiration this dude is clearly walking a fine line that often borders on being equal parts brilliant and insane. What results on screen is often fascinating to watch though and that's just fine by me.Guilty of Romance follows Sono's trademark style of storytelling. Everybody is basically a weirdo or deviant or soon will be. Megumi Kagurazaka who played the role of the supporting wife in Cold Fish takes the lead here. She plays the dutiful albeit sexually repressed wife of a famous romance novelist. Bored with her everyday housewife routine she searches for an outlet which soon leads her down a path from light modeling to porn star to sex obsessed prostitute. Her transformation from reserved woman to sexually insatiable beast is impressive to say the least. It took some guts for this actress to just take on this role let alone embrace it the way she did she gets naked a lot and she has sex a lot throughout this film. In addition to her blistering physical performance Ms. Kagurazaka does an equally fine job of portraying the changinggrowing thoughts  feelings of her character as one would be inclined to expect within the context of the role she was given. She single handily drives this film to be better than it should be and she is by far the best part of this whole endeavor.There's 4 other primary characters in this film. There's the husband who may or may not be hiding his own secret life the female professor who has long since undergone her own secret sexual transformation and whom now acts as somewhat of a mentor to Megumi's character the mother of the professor who doesn't take too kindly to tolerating her daughter'inlaw's debauchery and the playboypimp dude who helps facilitate much of the sexual goings on.As the story progresses all primary characters discover more about each other and themselves while the plot unfolds towards the big finale. It's all pretty standard stuff for a Sono film but there was very little that stood out or surprised me here. In fact I was a bit disappointed overall. Whereas many of Sono's previous films have an oddly free flowing appeal to them Guilty of Romance seems to be quite a bit more forced and contrived if not downright pretentious and it's all very linear in nature. As with the case with many of his films there's usually a character or two or some event that sends the protagonist on their journey of discovery and that's no different here. The pimp professor and mother all play their part in filling this role in this instance but I think there was far too much importance placed on the significance of each of these characters. These characters also serve to be part of a secondary story that revolves around a murder mystery. This whole entire secondary story was unnecessary in my opinion and this only served to detract from the primary focus of the film.This film would have probably been better served to just concentrate on the role of the lead character and to just let the star of the film have at it! It would have been far more interesting to just observe her performance and what the effects and outcome of her actions would ultimately have on her life and her marriage. The lead role didn't really require the heavy handed impetus of the other characters in the story. Handling them as more of fleeting acquaintances similar to how the modeling scout or porno actor were implemented would have likely worked much better overall.Overall I did enjoy this movie enough for the most part to recommend and as usual for a Sono film it is quite memorable. But I've come to expect more from this director over the years I guess that's the price one must continually pay for repeated success. Worth it alone though just for Megumi Kagurazaka's incredible performance.67 out of 10 stars should do it. I'll give it a 7.P.S. This film borders on being a stylized soft core porn film with a story to tell. So Viewer Beware!".

The pimp professor and mother all play their part in filling this role in this instance but I think there was far too much importance placed on the significance of each of these characters. These characters also serve to be part of a secondary story that revolves around a murder mystery. This whole entire secondary story was unnecessary in my opinion and this only served to detract from the primary focus of the film.This film would have probably been better served to just concentrate on the role of the lead character and to just let the star of the film have at it! It would have been far more interesting to just observe her performance and what the effects and outcome of her actions would ultimately have on her life and her marriage. The lead role didn't really require the heavy handed impetus of the other characters in the story. Handling them as more of fleeting acquaintances similar to how the modeling scout or porno actor were implemented would have likely worked much better overall.Overall I did enjoy this movie enough for the most part to recommend and as usual for a Sono film it is quite memorable. But I've come to expect more from this director over the years I guess that's the price one must continually pay for repeated success. Worth it alone though just for Megumi Kagurazaka's incredible performance.67 out of 10 stars should do it. I'll give it a 7.P.S. This film borders on being a stylized soft core porn film with a story to tell. So Viewer Beware!";

Over 2 hrs that's A MUST with him lol the director Sion Sono and not a problem just something that either seems to happen because sooo much is going on or he intentionally makes it that long to be seen as unique in style and vision. Well whatever then.Either way this is my favourite film by him. First is this then Cold Fish then Suicide Club 1 then Play in Hell then Love Exposure then Suicide Club 2 then Strange effing Circus eugh lol strange indeed and just...ugh. It was ugly looking lacking and disconcerting. Not sure about the point there AT ALL but I'm sure anyone with a way of words can explain anything.Well anyway this film made me cry. Not because I sought out a certain kind of film during a time of mental boredom and emotional fatigue after chronically intermittent downward spirals. And it just drains my head and heart afterward. I end up feeling dead inside and so I need stimulation fast. I was tired of mundane stuff. I've no idea how I came to find Sono's work but at the time it hit the spot that wasn't getting hit ever. Guilty of Romance might be a top favourite film on my expanding list.Thankfully it wasn't so disturbing by the time I got to it. Maybe if I were more prudent or had a virgin mind and eyes I would be more terrified like I'm probably meant to be after watching what probably is something so disturbing. But I don't see it that way it's comforting in its depravity. Because it's all too real.What's sad is the character played by Sono's real life wife. She's lonely untouched and insecurely obsequioussubservient. She does everything meticulously for her husband. Not herself and no one else. Sono normally introduces every character for like an hour separate lol with chapters but here you still have no effing clue how the wife ended up here from what I recall after a couple rewatches. Like who her family are where they are where she's from. It seems to be an unspoken or culturally context arranged marriageomiai in Japan. Because I don't see the love that brought them together! She IS guilty of romance. She wanted it badly and so badly that she later was so confused enough to be talked OUT of wanting it. It was too much of a burden to seek so she gave up on it almost maniacally so. I still am not sure about the whodunnit in this film like the whokilledwho factor. It would've been SO great with JUST the wife's story being alone getting naively tangled into the sex industry infidelity her loss of status loss of self loss of love and the mind all the things she desperately sought out after meeting the hooker who somehow inspired her this hooker is someone who crawled out of the dark side of feminism if not misandry altogether or just utter insanity lol. I absolutely HATED that woman and her character and the actress. All of it just put me off. Not the sex scenes not the anger just...her. She was...well...unattractive lol But whatever.I get her story afterall it took an hour to clear it up. She basically has a very creepy traditional mother and a double life herself as a prestigious lecturer and hooker. This probably shows her self conflict of fulfilling expectations and then saying to hell with them. It's a strange conflict I'm sure most people might at least have sex or do kinky things for pleasure out of the job but her strolling around at night assertively telling men to have sex with her when she's a professor is albeit weird to say the least lol And why this attracts the wife to this lifestyle no clue but that also indicates how lost and alone she is. The plot twist was good didn't see it coming betrayals everywhere. Madness in all these fools and creeps to be honest. And it drove the wife to have to accept the path she followed behind the hooker. What's so heartbreaking for me is that in the end she had to do it alone undeservedly. She was gleeful in what I think is denial and just plain gullibility that this secret life would eventually find her satisfaction and would spark passion and romance in if not her marriage then her life. That's how she is guilty. Sono is probably saying she was gullible to think that road she chose would lead anywhere like that but luckily it seems this kind of downfall is not normal that a certain type of person would descend this way. A person desperately seeking the Castle obviously a metaphor in this film for stability and happiness. Apparently based on some Russian or German or something story which Sono likes to do as well. There's also something in here and I'm not sure if it's an original piece of Sono's promoting his own poetry here but it was something thematic in the film about not crying. And this was recited by the hooker. She damn near preached it. Not to cry but to do. This also ties in with Buddhism which Sono might be. That sorrow is selfish. And this could've driven the wife to not wallow in dolor and self pity but to do. Unfortunately what she did was stupidly wrong. Does anyone care about the color the soundtrack scenery wardrobe? Stuff like that those elements that do help make the film? I'm sure there's a science to all of this but the film wasn't ugly. Sono intentionally uses color here all throughout the film. Not sure if it's symbolic I'm not trying to impress anyone with this readyathandreach wheel of colors and their meanings. But aesthetically the color was nice lol The other stuff eh.".

The previous movie in his loose trilogy of 'human condition' films was COLD FISH in which a mildmannered fish shop owner was sent on a journey of dark discovery whereas this film is about a mildmannered housewife who undergoes her own bizarre ordeal.If anything GUILTY OF ROMANCE is even colder and more harrowing than COLD FISH even though it's considerably less gory and not really a horror movie. Instead this film is about a woman who ends up becoming a prostitute so it's all about a dual journey of selfdiscovery and selfcorruption. It's quite dark and depressing although the film is so wellshot and wellmade that it's quite gripping and very watchable. I found it had similarities to Kim Kiduk's BAD GUY although Sion's style is all his own.Taking the lead is Sono's own wife Megumi Kagurazaka who gives a quite astonishing performance. She's often required to go completely nude for the role but far from being a mere voluptuous figurehead for the tale she's oddly endearing perhaps because of her foibles. You can understand her. Equally as good in support is the frightening Makoto Togashi playing a truly broken character who is one of the most disturbing I can remember seeing in a film. The movie is a visual masterpiece featuring surrealistic touches and expert cinematography and it seems to cover a heck of a lot of ground in a running time that isn't overlong.

	schema:headline " titillation and not much else";
	schema:reviewBody "A female detective arrives straight from indulging her extramarital affair to a crime scene where the mutilated sexual organs of a female victim have been recombined with a mannequin. We then follow three female protagonists in an ostensible exploration of female sexuality. Sex and murder in the first sixty seconds part of an impressive sequence that presents bold dark colours and incessant rain and promises to analyse the margins of the human psyche in the vein of Seven.Sion unfortunately fails to deliver on the promise instead indulging his juvenile penchant for sexual humiliation and big sausage jokes. One character drones on endlessly in pseudophilosophical terms about female sexuality dressed up for intellectual effect by lacing in Kafka the females all the while slipping over to the 'dark' side. However the sex scenes go on too long and are very stagey. The paint balls and asphyxiophilia don't seem to comment on anything except Sono's immaturity. The criminal investigation is nonexistent as the detective visits crime scenes has phone sex then has the murderer handed to her on a plate. Two of the three females are both indulgent of and ashamed of their sexuality while the third has an implausible double life as university professor and prostitute. Coincidentally the true story that this character is based on is a much more prosaic and toneddown affair. Sono sets out an interesting stall and there are some juicy dark themes to be explored here but his writing is not up to the task. He is both fascinated and appalled by female sexuality and ends up fetishizing it. The camera's gaze on the women is prurient and voyeuristic. Contrast this with the representation of the men who populate the film servicing the adult films pimping the women paying to be johns... They sit on the margins of the frame their behaviour taken for granted and natural. Only female sexuality is in any way problematized. Where Sono does excel is in the performances he gleans from his leads. Miki Mizuno as detective Kazuko Yoshida is a charismatic presence who deserved more screen time. Makoto Togashi puts in a kinetic shift as the disturbed Mitsuko Ozawa managing to carry a role that is punctuated by risible scripted moments such as a professor soliciting a male student on her own campus. The scene where Mitsuko sits down with guests for tea with her mother is very funny darkly so and manages to hit a high spot the rest of the film does not quite achieve. Megumi Kagurazaka who Sono apparently married recently also has some sharp comic moments in the early scenes of her buttonedup marriage. Highly stylized these moments nonetheless poke a stick at patriarchal attitudes still far too prevalent in 21st century Japan. Kanji Tsuda is impressive as the narcissistic husband. The one letdown is Ryuju Kobayashi who in no way carries the malevolence his character is meant to convey. The wardrobe department clearly would like him to reference 'A Clockwork Orange' but he looks like an interloper from a boy band who stole a big boy's clothes.'Cold Fish' shows Sono has talent and for the sake of Japanese cinema I'd love to see him stretch himself and break out from the niche genre  somewhere between Pink and Torture Porn  where he has set up camp. A more disciplined script tighter running time and more mature engagement with story might make that happen.".

	onyx:emotionText "A female detective arrives straight from indulging her extramarital affair to a crime scene where the mutilated sexual organs of a female victim have been recombined with a mannequin. We then follow three female protagonists in an ostensible exploration of female sexuality. Sex and murder in the first sixty seconds part of an impressive sequence that presents bold dark colours and incessant rain and promises to analyse the margins of the human psyche in the vein of Seven.Sion unfortunately fails to deliver on the promise instead indulging his juvenile penchant for sexual humiliation and big sausage jokes. One character drones on endlessly in pseudophilosophical terms about female sexuality dressed up for intellectual effect by lacing in Kafka the females all the while slipping over to the 'dark' side. However the sex scenes go on too long and are very stagey. The paint balls and asphyxiophilia don't seem to comment on anything except Sono's immaturity. The criminal investigation is nonexistent as the detective visits crime scenes has phone sex then has the murderer handed to her on a plate. Two of the three females are both indulgent of and ashamed of their sexuality while the third has an implausible double life as university professor and prostitute. Coincidentally the true story that this character is based on is a much more prosaic and toneddown affair. Sono sets out an interesting stall and there are some juicy dark themes to be explored here but his writing is not up to the task. He is both fascinated and appalled by female sexuality and ends up fetishizing it. The camera's gaze on the women is prurient and voyeuristic. Contrast this with the representation of the men who populate the film servicing the adult films pimping the women paying to be johns... They sit on the margins of the frame their behaviour taken for granted and natural. Only female sexuality is in any way problematized. Where Sono does excel is in the performances he gleans from his leads. Miki Mizuno as detective Kazuko Yoshida is a charismatic presence who deserved more screen time. Makoto Togashi puts in a kinetic shift as the disturbed Mitsuko Ozawa managing to carry a role that is punctuated by risible scripted moments such as a professor soliciting a male student on her own campus. The scene where Mitsuko sits down with guests for tea with her mother is very funny darkly so and manages to hit a high spot the rest of the film does not quite achieve.

Is this what they call Horror in 2012?Given that I'm not Japanese and have never lived in Japan I could only hope that I missed the entire message of this film and that's only if I give it enough credit to assume it had one. What I didn't miss was a 100 minutes Asian erotic film meant to appeal to the audience's libido rather than their brains or hearts. The amount of nudity and sex scenes bordered on shameful and that's coming from a guy. If you're gonna shoot an erotic film  do it by all means! Just don't make it appear as more than that.Yes there was a story hidden there. Yes the main actress Megumi Kagurazaka is gorgeous and sexy and has very lovely breast as the audience is constantly and repeatedly reminded. The attempt to add a crime story a murder was at best unsuccessful. The way the story evolved was predictable and not interesting. Sorry to sound harsh but I was expecting HorrorDrama not a self indulging peep at sexual fetishes they offer it all here! a raped woman enjoying the act people strangling each other and to top it off towards the end  a woman peeing!Bizarre erotica with an attempt at a story with a meaning. Nothing more. Wanna watch it? Go ahead just lower your expectations in advance. I have no clue how this movie rated above 4.".

Her husband is a perfectionist and demands her to be so as well. But when she finds a part time job at the super market things starts to change in her life.Story is an adaptation of murder of Yasuko Watanabe description in Wikipedia by director and screen writer Shion Sono that occurred in 1997. The movie to me had two phases. First half was about Izumi and the way she gets duped into the shady side of society. The second part is the horrible truth about Mitsuko Makoto Togashi and the truth about who's body it was that was found at the beginning of the movie.The first part of the movie was beautiful but the second part of the movie was gruesome. First part was well made but I couldn't get into the second part. Mitsuko's character lacked authenticity and her social background improbable. So otherwise it was a fine movie but there was no story towards the end Mitsuko's life seemed forced just to justify the plot. I wish the quality was consistent throughout the entire movie.".

Attempted because the Effi Briest Madame Bovary Anna Karenina The Kreutzer Sonata sort of neglected wife with a boorish husband and  or otherwise unhappy marriage was only one sort of springboard into this 'adventure' for Mitzuko and it was neither followed up nor very convincing e.g. the absence of her preexisting life except when  exceptionally awkwardly  some friends are produced and invited around for tea.The stupid husband seemed from what I could judge from the subtitles to be a celebrated writer but actually despite his airs of Mills  Boon perhaps where the romance comes in? or maybe Alan Titchmarsh. By contrast Sleeping Beauty did not need an such excuse and went straight in not even via touting hot sausages in a supermarket but with a proper waitressing job that was not enough to finance university and lifestyle. Then along with that Australian film we move off into the territory of Buuel's Belle de Jour frankly more challenging after all these years 1967 than either but only as a buildup for sexual liberation generally and specifically a cheap laugh about how doing a pornoshoot with a stud makes one better at offering hot sausages enthusiastically those scenes in themselves were surely a surprise to no one least of all Mitzuko.And that leads us into the domain no going back of casual sex dressing differently  seductively and the lovehotels about which we were so carefully told before.

Well I didn't but I cared even less to hear what I am fairly sure was Wagner's Siegfried Idyll and Bach's works for cello accompany all this and that apart from not being interested in how it unfolded was my main impulse for leaving. Perhaps the incongruity would have been less for those who were unfamiliar with this even so admittedly wellknown music perhaps not but it turned the switch to 'off' for me. Or was this really an attack on the cultural imperialism and globalism of the western world disguised as a film? Certainly there was little evidence of the restaurant and retail chains that dominate most cities. Certainly we were being shown a culture particular to Japan in the lovehotel. Certainly the western music of the baroque and the nineteenth century was being challenged to stand up against the most graphically demanding of bedfellows and thereby proved that Bach is not after all strong enough to survive any treatment even if that of Jacques Loussier were not enough to demonstrate otherwise so maybe...Still don't care!".

The actors perform OK and pass on a great feeling of team building and the intensity between each buddy however they did seem a bit too young for the jobs.The plot evolves in a very steady way showing a different perspective of the typical military training. This movie moved me with its funny moments typical Japanese a few intense sad moments and for people afraid to drown and of being breathless the movie will have a few moments of anguish and uneasiness too!

	schema:reviewBody "Shot in Nazi Germany in 1941 HEIMKEHR shows the suppression of ethnic Germans in a little town in Eastern Poland now Ukraine during spring and summer of 1939. While Polish military prepares for war German schools are closed and plundered. Minority rights are cut down or disrespected. Open hostility and violence against German people increases while the official authorities watch on. After the outbreak of the war the Germans are interned into a prison. Only the progress of the Wehrmacht safes them in the last minute. The final scenes show them being relocated and transferred back to the Reich.For today's audiences this film shows a world surrealistically turned upside down as it is a Nazi produced film that accuses ethnic persecution and a chauvinistic state treating his unwelcome citizens with ruthless disposal and disrespect of laws. Many scenes and lines said by the actors appear familiar from countless AntiNazimovies. The propagandistic means employed by director Gustav Ucicky are mostly very primitive as the villainous Poles look ugly and mean with no redeeming qualities at all. Even a few nasty Jewish stereotypes are thrown in.Other scenes such as the imprisonment of the Germans in a crowded dark cell have an intense nightmarish quality and ironically strongly recall Holocaust iconography for today's viewers. The final speeches held by the otherwise great Austrian actress Paula Wessely are a torture to watch pathetic pompous silly and empty propaganda at its worst as lifeless as a cardboard.It should however be pointed out that the pogromlike assaults including murder and manslaughter the increasing ethnic hostilities and the aggressive nationalist policy of the Polish state which was also directed against other minorities or in this particular thenpart of Poland rather majorities such as Ukranians Jews and Belorussians is based on welldocumented facts which are given little attention or downplayed by many historians today for mostly political reasons. As the war came closer the hostilities on both sides increased. There are many scenes such as an incident at a movie theater when the Germans are forced by an angry crowd to sing the Polish national anthem which may actually be fairly realistic portrayals of the atmosphere in certain parts of the country and the loyalty conflicts endured. Other now rather forgotten facts of the prelude to the war are shown as well such as the mobilization of the Polish army as early as March 1939. A Polish propaganda poster which can be seen in one scene that calls for a Greater Poland reaching as far as Berlin and further is authentic as well. After the outbreak of the war several Thousands of German civilians were interned and massacred throughout Poland.

	onyx:emotionText "Shot in Nazi Germany in 1941 HEIMKEHR shows the suppression of ethnic Germans in a little town in Eastern Poland now Ukraine during spring and summer of 1939. While Polish military prepares for war German schools are closed and plundered. Minority rights are cut down or disrespected. Open hostility and violence against German people increases while the official authorities watch on. After the outbreak of the war the Germans are interned into a prison. Only the progress of the Wehrmacht safes them in the last minute. The final scenes show them being relocated and transferred back to the Reich.For today's audiences this film shows a world surrealistically turned upside down as it is a Nazi produced film that accuses ethnic persecution and a chauvinistic state treating his unwelcome citizens with ruthless disposal and disrespect of laws. Many scenes and lines said by the actors appear familiar from countless AntiNazimovies. The propagandistic means employed by director Gustav Ucicky are mostly very primitive as the villainous Poles look ugly and mean with no redeeming qualities at all. Even a few nasty Jewish stereotypes are thrown in.Other scenes such as the imprisonment of the Germans in a crowded dark cell have an intense nightmarish quality and ironically strongly recall Holocaust iconography for today's viewers. The final speeches held by the otherwise great Austrian actress Paula Wessely are a torture to watch pathetic pompous silly and empty propaganda at its worst as lifeless as a cardboard.It should however be pointed out that the pogromlike assaults including murder and manslaughter the increasing ethnic hostilities and the aggressive nationalist policy of the Polish state which was also directed against other minorities or in this particular thenpart of Poland rather majorities such as Ukranians Jews and Belorussians is based on welldocumented facts which are given little attention or downplayed by many historians today for mostly political reasons. As the war came closer the hostilities on both sides increased. There are many scenes such as an incident at a movie theater when the Germans are forced by an angry crowd to sing the Polish national anthem which may actually be fairly realistic portrayals of the atmosphere in certain parts of the country and the loyalty conflicts endured. Other now rather forgotten facts of the prelude to the war are shown as well such as the mobilization of the Polish army as early as March 1939. A Polish propaganda poster which can be seen in one scene that calls for a Greater Poland reaching as far as Berlin and further is authentic as well. After the outbreak of the war several Thousands of German civilians were interned and massacred throughout Poland. That the Nazis in consequence could do far worse than that is a testament to the cynical hypocrisy and doublespeech of totalitarian regimes.";

Why must movie studios always feel they know better than the director. This film would have been much more successful had they left it alone but by insisting on so many cuts and changes they shot themselves in the foot. All because they wanted a family friendly spiderman type film instead of the much more dark and violent world of daredevil. Every scene added to the film makes you wonder why they cut it in the first place. It isn't just about adding scenes though they have taken a couple out too. I can't imagine anyone who would miss the fireside love scene. I urge everyone who saw the theatrical cut to watch the directors cut. It isn't a perfect film but it's a more complete and enjoyable one. Also watch the documentary on the directors cut DVD and see one of the producers trying to defend the original release and then actually saying he thinks it is the better cut. I think he must be more blind than Matt Murdock!!!".

But now that i have seen the true version of this movie the director's cut i don't have any desire to watch the theatrical cut ever again. The director's cut is an improvement in every way. Everything makes sense now and the characters are more fleshed out which is a very good thing. The DC is 30 minutes longer than the original cut of which the new footage ranges from a whole new big subplot and little things that actually have more impact and and make the movie more understandable and better than you might imagine. The action scenes are way better also. The DC makes the movie into what it should've been in the first place before the studio screwed with it. I can't believe how much the studio hacked this movie up for theater..it is quite ridiculous. But now with the movie restored to it's original vision i can fully enjoy it without the thought of something missing from it. In comparison the only thing that the original DVD release has over this new DC DVD is it has a second bonus featuresbehind the scenes disc. The DC DVD is one disc and has a few movie trailers a makingof featurette and an all new audio commentary. Despite it's shortcomings in form of a second disc compared to it's counterpart i'd choose the DC over the theatrical version any day. The DC is simply so much better. Forget what you know about the theatrical cut of the movie and give this new DC version a chance..it is superior to the other version in every way. So give it a try and i think you might be pleasantly surprised. Even those of you who hate the original cut. My vote in comparison Theatrical version 5.5 Director's cut version 9.5In closing i'd like to thank the Director the film editors and everyone else who made this wonderful Director's cut DVD possible. I love the new version and it's nice to see the Director's vision restored to this movie after nearly 1 12 years. Two thumbs up! R.I.P. Daredevil theatrical version!!".

Although i liked the theatrical release  but didn't love it i still bought it when it came to DVD...and to be honest when i watched it the 2nd time on DVD i didn't think as much of it as when i left the cinema.So when i heard the directors cut was out and people who hated the first release but liked the 2nd one i thought wow i didn't mind the first perhaps i will really like the new version. and guess what? I did ! Its absolutely fantastic. After the characters were fleshed out more the storyline was more involved and filled in the plots you actually cared about what happened and got more into the feel of being apart of what was going on in hell's kitchen.If you watch the featurette  giving the devil his dues you will understand that Mark Johnson the director absolutely loves this material loved the comic and was disappointed himself with the theatrical release. He understood why the critics  fans alike didn't support it and really wanted to fix the problems with this DVD. When will Hollywood studios  executives learn a 100 minute movie does not mean a better movie  and when will they learn that audiences DO want more than just action  we can think you morons! And can hold our attention for more than 100 minutes. Here's a simple plan for your money making schemes  and this goes to Gary Foster  producer who still says the theatrical version of daredevil is better If you make a GOOD MOVIE that gets good reviews and that fans  critics enjoy then more people will see it more people will see it a 2nd time more people will recommend it to friends and that means a bigger audience a repeat audience and bigger dollars for your pockets ! So while the first was a quick paced movie that made quick bucks a longer  more thoughtout MOVIE would have garnered longer life at the box office.in a word  RECOMMENDED !".

I also loved the Matrixlike martialarts incorporated throughout the film. In fact as far as darkerthemed comic book movies go I think Daredevil is a much better film than either of the first two Batman pictures were. I recently watched SpiderMan again on DVD and I've always had mixed reactions of it. I do think it works on the level of campy fun and for that I gave it a B Minus. But I think Daredevil is a more solid picture and I'd grade it with a B.I like the look of the film the washedout colors make the movie look very 70's in certain scenes. Like The Crow the movie has an MTV mentality with rock and rap songs but also has a love story as well. The sound design is awesome if you have a good theatre sound system Daredevil will take full advantage of it. I don't think Ben Affleck got credit when it was deserved. Along with Jennifer Garner Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan Affleck was perfect cast.Anyhow as much as I believe Daredevil is a much better film than SpiderMan was. I actually think SpiderMan 2 is better than Daredevil. The best comic book movie ever placed on film. It shows that a director can really improve on his work. I highly recommend that film to anyone. Well the bottom line is SpiderMan B Daredevil B and SpiderMan 2 A. I hope you enjoyed my review.".

I do agree that having Matt walk with Elektra after that bizarre fight would've been a better idea. It would make the impact of her death more believable. In the DC Matt only bonds with Elektra on two shallow occasions. He plays with her for three minutes in that silly sparing match and then walks her up to the roof and leaves her standing in the rain. So why does she wish you could see me tonight at the ball? There is no depth or connection at all. The DC works well for most things but it really hurts the relationship aspect between Matt  Elektra. Besides the relationship factor this version is better. The fight scenes are vastly supperior. A must own on DVD.".

	schema:reviewBody "First off this was a more complete version of the DVD which came out earlier. In this edition about a halfhour of new material was added to the disc and what was shown at the theaters. All reviews I read said it elevated this film from fair at best to good. I agree. It made the movie much much better.Yeah it's more farfetched than the other superhero movies because here the hero is a blind guy who because of his blindness has extraordinary hearing powers along with the rest of the usual BatmanSpidermantype athletic skills.As in most of the Batman films this is a dark film. I think it would have been better had it lightened up a bit with a few jokes and a more wholesome female lead. Jennifer Garner is another one of these latterday skinny chicks who is made to be toughlooking toughtalking and toughfighting. In other words ridiculous. However I will say she comes across a little more likable on the extended version. One more negative the fight scenes go on a tad too long and are outlandish.On the positive side this may be the bestsounding DVD I own at least up to ones I had heard up until this came out in January of 2005. Since the hero Ben Affleck has super hearing this is emphasized in this movie and so you if you have a 5.1 surround system hear sounds from all speakers at almost times. It's awesome!Affleck meanwhile is likable as the superhero and I liked the message he gives at the end about shunning revenge. Wow you don't hear that much in movies. Kudos too to villains' Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan. They are fun to watch especially Farrell.So if this superhero film interests you make sure you get the Director's Cut edition. It's far better than the original and I believe the same price.".

Since the hero Ben Affleck has super hearing this is emphasized in this movie and so you if you have a 5.1 surround system hear sounds from all speakers at almost times. It's awesome!Affleck meanwhile is likable as the superhero and I liked the message he gives at the end about shunning revenge. Wow you don't hear that much in movies. Kudos too to villains' Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan. They are fun to watch especially Farrell.So if this superhero film interests you make sure you get the Director's Cut edition. It's far better than the original and I believe the same price.";

The subplot with Coolio really rounds out the character's of Matt and Foggy and little scenes added back in here and there like Matt's rituals after patrol and in the morning and the extended version of him and Elektra on the roof before the rain made part of the ending make more sense. One thing I really enjoyed was the additional time to developing the Kingpin and making him really seem like a bad guy helped a lot. All in all whoever made the call to cut all this stuff from the movie should be fired from the studio because the theatrical release was a butchery and a farce. I felt bad having to admit that I didn't like the movie too much at first but now I can tell people how much it kicked a didn't know if curses were allowed.".

The other actors in the movie are great too! There is Colin Farrell. Usually I not a fan of him but here he's gave us an awesome performance as the professional killer the Bullseye. He can kill you with nut. No joke. He's a great character. And there is Michael Clarke Duncan as the Kingpin. Well I know that in the original comic book the Kingpin is white but you know what? Doesn't matter. This Kingpin is similar to the comic bookKingpin except the color of they're skin. Both of them are big both of them are brutal and Duncan has a voice that makes my skin crawl.The direction is perfect I think. Dark and stylish like a good Batmanmovie. The story is good too because it's not just a typical superherostory it is actually a tragedy if you think about that. It has drama and blood not funny at all but okay it has some funny moments but not much.So I don't understand why people hate that movie so much. It's great! Grow up people!

	schema:reviewBody "Where Spiderman was colorful and almost cartoonish Daredevil is gritty and merciless. Whatever you thought couldn't happen in Peter Parker's world will more than likely happen in Matt Murdock's neck of the woods. Because people die here. Sometimes they die slowly and painfully. The superheroes go home with scars on their backs broken teeth and more than a few gruesome images that need to be repressed. For all of these reasons I liked Daredevil because it takes chances by offering a hero that is by no means invincible or conventional. The origin story of the character Daredevil is pretty complicated but as the helpful gentleman in the theater so aptly put it He's blind but he can see stuff blind. Let's just leave it at this As a kid Matt Murdock was blinded by radioactive material in a freak accident. This caused his other senses to become phenomenally acute to the point where Matt can track criminals by their scent and use sound waves as a sort of radar. He uses his newfound abilities to protect those who will not be protected by the justice system all the while hoping that one day he will find the person who killed his father. If you're a fan of the first two Batman movies you'll find a lot to love in Daredevil. There are still some comic book elements that require some suspension of disbelief like the fact that Matt could construct an entire hightech lair beneath a church while working as a probono lawyer but the movie is not fantasydriven. The fight scenes will make you wince at their realism the love story is not corny or forced as opposed to a certain flick called Just Married and the characters are complex uncertain people who just happen to don masks and fight on rooftops. Do you remember the parts in the old Christopher Reeve Superman movies where Clark would hear someone crying for help in the distance? He would always be having dinner with Lois Lane at the time and had to make up some dumb excuse for ditching the scene like Oh! I just forgot. I have a book due at the library. Then he would dash off to save the day leaving Lois high and dry. Well in today's feature Matt hears someone crying for help but when his love interest Elektra asks him to stay he actually does. With outofleftfield scenes like this I couldn't help but enjoy Daredevil. Some might be surprised at how little screen time the villains get in this movie. Kingpin a Don Giovini mobster type and Bullseye an Irish nut with a couple of loose screws are important parts of our story but they don't steal the show. Going back to the Batman comparison many movie buffs think that Jack Nicholson's role as the joker actually become more interesting than the winged knight himself. Not so in this movie as Daredevil is the guy whom the role shebang revolves around. By deciding to focus on the hero more than the villain the audience can get into his head and root for him to the last battle. Matt is a cool guy because he's not a wealthy playboy or Kryptonian who can smash through walls. Other than his heightened senses and combat skills he's just a regular guy who happens to like read leather. After XMen and Spiderman became huge hits it was expected that Hollywood would start churning out more superhero flicks as fast as they could make them. Thankfully Daredevil doesn't seem recycled or rushed and actually brings something new to the table.".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite the low ratings this movie has gotten from the masses I honestly can say that this is probably the best Marvel movie to come out in the recent barrage of comic based movies to hit the big screen. I'm guessing the reason for the lack of high ratings is that most people were looking for a super hero along the lines of Spiderman who saves people and is always doing the right thing. Well this obviously isn't the case here as one can clearly see from how Daredevil does away with the baddies. I personally think that the concept of an avenging lawyer who serves up street justice to those that manipulate the system is a great concept. I also think that everybody did a great job of playing their characters as they should be played yes I know even Ben. The only person I thought did a mediocre job was Colin who only helped to make the already stupid looking Bullseye look even dumber then the character deserves. As you can no doubt guess from reading this I'm a huge fan of the series. What you probably wouldn't guess is that choosing Michael Clarke Duncan to play the Kingpin is by far the best improvisational casting choice I've ever seen. For those of you who don't know the Kingpin is supposed to be a big white guy we're talking sumo style big. While Michael isn't quite that big his size and look are by far better then anybody else they could have ever gotten to play this role. So in conclusion if you like your hero's on the darker side a la Batman then this should be a good choice for you. The effects and story line are great I can only hope that the only acceptable attendance at the theaters won't stop them from making a sequel to this movie I know don't hate me but with Ben playing Daredevil again as well don't worry I hate myself too!!! And P.S. Elektra isn't a sequel it's a separate plot line all together although they try to link the two at some point in the movie but that's another comment for another movie.".

Affleck is a terrific DareDevil who seems to exude confidence as a lawyer but then exudes pain as a tortured soul. Look for his father the boxer who I remember from Officer and a Gentlemen. Jennifer Garner is another good casting as the sexy Elektra. But the stars really are Colin Farrell who plays the totally lunatic assassin BullsEye to the T. And Paul Michael Duncan steals the show as Kingpin.Every time DD goes back out to fight the bad guys you feel for his pain like his father who fought against the mob way and had the courage to stand up for what really mattered to him. DD does the same in a similar high stakes game of cat and mouse with Kingpin and BullsEye. The mood is dark and somber. The sight of DD is artfully depicted. The story evolves so in the end you are rooting for the good guys to take down the bad guys and you are not sure if that's possible. I'm surprised there was never a sequel because this movie delivered. An interesting story excellent casting and solid acting make this the movie you should watch if you are in the mood to see one of those good ole good vs. bad guy films a la Death Wish or other vigilante shows like The Equalizer. Hence my 810. Enjoy.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is without a doubt the best superhero movie out there. Forget Spiderman with its colorful character swinging through the streets of new york. Forget Batman with it's dark brooding character and over the top comic to film transition. In half of the batman movies I half expected Wham Kasplat or kazump to show up in the middle of a fight scene. But this isn't about Batman or spiderman for that matter. This is about Dare devil. A super hero that most people have never even heard of. Which is one of the reason's why it didn't do as good at the box office as it should have done. Which in hindsight this is a shame as some people out there are missing a great film. Right from the start we are drawn into the story by meeting a beaten up Ben Afflick in the title role. We then hear him say the immortal line they say that when you are about to die you see your whole life flash before your eye's. That is also true of a blind man And then of course we are taken to back to when the hero of the film was a normal boy growing up in a part of new york called hells kitchen. An origin story that to my mind hasn't been implemented as well in any other movie. The film doesn't let up from that moment either and if superhero's existed they would exist in the form of dare devil. The scene where Mat Murdock return's home after dispensing of a really nasty rapist is masterful. Beaten and bruised he steps in the shower and as the water trickles over his battered body you can see the blood trickling down the drain then cut to his face as he pinches a single tooth that comes away from his jaw then clunks to the bottom of the shower with a ching. Then after stepping out we see him go straight to the medicine cabinet and pop some painkillers into his mouth. Then after stepping into his sound proof coffin so that he will not go mad from the high intensity sounds he is constantly hearing he passes into something slightly less pleasurable than sleep. You know at this point that this is a super hero. There is no Aunt May or butler Alfred at home to cook him a nice cup of tea. He is completely alone. Doing what he does not to get thanks. But because he has the ability to do it. I don't even class this movie as a movie. This move is pure Art. Made and written by people that love the whole daredevil mythos. The man without fear. And to all those people that hated the movie I am sorry. I am sorry that the film hasn't got the recognition that it deserve's and i am sorry that everyone who hated the film so much hasn't really watched the film. Just remember as daredevil said in his own words. I'm not the bad guy".

	schema:headline " It pained me to watch this garbage  Spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "Maybe not the worst ever but definitely close. How they could have such a huge budget for this film and accept such a horrible story is beyond me.I've been a pretty big comic book fan for 20 years. While I never got into Daredevil too much he made numerous guest appearances in my favorite comics and I was looking forward to this film. Yes it's a comic book movie but the level of camp in this film was unreal. There must have been hundreds of cheesy lines in almost every line of dialog during this film you'd almost think Arnold Schwarzenegger wrote the screenplay. Add to that the ridiculous amount of blind jokes and it was painful to sit through. Okay Daredevil is blind and yet has insanely high perception in his other senses we get it. No need to show endless shots of him doing amazing things with his other senses to hammer this into our skulls. Bullseye has perfect aim and can hit anything he wants to we get it no need to show 20 scenes of him using this skill either.This film takes ridiculousness to a new level. Daredevil is human. Unlike SpiderMan he has no genetic mutations. He simply has heightened senses from being blind. The story never proclaims he has anything other than human abilities either. However there are literally hundreds of stunts that Daredevil does that are humanly impossible I don't care how great he can here there is no way he can jump 50 feet in the air or vault off a 50 story building and land on a fire escape and not break his legs. This guy could give SpiderMan a run for his money for all the advantages they gave him.By letting Daredevil achieve insane stunts it creates no sense of weakness for him. You are never left feeling like there is a battle this guy can't win which is a mistake in film making. Daredevil can scale a 20 foot wall yet he gets stabbed in the shoulder and that knocks him out for half the film? He can't summon the energy to help out Elektra his love yet right after that he can make his way a couple miles across town and get involved in the fight of his life?! This film is FILLED with inconsistencies mistakes and just absurd events that would require a complete suspension of belief reality in order to enjoy this film. I expect comic book movies to take some license but this film makes Armageddon look like it was taken straight from the film vaults at NASA. And with all of this absurdity there is no way to enjoy this film as a campy popcorn movie. I would consider TombRaider a masterpiece in comparison.Perhaps the biggest flaw with this film is the CGI. For a recent movie this is some of the worst CGI effects I have ever seen. None of it looked realistic. I can't think of a single special effect that I would believe. Remember that scene in Spider Man where Toby Maguire gets his new powers and starts jumping 50 feet in the air from roof to roof? Imagine an entire movie of that. They may as well have left the blue screens and wires in. At least Mark Steven Johnson admits on his commentary that the CGI is crap.Did I mention that Bullseye with a horrible performance by Colin Farrell actually cuts someone's throat with a playing card in this film and kills a man by throwing a paperclip into his neck?!That being said if you like this film the DVD is loaded with bonus features. The audio and video come across very well and the featurettes are fairly well done. This DVD has everything you could want if you're a fan of the film.".

	schema:reviewBody "As the release date of Daredevil approached I became more and more skeptical of Ben Affleck's ability to actually pulloff a superhero movie. After seeing it last night though I no longer doubt this ability nor do I doubt anybody else's abilities in the allstar cast.The fighting scenes were excellently done. The presentation of Daredevil's superhuman senses was even better than I imagined. Jennifer Garner is one of the hottest actresses who can kick anyone's ass. Michael Clarke Duncan's gave a great performance as the Kingpin. Collin Farrell is one of my new favorite villain's in Bullseye. Everything about this movie is just as dark as it is truly beautiful.There were two major elements about the movie that made me give it a score of 8 instead of 10 though. First when Daredevil kills that rapist in the subway the problem is that in the comic books Daredevil has never maintained a criminals must die mentality. He has actually gotten into fights with other superheroes over this belief so when this happened in the movie I was a little miffed. Somebody has brought it to my attention that Daredevil actually killed his first criminal on his first outing in his hero persona but my only response to that would be the fact that the incident in the subway station was presented as not being Daredevil's first time.Second the godawful soundtrack is touted around scene after scene in the movie. The main problems with this is that a. The music really REALLY sucks and b. The music dates the movie. Watching the movie 10 years from now when our culture's preferences in music have changed will make us more critical of this movie in the long run. Nobody is going to remember these songs or the people who sang them in ten years and I wish that they were not there to begin with.Other than that I can't understand why there are so many people who didn't like this movie. If you liked Spiderman you'll like this movie even better because simply put Daredevil is a better movie. The plot is wellwritten the characters are as likeable as they are believable and the specialeffectsfight scenes are topnotch. It really is great that the Marvel superheroes are getting treated so well in the film industry.".

The end piece with the Kingpin is a little rushed but I suppose we had all the SuperHero SlugFest we could ask for with the Bullseye church section? I would have preferred a standard music score throughout and not the alternative rock track that got dropped in occasionally. But these little gripes aside  the movie really does hit the spot throughout.Daredevil also marks the first mainstream venture into a mature audience market for a kids superhero character. The comic character was always a darker version of SpiderMan with mature storylines supplied by the likes of Frank Miller. But it's still a gent in spandex underwear leaping around New York after hours brawling with other costumed nutcases and leading the customary doublelife Lawyer by Day Hero by Night of your regular SuperHero. The 1989 Batman film and even SpiderMan moved Comic Character movies away from the younger audience  but Daredevil really pushed it further without an allout onscreen blood and sex agenda. A brave move as the potential audience must be reduced by this approach and it has to be a harder sell to the studio and moneybackers.I am sure there are a legion of SpiderMan and XMen fans out there that would wave the flag for these to be crowned best superhero movie but my vote would go to this horned devil.

	schema:reviewBody "I personally thought this film portrayed the darkness of the comic books very very well. Ben Affleck's performance as the Daredevil Matt Murdock is believable but he does get too dramatic in scenes where it really isn't required. As much as people don't want to believe it this movie works with the pretty boys Affleck and Colin Farrell as the secondary villain a sharpshooting hitman named Bullseye. They really hate each other laughs. Jennifer Garner as the very sexy heiress Elektra Nachios saves this movie from being a 510 instead of an 810. She is such a likable character and does an excellent job of playing the powerful yet vulnerable Elektra. She is great at being a woman who wants to be with her man yet has her priorities. The main villain is the very evil Kingpin headed by a great Michael Clarke Duncan. Duncan shows his brute force near the end of the movie. All throughout these 4 A and B list actors are flanked by a great supporting cast including Joe Pantoliano as an investigative reporter who later becomes of aid to the Daredevil Leland Orser as the Kingpin's right hand man Wesley and Jon Favreau as Murdock's best friend and colleague. Favreau is mostly comic relief but the first two characters played by Pantoliano and Orser are serious characters. All in all this is a good movie not great good. The cast does a much better job than most people believed they would and Jennifer Garner owns the film. It's a shame no sequel has been announced because it would be a great film as well. The darkness of this movie can be felt all throughout with the great villainous work of Duncan and Farrell and the mood of Affleck and Garner. 710".

I honestly don't understand why people want to say that this movie isn't good yes there are bad points but there are many good points as well. If you look at this film without any bias and if you are a fan of the comic you'll understand this movie is a great movie as a movie and a great piece of art.

When the makers of the film paid him to make a very camp Daredevil suit he did as they asked. Everyone else involved should be ashamed of this sorry mess of a film. I could go on and I will.In your average blockbuster you'll see action follow a storyline perhaps witness a little love interest. This will build up to a grand finale a showdown. And would just a small amount of good acting be too much to ask? Apparently so because on all counts this movie fails.When a comicbook action movie contains only a handful of minutes of said action you know there's a problem. That isn't even the bad news regarding action in this film. As if by accident Daredevil battles Bullseye for a second time. At this point the CGI characters yes i think Colin and Ben were in a bar drinking when this scene was made move in. Did I mention that they move in like drunken idiots unconvincingly lurching up and down all over the screen. Didn't the CGI guys see The Matrix original or Reloaded or Blade?As for the storyline don't get me started. Because I won't know where to. Was there a story? I saw this film an hour ago and I can't tell you what happened apart from people fighting crying kissing and dying. the scriptwriters should never be allowed out of the unemployment line again.A big deal was made of Jennifer Garner taking on the part of Elektra. I think she read the script and thought she was playing Carmen Electra because that's how much of an acting range she shows in this film and I'm a big fan of Carmen. Garner and Ben had no chemistry at all. A stink bomb has more chemistry and would have done the job i.e stunk to high heaven better than this film for a lot less money. Ben has no excuse as I'm fairly sure JLo made him sit down and watch all her movies. Did he watch Out Of Sight? Imagine JLo being better than you at acting...And on the subject of acting the usually dependable Colin Farrell manages to play a very unconvincing Irishman which is no mean feat for an actual Irishman. Yet another illustration of just how poor this film is.You've still managed to make it to the end of the movie instead of a destroying your TV or b plain old falling asleep? I won't spoil the ending but you are rewarded and I use the word 'rewarded' loosely by a total lack of a spectacular showdown. Instead Daredevil gets really angry to all the naughty men who've stayed up past their bedtimes. You can almost hear Daredevil say Hey don't make me come up there! as he wanders into the night one last time hopefully anyway.This film gets 0 out of 10 with perhaps an extra 1 for costume design.".

With no where else to turn Sven asks Falk to help him deal with the crazed Lehmann Falk agrees but soon realizes he's dealing with a more dangerous man than he imagined when Lehmann kidnaps Sven's wife Jeanette and then releases her with a time bomb locked around her neck demanding that Sven hand over ownership of his company to Lehmann.";

Nothing really revolutionary. Meanwhile former police investigator Johan Falk quits the force because he is ostracized by his superiors again nothing new and joins a team of bodyguards to back his old pal Sven Persson up against the mafia gang.No new twists and turns the same old story. Then why is it good? Well the characters are believable the performances are good and there is something different about Swedish actionthriller flicks. This one is far more violent than most but is still kept at a fairly decent level no tremendous explosions and stuff just plain shooting car chasing through the Swedish forest very nice and then shooting some more before the quite exciting finale. Of course in line with tradition there's a lot of looking confused grim confused again and then very very dedicated before the good guys win oh gimme a break that's not a spoiler.Performances are fine except for maybe Alexandra Rapaport who should just stay away from this kind of film for she is clearly not cut out for it. The action itself is believable and even cool at some points. So all in all a good action movie. And Swedish at that.".

	schema:headline " A pinnacle of the Italian New Wave";
	schema:reviewBody "It's not easy to rate an experimental film on the same scale as films that were intended to be seen by wider commercial audiences and Partner is an experimental film. Many have criticized Bertolucci for aping Godard's style in this film and certainly there are liberal elements of Two Or Three Things I Know About Her and Weekend but the camera work and cinematography and even the Morricone score are all indicative of an Italian filmmaker more so than the French new wave that served as the defacto inspiration. But if one is forced to point out the films that it followed one should also illuminate the many films that it inspired whether directly or indirectly and that list is at least as impressive. The easy heir is Fade To Black which follows a wouldbe actor on his descent into madness and murder. The overthetop performance of Pierre Clementi is exchanged perhaps as a sign of the times for the understated twitchiness of Dennis Christopher but the whole story is here. One can chose to credit the original Dostoyevsky story but the film reference reads truer as an influence on the later film when considering what a lose adaptation Partner was of The Double. In fact Conrad's The Secret Sharer could just as easily have served as the source material when dissected the faithfulness of the Amico script of the Russian author's work and of course only for the sake of argument as Dostoyevsky is clearly credited. Less obvious may be the impact that Partner had on Bertolucci's Italian peers. A mere year later Love And Anger would unite the Italian filmeratti with Godard to launch a collaborative New Wave film. It's unlikely this would have happened were it not for the release of Partner. Likewise the classroom discussions of Zabriskie Point betray more in common with this film than with Antonioni's previous output and yet it can also be said that certain scene compositions in Partner could trace their routes back to Antonioni's Blow Up. The composition is very similar though the camera movement is not. Even when examining Bertolucci's future output one can point to Partner as the turning point in his artistic style. Up to that point his work was devoid of the cinema reference that pervades Partner the Odessa steps parody amongst others and was toned down in The Conformist and Last Tango In Paris. As an experiment Partner is more of a success than a failure. It's not simple casual viewing. It's a hard to digest film from a man who has absorbed and digested more about film than most others. It's comparable to Louis Malle's Black Moon but predates it by seven years. Partner is an oddity. It's unlikely to have a broad appeal which is probably a good thing. This isn't going to sway the Shrek crowd that's for sure. To an extent you either get this film or you don't. The same can be said for dozens of films and filmmakers who are held in high regard by people who hold this film in contempt it's tonally very close to Jodorowski's Santa Sangre. I for one am glad I've seen it. It's not perfect but it's thought provoking well made and less self indulgent than a lot of recent arthouse fare from culty sacred cows Inland Empire anyone?. Most people will find their way to this film as part of their Bertolucci completism. Some may be Tina Aumont obsessed. I don't think either will be greatly disappointed.".

However having caught up with it now thanks to No Shame's 2Disc Special Edition I have to say that I was underwhelmed finding it overly didactic and unfortunately Godard's trademark dynamism and humor in his early work at least are seldom evident here.While interesting and quite admirable in itself  being a loose updating of Dostoyevsky's The Double  the film feels dated today especially its consumerist critique represented by a silly musical number about Dash a detergent which ironically is still in use nearly 40 years on! having said that Godard had already attacked the same targets in 2 OR 3 THINGS I KNOW ABOUT HER 1967. Besides Pierre Clementi's cold and arrogant personality doesn't allow much audience sympathy. Bertolucci's technique is suitably experimental  one of his most surreal touches is having Clementi's large shadow cast on a wall turning against him and in a remarkable sequence despite Morricone's lush romantic music a date between Clementi and Stefania Sandrelli consists of them being driven in a stationary vehicle with Clementi's butler making do as chauffeur i.e. acting out the machine's sounds with his mouth! Incidentally a similar scene was depicted in Jerzy Skolimowski's LE DEPART 1967 another experimental film I caught up with recently and which also left me somewhat disappointed.Apart from reflecting on politics and modern society the script contrasts contemporaneous attitudes in theatre and cinema. Sandrelli although looking positively gorgeous as a blonde seems uneasy in this environment even if she did go on to make 3 more films with the director but Tina Aumont's contribution who expires unconventionally at the hands of Clementi at the end of the aforementioned musical number is rather delightful. The film's colorful widescreen photography makes great use of its Rome locations while Ennio Morricone's eclectic score serves more often than not as ironic comment on the action.Not an easy title to appreciate therefore and Bertolucci has certainly made more involving films but at least the DVD extras prepared by No Shame this is their first release I've sampled  particularly the fascinating and lengthy interviews with Bertolucci and film editor Roberto Perpignani  are excellent indeed! An interesting piece of information gleaned from the supplements is that the film's script was rarely adhered to and neither were current conventional Italian filming techniques the sound was recorded live besides Pierre Clementi flew every weekend to Paris and reported back to Bertolucci with the most uptodate slogans spouted by the protesters in those famous May 1968 riots thus enabling him to incorporate them into his film like Vietato Vietare It is forbidden to forbid and Proibito Proibire It is prohibited to prohibit...".

	schema:headline " The Nutty Professor as remade by Bernardo Bertolucci in the 60's.";
	schema:reviewBody "Bertolucci's third feature is one of his greatest films yet it's not very well known despite it's beautiful use of colour and 'Scope and a great and unique musical score from Ennio Morricone.Maybe because the subject matter or the theme of the film is very oblique and fairly intricate and more subtle than his later direct tackling of themes such as class sex and identity and also unlike ''Fight Club'' which deals with the same themes it doesn't become schizophrenic and fall in love with what it is against. It also has one of the greatest performances of the 60's from Pierre Clementi a FrenchItalian actorwho worked with Luis Bunuel and Philippe Garrel. In this film he plays a student who is disaffected and alienated his life is transformed when he meets his doublethe film is a loose adaptation of the Dostoyevsky story ''The Double'' who is everything he isn't. Bertolucci doesn't attempt to explain the two Clementis and refuses to spell out that either is a hallucinationthe conceit of the film as it develops is the difficulty to tell apart which is which.The film's tone is largely comic for most of the film including a hilarious and shocking sendup of Hollywood romances in the scene where GiaccobeClementi and his beloved Clarathe luminous Stefania Sandrelli plan to elope. But the tone of the film is also disturbing on other occasions as Clementi's character commits many acts of murder as the film moves along including one of the most upsetting and gruesomely cruel murder scenes in film history. The style of the film doesn't have a clear plot and is essentially a series of digressions. The film's style is intensely subjective and never abandons Giacchobe's pointofview and some aspects of the film can be seen as dreams or hallucinations and others develop surprisingly including a suggestion of a narrative leap near the end. The music score by Ennio Morricone is avantguarde enough to meet the challenge. The complete score played over the opening credits features four themes each distinct and disjunctive a quartet which during the film rotates in various junctures at various times sometimes diagetically appearing in the action other times working conventionally in the background. It's unlike any other score I have ever heard beautiful and strange to listen to.The film is one of the most interesting works made at the late 60's and it's location footage of Rome in colour is fairly unique for an Italian film of that period. It is a film that is Bertolucci's most NouvelleVagueish with Godardian monologues on theatre and cinema digressions on Artaud attacks on consumerism but it's also one which is fully Bertolucci rather than a work of a dilettante. The visual design is a curious mixture of German ExpressionismF. W. Murnau and Hollywood 'Scope pageantsNicholas Ray while some of the visual and editing tricks seem to come from Hitchcockred thunder from ''Marnie'' and of all people Jerry Lewis''The Nutty Professor''  from the foregrounding of the soft red and cobalt blue throughout the film right down to the white fadeaway it ends.Bertolucci's exuberant nonrealism allows him to directly confront the audience with the preoccupations and contradictions of Giacchobe and his generation all the while conveying the emotional confusion of his characters. It is perhaps dated to an extent since it's firmly addressed to the issues of the late 60's student unrestMay '68 happened when this film was in production but it's also a film about confusion about passivity a psychological exploration of the main character's pathology and his charm and also sets up the themes that Bertolucci touches on ''Il Conformista''. The search for one's identity the conflict between rebellion and conformism the blurring lines in sexual and social politics. And it's all done in a manner that is very funny and light. The abrupt ending of the film which raises a lot of questions is one which the viewer can ponder endlessly for themselves. And Pierre Clementi's tourdeforce performance makes this just as much his film as it is Bertolucci's anyone interested in a great performance by a charismatic if obscure European star that is emotional and simultaneously physical and sensual than this is the place to go.".

	schema:reviewBody "While the often noticed aping by Bertolucci of his hero Godard in this early film is quite true even the film itself admits its debt to Godard right on screen there is more here than mere imitation. Whether intentional or not I saw plenty of other influences from Bunuel to the paintings if Rene Magritte. A loose examination of schizophrenia an inhibited intellectual young man spawns a separate self who is confident aggressive and revolutionary. While vaguely based on Dostoyevsky's The Double this is very much it's own story and a hell of a lot of fun. I found Bertolucci's surreal playfulness more inviting than most of Godard's work from that period. It asks many of the same questions and has much of the same distain for modern consumer society and film narrative conventions but does it with an absurdist sense of humor that give rise to some moments that now seem as much Monty Python as they are French New Wave. The most egregious Godard ripoffs can be annoying sudden inappropriate music etc but they are for the most part mercifully brief. Mostly this is more influence and homage than theft and creates a time capsule that still has relevance and interest and pleasure in the watching. Pierre Clementi does a fine job playing the two different versions of the hero Giaccobe.".

His third feature Partner has him follow Godard into his fin de cinema. Partner is a purely experimental film with little narrative. It's definitely a turn for the worst for Bertolucci. Thankfully he was drawn back into narrative cinema with his fourth film The Conformist. Partner is worth seeing for fans of the director and New Wave enthusiasts. It has some interesting points. The minimal plot of the film has Pierre Clmenti playing a man with split personalities. Most of the rest of it is made up of random vignettes. Some are amusing some are annoying. Some are just plain boring. Unfortunately there just aren't enough amusing ones to make it an easy watch. Clmenti is excellent and Bertolucci lives up to his reputation as one of the cinema's greatest visual minds. Stefania Sandrelli who would go on to star in The Conformist appears briefly with curly blonde hair. She doesn't do much but she's gorgeous.".

It is basically a middle of the road RomanticActionComedy date film the type that were churned out by the truckload during the early 1990's. R rated so it dates this film a little bit as the romanticactioncomedy genre is almost 100 exclusively a PG13 genre for at least the last 10 years. The film stars a moderately funny Damon Wayans not his best as a street wise guy trying to get 'mo money' by applying for a minimum wage desk job as well as snag a girl. But things are never that simple and his supposedly boring low paying job leads him into the middle of a laughable crime plot. The film also costars his annoying goofy and much less funny younger brother Marlon Wayans who always reminds me of a Clist celebrity in the Eddie Griffin style. I didn't recognize any of the other cast. The movie was written by Damon Wayans though which is worth noting. This is an average film at best not unenjoyable but certainly forgettable save for a couple funny scenes very much in an In Living Color skitcom style. Every date movie clich is here too including the uptight boyfriend the fat and lovable comic relief and the crimecaper subplot. Worth viewing only once for Wayans' Brothers fans but otherwise not worth a DVDVHS effort. But if it is on TV check it out.".

It's not The Thin Red Line but what did you expect? I expected a light and entertaining movie and that's exactly what it is. Nothing more nothing less. I would give it a 7 note but Stacey Dash deserves 2 more points. For her alone this film is worth watching. But beside of her it has a nice romantic plot the action plot isn't too sophisticated but it's enjoyable. The movie is a bit like a fairy taleagain thanks to Stacey Dash but that gives it a lot of charm and I always enjoy watching it. I would highly recommend it if you want something light and easy for the evening.".

It's not The Thin Red Line but what did you expect? I expected a light and entertaining movie and that's exactly what it is. Nothing more nothing less. I would give it a 7 note but Stacey Dash deserves 2 more points. For her alone this film is worth watching. But beside of her it has a nice romantic plot the action plot isn't too sophisticated but it's enjoyable. The movie is a bit like a fairy taleagain thanks to Stacey Dash but that gives it a lot of charm and I always enjoy watching it. I would highly recommend it if you want something light and easy for the evening.";

I liked seeing Damon's softer side towards Stacy Dash and Marlon's jealousy towards his brother's relationship with this girl. Also the nightclub scene is a riot!  Overallit is a great movie to watch especially if you are a fan of the Wayans family plus it has a wicked soundtrack as well!".

This is a cool little movie but really only good the first time one watches it. There are some funny things in it but they are not hugely hilarious to label it a cult movie.Basically this film is about a conartist whose dad was a cop who was killed in the line of duty. As such he has given up on trying to be anything and lives his life trying to make mo money from conning people. He has a partner who looks up to him. After a rather clever conjob he is caught out and manages to escape only to be caught by a transit cop. The judge dismisses the charges because his lawyer is awful basically he raves on about the injustice of the system in a Negro evangelist sort of way and thus he takes this final change to try and go straight.While selling books be meets a rather nice lady and applies for a job where she works being a credit card firm. It lands up that the security consultant is using the cards to purchase some really expensive things and as the owners of the cards are dead the company gets billed. The guy tries his hand at the fraud at first but when he is caught he is blackmailed into joining this gang.I really can't think of anything indepth about the movie with the exception that it has the idea that once you are a criminal it is very difficult to escape your past. As they say old habits die hard. He is tempted and falls for it but moreso the bad guy uses his past as a lever for blackmail to force him to continue. Thus we see that even though he is struggling to go straight he is not.Really there isn't much to comment about this movie anyway. In the end it is a standard actioncomedy which doesn't really stand out that much. I enjoyed it but it lacks any deep meaning or simple plain fun that elevates others movies above it.".

In another movie he'd probably been arrested for stalking and harassment but because he wrote the movie those two actions are considered romantic. While following Amber Johnny found a new way to upgrade his lifestyle. Of course that led him to more trouble and this trouble had deadly consequences.Besides being largely unfunny this movie just sucked. The story was lousy as were the various situations.

So he gets a job as a mail room clerk and ends up stealing a credit card and goes on a shopping spree with his brother SeymourMarlon Wayans. A roguish executive finds out and extorts Johnny to do his bidding.The funniest scenes every scene involving the beautychallenged Charlotte is a riot.

Were it not for The Last Boy Scout this would be far and away his most watchable film.Strangely enough the filmmakers decided to build a comedy around a plot which at its core is a crime film. Naughty white guys have started a scam involving preapproved credit cards issued to deceased customers dead men tell no tales and running up expensive tabs buying items to be resold at lower prices.Damon and his little brother Marlon who is now in every second crappy comedy made are John and Seymour two small time scammers whose lives revolve around the pursuit of cash as long as it doesn't involve real work.As Seymour says not once but twice to painful effect in the film A job ain't nothing' but work. When John comes across a young woman for whom he harbours amorous intent his pursuit takes him to the offices of a large corporation where he decides the best way to further his courting process is to take a menial job as a mailroom assistant in the same building.To complete the tenuous plot connections the brothers are somewhat mentored by Walsh the expartner of their deceased policeman father who coincidentally happens to be investigating the credit card scam which happens to be going on in the new firm John just got the job with.Phew...Long story short John gets involved over his head in the credit card scam and must find a way to extricate himself without further drama or police intervention whilst at the same time allowing him to pick up and later keep hold of his love interest named Amber who it must be said is a terrible actress who is given some painfully forced dialogue.But Mo' Money has precious little to do with the plot it is a chance for the two Wayans to try on different personas in a series of scenes which are basically skits that serve only to cause amusement and do the bare minimum to justify the next scene where they can do the same thing only different.Being an early 90s film and being that Wayans is a hip black guy he gets to wear a whole range of increasingly stupid looking hats all of which are supposed to be cool by the way and a garish collection of urban executive wear which I guess were all fashionable at the time.The humour is largely based upon the larger than life characters in the film many of them created by John as he runs his various scams early on but some of them in the various bit parts that populate the rest of the cast. There are numerous throwaway lines and sceneswithin a scene that try to scatter jokes throughout with about a 5050 success rate and keeping with that ratio thankfully the bonehead lines and there are a few are equally offset by some really good moments.Given that the PC craze was only just gaining steam in the early 90s there are a few thinly veiled racerelated jokes that fall flat in today's environment not so much because they are racially based but because they just aren't that funny to begin with.It seems that the only three straight people in the film that are not caricatures for comedy's sake are Amber Detective Walsh and the bad guy...Now I considered it odd that a light comedy would even bother with the intrusion of a criminal subplot especially one that justifies the murders that happen in the film but if you are to have a bad guy at least make him menacing this is where Mo' Money definitely succeeds.The bad guy Harry Lennix the head of security in the credit card firm keeps things low key and doesn't resort to overacting his way through his scenes like the remainder of the cast. You are always guessing at what he might do next especially as you know he is capable of acts of violence from early in the film and you are just waiting for him to snap and do something.When he finally does it isn't his fault that the finale seems totally out of place in an 80s flashback over the top sort of way but the film had to end somehow and turning Wayan's character into an instant quasi Bruce Willis must have seemed like a good idea at the time.Despite the dated elements of Mo' Money and the fact that the crime elements seemed forced into what should have been a fluffy personality driven comedy I still liked Mo' Money.Final Rating  6  10. Inoffensive amusing at times and thankfully pretty brief. Mo' Money also harks back to a time when a Wayans could actually cause me to crack a smile Scary Movie White Chicks etc killed that....If you liked this review or even if you didn't check out oneguyrambling.com".

For me it was a chance to live to breathe free as anything went there was no need to conform to any narrow minded conventions as I felt I had to  survive at home.  The first time I witnessed Tim Curry flinging open his cape proudly proclaiming I'm just a sweet transvestite from Transsexual Transylvania I knew I'd found a place to be myself.  Even now some 18 years later that sight still gives me a thrill.  Sure the plot is ridiculous on second thought it had more to offer than 80 percent of the crap coming out of Hollywood then and now and it is loaded with technical flaws.  Still I consider it the greatest film of all time. How many films draw a crowd of regulars weekly create a sense of community especially for people who more than likely felt as if they were not a part of any community as I felt?  Over the years I've seen the film 64 times and when I'm 80 I plan on getting up on my arthritic legs and doing the Time Warp.".

	schema:reviewBody "Or I should say the Sweet Transvestite of all cult films!To those who haven't seen Rocky Horror don't bother reading reviews about it. It won't mean anything. Don't rent it on DVD which it recently came out on. It also won't mean anything because it's missing the thing that gave it and the stage play that preceded it life... the audience. By definition a cult film is meant to be seen by a group. Preferably a large one. I saw Rocky Horror 20something years ago and wound up playing Brad with the players next to the stage. Something I would normally never do. Why? The show's energy sucked me in. More accurately the audience's energy sucked me in. The show with a revvedup audience is almost like a dialogue between the movie and the people watching it. It celebrates sex hedonism even while playing out the danger violence and tragedy it can result in. It allows the audience of mostly young kids to exude and rejoice in their sexuality whatever it is. And without ever taking their clothes off. I think that is the real appeal of the show. There's a joyousness and a strange innocence in throwing raunchy comments at the screen watching the live performers onstage act out the scenes in racy costumes and sharing the energy anonymously in the dark with strangers. The live show with the original actors must have been electrifying. Plays always have more energy than films because of the immediacy of the live actors and the energy must have been even more intense. I'll always regret not having the chance to have seen it. The movie itself has been described too many times for me to give a synopsis. I will however say that it is really a collage of feelings ranging from fear trepidation excitement lust joyous sexual fulfillment more lust tragedy and a strange sadness at the end. Basically all the emotions that make life worth living in an hour and a half. However the visceral enjoyment of this film and the emotions it brings will only be experienced with a large highly energized audience. If you get a chance and if you can get your reserved ego out of the way go to a midnight showing in your area when you know there's going to be a big showing. Don't go expecting a logical coherent storyline. Its about experience not narrative. You'll get an experience that you've been missing your whole life. At the end there is a message here hidden under all the seemingly blissful hedonism. It takes a long time for it to become clear however.I wonder if O'Brian its creator was clever enough to have put it there all along? By the way there is no nudity or actual sex in the entire movie. For a movie with its reputation that's pretty amazing. Compared to the slashergore fests passing themselves off as film these days the movie is strangely quaint and innocent. But then that's what true enjoyment of sensuality should be. For a cult film 10 out of 10 stars. It doesn't get any better than this as cult films go.".

Classic memorable rock 'n' roll tunes written by O'Brien throughout including The Time Warp Sweet Transvestite Hot Patootie....the list goes on and on.

	schema:reviewBody "The Rocky Horror Picture Show isn't a film for everyone. You need a sense of humor to enjoy I would say and must have an open mind.Back in the 70s I used to see this film almost every weekend with my buddies. It was a blast! The audience participation is so energetic! Dressing up was also something I loved doing I'd dress as Magenta! The film is hilarious and the lines delivered are priceless. Kudos to Richard O'Brien for writing such a good script! And the actors were simply amazing!! A first role for many of the stars. Tim Curry stands out as Dr. FrankNFurter 'the sweet transvestite from Transsexual Transylvania' a role he will always be famous and remembered for. He is so hilarious delivers his lines perfectly and if I do say so myself he is quite magnetizing! Susan Sarandon performs great as Janet Weiss and has a very nice singing voice. Barry Bostwick's character Brad is simply lovable! Patricia Quinn and Little Nell are 2 beautiful women playing 2 beautiful characters who are also very entertaining! Charles Gray and Jonathan Adams are also a great addition to the film.Another major plus of this film is the singing and the dancing! Catchy songs and thrilling dance numbers drew me to this film the most! So see it at home see it in the theater but just make sure you see it and get ready to have ultimate fun with what is in my opinion the best movie out there!!".

	onyx:emotionText "The Rocky Horror Picture Show isn't a film for everyone. You need a sense of humor to enjoy I would say and must have an open mind.Back in the 70s I used to see this film almost every weekend with my buddies. It was a blast! The audience participation is so energetic! Dressing up was also something I loved doing I'd dress as Magenta! The film is hilarious and the lines delivered are priceless. Kudos to Richard O'Brien for writing such a good script! And the actors were simply amazing!! A first role for many of the stars. Tim Curry stands out as Dr. FrankNFurter 'the sweet transvestite from Transsexual Transylvania' a role he will always be famous and remembered for. He is so hilarious delivers his lines perfectly and if I do say so myself he is quite magnetizing! Susan Sarandon performs great as Janet Weiss and has a very nice singing voice. Barry Bostwick's character Brad is simply lovable! Patricia Quinn and Little Nell are 2 beautiful women playing 2 beautiful characters who are also very entertaining! Charles Gray and Jonathan Adams are also a great addition to the film.Another major plus of this film is the singing and the dancing! Catchy songs and thrilling dance numbers drew me to this film the most! So see it at home see it in the theater but just make sure you see it and get ready to have ultimate fun with what is in my opinion the best movie out there!!";

	schema:reviewBody "The Rocky Horror Picture Show was one of those glorious films I began watching with no preconceived notions about it or any clue what it was about. I knew that there was a cult status that had followed this film since it was first released in 1975 but I knew little else about it. So rarely does one get the chance to go blind into a film and I took that chance and could not be any happier with the result. Directed by Jim Sharman and starring Tim Curry in his film debut along with the film's writer Richard O'Brien Patricia Quinn and Nell Campbell reprising their stage roles The Rocky Horror Picture Show has exploded into a phenomenon filled with audience participation props and shadow casts making a viewing of the film a rite of passage for young people. Beginning as a stage production before being made into the film The Rocky Horror Picture Show has withstood the test of time crowned as the longest constantly running film in movie theatre history.The film opens at a wedding outside of a church in the idyllic city of Denton Ohio. Friends of Brad Majors Barry Bostwick and Janet Weiss Susan Sarandon have just tied the knot and Janet has caught the bouquet. Taking his cue Brad proposes to Janet and the two decide they must travel to see their former science teacher now friend and mentor to share the good news. Along the way the two experience car trouble and wander upon a mysterious castle to ask for help and use a telephone. What Brad and Janet have come upon disturbs them as they meet a peculiar group of people who have come to see an affair of a transvestite scientist. Brad and Janet are undressed by the domestic of the home Magenta Patricia Quinn and the handyman Riff Raff Richard O'Brien and taken up to the master's laboratory. Once they formally meet Dr. FrankNFurter Tim Curry they begin to learn that he is a scientist interested in reanimation and has the secret to human life. The affair that they happened upon is one in which Dr. FrankN Furter is going to reveal the muscle man he has created. After the reveal of Rocky Peter Hinwood things take a turn for the strange and everyone is escorted to bed as Frank and Rocky get better acquainted. After a night of trysts it is unsure whom should be paired with whom anymore and everyone including rival scientist and friend to Brad and Janet Dr. Everett V. Scott Jonathan Adams who happened upon the night's activities is invited to dinner. After a raucous dinner revealbirthday party more sexual liberation occurs and everyone participates in Dr. Frank NFurter's floor show in full formal attire. After spending time in FrankNFurter's palace and submitting to his plans Brad and Janet definitely don't leave the same way they came in. From the opening sequence of Patricia Quinn's infamous red lips singing to the audience one knows they are in for a wild ride. The beginning of the film is filled with fun nods to classic cinema including The Wizard of Oz as the same characters that are at the wedding will also appear in Transylvania. There are also tons of nods to Bhorror movies of the early days of Hollywood making The Rocky Horror Picture Show a treat for fans of classic films. My first experience with a rock musical did not disappoint. Since I first saw this movie just two months ago I have bought the soundtrack in two different mediums so I can listen to the music anytime I please yeah it's that good. Speaking of the music am I the only one that thinks that as cute as Time Warp is Sweet Transvestite is the song that really steals the show? Although to be fair any scene with Tim Curry stole the show. It's unbelievable to think that this film was Tim Curry's film debut what an introduction! He was extraordinary in this role and proved that if he can do Dr. FrankNFurter he can do anything. It's truly unfortunate that he has been so underutilized in Hollywood with acting ability and a voice like his you would expect him to be in just about everything alas this did not turn out to be although he has an extensive filmography of voice work to his credit. I suppose such is the life of a character actor it's just so disheartening to see how great he can be If you need any further evidence check out Three Men in a Boat or Blue Money and to see him act in the worst American movies imaginable. I wonder if Tim Curry's entrance coming out of the elevator in The Rocky Horror Picture Show isn't the best on film. The Rocky Horror Picture Show does many things that are hard to do well on film. Not only does the film use a narrator which can bog down the story line and come off clunky and often disjointed but several of the characters also broke the fourth wall as well. This device is almost never done well but executed flawlessly in this film. What's more however is that The Rocky Horror Picture Show encourages rebellion of expectations tolerance of differences and acceptance of our own individuality. Of course sexual freedom is explored in the film but so was rebellion from a meaningless middleclass existence where a new wife is praised for her cooking or a new husband is commended because he has a promotion on the way. The Rocky Horror Picture Show offers viewers the message of sexual freedom but that's not all. Being true to yourself if the heart of the film and to go after what you want no matter what it is don't dream it be it.".

It's like she was singing a Disney song in the movie although she didn't sing in the Enchanted regardless of her playing a villain. I would've loved to have heard her sing. She looked really sexy in the film although I bet she was cold having just a bra and underwear on. Oh well she did a great job anyhow!The songs were amazing the cast were amazing and the storyline was hard to follow but good at the same time. Watch this film!!!".

It really is an excuse for a heterosexuals to embrace their inner fetishist and embrace the hidden campness within. It has no equal it has no rival and it will live forever more. The fact that such a trendy series as Glee sees fit to pay tribute to it in one ep with actors who weren't even born when the movie version was released ably demonstrates its' timeless appeal and popular resonance. What's great? What isn't great? Tim Curry is the ultimate Franknfurter better even than Anthony Head who also excels in the role. Barry Bostick and Susan Sarandon are also terrific Richard O'Brien Little Nell and Patricia Quinn all brilliant much like Dickens there's no such thing as a small role in this film. Interesting to see Christopher Biggins as one of the Transylvanians and a very young Koo Stark as one of the guests at the wedding. And off course this is the film that made Meatloaf a star he makes a huge impression for having so little screen time and actually no spoken lines he sings absolutely everything. Charles Gray makes a wonderful narrator so weird to think he actually never met the rest of the cast. Great music Richard O'Brien must have a terrific songwriting ability to produce all these crackers. Love Time Warp Sweet Patootie Sweet Transvestite I'm Going Home Burning at the Frankenstein Place. Not so fond of Janet Bryce and a few of the others which tend to slow things down a tad in my opinion.Contains 2 of the best lines in movie history. Firstly Franknfurter Magenta you and your brother have served me faithfully Magenta I ask for nothing Frankfurter And you shall receive it in abundance! plus Magenta surveying the carnage wreaked by Riffraff You killed them! But I thought you liked them? They liked you Riffraff hysterically exposing all his inner insecuritiesThey didn't like me! They NEVER liked me! Priceless!".

This movie deals with being different in society from sexuality to the way people look. The directing was good and the scenery and lighting gave the story that takes place in this big house believable for the movie. This also helped keep the audience interested. It made people think of things like What's going to happen to Brad and Janet? Will they ever get out of this house? How is this movie going to end? Although the story was very different then from what I'm used to watching it was still great nonetheless.The story was hard to follow towards the end. When Dr. Frank and Rocky die and Riff Raff and Magenta return to Transylvania it was a little confusing. This movie works for the movie but something like this couldn't happen in real life. I liked this movie anyway since I'm a sucker for a good musical.".

	schema:reviewBody "I admit I'm too lazy to read through all the reviews here and see if I'm the only one who loves this classic not only for its music its cast and costumes or its insane collection of cinematic references. Just in case I'm the only one I post this comment to perhaps give you a new view to this wonderful film.Under all its noise and gaudiness I think the RHPS is profound touching and tragic.A German critic sympathetic to the film called it utterly immoral. This is ridiculous as the RHPS is one of the most deeply moral films of all times.Why do Brad and Janet let themselves so easily be seduced by Frank N'Furter? Because they never spent a thought on the rules they want to live by. They think you don't have sex before marriage because that's just the way how decent people should live. Obviously no one has told them that there could be a real understandable REASON for living this way. They have no clue. Trying to live by a moral without understanding the foundation of this moral must lead to tragedy.Frank N'Furter is a fascinating figure one of the most memorable villains in cinematic history. There can be no doubt that what he does to Brad to Janet to Rocky to Eddie is not only rude but evil. Not before the Floor Show at the end we get a glimpse at the human core in this monster. There he sings about how he wanted to be dressed like Fay Wray when he saw her in King Kong. I suspect that he not only wanted to be dressed like her he wanted to BE her  a longing that could not be fulfilled. Wearing women's clothes tragically didn't made him an angelic figure like Fay Wray it made him a freak. And it seems to me that all he wanted in the first place was to be loved and be accepted for what he was. When he sings I'm going home and imagines an audience this audience doesn't consist of weirdos like the Transsylvanians who are present when Frank is introduced into the film. Instead they are ordinary old people who friendly applaud his performance. Frank makes you think about how unfulfillable desires can torture people and make them outsiders. I don't think Frank wanted to be an outsider.For me the most beautiful scene is when they sing Don't dream it be it in the pool. The other four people in the pool are dressed like Frank there are no boundaries any more no distinction between the sexes no gravity. This is pure bliss the single truly utopian moment of the RHPS. Makes you want to believe that it could really be possible to be in love with the whole world caress and be caressed back without jealousy and pain beyond time and space beyond good and evil. Not even Dr. Scott can resist great performance in his monologue magnificent actor!.But is this more than a dream? Could it be real? The scene could go on for ever I wish it would but it is short and is abruptly ended by Frank himself when he jumps out of the water and starts singing Wild and untamed thing. Why? Doesn't he trust his own utopia? Earlier in the film we have seen how Janet imagines different people replacing the face of her lover Rocky during her orgasm. This is basically the same utopia but here the way it is presented doesn't make it look very tempting but bizarre and disturbing. I suspect this scene is closer to our reality outside of the cinema outside of our dreams When you love with your body but not with your soul all you can hope for is a moment of frantic pleasure but no real fulfillment.The ending of the RHPS cannot be mistaken in its moral. Brad and Janet spell it out when they sing the sad last song Super Heroes. What is left for them from the big party? Nothing but pain and disillusion. They have not been loved they have been used and now they are scarred for life. This is not a happy ending.The epilogue by the narrator is very pessimistic. But are we really insects crawling on this earth without hope without meaning? I don't think so. We could decide to live a different life. A life without deliberately or thoughtlessly hurting other people. Respecting and accepting other people for what they are. Living not by an empty moral but by a real one with love and compassion.".

The Rocky Horror Picture Show simply is a tremendously inspiring movie and it's almost impossible not to start swinging yourself when the legendary songs such as The Time Warp and Touch Me are being sung by the vivid cast. The screenplay is adapted from Richard O'Brien who also costars play and it still comes across as very wit and allknowing in its humor. There's spoofing and referring to everything from Universal and RKOPictures horror movies over typically 50's sciencefiction to Hammer horror and the filming locations  set pieces are leftovers from other classic genre titles. The story is ridiculously simple and merely just introduces a young couple whose car breaks down near a ominous dark castle. When they go there for help they're sucked into the eccentric world of transvestite Dr. Frank 'N Furter and his bizarre collection of servants and friends. The frenzied doctor created himself a muscled and blondhaired toyboy and he's in the middle of presenting his creation when Brad and Janet a great early role for Susan Sarandon stumble in. The lines and song lyrics are often hilarious and far from politically correct and the lingerie costumes are quite nifty. All the acting performances are terrific but immensely divergent since Tim Curry's Frank 'N Furter is extremely grotesque whereas Charles Gray's narrating character is straightfaced.".

After quitting the cast of Jesus Christ Superstar over creative differences O'Brien set out to write a rock musical that would combine all the things that give you a buzz from sciencefiction and horror films to comedy and glam rock. Impressed by Alice Cooper's recent concert assaults on London O'Brien created what he originally called an Alice Cooper type Frankenstein character named Dr. FrankNFurter who would build a blond muscleman for his own pleasure. Tim Curry assumed the role in the 1973 London play sharing the stage with O'Brien Little Nell Patricia Quinn and Jonathan Adams. Behind the scenes were director Jim Sharman production designer Brian Thomson musical arranger Richard Hartley and costume designer Sue Blane all of whom brought their considerable creativity to the production. The core members of the Rocky Horror stage family went on to create the film building on a year's worth of theatrical innovation.Transferring Rocky Horror to the medium of film allowed the concept to take on a dreamlike quality. The film's tone is satire Richard O'Brien enjoyed the dialogue of classic sciencefiction films where actors were called on to say outlandish lines with straight faces. The songs are integrated not backstage musical numbers which advance the plot. All of the characters are seduced or controlled by Frank but his influence does not end with them. The film is at its most subversive when Frank talks and sings directly to the camera the technique is a tribute to JeanLuc Godard Jim Sharman's favorite director.In the film Sweet Transvestite Frank is given a glamorous Joan Crawfordlike film star appearance and speaks in a feminine voice with an upperclass Knightsbridge accent. When heshe gazes into the camera and beckons Give yourself over to absolute pleasure his message is not meant only for his poolside partners but for us. As the bisexual mad doctor commences his final descent into decadence his moral subduers are portrayed as similarly decadent hypocrites offering up Frank as a sexual martyr.

But somehow the combination of the narrative the mood and the humanness of the characters create an alchemy that transcends this film from something that could have been common into something quite unique and memorable. Noirish settings dedicated medical professionals and mobsters and their loyal henchmen are all commonplace enough in movies as to risk being clichs. Yet everything in this film about a London midwife who stumbles into contact with the Russian mob as she seeks clues to the identity of a teen who died in childbirth mesh together wonderfully and fully engage the viewer.While it all starts with the script credit must be given to the director David Cronenberg for bringing it to life and for the cast who created living breathing characters who the viewer cares about whether they are likable or not good or evil or not quite so easy to read. They seem real.At the core of the film is Nikolai the loyal chauffeur to the kingpin's volatile son. Nikolai is both enigmatic and mesmerizing. We know he is a man with a past and with secrets but we really don't know what his goals and motives are. We don't know who he is yet somehow just as the halfRussian midwife Anna we are drawn to him and trust that there is goodness in him even as were are not quite sure we should. It is a skillful yet understated performance that quietly blows you away.Although Eastern Promises has some of the director's signature moments of eyepopping violence they do not dominate this film and it is the quiet moments where the characters are silently contemplating aspects of their own existence that give the film its power. We can see the introspection and pain on their faces but the script leaves so much unsaid and so much about the two main characters played by Viggo Mortensen and Naomi Watts we come to care about so much remain a beautiful haunting mystery.".

Even the poster with little and index finger straighter then the rest it all breathers authenticity.I didn't go in expecting nonRussian actors to suddenly have no accent but I did have hesitations about the pronunciation that usually tends to be horrible. Not so here despite the accent that was slight the intonation the way the characters cary themselves especially Mortinssen's are very Russian. Even his less then perfect English sounds Russia when he misses articles Not good place for girl to grow up. Overall the director shows a bit of what a real SinCity looks like. Violence is like a snap of a whip sudden and loud. The movie is very stylish but without trying to be so. It's just how these people like to live their lifes. A lot has been said about acting and it is true Mortinssen really delivers. All the auther actors are great too though there is no weak link in this movie.Anyway the bottom line The most authentic movie about Russian mobsters that the west has produced so far. Furthermore I find the only aspect in which it looses to the Godfather is scope. Although the movie is complete I can not help but to want for more. The best film I've seen this year.".

After you shake off its terrific immediate impact there is no way to think while watching it you realize that Eastern Promises is also a kind of morality tale complex and important.Only after you hold your breath cover your eyes and get through the movie do you realize how Eastern Promises manages to contradict Friedrich Nietzsche effectively. The German philosopher's Beyond Good and Evil denied the possibility of a universal morality. Cronenberg's film says that ethics  without expectation of rewards in this life or a possible other one  can prevail even in the depths of great evil. The History of Violence director continues his subtle subtext theme of upholding Anne Frank's belief that in spite of everything people are really good at heart and he does so without a smidgen of sentimentality.There is no goodness in evidence as Viggo Mortensen's scary Russian mobster does every bidding of Armin MuellerStahl's chilling godfather figure ruling ruthlessly over a family which includes his son a monster out of control played brilliantly by Vincent Cassel son of JeanPierre Cassel.During a prerelease press tour Cronenberg spoke of his wish to present provocative juicy stories... with complexity... showing that all monsters are sentimental and have some kind of relationship to a moral compass. That is all true but what makes Eastern Promises so appealing is that there is no pop psychology or worse pop philosophy in or about it. The film hits you over the head with its magnificently written story Steven Knight of Dirty Pretty Things not with a message.The title on one level refers to promises made to young women in Russia luring them to the West where the Mob enslaves them as prostitutes. It is one of these drugged and brutalized women whose death opens the film and brings an English nurse Naomi Watts into the story.As a multitude of promises threats and tragedies unfolds you get the maximum out of Eastern Promises with minimum advance knowledge of its story. Initially that is. When you return to see it again it won't matter that you'll know how it ends you will want to reexperience what is certain to become a classic film.

My two favourite films of this idiosyncratic and fascinating director. Naomi Watts and motherhood go beautifully together and it's her gutsy maternal instinct that throws her in a world populated by truly horrible people. The trick is we go with her and within that brutal world we meet some memorable characters. Viggo Mortensen what an actor! His fearlessness is riveting he's also beautiful beyond words. We think we can read him but we doubt our own thoughts he's in total control of his character and of his audience. He has the face of an icon and he underplays it over playing it. If you see History Of Violence and Eastern Promises you'll understand what I mean. This is not a film to like but to love and I loved it.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a wet and dreary preChristmas London an anonymous distressed 14year old Russian girl staggers into Trafalgar hospital on the verge of giving birth hemorrhaging badly and with obvious heroine tracks on her arms. Pediatric nurse Anna Naomi Watts tries in vain to save both mother and baby but in the end all that remains is the newborn and a diary written in Russian in the girl's purse that contains a business card for a Russian restaurant. Haunted by her own previous miscarriage and determined that the baby girl not be sent to an orphanage Anna attempts to have the diary translated in order to identify the anonymous girl's family. In so doing she becomes embroiled in the dark seething world of crime drugs and prostitution of the Russian Mob. It is an enclosed hot house society where family loyalty and responsibility and adherence to the vory v zakone code of thieves are paramount and shady characters like the restauranteur Semyon Armin MuellerStahl his son Kirill Vincent Cassel and his driver Nikolai Viggo Mortensen exist on the periphery of the law.As a longtime fan of Cronenberg's work it is interesting for me to see his recent films grab the public attention in such a mainstream way. While it is true that both A History of Violence and Eastern Promises feature less obviously fantastic elements than say The Fly or Scanners Cronenberg's uniquely clinical and undramatic visual and storytelling style remain intact throughout all of his films. Nothing in a David Cronenberg film appears on screen without a reason. He's sort of the filmmaking equivalent of Ernest Hemingway a deceptively simple unflinching eye a calm surface that somehow manages to get under your skin and hints at labyrinthine depths beneath. Cronenberg's work always makes you uncomfortable but here in Eastern Promises it is done very subtly almost subliminally so you find yourself thinking about it afterward without realizing it.The acting in Eastern Promises is uniformly excellent. Viggo Mortensen's Nikolai in particular displays a still coiled menace that is chilling and intense which plays well against Vincent Cassel's portrayal of the feral Kirill whose confused and tortured attempts to live up to his father's criminal expectations set the plot in motion and Armin MuellerStahl's stunningly nuanced performance as the crime boss Semyon Satan dressed up as your favorite uncle at Christmastime. As Anna unwittingly tossed into this den of serpents Naomi Watts manages to be simultaneously vulnerable and tenacious in a role for which she will doubtless receive too little credit.Cronenberg's nononsense approach to violence is still in evidence here from the shockingly bloody opening scene to one remarkably brutal fight sequence that deserves to be written down in the annals of film history and is so astonishing that it isn't until afterward that you register the fact that Viggo Mortensen did the whole thing completely nude. But in the end it is the sinuous undercurrent of hope the trickle of humanity that manages to somehow exist amongst these desperate characters that sticks with me in this film. The writing hints at things rather than stating them the muted film noir visual style enhances this and even the big plot twist near the end of the story that I wouldn't dream of spoiling for you is handled with the most minimalist of gestures. I swear sometime soon David Cronenberg is going to discover the meaning of life in a black screen.".

	schema:headline " Cronenberg and Mortensen deliver in one unmissably solid thriller";
	schema:reviewBody "When I first saw the trailer for Eastern Promises I was a little confused. Yes A History of Violence was a complete turnaround style picture for David Cronenberg whose previous films include the most twistedly eccentric visions of horrendously graphic violence and overtly over sexualized human beings and monsters but I had not expected that he would continue down the path of the independent mainstream. I was a little hesitant to see it at first but gradually the trailer's imagery drew me in. And now I can say there really is a reason for the Oscar buzz.There really is no way to perfectly describe Eastern Promises without giving a few juicy details away. It revolves around a Russian crime circuit in London headed by Semyon Armin MuellerStahl and includes his son Kirill Vincent Cassel and Kirill's driver Nikolai Viggo Mortensen. Anna Naomi Watts a midwife gets involved within the circuit unknowingly when she attempts to get a diary recently left by a teenage mother who died during childbirth translated from Russian into English.The plot is really not that complicated but giving a full description ruins the little idiosyncrasies and poignant character moments shared within the film. Oscarnominee Steve Knight has constructed a gritty atmospheric thriller that starts up quick and then slows down to a nice steady pace just so the audience can catch its breath and brood over the workings of the cast. It is dialogue driven but when it is not being sly or darkly comedic it plays out like an opera. We gradually learn all the intimate details of every sketchy character and we get a deeper sense of just how bad some of these characters are. It is not just a paintbynumbers depiction of bad men it is a highly detailed and clearly articulate character study. And even at its dullest moments it works excellently.Kudos also goes to Cronenberg's go to cinematographer Peter Suschitsky. London and its drab and depressing climate are beautifully represented here from the first frame all the way up to the last. Even when the sun is out the sets have a certain subdued haze over them. We are watching a film about the criminal underbelly and its settings help reflected just how low these people are in their moral standings. It works greatly in favour of the film and it almost works as a character in itself. The drab almost noir settings help achieve the dirty politics of the film and they help explore the character studies even further. Whether it's the scariness of watching Mortensen in the dark or just looking at the glare of MuellerStahl in his dimmed restaurant all of the details have been amped up on each set to give the audience a greater sense of understanding and purpose for just about every character.And what Cronenberg film would be without some bizarrely violent visuals? While not exactly a bloodbath Cronenberg does have a few moments where he paints the screen a bright shade of scarlet red. And when it begins to flow there is nothing that can really stop it. It works much in the same way as it did in Violence in that the film builds to a scene loaded with it and just lets loose in a ferocious manner unlike any wellknown director currently working in the mainstream on movies that are not specifically horror with obvious exceptions to Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. It has that Cronenbergian touch and much like his other films its style is impeccable and thoughtprovoking.Another fantastic element is the score by Howard Shore. It slows when it needs to and it quickens even faster. It plays out wonderfully throughout the scenes and gives them a sort of classy feel. I realize I used the opera description before but it fits even better here. Its great workings underpin every scene and help dictate just how well off the film is.What hurts the film besides some very bizarre choices by Watts' character is the denouement. It works but I just cannot fathom how neither Knight nor Cronenberg thought it was appropriate for the story that was taking place. It just does not have the solid impact that every other scene either has or builds to. I sat almost dumbfounded trying to figure out who thought it was a good idea and why no one told them to rewrite it. But I will say much like Violence Promises has an absolutely stunning final moment. But to get to that astounding moment you have to sit through a rather disappointing finale.If you thought you had seen Mortensen's best work before Promises then you will be in for a very big surprise. His cold and calculating performance as Nikolai is the stuff that creates legends. He is menacing from the word go and even as the enigmatic slowly becomes the wellknown you will just stare in fear and awe as he speaks on screen. From the terrifying tattoos to a small character moment where he puts out a cigarette on his tongue Mortensen is the quintessential image of evil. His unrestrained anger is felt throughout the film and hopefully will be just the right performance to launch him into the stratosphere of Oscarnominated actors. Even during the letdown of an ending he keeps up and never lets anyone down.The rest of the cast albeit nowhere near as strong as Mortensen are all very good supporting characters. Watts' character may have issues but she breathes a certain life into the nave character that I doubt many others could match. Much the same goes for Cassel and MuellerStahl who bring just the right amount of intensity to their roles.Although it is flawed Cronenberg has delivered yet another exceptional thriller. It will surely be recognized at Oscar time and for good reason too. Do not miss it.8.510.".

On the negative side of the balance there's a plot structure that one hopes would be more complex but which ends up being as contrived as an early 20th Century film melodrama  the orphaned baby in the hospital threatened by ethnic gangsters... the alltooobvious secret agent who blows his own cover but gets away with it... etc. On the other hand Viggo Mortensen gives a decent performance affected accent aside and Vincent Cassel is brilliant. There are some pretty cool violent action scenes which might be a positive or a negative for different people  the director Cronenberg has often been accused of needless gore while his defenders often argue that gore is a style and a manner of formalism for him. Eastern Promises always seems to hang just on the precipice of bad taste and even sheer stupidity and the artistic accomplishment to which these ends are used is questionable in the end.An orphaned baby's mother leaves behind a diary with all kinds of mafia secrets which is discovered and for some reason allowed to remain in the possession of the nurse on duty at the time Naomi Watts instead of the police. Leaving aside the fact that the diary plot device is more stale than Shakespeare allusions the movie then throws in this chauffeur character Mortensen and the audience can tell within 5 minutes that he knows way more than Cassel's character and is probably a secret agent. However this possibility never occurs even to the hardened mafia types after the chauffeur arranges for a whore he slept with to be arrested and sent back to her home. One is left by the end of the movie after witnessing this mafia's inept attempts to protect itself from a very obvious threat to wonder how they could possibly have stayed in power for more than a few weeks.Cassel is the main saving grace of the film  as a selftortured repressed homosexual who's always dangerously close to releasing his energy in the form of violence on relatively innocent people his volatile energy keeps the film going. The performances in general are very good as Cronenberg knows how to work with the actor to bring out something interesting regardless of the material. But it's a shame to see the director and the cast trying to put meat on such a poor animal's bones. I greatly preferred the previous MortensenCronenberg collaboration A History of Violence. There were some moments of this film that seemed to reach for territory even beyond that film's deliberately limited pallet but the structure of the story wasn't strong enough for me to support or sustain those moments.I see Eastern Promises as an interesting failure. Ultimately the characters are more interesting than anything in the story which is not inherently bad but is rather demanding towards the actors. Most carried through in this film but it lacked a certain focus and vitality that the best films should have.".

However this possibility never occurs even to the hardened mafia types after the chauffeur arranges for a whore he slept with to be arrested and sent back to her home. One is left by the end of the movie after witnessing this mafia's inept attempts to protect itself from a very obvious threat to wonder how they could possibly have stayed in power for more than a few weeks.Cassel is the main saving grace of the film  as a selftortured repressed homosexual who's always dangerously close to releasing his energy in the form of violence on relatively innocent people his volatile energy keeps the film going. The performances in general are very good as Cronenberg knows how to work with the actor to bring out something interesting regardless of the material. But it's a shame to see the director and the cast trying to put meat on such a poor animal's bones. I greatly preferred the previous MortensenCronenberg collaboration A History of Violence. There were some moments of this film that seemed to reach for territory even beyond that film's deliberately limited pallet but the structure of the story wasn't strong enough for me to support or sustain those moments.I see Eastern Promises as an interesting failure. Ultimately the characters are more interesting than anything in the story which is not inherently bad but is rather demanding towards the actors. Most carried through in this film but it lacked a certain focus and vitality that the best films should have.";

	schema:reviewBody "Ever since Cronenberg started making straight movies without too many splatter elements something in his oeuvre had been lacking. Spider was beautifully photographed but a complete and utter bore. The much praised A History Of Violence had a great cast and a solid premise but turned out to be just as boring and on top of that farfetched and superficial. Eastern Promises finds Cronenberg finally coming to terms with his new realistic approach to movie making.It's a little wonder that there haven't been too many serious movies about the Russian Mafia yet so having a movie that takes place in these circles is fascinating all by itself. Cronenberg sets the story up slowly but nicely. He never falls into the trap of slowing things down too much as he did with his previous two movies. Cronenberg also avoids getting too close to the style of the genre's Big Kahuna Martin Scorsese. This is a completely original effort which sets it apart from 2007's snorefest American Gangster that didn't contribute anything new to the gangster genre at all.The cast is of course very helpful. Viggo Mortensen and Vincent Cassell look threatening coldblooded and emotional all at the same time. You really forget the actors and start looking at them as the characters they embody. Armin MuellerStahl who plays the gangster boss wasn't quite as convincing. During the movie we hear all those cruel and crazy things he's done but when we see him on screen we can't really imagine that he's capable of all that. The weakest link in the cast however is Naomi Watts who plays the same way she always does and comes across as pretty onedimensional. She has deservedly gotten a lot of praise for Mullholland Dr. but failed to present a comparably great performance ever since. She's just good enough not to ruin the intensity of this movie.Eastern Promises is aesthetic explicit and thrilling. There are some scenes you won't forget for weeks to come the sauna fight the opening sequence. In short what we have here is a modern classic. One of last year's finest and possibly the best movie David Cronenberg has made so far.".

	schema:headline " Keeping Promises";
	schema:reviewBody "When it comes to films made by veteran Canadian director David Cronenberg certain promises are expected to be kept. The name promises something dark and twisted something gruesome and haunting something disturbing and seductive. Cronenberg's latest EASTERN PROMISES certainly makes good on all these accounts and solidifies his new more linear but no less disconcerting approach to filmmaking. Gone are the days of surreal experiments where fetishists get off on colliding cars and the ensuing scars or twin gynecologists playing patients for patsies. Now is the time for the Russian mafia in London to be given a human touch. No now Mr. Cronenberg is not so concerned with being bizarre as he is with being blunt. As with his last masterpiece A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE Cronenberg has made PROMISES into a straightforward story and morality tale much to the dismay of film students everywhere. Fear not though students. Accessibility does not make Cronenberg irrelevant. If anything it means that brilliantly polished stories about the underbelly of humanity can be told without any unnecessary sentiment allowing for them to be both provocative and bloody as all hell.It rains just as much in Cronenberg's London as it does in the real London. The rain ushers in the heavy yet steady hand of this director whose work always seems to be weighed down by a looming sense of despair and discomfort. Still though the viewer is pulled into a world where cutting the tips off of fingers and slitting throats is just as normal as a wellbalanced breakfast nothing is so simple as good and evil as absolutes. Like the sky the rain is falling from everyone is surrounded by an ambiguous grey. Naomi Watts plays a midwife named Anna. On one tragic evening Anna helps to bring a baby into the world at the expense of the very young heroineaddicted mother's life. She does not want to see the child fall into the system as the girl cannot be identified to find her next of kin so she makes it her mission to find the girl's family before this can happen. It may all seem noble but her saintly act also serves to appease the pain she has felt since the miscarriage of her own child months before. She couldn't save her baby but she can certainly try to help this one. Her search leads her directly to the door of the Russian mafia and this is where she meets Nikolai Viggo Mortensen. At the moment Nikolai is just the driver but he's got hopes to one day be part of the real family. He would be perfect for the job as he is calculated and cold when he needs to be but then again not so as he also takes the time to encourage the slave sex worker he's just been with to find a better life. People are complicated Cronenberg knows this and this is what gives EASTERN PROMISES its depth.Though regular Cronenberg cinematographer Peter Suschitzky guides EASTERN PROMISES with a tranquil glide that sets the pace as both unnerving and engrossing it is Mortensens's performance as an aspiring mafioso with a nagging sense of compassion that is most memorable and moving. His face is harsh and guarded behind his dark sunglasses and beneath his slicked back immaculately placed hair lies a mystery that is being heavily protected. His presence is daunting as he steps from a black town car dressed to match from his shoes to his gloves. He is naturally imposing and his icy composure and unflinching dedication to his superiors make him frightening without really trying. He is not so much trying to intimidate others into submission though but rather to keep them away. Yet there is something about him that inspires those around him to see a reason to trust him. Perhaps it is his reliability or perhaps it is just that you know once you meet him that you would rather have him on your side than on the other. Mortensen working with Cronenberg for the second time after his tortured performance in A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE is transformed and nearly unrecognizable as Nikolai. And while his character is extremely guarded he still manages to find himself in a very naked position before the film's end in what is a shocking and exhilarating fight sequence that finds Cronenberg as God going after Nikolai when he is at his most vulnerable. Proving himself to be a vengeful God Cronenberg punishes his character for allowing himself to relax for three seconds to appreciate his success.The fight sequence is already being heralded as one for the books that will be talked about for years to come. I have a feeling we will be hearing just as much talk about Mortensen's performance Steven Knight's script and Cronenberg's direction come awards season. After setting the groundwork with A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE which I actually do prefer over EASTERN PROMISES just because it left me with more on my mind the mainstream film community seems finally ready to reward one of its veteran contributors. If you're going to sell out I can't imagine a better way to do it.".

Cronenberg has his own recognizable style of making movies and it's visible in this one and it saves a movie a little bit. I mean if you take it as some kinda Kill Bill with a bunch of bad guys and a bit of ethnic flavor it's OK although still nothing much to talk about since the story line is so generic and flat one has to be a naive and impressionable teenager to be entertained by it.The problem starts if one takes the movie seriously as some kind of gangster drama or as some kind of glance into the world of real Russian mafia. Then the whole thing falls apart right from the beginning. For someone who grew up in Russia and had any remote contacts with gangsters the mafia portrayed in this piece of fantasy is no more realistic as the orcs in the Lord of the Rings. First of all no organized crime group would call themselves vory v zakone. It's plain ridiculous. Then the whole switching of languages thing looks really schizophrenic. You constantly see the Russian gangsters exchanging phrases in some kinda pidgin Russian and then repeating the same thing to each other in English. It's just ludicrous as well as the words they say in Russian are so out of otuch with what the real Russians might say in the relevant situation. It's hard to believe that in a movie with such a budget they couldn't hire some Russians to do the work. Cassel in fact was the only one whose accent remotely reminded meRussian. The worst came from Mortensen who despite claiming to visitRussia and practice for the role inside the country totally fails to look anything close to what a Russian man would look and sound. Then the way they execute each other and all these Chechens with little knives is again so remote from reality. In real world they just shoot the victims early in the morning while they are going out of the house and not run after them in the public sauna armed with tiny knives. The God fathers gathering to admit the new member is again director's fantasy. In real world none of them busy people would bother to come together in order to hire a little man. In real world a mafia newcomer would never have chance to talk to all the bosses at once. Then I had an impression that the fearsome criminal organization where Viggo infiltrated himself consists of only the father his son Cyill and him nobody else. I could go on and on about all the mismatches but I guess the realism wasn't the driving force behind the making of the movie so let it be what it is a stylized B rated piece of mafiafantasy.".

	schema:reviewBody "David Cronenberg's Eastern Promises takes on in the broadest stroke the Russian mafia. But it's not that broad persay so much as it takes on the atmosphere of an organized crime family of the terror that is just completely seething under the surface and comes up like pus out of a boil when heated. The Russian underworld of London isn't too pretty and rivalries are settled often with the slice of a throat by a shaving knife as happens towards the beginning of the film and later on in a graveyard put to a splendid jumpcut to an accordion player with the members initiated through specific tattoos on the torso and knees. And when the most unexpected happens like a terrible rapepregnancybirth via a 14 year old girl the repercussions could be even more severe than a murder rap. I loved getting immersed into the nature of the people of the violence the threat of it the joys submerged with lots and lots of vodka it could be a stereotype but then what would a stereotype be if it weren't true in the ugliest form and at the same time always outsiders to British society.It's an insulated world where doubleedged personalities are common especially if a crime bossfather like Armin MuellerStahl's character Semyon and at one time he has to be kind and compassionate to those outside of the circle. Like Naomi Watts's midwife character who first comes to him about this mystery baby and a girl's diary written in Russian. But there's always the sensation even early on that he's a lot more sinister a lot more cruel and vicious than he would let on to any ordinary person and this is all the more apparent in his quick outbursts against his son Kirill Vincent Cassell. Kirill of course is like a lone black sheep of the family who gets into trouble with other families usually through killing somebody in all late hours of the night. Nikolai Mortensen is the driverbodyguardfootsoldier to Kirill and the rest of the family and has a bond that goes beyond what Kirill has he's really like a 'good' son if anything at all to Seymon. Some of the best scenes in any Cronenberg film are those that are filled with an unspoken tension and understanding of the dynamics when Nikolai settles a situation between Seymon and Kirill or those subdued homoerotic moments from Kirill to Nikolai.Many of those scenes the whole story arc of Nikolai is a truly compelling tale that soon reveals itself and not to reveal too much here as to make it spoiling as part of Cronenberg's aesthetic of the doublesided nature of a man or the duality inherent in certain types. But suffice to say it's one of the coolest examples even if it might seem almost conventional at first because of what Nikolai's future will come to following the fight he has in the steamhouse. While we see the more emotional story of Anna who like Nikolai is an outsider who is put into a somewhat torn situation albeit Nikolai unlike Anna is far more cunning and as he says to her at one point he is a 'bad' guy her side of the story is more of something to keep things moving along the fate of the diary the baby the whole ball of wax of secrets surrounding the mother's death and so on. This is all still compelling in sad voiceovers but somehow Anna's side is more of a baseline to the saga of the Russian family which is appropriate. Her ending which seems tidied up on the surface has an openending that feels almost TOO tidy however if you're thinking that ambiguity is lacking it actually nears up to what History of Violence offered in a 'what next' kind of query to the audience.As modern thrillers should be as Cronenberg and his screenwriter knows Eastern Promises is efficient startling and often as entertaining as the goofiest moments of any film by the director. Only here its in little moments of dialog was Anna's uncle in the KGB...maybe not but as an auxiliary? not so much in outrageousness or supergore. And yet it's also probably even more violent if only in the suddenness than History of Violence the much hyped steamroom right with Mortensen fending off the two gangsters lives up to it as it's as visceral as Oldboy's classic sequence and with an energy and shock value that made everyone in the audience I saw it with yelp and cringe. But Cronenberg isn't simply going by shock value here Eastern Promises is very strong as classic storytelling and even better in the acting department. Mortensen is one of Cronenberg's very best male collaboratorstars and here his work is if anything more subtle and textured than the last one which is saying a lot of both director and actor MuellerStahl gives maybe his best performance since the 80s a sure Oscar contender if I've ever seen one Watts is sublime in a role that requires her mostly to be uneasy around Russian mobsters and frightened by the fear all around the situation Cassell is about as taut as can be imaginable and at the same time projecting the pathetic subtext to Kirill's boasting masculinity and stupidity.If you're planning on seeing any crime movie this year that isn't directed by the Coen brothers and one that is atmospheric without hyperstylization and grips the intellect just as much as the emotions Eastern Promises is it. In a career of some of the most challenging probes of men on the edge of sanity andor reason Cronenberg continues to strike where the iron is hot or just not seen to even be considered grounds for striking at all.".

Sir Arthur Conan DoyleIf Viggo Mortensen fighting naked in a London steam bath with some bad Chechens doesn't interest you then perhaps I can offer you a secondtier Godfather with strong family values and exceptional acting. Director David Cronenberg in Eastern Promises comes through again with realistic violence and depressing ambiance cast over by a humanity that even the Godfather has trouble matching.Midwife Anna Naomi Watts happens on a prostitute's volatile diary in the emergency room. The London Russian mob vory v zachone wants it back because it implicates the son of kingpin Semyon Armin MuellerStahl Shine in crimes. Driver to the mob but good guy deep down Nikolai Mortensen serves as the agent collecting the diary and carrying out the fate of those who have read it. As in most mob stories loyalty is coin of the realm so much so that even children of a don are not exempt from the rigid code. As in Dirty Pretty Things young girls like body parts are bought and sold like slaves in a careless market.Cronenberg's worlds are usually violent topsyturvy and peopled by bipolar miscreants who have accepted the dangers in hope of riches or power but at the same time fight with themselves over the moral implications. So too in Eastern Promises where a helpless newborn topples a kingmaker and makes virtuous royalty of others. Getting the throne or that royalty is tough for Nikolai whose naked fight to the death in the bath is a tour de force of violent ballet even discounting Mortensen's otherworldly physique. Cronenberg's fascination with the body's vulnerability is memorable here stripped down and utterly alone like birth and death.The majesty of Coppola's Godfather is partly here but more diluted the array of complex characters in the Corleone family just is not duplicated. Yet MuellerStahl has Brando's quiet authority and Mortensen Pacino's quietly dangerous charm when he says I live in the zone all the time you can't help but wonder what secret turmoil lives in his heart. Neither Eastern Promises actor can possibly surpass those Godfather icons but they and the film are promising affiliates of the royal gangland canon.".

There are layers of complexity bringing together the history of the families the ethnic tensions the feelings between the killers and their own families all down much economically than Coppola did. This film runs under two hours and makes quite an impact leaving its audience wanting more in particular about the future of the Viggo character... a man who is able to handle the worst of situations and might have more ambitions than are obvious when we first meet the players.This film is not for the weak with plenty of graphic violence and some emotional moments that people might not be able to handle.

To find any clue to place the baby with its next of kin Anna asks her Russian uncle Jerzy Skolimowski to translate the diary she also follows the trail of a business card found in the diary to a Russian restaurant owned by Semyon avuncular yet sinister Armin MuellerStahl.Semyon's son Kirill Vincent Cassel hangs around Semyon's street muscle Nikolai Viggo Mortensen like that little yapping dog Chester in the Warner Bros. Sylvester cartoon Dr. Jerkyl's Hide That's my Alf!.These early scenes do well to create an aura of uneasiness around the Russians. It falls apart just about the time we see Viggo stark frontal nekkid. You heard me ladies...Semyon betrays Nikolai to the Russian Mob on the pretense that Nikolai is Kirill his son who was ordered sacrificed. But Nikolai dispatches the assassins in a nude steam room scene that can't GET any steamier for the ladies with his magnificent ballsac doing most of the work.There are two big reveals in EASTERN PROMISES. The first is Viggo's magnificent ballsac the second is that Nikolai is a cop. Undercover.And the movie is officially euthanized by its own makers.After all the research that went into the Mob tatts on Viggo's body after all that skulking around and winding us up now we don't have to fear for Anna any more  we know she has a protector in the form of Aragorn! How could any cavetrolls get near her now? Cronenberg makes a greatlooking film but that's probably more attributable to his cinematographer Peter Suschitzky but I'm not letting him off the hook for the absurd twists that negate the whole reason for us to be concerned with these people's fates.Like his HISTORY OF VIOLENCE Cronenberg's story does not seem to take place in any real world we know. Wouldn't the Russian Mob  after sending two assassins to kill Kirill and failing  send more assassins to finish the job? And when they find out Nikolai is not Kirill wouldn't they go after the real Kirill? Wouldn't they sanction Semyon for trying to baitandswitch them? And whether Nikolai is Kirill or not wouldn't they send someone to finish the job while he lies prostrate in hospital? None of this happens. It's Cronenberg's world of No Consequences.The gore in EASTERN PROMISES is not gratuitous but when it comes Cronenberg never flinches. The naked shower battle is intense with glinty knives scarring across backs and stabbed into eyes yet Cronenberg simply uses gaping wound holes to distract us from the gaping plot holes.Firstly it's not a child prostitution ring if just one fourteenyearold girl was raped it's not a Russian mob war if there are no followup assassination attempts and Anna suddenly seems completely safe and therefore irrelevant the baby becomes a McGuffin Kirill becomes homosexual and Semyon is simply arrested by local police. After showing us a Russian underculture that is hard and heavy Semyon's arrest is ridiculous uh guess the Russian gangs didn't want to interrupt official police business.In a final shot Nikolai is seen taking on the Godfather role in Semyon's stead. So an undercover cop who is trying to bring down the organization is now running it. And all this while I thought There IS No Keyser Soze.".

However I feel that in Eastern Promises there are so many disappointments and incorrectness. I even don't know where it all starts. I guess the script is awful first of all. Those kind of scripts should be given to exercise to some smaller ranked directors. But Kronenberg how could he work with this script? Money??? One of the greatest problem of the movie is the cast and the language. My native language is Russian and there was no oneI mean no one phrase which I could trust. Wrong understanding of Russian mentality wrong use of Russian language in corresponding situations. This movie looks like some of the 80' Brooklyn mafia Hollywood mid budged features. Even good actors didn't help. I think that this is very complicated issue. And it's extremely difficult now days to built a story about mafia. And about Russian mafia particularly without going in some stereotypes and clichs. It's not enough if you have Russian dialogs coach on the set and have read some books about the zona. It all comes together. Mr Kronenberg should have lived at least 5 years in Russia in order to get closer to what's going on. I don't live in Russia for 15 years and I feel that I am lost with their present mentality. You cannot make a movie about something if you don't feel that you completely understand it Other wise it becomes  Eastern Promises.".

The film i chose to see was eastern promises. I really am a fan of a good gangster movie. I think Goodfellas was brilliant once upon a time in America was good as well even scarface with its overblown at that time violence had something to say or show but when it came to eastern promises i was really let down. I haven't seen such a load of crap in a long long time. OK Russian mafia is into skin trade OK they do tattoos they like vodka OK. But what the F... was this? Viggo Mortensen is a great actor and i think his performance was the only thing OK about this film but even he cant save this awful script. All they really do is drink some go to a whorehouse kill a guy or 2 and then go drink some more only to finally go sobbing like a little girl. I lived in St.petersburg for a long time so may be gangsters there are different from the ones migrated to London but there is not one link of authenticity to this movie. The people i met who were gangsters were some reaalyy scary bad .... mf not the schoolyard bullys portrayed in this movie. Im really sorry if this is how Hollywood sees Russian gangsters cause the people that are studying to be policeoficers at this time are in for one nasty surprise if they think that Russian gangsters are the way they are in this movie. If u want to see something at least remotely authentic rent brother Brat in Russian".

Everything else was so fake fake villains Russian Turkish fake accents fake story... I mean this was a cartoonish performance. I guess it's what Western people assume Russian gangsters should look like and the majority of Western viewers will probably buy this crap. Being Russian I don't. No way. I understand that actors are not Russian so it's a challenge but some similar movies OK very few movies manage to address the authenticity part much better e.g. Little Odessa seemed more genuine to me. Viggo Mortensen does not look like Russian. He may be a good actor but he cannot play a Russian OK his Russian is not the worst but it's far from genuine. BTW were Mashkov already booked? What about Mironov? Could Cronenberg give Menshikov a call? Anyway if you are familiar with Russian culture and value authenticity in movies you will probably be disappointed otherwise give it a try a lot of people seem to like it.".

The overcrowded training scene in Po Chi Lam is so funny when this poor guy keeps getting accidentally knocked out of the dojo. Wong's students Fu and So who really earns the name Bucktooth in this one add levity and do some decent fighting too.  The villain is hilarious with that classic evil laugh.  Not to be missed do not forget to see Jet's rooster style.  C'mon you know Jet Li is the man if he can do that scene and still looks hardcore.Did I forget about the great fight scenes? thanks to Yuen Woo Ping  See Jet take out a guy while seated in a chair!!  Who else can take down three guys at once on only ONE jump??  Definitely watch the battle between Jet and kung fu great Gordon Liu a passing of the torch. Cheung Man fights as well and is just great to look at. Director Jing Wong knew what he was doing and this film definitely doesn't take itself too seriously.  Add Jet Li fights done by Yuen Woo Ping Anita Yuen whatta babe! Cheung Man and a lot of humor and you have one heck of a movie!!".

Gnong Kau Chai as Legate Officer Lui in my view steals the film as possibly the best bad guy ever.  His maniacal laughter and dialogue is but one of many good things in this film another of which is Jet Li's gracious and best performance as Wong Fei Hung.  TakHing Kwan who for so many films had played the same character could feel as if he has successfully passed on his mantle to Li.  The comic aspects of the film elevate this from Li's other films as Wong Fei Hung.  The use of Wong's theme song Under the General's Orders is my favourite thing about the film especially when used by the hookers whose brothel is nest to Po Chee Lam Wong Fei Hung's martial arts school.  In a year in which Li made Fong Sai Yuk 1 and 2 Tai Chi Master. If Jet Li was a fine wine people would say 1993 was en excellent year.".

For a person that doesn't like subtitles I actually didn't mind reading the well put together script which was witty and full of twists and turns. It's not very often that you see Buddha monks living next to a brothel in a authentic oriental movie and the different characters made the film funny and a joy to watch. Once again the flying fighting scenes spoil the action but after watching a few Jet Li movies I'm kind of getting use to it now. Enjoyable!RoundUp One of the things that made me laugh in this film was when they were fighting and naming the styles that they were using. It really reminded me of the old Kung Fu movies that I used to watch when I was young. I didn't get the point of the corrupt police officer who kept on laughing all of the time or why they were feeding people a deaf drug but maybe I missed some of the plot whilst reading the subtitles. Anyway it's definitely worth a watch if your into movies in this genre.Budget NA Worldwide Gross HK18millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their Jet Li movies about a Buddha monk whose investigating the mysterious disappearance of girls in his village. 610".

	schema:headline " Mr. Bean has a very distinctive and narrow brand of slapstick comedy so his target audience is not that huge but people who are into his humor should LOVE this movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "I had never seen any of Rowan Atkinson's performances as Mr. Bean when this movie came out in 1997 so I knew nothing about it when I went to see it other than that it was about the zany adventures of this strange looking man on the movie poster. He strikes me as one of those comedians that you either completely love or completely hate because his comedy is so extreme. It's not the kind of thing that you can watch and just sort of like or not really care for. It's one of those movies where it's not surprising to see people walk out in the middle while other people are just about falling out of their chairs laughing so hard. Personally I was one of the latter.I admit that Bean certainly deals in a very childish sort of humor. This is by definition slapstick comedy and it is certainly not for all tastes. But from the movie's opening scene which shows Bean gleefully shaving his entire face with an electric razor including his forehead and even his tongue you know that this is what the movie is like so you can't really hold that against it. The story in the film is clearly one of those that is invented for the movie and then manipulated to fit the screenplay and to work nicely into the movie. It's not that hard to realize that such a huge art gallery could be fooled for so long by someone like Mr. Bean thinking that he's a genius and certainly no way that he would be left alone with a 50 million painting long enough to remove it from the vault and rub paint thinner into it but on the other hand the rest of the comedy fits so nicely into this plot. At the very least there are relatively realistic situations thrown into an unrealistic plot which makes the movie enjoyable even though you don't really take it seriously.There is a wonderful scene for example where Bean sneezes on the painting of Whistler's Mother and then he tries to wipe off the spray with his handkerchief which has been smeared with a leaky pen. So the painting gets smeared with ink and he grabs the first can he sees off a nearby shelf which happens to be paint thinner. It cleans the ink off nicely but then causes the paint to boil off and then Bean frantically tries to save it by wiping it even harder rubbing the paint off right down to the canvas. Sure this is not the mark of an intelligent mind but that's the point of the whole movie. Bean is a film that relies on the fact that humans are so amused by the misfortunes of others. There's something funny about seeing someone else get into a sticky situation and in movies like this they do just that and things only get worse and worse. Granted there are a million ways out of every situation that Bean gets into that would be less painful than the routes that he chooses but if he took them there would be no movie. Consider for example the bathroom scene where a man walks in on Bean as he appears to be getting a little too friendly with a hot air dryer. He quickly grabs a light bulb pretending that he had been examining it and then the man leaves and Bean drops the hot bulb to break on the ground and when he goes to run cold water over his burnt fingers the water sprays his crotch again. Total slapstick but that's funny!Like I said Bean is not a movie for all tastes. But there is a place for childish humor in movies and that place is in movies like this. It certainly can be taken too far or simply done wrong as in the case of movies like the American Pies or the Scary Movies etc. but Bean is a movie that knows what kind of comedy it delivers and it knows how far to go before things just descend into vulgarity and bad taste. It's a comedy that does not pretend to be anything that it's not and for that it should be respected. It is also by the way the kind of a comedy that allows for an almost innumerable amount of sequels. While I can certainly see it being vastly overdone I would just like to say that if a couple more Bean movies were to be made I would be among the last to complain!".

	schema:reviewBody "Despite only having fourteen episodes Mr. Bean was a VERY successful TV series developing a welldeserved reputation for its excellent visual humour! Two years after the show's demise it was decided that it was time to bring Rowan Atkinson's character to the silver screen. The result was Bean a.k.a. Bean The Ultimate Disaster Movie but unfortunately this didn't turn out to be nearly as good as the classic TV series and has disappointed many fans including me.Mr. Bean works as a caretaker for England's Royal National Gallery and is one lousy employee as one would probably assume constantly sleeping on the job! Because of this the board of directors plans to fire him but the chairman will not permit this. The Grierson Gallery in Los Angeles has just purchased the famous Whistler's Mother painting and curator David Langley has requested that the Royal National Gallery sends an art scholar to make a speech at the unveiling of the painting. Since the board of directors can't fire Bean they see this as an opportunity to get him out of their lives at least temporarily so they send him under the name Dr. Bean! David Langley has no clue that Bean is not a doctor nor is he even an art expert and the painting could now be in danger because of him! Not only that the presence of the Royal National Gallery's terrible employee may also threaten the future of poor David's job and family! This movie's main problem is that it simply isn't nearly as consistently funny as the TV series. There are quite a few funny parts I can't deny that but I think most of them only made me smile or snicker not enough big laughs which there are a lot of in the show! Also some gags from the show are repeated in this movie and were done better the first time. These include Mr. Bean falling asleep while sitting down and gradually falling onto his knees and head I guess that one is not as funny when nobody else is in the picture and getting his head stuck in a turkey dinner the main reason why it's not as funny this time is probably because the turkey isn't as big. Now this movie did introduce some new and funny gags but none of them can match some of the priceless ones in the show. None of the other characters really add much to the humour and sadly Mr. Bean cannot steadily carry it all by himself throughout the entire thing. Towards the end I've found the film gets a bit tiring.Overall I would say Bean was not a bad first attempt to bring the worldrenowned walking disaster to the silver screen but hardly a good one either they certainly didn't completely pull it off. I am only one of many fans who have been disappointed by it to some degree. I certainly don't think it's something to watch for nonstop laughs over and over again and that's pretty much how I would describe many of the short sketches which I'm sure many would agree with. I think most fans of the show would at least find SOME laughs in this movie but it seems that some fans hate it so that's certainly not a guarantee.".

I'm not sure how well this did in the states or on which side of the pond most of the filming took place on but whatever way you look at it this just takes the concept of the series and mangles it up rather leaving us with a film that nowhere near manages to capture the magic and charm that the series did. It's funny in places but generally this has added more of an American edge to the Bean formula which misunderstands the humour of Bean. In the series it was never that Bean was an outright idiot he was just a man who perceived the world a little differently to everyone else and tended to do things his own way sometimes with catastrophic consequences. Here he is presented as a typical sort of slowminded dolt of the sort you see trotted out in many American comedy films robbing him of his distinctively innocent edge that carried him through the series.Other things aren't right with the film too including the naff plot and script which are flawed and fail to hold together.

The commercial frenzy built around the exposition points out even if strictly fictionally the ugly part of the behavior towards art in contemporary America. Reynolds's character a distinguished and respected general who can barely tell a Picasso from a car accident is another prove of that.

If you're a fan of Mr. Bean stick with the sitcom.  This movie's humor and antics are too immature and vulgar. And the family's kids were stereotypical to the tenth degree.

Along the way he gets entangled with art theives and actually ruins the painting he tries to recover.  The only funny part was when he made that theme park ride go too fast.    If you're a fan of Mr. Bean stick with the sitcom.  This movie's humor and antics are too immature and vulgar. And the family's kids were stereotypical to the tenth degree.  Bean the movie is just not worth it. It's a major disappointment.  Get The Full Monty instead.  Please Mr. Bean fans turn your back on this movie.";

In fact I am proud to say that it was my country who came up with the idea for this wonderful film.The story is about Hildur a blond bimbo who needs to get a job for the first time in her life after her boyfriend has been arrested. She gets a job at a geek shop called Astrpa and slowly learns the way of the geek and how to survive a battle against orcs and ice witches. Through her friendship with her fellow role players or party members she grows into a stronger and more independent person.This movie will leave you rolling on the floor with laughter without being degrading towards us geeks. In fact the moral of the story is that geeks rule! At least that's what I think. But even nongeeks can enjoy it a lot and get a glimpse into our silly little world.The outdoor scenes are beautifully shot. Iceland simply is a perfect place for fantasy adventures with its mountains and waterfalls. The dialogue is well written and realistic and the characters are just adorable. It has wonderful humour interesting action scenes and will make you love geeks if you don't already.Seriously this is one of the best films I've seen this year and it deserves every single star I've given it.".

There she finds new friends and journeys along side them with the power of imagination and RPG.What is really brilliant about the story is that her real life was perhaps more of a fantasy then the RPG. Its an excellent mix of drama comedy and adventure. Although the picture is graphic at times it still leaves a lot to your imagination which I really love.A movie for everyone and I think anyone can relate to it.";

Also reminded me of Clerks set in a comic store in Sweden but it could have been made in the US as far as the story goes apparently RPG'ers share a common bond the world over.

It's a trajectory not unlike Legally Blonde and Ragnhildur Steinunn Jnsdttir handles her role as Hildur as convincingly and engagingly as Witherspoon did in her corresponding role.I don't play roleplaying games or even video games and my taste in movies tends to the heavier stuff but I like to praise the rare lightweight upbeat movies that work for me. It's not saccharine and while Astrotopia what Netflix calls this movie is clichd in the overall arc of the plot it is relatively fresh in the momenttomoment of the movie. I'm not big on visual gimmicks but the scenefades into comicbook panels are precisely appropriate and an added little delight.The scenes and characters in the nerdy fantasy store where Hildur finds work were reminiscent of the record store scenes in High Fidelity. Not exactly new territory but enjoyable in the same way.Overall the movie had a nice quirky quality without being too darn cute or shoving its upbeatness down the viewer's throat.

I was lucky enough to get into a sneak preview last night and I was not disappointed. The movie like the book has the most hilarious lines and moments and each of the actors portrayed their characters so well you couldn't imagine anyone else in that part.  Renee Zellweger IS Bridget there is just no arguing it. No other actress could have pulled off what Renee did in this movie. Hugh Grant makes for an excellent Daniel who is completely two faced and has a smarmy sort of charm that makes you want him just as badly as Bridget does. Colin Firth is a superb Mark Darcy but that was a given because the character was practically written with him in mind  as all avid BJD readers know Mark Darcy's character is a play on the Mr. Darcy Firth portrayed in Pride and Prejudice.Some of the more hardcore fans of the book may be disappointed with all the missing jokes and scenes but to film the entire book would have left us with a 10 hour movie. The writers did an excellent job distilling the essence of the novel and the finished product has all the charm and wit of the original. The audience many of whom I'm sure have never read the book and many of whom surprisingly were male laughed nonstop throughout the film and everyone seemed to enjoy it thoroughly. As for those of us who have read it I do believe that this is one of those rare booktomovie jobs that was really spoton and everything that was noticeably changed in the process only makes the movie better.

	schema:headline " Corny but cute";
	schema:reviewBody "Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon.What really makes this movie stand out from a venerable list of other working girl fantasies is the familiar but oneofakind personality of the irrepressible Bridget Jones. Created by novelist Helen Fielding who also wrote the script and brought to life by the talented and zany Rene Zellweger Bridget Jones is a 32yearold pleasingly plump London working girl a ...verbally incontinent spinster who...dresses like her mother to quote Colin Firth's character Mark Darcy. She is also clumsy the kind of girl who might spill sauce on her blouse a little overweight smokes drinks too much and sometimes says what she thinks without consulting her brain. She is also very good at improvising on the spot a talent that charms not only the two leading men Hugh Grant and Colin Firth who vie for her affection but also the five o'clock news audience who like her bum and knickers just fine.Director Sharon Maguire in her first outing combines Brit witticisms slapstick pratfalls raunchy sharp and realistic dialogue and a blatant but inoffensive sentimentality into a romantic comedy that surely has Nora Ephron and Julia Roberts paying close attention. She keeps us guessing about who will get the girl and who really deserves the girl with the usual misdirections and misunderstandings characteristic of the genre.

Bridget's friends are funny as a kind of foil to the tired glamor of Yank TV's Friends. And there's a darling home movie sequence during the closing credits purporting to recall Bridget at four and Mark Darcy at eight that retrospectively and adorably frames the movie.Should a CHICK FLICK ALERT be declared here?

	onyx:emotionText "Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon.What really makes this movie stand out from a venerable list of other working girl fantasies is the familiar but oneofakind personality of the irrepressible Bridget Jones. Created by novelist Helen Fielding who also wrote the script and brought to life by the talented and zany Rene Zellweger Bridget Jones is a 32yearold pleasingly plump London working girl a ...verbally incontinent spinster who...dresses like her mother to quote Colin Firth's character Mark Darcy. She is also clumsy the kind of girl who might spill sauce on her blouse a little overweight smokes drinks too much and sometimes says what she thinks without consulting her brain. She is also very good at improvising on the spot a talent that charms not only the two leading men Hugh Grant and Colin Firth who vie for her affection but also the five o'clock news audience who like her bum and knickers just fine.Director Sharon Maguire in her first outing combines Brit witticisms slapstick pratfalls raunchy sharp and realistic dialogue and a blatant but inoffensive sentimentality into a romantic comedy that surely has Nora Ephron and Julia Roberts paying close attention. She keeps us guessing about who will get the girl and who really deserves the girl with the usual misdirections and misunderstandings characteristic of the genre.

	schema:reviewBody "As a huge fan of the books I had incredibly high expectations of the movie. In order for the movie to work for me it had to capture Bridget's pluckyheroine character and the hilariouspoignant emotions that are in the book.  Needless to say Bridget Jones's Diary' the movie worked very very very well.  Although Helen Fielding also wrote the screenplay w Richard Curtis very skilled with romantic comedies and keeps the laughs coming this movie could have fallen flat on its face.  But it doesn't because one the casting is absolutely divine and two smartly builds on some elements the book downplays.   Renee Zellweger is absolutely perfect as Bridget Jones.  She has always been one of my favorite actresses and here she totally displays Bridget's pathetic cuteness.  Zellweger gained weight for this role too so she looks adorably plump.  It's very very hard to not fall in love with her the moment you see her at her family's Christmas party or drinking alone at home or listening to sad Celine Dion music.  You have a heart of stone if you aren't moved to laughs or tears or pity for her.  I can't imagine anyone else playing Bridget Jones.  Zellweger fits the role because she is very much normal and approachablewe can relate to her.  As Daniel Cleaver her caddish Cassanova loverboss Hugh Grant is smoldering and hilarious.  Ok I might be a little biased because I've been in love with him for ages and ages but you can't deny he is a great comedic actor.  There's no trace of his stuttering that we saw and I loved in Four Weddings and a Funeral' or Sense and Sensibility.'  Grant morphs effortlessly into a cad that we all love to hate and all love to love.  Yes it's a paradox but that is what Grant brings to his role.  He makes being bad' look so sexy.  You can't take your eyes off him he brings his own humor to his role.  It's lovely smoldering and incredibly sexy. Colin Firth is also a delight to watch onscreen as Mark Darcy I think I might be in love with him too.  He is also sexy and smoldering but not in the same wild fiery way as Daniel Cleaver.  Firth brings a very cute sweetness to his role.  I don't know if it is his adorable face or his hair or the way he dresses or just the fact that he is a major sex symbol but you can't help but fall in love with him the MOMENT you see him onscreen. There is also one very beautiful moment where he tells Bridget I like you very muchjust the way you are.'  It's incredibly romantic and for me ranks right up there with Tom Cruise's You complete me' in Jerry Maguire.' He also has rather explosive chemistry with Renee Zellweger which is moving and sexy all at the same time.  And of course the author Helen Fielding used Colin Firth as the basis for Mark Darcy so it all works out marvelously. I also mentioned that the movie smartly builds on some elements that the book downplays.  Yes there are certain parts of the movie that cannot be found in the book but I'm still glad they put them in the movie.  Most of what they added doesn't necessarily build on plot but it does add to the characters.  I don't want to give anything away because it's rather hilarious what unfolds onscreen.  The movie is filmed in an almost Ally McBeal type of way but it remains true to the sincerity cuteness and pathetic naivete that Bridget Jones embodies.  There are no pretensions. It's an entirely wonderful film.   1010".

The three lead characters are just perfect. It is funny sweet at times sad at others and just wonderfully sexy and v. romantic especially the last 14th of it.Renee is so extraordinary as Bridget Jones who would have ever thought she could play so believable a modern Brit woman so well. Her accent seems flawless to me. Hugh Grant is hilarious and a charming Lothario throughout. But Colin Firth is who really sold me on this film. His ability to play a guy that you start out not liking but drooling over by the end of the movie is sublime.I am a big fan of the less is more style of acting that Mr. Firth puts forth in this film...much of his performance is in his eyes and his facial expressions. While Daniel Mr. Grant's character chatters on and on and tries to charm with his wit and words Mark Darcy Mr. Firth's character just has a strong and rather silent presence along with an integrity of character that is revealed and he wins us over as well as Bridget.This movie has a lot going on outside of the wonderful romance as well. Contemporary events gender inequities social differences work place decorum fashion selfimage sex family and friendship all come under the scrutiny of Bridget Jones and her diary.This is a very good adaptation of a beloved novel. The tone scene selection dialogue and characters capture the essence of what fans of the book love about it. I cannot imagine it any better cast or written.".

	schema:reviewBody "With certain bad movies  Plan 9 from Outer Space is a famous extreme example  you start to wonder if there's something wrong with people who don't realise that they're bad.  I'm not saying that if someone LIKES Plan 9 then his or her brain probably needs to be repaired the suspicious unhealthy thing is not LIKING the film but being of the opinion that it's good.  Many people have a soft spot for it precisely BECAUSE they realise how bad it is.  In this way it differs from something like Timecode where either liking the film OR having a high opinion of it is something to be embarrassed about.  And something similar applies to say Citizen Kane. Disliking it makes sense thinking it's a bad film does not.But there's another kind of film that tempts me to be even more presumptuous.  Dumbo is the best example I can think of at the moment.  I can see why one might mistakenly have a low opinion of Dumbo some of the footage IS mere padding the triumph at the end is too swift the charge has been laid falsely but not ludicrously that the crows are racist caricatures ... and so forth.  But surely even the people who think Dumbo is a bad film must still manage to like it.  If they don't THEN I'm suspicious.I feel this way to a greater or lesser degree about a number of light comedies and this is one of them.  I can't honestly say that I revere or adore Bridget Jones's Diary N.B. I'm male but all the same I can't help thinking that people who take an active dislike to it have something wrong with them.  This applies not just to the film as a whole but to Bridget Jones the central character in particular.  What has she done to merit dislike?  She's beautiful as beautiful as Rene Zellweger has ever been on screen honest and kindhearted.  The diary she keeps certainly reveals her many flaws but none is particularly pronounced most are purely negative and anyway she shares them all with the rest of us  so don't pretend you're not like this too.This is an amiable wellwritten and fresh romantic comedy with for ONCE an attractive female protagonist.  It's far from being the greatest film ever made and there may be grounds for attacking it which I haven't touched upon I suppose there always are and so all in all I'll understand your not thinking as much of it as I do but dammit you'd better LIKE it.".

And something similar applies to say Citizen Kane. Disliking it makes sense thinking it's a bad film does not.But there's another kind of film that tempts me to be even more presumptuous.  Dumbo is the best example I can think of at the moment.  I can see why one might mistakenly have a low opinion of Dumbo some of the footage IS mere padding the triumph at the end is too swift the charge has been laid falsely but not ludicrously that the crows are racist caricatures ... and so forth.  But surely even the people who think Dumbo is a bad film must still manage to like it.  If they don't THEN I'm suspicious.I feel this way to a greater or lesser degree about a number of light comedies and this is one of them.  I can't honestly say that I revere or adore Bridget Jones's Diary N.B. I'm male but all the same I can't help thinking that people who take an active dislike to it have something wrong with them.  This applies not just to the film as a whole but to Bridget Jones the central character in particular.  What has she done to merit dislike?  She's beautiful as beautiful as Rene Zellweger has ever been on screen honest and kindhearted.  The diary she keeps certainly reveals her many flaws but none is particularly pronounced most are purely negative and anyway she shares them all with the rest of us  so don't pretend you're not like this too.This is an amiable wellwritten and fresh romantic comedy with for ONCE an attractive female protagonist.  It's far from being the greatest film ever made and there may be grounds for attacking it which I haven't touched upon I suppose there always are and so all in all I'll understand your not thinking as much of it as I do but dammit you'd better LIKE it.";

She automatically assumes that firstdate sex is inevitable even before a relationship begins hence the underwear angst?  She cannot string two words together without babbling?I guess the thing that bothers me the most about this film though and people's glowing reactions to it is wondering what Bridget and Mark are going to talk about from now on.  I mean he's a top barrister with education money social standing and a variety of interests humanitarian and otherwise.  Bridget on the other hand seems to have no interests other than drinking smoking feeling sorry for herself and catching a man. She's not intelligent welleducated committed to anything or even with the prospect of being a viable supporting housewife.

This is a film for anyone over the age of 15 but honestly I think seeing as I'm not fifteen myself everyone will most probably love it. But I'll give you one piece of advice DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT watch it with your parents or grandparents because it will lead to utter embarrassment.The Storyline It's New Year's Day hung over and still single Bridget Jones a 30something year old journalist girl from Londondecides to start a great new life. And in order to do so she decides to keep a diary. Of which she rights down everything from her calories gained to her instant messaging with Daniel Cleaver her boss. She makes new years resolutions such as to stop smoking make better use of time and learn to programme video. It is a film like no other a masterpiece of great storytelling. As for the genreit is a Romantic Comedy which is very equally balanced which on one hand makes you feel very sorry for Bridget at times but on the other will leave you laughing uncontrollably. I mean come on how many films have you seen with a great storyline a love triangle and that can make you laugh till your ribs hurt? Now I think of it not many!Characters Mark Darcy the love of Bridget's life and Daniel Cleaver quite funnily enough also the love of Bridget's life are sworn enemies. Mark is a very upperclass sophisticated character. Who is sometimes very up himself. Daniel is the complete opposite he is a very laid back easygoing character. Jude Sharon and TomBridget's three best friends which give her some of the worst advice you can think of. But they do try to help TomThe main characterBridget is a working class girl slightly overweight or so she thinks. She is infatuated with Daniel before Mark comes along.Movie SoundtrackWell I can't say it has the best choice in music to be honest but its okay if you're into the whole complaining of heartache scene. But I suppose it goes well with the movie so I can get over that. On the other hand there are quite a few classics in the movie such as all by myself and without you.".

Life is frequently aimless and trivial and therein lies the movie's attraction.  Notwithstanding of course that this is a very funny and highly original comedy.Bridget played with considerable aplomb by Renee Zellweger belongs to the ranks of that modern phenomenon  the over30 unmarried career woman. Just when it seems Bridget may be destined for terminal spinsterhood two opposing forces enter her life  charming cad Daniel and uptight but very sexy lawyer Mark.  Which of the two is her Mr. Right?  And why does everyone insist on asking that question detested by all singletons  How's your love life going?  The movie's conclusion is predictable and although any other ending would leave the audience feeling cheated it does seem somewhat tame and ultimately unsatisfying.The film encourages the viewer both to get involved with Bridget emotionally and to laugh at her at the same time.  Perhaps the best joke is the milieu inhabited by her parents  where the minigherkin is the height of sophistication and 60yearolds throw garden parties with such alarming themes as 'tarts and vicars'.  Bridget is certainly no social butterfly and whilst we cringe at her public embarrassments notably her TV report involving a fireman's pole and a bottom the size of Brazil we triumph with her when she manages to turn a bad situation to her advantage.  Maybe we can recognise a little bit of Bridget Jones in all of us.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ransom is no ordinary kidnapping thriller. It's a tense and believable thrill ride where even the people who seem to be in control are in fact not. And they know it.Selfmade airline tycoon Tom Mullen Mel Gibson has it all a beautiful wife Rene Russo an intelligent young son Brawley Nolte and a thriving business. That's all about to change when his son is kidnapped. The FBI led by Lonnie Hawkins Delroy Lindo is on the case but after a mishap Tom loses confidence in their abilities to get his son back. Tom decides to turn the tables on the kidnappers he's offering the 2 million dollar ransom as a bounty for the kidnappers.The best thing about Ransom is that no one knows who's in control. Tom may be calling the shots but he's very aware that this gamble could end in disaster something that neither his wife Lonnie nor the kidnappers are happy about. However it also could turn in his favor the kidnappers know that this is an opportunity to get the whole ransom that they were going to split between them.Mel Gibson is one of the biggest names in Hollywood and for good reason not only is he very photogenic he's an effective performer. Mullen is a desperate man but taking risks is what he does best. Gibson is wellcast in the role. Rene Russo was the goto female star for mainstream movies but her career has fallen recently. While she's no Meryl Streep she's a good actress. She doesn't have the juiciest part but she's no mere housewife and Russo makes the most of it. I've never been a fan of Delroy Lindo his delivery seems pretty hammy in his performances and there's no reason why Lonnie couldn't have been played by someone better. Gary Sinise is good but too lowkey.Ron Howard started his career as a teenage actor but now he's one of the hottest directors in Hollywood. Howard knows how to make a movie. Ransom is suspenseful and unpredictable. It's efficiently made and involving. What more could one ask for? The only problem I have with the film is the ending. It's not what happens it's more or less inevitable but Howard obviously did it the way he did as a concession to the studios the last couple of minutes are so wildly improbable and over the top it destroys the taut level of suspense that has been built up.Nevertheless the majority of the film is well worth it.".

Gary Sinise now ranks as one of the most notorious villains after his role as Jimmy Shaker in Ransom one of the best performances I can remember in recent thriller history. Gibson lights up the screen and is backed by Ron Howard's brilliance and yet so few people appreciate his work. He has proved he can direct Apollo 13 A Beautiful Mind Splash and Ransom only solidifies this stance. Ransom will keep you on the edge of your seat for 2 hours culminating in a showdown between Gibson and Sinise that won't be soon forgotten. Also the lack of plot holes in the movie make it even more believable mostly because of the brilliance that is shown in its simplicity i.e. Gibson will go to any means possible to get his son back period. Check this movie out asap and do it justice by giving it a higher rating than 6.6!".

Rene Russo Outbreak Major League plays his wife.  Delroy Lindo Clockers Get Shorty plays the head FBI agent on the case.  Gary Sinise plays a New York cop.  Gibson soon starts to doubt the chances of the ransom working so he changes the ransom to a bounty on the kidnapper's head.  The film is welldirected by Ron Howard Apollo 13 Cocoon.  The story line is gripping and wellwritten.  Mel Gibson is excellent as the father.  Rene Russo and Gary Sinise are good in their roles.  Delroy Lindo delivers the best supporting performance he plays the agent very convincingly.  A suspenseful entertaining and overall great film. Rating R violence language".

	schema:reviewBody "Ransom is one of those films that defined the late 90s. With large budgets larger than life sets bigger stars and predictable situations Ransom demonstrates that overabundant Hollywood escapism. There was no worry that a Mel Gibson movie would flop  there was no concern that ticket prices would drive audiences away  there was no worries about putting 80 million dollars on the table because this had everything late90s cinema goers wanted to see with their popcorn and soda. This movie was melodramatic this gave audiences an evil guy that was loved in Forrest Gump and it kept us cool for nearly two hours. It had everything. This was a time of taking risks and pushing big names into theaters  now well and one could argue thankfully that recycled magic has gone. A film like this could not exist today. The safe nature of this film would be pushed aside for quirky camera footage younger actors and less tears with more violence. Audiences have changed and while I have grown up beyond the Ransom excitement I was feeling this lovehate relationship with this film. In 1996 when this film was being released I was first being introduced to cinema. I was going to theater at any opportunity I was being pulled into these lessthan spectacular situations and people like Gibson Sinise Russo and Howard were idols because of what they could accomplish on screen. But like any child I was pulled into the glamour the hype and the glitz while in retrospect the basics were being missed. Watching Ransom now thirteen years later it just doesn't seem like the type of film that deserved wide release. Watching this film today it felt more like a superimposed madeforTV movie than a blockbuster. To begin director Ron Howard was out of his element with this film. Apollo 13 Blackdraft Splash even Willow seems to be more nature based dramas so to feel him helming this violencebased drama it just felt staged and unfocused. In the director commentary Howard discusses how he attempted to use POV shots to convey the story and develop his characters and while the idea was present the execution just felt phony. The juggle between Gibson and Russo's perspective at times felt dizzy to the viewer. Yes the details around a kidnapped child have that effect it creates havoc for the viewer  ultimately missing stronger themes throughout. That isn't to say Howard didn't have some powerful shots with his cinematographer overall Ransom just missed the strength behind the camera. Then as if to overcompensate for this Howard allows his actors to overpower the screen with their overthetop characters. Gibson a wealthy airline tycoon goes from passive father to vengeful cynic a la Payback in a mere instant allowing  sadly  more drama to unfold between Russo and Sinise. Who was the central focus of this film? This is an excellent question for Mr. Howard as well as the cast. Is Gibson the main character? Is his child the main character or merely the developing plot? Is the wooden Delroy Lindo a major player or is Sinise just trying to keep up with Gibson's anger? Valid questions that alas cannot be answered by this film. Ransom attempts to bring too many twists and turns into an already filled suitcase and the end result is catastrophe. If this would have merely been a story about Gibson reacting to the capture of his son and Sinise never being revealed until the end then Ransom would have successfully accomplished with what it set out to do. The pivotal ending would have been more controlled and dramatic that this would have made this normal film stand proud. Instead Howard incorporates two family dramas together the Gibson family and the jumbled undeveloped Sinise family whom includes Lili Taylor Liev Schriber Evan Handler and Donnie Wahlberg. Again this would work well on paper if we would have the opportunity to see via each perspective but we do not even within the two hours. Therefore it becomes further unfocused and disruptive to the central conflict.Finally the last twenty minutes were mere fluff. Not to give away plot but it felt like it was placed there for those wishing Gibson would provide some much needed action to the screen. Nothing that developed nothing that revealed nothing that enhanced merely staged action for a drunk with Hollywood money audience. It was shameful.Overall I disliked Ransom. When I first began this review I was in a lovehate relationship but as I wrote I found more issues with this film. The lack of development between minor characters the entire Jackie Brown subplot was embarrassing and the scene in which Russo visits the church just wasted my time. The transitions between scenes and plots were lacking which I blame directly on Howard's inability to control what was happening. He had a strong focus but the execution is where it faltered. I do not see myself watching this film ever again  and ultimately will smile when seen on late night TV or in the dollar bin  that was the feel of Ransom.Grade  out of ".

	schema:reviewBody "A movie like Ransom is so preposterous and unbelievable it could only be made by a person like Ron Howard. From Opie to Happy Days to producing and directing Ron Howard has spent his entire life in a Hollywood bubble shielded from reality so when he tries to make a gritty realistic movie it comes out like this. The only thing that raises Ransom from a directtoDVD release starring Steven Seagal is the acting Mel Gibson Rene Russo Gary Sinise and the budget. The rest is crap not to mention it runs on for far too long.The story is a straightforward kidnapping tale and I'm sure the rest of the reviews here at IMDb have covered the basics. I'll cover the hallucinatory parts that Ron Howard thinks are real1 Gibson plays the owner of the fourth largest airline in the US. Yet he takes Sunday off with his wife and son to hang out at the NY City Kids Science Fair without security or an entourage. The idea that a guy who is busy running an airline he built himself would take an entire day off to waltz around a science fair with only his wife and kid is idiotic enough but to do so without security and assistants etc... takes this into the realm of fantasy.2 Gibson and his family went through an excruciating three month FBI investigation where Gibson's character was investigated for bribing a union official. Gibson confesses to the lead FBI agent covering the kidnapping that he is in fact guilty of the bribe and that he lied to cover it up. At the end of movie Gibson should be in jail but the career FBI officer doesn't do anything with the information except tell Gibson's wife.3 Gibson's character ignores his kid at the science fair which enables the kidnappers to grab the kid. Gibson lied to his wife about paying the bribe and put the entire family through a hellish FBI investigation. Now Gibson refuses to pay the ransom and seemingly places his kid in danger when everyone else is telling him to pay it. In the real world this would cause a lot of marital problems and might in fact lead to a divorce since Gibson has lied to wife about some serious issues and placed their child in extreme danger. Of course its a happy family at the end.3 Gibson's wife only has 500000 to her name despite being married to a billionaire for 20 years.4 Gibson goes on TV and offers a two million dollar bounty on the kidnappers which he later raises to four million. Now in the real world this reason this doesn't happen is because its against the law to offer money for someone's death. Again the moment after he made those threats Gibson should be in jail. In Ron Howard land nothing happens.5 The kidnapper who is smart enough to plan and pull off the kidnapping is stupid enough at the end of the movie to walk into Gibson's home to collect the reward despite knowing that Gibson's kid would recognize him since the kid has heard his voice. 'Nuff said this movie was garbage.".

But his son is taken from him so Tom contacts the FBI. Sent to assist him is the same agentDelroy Lindo who investigated Gibson on a prior Bribery accusation involving his company.  The Kidnappers demand Ransom but the drop is botched when the FBI intervenes.  Now Gibson is forced to face the hard fact that he may never get his son back and decides to take an unthinkable gamble!TO THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE The most emotional scene I have ever scene is just after Shaker fires the Gun at Tom's son. The Gibson and Russo interaction on the Balcony was amazing.  I was also very pleased with the Depth Lindo and the Screenplay gave his character. You see his willingness to Manipulate Tom and his wife to save their son. But his straight forward comment to Tom about possibly using his comments against him during Tom's Bribery's confession shows his Character's character.  The movie often forced me to Empathize with these people and their plight shoving me face first into each moment. Even the crew of kidnappers felt real.  Although they were the bad guys they weren't made out to be the embodiment of evil they were human corrupted regular people. Howard as director did exactly as he should have he made you forget you were watching a movie!  No matter how many times I watch this it always entertains and impresses me.".

The fact that it also shows the kidnappers is what makes this movie even more tense actually.I'm sorry but I just can't stand Rene Russo in this movie. Her character really irritated me at times. Best actor is Gary Sinise who was really 'hot' in the mid90's ever since his Oscar nomination for one of my personal favorite movie's Forrest Gump. It was also nice to see the at the time fairly unknown actor Donnie Wahlberg who also did a good job.The music by James Horner is good still I'm curious about the original Howard Shore score.Yes the movie has some good moments and is perfectly watchable but it most certainly is not Ron Howard's or Mel Gibson's best. It also is not a movie that I enjoy watching multiple times. Also the original from 1956 is still a better movie even if it doesn't have action or a spectacular ending.

	schema:headline " Great psychological gamesmanship";
	schema:reviewBody "This is my favorite film of all time I've probably seen it 50 times. Gibson plays the part of a self made airline owner whose son is kidnapped by NYPD detective gone bad Gary Sinise. After a bungled ransom drop Gibson realizes if he pays the ransom demanded his son will be killed. He attempts to the turn the table on Sinise by offering the ransom amount as a bounty on Sinise's head which Gibson will withdraw if Sinise releases his son. I love the psychological battle between Gibson and Sinise as each battles to establish dominance over each other and of the situation. In what I would call the climactic scene of the movie the direction and writing are about the best I've ever seen on celluoid. Gibson has a final 90 second phone call with Sinise. Sinise offers proof of life by allowing the kidnapped son to say Daddy into the phone. He then offers one last chance for Gibson to withdraw the bounty and pay the ransom. Gibson refuses and the camera pans back to Sinise who points his gun in the direction of Gibson's son and fires. The next 60 seconds consists of jumping to reaction shots of all the main players  the audience is not sure if the son is alive or not. The drama in this scene is overwhelming.After this climactic scene  the movie winds up about a half hour later with an action packed ending.".

Not exactly something new storywise but it keeps your attention for the full two hours. Mel Gibson Rene Russo Deroy Lindro Gary Sinise Lily Taylor Liev Schreiber and Donnie Wahlberg make for a deep and talented cast.The action wasn't overdone and the story was a very involving one.

	schema:reviewBody "Ransom is an excellent intense movie with a strong cast a great script and an excellent director all rolled up into one. The film was released on November 8 1996 from Touchstone Pictures and in my opinion was one of the best films of 1996. The film stars Mel Gibson as Tom Mullen a wealthy businessman who runs an airline company which is the fourth highest airline in the world. He's married to his wife Kate played by Rene Russowho was great in Tin Cup and Lethal Weapon 4. They have everything in the world that they wanted but it all crashes when their son Sean played by Brawley Noltereal life son of Nick Nolte is kidnapped by NYC detective Jimmy Shaker played by Gary Sinese. Shaker wants 2 million dollars in cash with 50's and 100's and no marked bills or Sean will die. The cat and mouse game begins between Tom and Jimmy. Tom cooperates with FBI and it's leader Agent Lonnie Hawkins played by Delroy Lindowho was awesome in Malcom X and good in Romeo Must Die as Aaliyah's Father. The Mullens will do anything to get their son even if they kills them to do it. Jimmy has put together a group of young guns to hold Sean hostage. Jimmy's girlfriend Maris Conner is the tough chick and was Tom's caterist at his parties. Lili Taylor plays Maris and also there's the Barnes brothers Clark and Cubby played by Liev Schriber and Donnie Walberg of New Kids on the Block and Boomtown. also there's Evan Handler as Miles who's involved as well. The film caught me from the beginning to the end. I really liked the ending in which Gibson and Sinese have a great confrontation towards the end and you won't believe it. The film is excellent and exicting throughout. Gibson gives an excellent as Tom Mullen i think he deserved an Oscar Nomination for his great performance. Russo was terrific as the wife who's afraid for Gibson and the fear for her son. Sinese was amazing as the conniving sneaky slimy and unfaithful cop who kidnaps young Sean Mullen. Sinese puts up great performances throughout his career including Forrest Gump Snake Eyes Mission to Mars Apollo 13 and George Wallace. Lindo is good as Hawkins Taylor was a mainstay as Conner and the cast Schriber Walhberg Handler and the young Brawley Nolte all were great in their roles. I recommend watching this film you'll absolutely love it. Ron Howard did an excellent job directing this film. He was also great in directing Apollo 13 Parenthood Cocoon and A Beautiful Mind. Overall Ransom is a 2 hour 1 mintue fun ride that will take your breath away and leave you out of your seat begging for more.By Gerald P. Garrow 15031010  Excellent".

A couple of fairly deep issues are dealt with such as eating disorders and depression but other than a few moments all we are doing is watching a family live their life a strong hardworking mother Alison Steadman a weaker easilyled by his mates father Jim Broadbent and their twin daughters Natalie Claire Skinner  resourceful and kindhearted but with a strange tendency to wear men's shirts and down pints  and Nicola Jane Horrocks  screwed up rude irrational and painfully insecure in both her looks and her intelligence.The performances brought out by this form of filmmaking are superb  as they are in all of Leigh's movies Secrets  Lies Career Girls and All Or Nothing are all worthy of viewing but especially Secrets  Lies. However Alison Steadman is the standout perhaps for no other reason than she has the most screen time the driving force that brings all the family together. The scene in which she finally cracks and loses that nervous laugh to tell Nicola a few home truths and break down the barriers that Nicola has put up between herself and the rest of the world is so beautifully written and terrifically performed that it is a shame that Steadman in particular was not Oscarnominated.Only one or two criticisms struck me. One was a slight lack of development of the other daughter. What exactly DOES make her tick? Am I merely stereotyping by assuming she is supposed to be a lesbian? Or is she just happy being so masculine in her dresssense and mannerisms  she isn't even offended by a client who calls her a 'good lad'? We never find out because the film focuses a little more on her sister. It certainly appears that her mother suspects her daughter of being gay but for some reason the subject is never brought up.Similarly a couple of loose ends are never tied up. The caravan and the restaurant in particular. But I guess we have the prerogative to make our own endings up haven't we so that's a good thing in many ways.I think at the end of the day people will either like all of Mike Leigh's films or none of them. And I'm in the former group. His work is beautiful and always touching.".

Their two daughters are like chalk and cheese Natalie a plumber is quiet and practical I thought she was a boy at first hers is a curiously unsexed character while Nicola is a complete mess.The ugliness of true life is shown beside its mundane beauty.  The shocking scenes of Nicola's selftorture she is a secret bulimic are juxtaposed with scenes of the mother dusting and the ordinary cheerfulness of the rest of the family.  A bizarre family friend Aubrey and his dream of running his own restaurant provide a subplot of sorts but the domestic drama is far more interesting.Horricks gives a startling good performance as the disturbed Nicola she drips with selfloathing but inspires pity. The most poignant scene is one in which her boyfriend no Einstein himself becomes fed up with her intense sexual demands and asks her to prove her intelligence by having a real conversation with him.  Nicola whom we know is intelligent cannot bring herself to do this she is compelled to always show herself in the worst light.  She can only mutter 'I AM intelligent' in a voice of despair.  The boyfriend departs leaving her in a state of even more intense selfhatred and depression.  It is hardhitting scenes like this one which stick in the memory.The mother Wendy who appears a scatterbrain at first emerges as a dignified wise and compassionate woman as she responds in a touching scene to her troubled daughter Nicola.It's such a plainlooking film yet it is striking because of the intensity of its characters and the honesty of director Mike Leigh's observations. Although life is hard for the family it is also sweet. That I think is Leigh's message.".

He takes us through 5 days in the life of a London family Jim Broadbent Alison Steadman and their twin daughters Claire Skinner and Jane Horrox.  What follows is by turns touching hilarious and unsettling. Leigh is often compared to Ken Loach but Loach deals with unspeakably grim and often melodramatic scenarios. The far more impressive gift of Leigh is to make tales from the apparently unremarkable. So many touches run true here Steadman doing a little dance to herself alone in the kitchen Broadbent and Stephen Rea drunkenly reciting the Spurs Double side Skinner describing an arthritic old woman met on her plumbing round. And the tragedy of the film is also unveiled naturally and feels horribly believable.The performances are also astonishing. Broadbent and Steadman both distinctive actors can descend into parody but here are just hugely enjoyable. Skinner is nicely deadpan but the star is Horrox playing a twitching wreck of a girl who mainly communicates in one word insults. Little wonder she's been given so many chances to prove her talents subsequently just a shame she's never taken them. The only false note is Tim Spall as a manic chef. Perhaps that's because he's simply put in for comic value he was far better in Leigh's 'Secrets and Lies' his character given none of the depth which lights up the rest of the film.".

And the tragedy of the film is also unveiled naturally and feels horribly believable.The performances are also astonishing. Broadbent and Steadman both distinctive actors can descend into parody but here are just hugely enjoyable. Skinner is nicely deadpan but the star is Horrox playing a twitching wreck of a girl who mainly communicates in one word insults. Little wonder she's been given so many chances to prove her talents subsequently just a shame she's never taken them. The only false note is Tim Spall as a manic chef. Perhaps that's because he's simply put in for comic value he was far better in Leigh's 'Secrets and Lies' his character given none of the depth which lights up the rest of the film.";

	schema:reviewBody "Mike Leigh is one of the true independent auteurs in the British film industry and one of the few major British directors who has not allowed himself to be seduced away by Hollywood. His films generally based on modern urban English workingclass or middleclass life concentrate more on character than on action and have a very distinctive style which arises out of his equally distinctive method of working based upon allowing a story to emerge through improvisation rehearsals and discussions with his cast before shooting actually begins. He generally uses a select group of actors including Jim Broadbent Timothy Spall and his onetime wife Alison Steadman.Broadbent Spall and Steadman all appear in Life Is Sweet a comedy based upon the lives of a family from the North London suburb of Enfield father Andy mother Wendy and their 22yearold twin daughters Natalie and Nicola. Andy works as a chef but hates his job and harbours ambitions of running his own business. He has bought a dilapidated fastfood van which at some unspecified future date he intends to clean and restore in order to start up a fastfood business but has not taken any further steps towards realising his goal. Another major character is Andy's friend Aubrey another chef who has taken his own entrepreneurial ambitions a stage further by opening his own French restaurant named The Regret Rien after the Edith Piaf song.Like a number of British filmmakers from the eighties and early nineties Leigh made his films from an essentially leftwing position and was critical of the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher. Life is Sweet which appeared in the last year of her premiership can be seen as a veiled satire on the cult of the entrepreneur which flourished under Thatcherism and on the tendency to see business both big and small as the sole key to national success. The characters of Andy and Aubrey are well contrasted. Andy is a competent chef but lacks the drive to become a successful independent businessman his ambitions never seem to amount to much more than vague daydreams. As Wendy says he has two speeds slow and stop.Aubrey by contrast is a man whose inordinate faith in his own abilities is matched only by an incompetence which will surely doom his business career to failure. Much of the humour derives from the bizarre nouvelle cuisine dishes he takes a perverse pleasure in devising. Saveloy on a bed of lychees anyone? When Aubrey's business does not work out as well as he hoped he takes refuge in alcohol.The film is as much about Andy's home life as his work life if not more so. His two daughters although twins are completely unlike both in looks and in character. Natalie crophaired and chunky is a tomboy who works as a plumber and spends her leisure time playing pool and drinking with her male workmates. Nicola who is unemployed is extremely thin a sufferer from bulimia and a chainsmoker. Whereas Natalie is relatively placid Nicola is neurotic bitter foultempered and much given to hurling abuse at her family and acquaintances. She claims to believe in various leftwing causes capitalist! is her favourite insult for her father because of his business ambitions but never does anything active to further them. Natalie does not appear to have any romantic interests in her life none of her male drinking chums count as boyfriends and although some have seen her as a stereotypically butch lesbian she has no girlfriends either. Nicola by contrast has an active sex life although a rather odd one she likes her rather reluctant boyfriend to smear chocolate spread over her chest.The two acting performances which really stand out come from Spall as Aubrey a brilliant comic creation and Jane Horrocks as Nicola an equally brilliant tragicomic one. The film is however really an good example of ensemble acting and there are also great contributions from Steadman as Wendy and Broadbent as Andy.With its general theme of frustrated ambition and a character as unbalanced as Nicola Life is Sweet could easily have been made as a tragedy. Yet that title is not meant ironically. Leigh might not be a largeC Conservative but this film suggests that he is a smallc conservative when it comes to family values and the film is very much about family life. For all their eccentricities the family at the centre of Life is Sweet is not intended to be portrayed as a dysfunctional one. It is a family that functions although in ways that outsiders might perceive as strange. The sensible steadfast Wendy and Andy who beneath some surface peculiarities is a deeply caring man have an unconditional love for their daughters. They are prepared to make allowances for Nicola's behaviour which is the result of emotional insecurities rather than spitefulness or malevolence. We don't hate you! We bloody love you you stupid girl! We learn that Wendy got pregnant with the twins as an unmarried teenager but refused to have an abortion because of a belief in the sanctity of life.After all the storms the film ends on a note of calm and hopefulness. This is one of the most distinctive and one of the best British social comedies from the early nineties. 810".

	schema:headline " The kind of life I want...to observe";
	schema:reviewBody "Life is Sweet is a deeply moving tough sliceoflife served on the grandiose platter that is cinema. It's a rich little film centered around an incredibly dysfunctional working class family just north of London residing in a congested yet heavilydecorated home. The family is made up of hardworking and ambitious father Andy Jim Broadbent playful and often whiny mother Wendy Alison Steadman determined and introverted adolescent Natalie Claire Skinner and her sarcastic often patronizing twin Nicola Jane Horrocks.Writerdirector Mike Leigh follows this dysfunctional bunch rarely orchestrating a frame that isn't fixated on one of the family members. Through the limitless realms of conversational intimacy and quietly effective filmic poetry he allows his characters to talk openly and frequently rather than handing them a contrived plot to work off of. Leigh's style is an incredible one. He takes his actors provides them with an outline for specific scenes and allows them to improvise and bounce ideas of one another so as to squeeze all the possibilities out of a certain scene and setting. When Leigh and his tight knit band of actors are ready shooting will commence.Through this tactic Leigh allows for a rare and unfortunately underrated style of intimacy to prevail. The first fifteen minutes of Life is Sweet provided me with an unparalleled depiction of rapidfire conversation that I have gone far too long without seeing. This style comes from everyone in the family who respond just quick and spontaneous enough for realism to triumph over drivel and just naturalistic enough to sound authentic and as if they're making the material up on the dime which they relatively did. The gifted improvisationist on hand here is Horrocks playing a deeply troubled girl who doesn't know what she wants or what direction she is going in life and her only vice is to attack her family members and acquaintances in a demonizing meanspirited way. However this character is not contemptible at least to us as we see her insecurity and burdened attitude from a human standpoint rather than one where our response almost seems to giggle and mimic her behavior. To combat her family's conventional sense of behavior and the world around her Horrocks' Nicola uses buzzwords and names she willfully takes out of context. Fascist! she screams at her mother after she disapproves of her daughter's actions. One can only admire her cute little resistance and opposition to authority for what it is. Her defense mechanism is taking everything regardless of how genial and wellmeaning it is and using it as an insult or a demeaning remark from somebody ostensibly in an higher position than she is. Despite this her character has the ability to potentially relate to other members of the audience probably moreso than any other character in this film and they all can be pretty damn relatable.A subplot involves a rolypoly pudgy man named Aubrey Timothy Spall a good friend of this dysfunctional family who plans on opening a restaurant downtown serving unique and somewhat daring cuisines. Spall plays a character fit for a farce and at first seems to be Leigh's attempt to steer this project away from heights too depressing and offputting. However Leigh finds ways to get this character to fit in perfectly with this dark and often bleak material offering a slapstick force to the story that isn't too overbearing or nauseating and tiresome. Leigh writes a difficult character effectively and Spall musters up an ample amount of energy and drive to play the character beautifully. The cinematography by Dick Pope who would later go on to do Oscar winning cinematographical work in The Illusionist along with similar work in Richard Linklater's Bernie is also a sight for sore eyes here combining an array of soft colors with the tenderness of the London atmosphere. Brought into wonderful conjunction with Leigh's astute framing  which occasionally turns daring by narrowing itself in setting to small rooms and through open doorways  the appearance of the film is comparable to the style of independent auteur Wes Anderson. It's touching and a beautiful inclusion to a welltold story.Ultimately Life is Sweet is characterheavy and that's its best attribute. Because of its deeprooted investments in six very intriguing people it allows its themes and story to hit notes of actual working class life. These same characters could be thrown in a belittling film that either relies too heavily on self referential trite or nonsensical antics but instead sees them as easilybreakable souls through a lens of considerable warmness. I loved Life is Sweet almost as much as my own life  and without the context of this review that line would seem like a hopeless line of overpraise.NOTE Two important sidenotes I felt would feel awkward included in my review one Life is Sweet is available on DVD and BluRay through The Criterion Collection a too often overlooked film distribution company outside of the film community that is committed to releasing American film works of considerable quality and significance along with exceptional films of the world. They've released yet another masterful film that may've gone unseen had they not exist.The other note I have is a question to viewers about Wendy the mother of the picture. Throughout the film I noticed her hair turn gray specifically during the scene when her and Nicola have a meaningful hearttoheart. I'm curious  is her hair dyed for effect or a result or breakneck improvisation?Starring Jim Broadbent Alison Steadman Claire Skinner Jane Horrocks Stephen Rea Timothy Spall David Thewlis and Moya Brady. Directed by Mike Leigh.".

Obviously the film is not memorable enough to receive a similar reputation as other Leigh movies such as Naked or Secrets  Lies but thanks to the interesting acting as well as Mike Leigh's restrained thoughtful and inspired directing Life Is Sweet still appears as a pleasant surprise.The dysfunctional family which is portrayed at the heart and center of this little film is portrayed by Alison Steadman who gives a really good performance almost reminiscent of the fabulous Brenda Blethyn in Secrets  Lies Jim Broadbent who hadn't become an established supporting figure of cinema at that point except for minor roles in Brazil and Superman IV Claire Skinner and Jane Horrocks the latter of both a truly stunning surprise with her fascinating acting. The cast also includes Stephen Rea Timothy Spall and David Thewlis. The outcome of this collection of talented performers is a very moving drama a glimpse into the life of a number of characters whose lives most of us would like to observe but wouldn't like to live ourselves. At least I wouldn't to be perfectly honest.This film most likely will not change the lives of those who watch it especially not today almost thirty years after it was filmed and released but it is a great little gem from a filmmaker who can easily be counted among the best directors working today. Leigh's films have always been characterdriven and that has always been their greatest strength they work for the viewer as long as they are prepared to engage themselves with the protagonists of the film as long as they are not turned off by the sheer alienation they might feel while watching these everyday situations. Most of the negative comments for this film were written by people who felt bored by the movie and didn't see any reason to watch people whose lives don't appear to have a significant purpose but they failed to understand that this is exactly the point of the film. Ultimately you should watch it if you enjoy witnessing brilliant acting or if you just want to experience a peculiar little look into the lives of a strange little family. It's a bizarre film and quite difficult to access because it's rather hard to relate to the main characters but it's also a beautiful little gem and worth the time spent with it.".

	schema:headline " The right movie for the wrong audience";
	schema:reviewBody "It's a pity this movie failed at the box office because in my opinion it's really good. It combines combines the classic dystopic scifi future with a scorched Earth a few heroes struggling against enigmatic aliens and a corrupt military force action style sequences that are at times quite intense and the typical slowpaced Asian movie storytelling. Add to this a rich amount of influences from the FF games including eight mysterious spirits that must be found in time or the heroine will succumb as well as a lot of mythological references that must be taken for granted rather than analysed to bits if the viewer is to find any pleasure in this film.The trouble is that the FF video game fans wanted a story based on the games or on their particular favourite in the series and were disappointed with both the story the setting and the characters. The average scifi movie fan though who ought to have loved the wicked general excellently voicecast by James Woods and his huge space cannon as well as the 'Aliens' styled surroundings and technology was put off by all the talk about spirits and world souls. Leaving for a few of us who went to see the film with no real expectations to enjoy it.Because it is a good film. The animation is for the most part excellent even if some scenes have a too blatant 'look what we can do' boast to them. Particularly all the scenes of Aki's hair waving in the wind. Personally I didn't think the story was either too slowpaced nor too weird. It works well especially if you like Asian movies. For the European and American market though there's probably not enough action and too much talking.If this movie had been released this year it would probably have been given a better reception. The thought of fully computer animated films isn't as new and strange anymore and with films like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon The Ring and Hero the west is opening up for the Asian way of telling stories. I hope to see more films like this at least if they are this well made. 910".

	onyx:emotionText "It's a pity this movie failed at the box office because in my opinion it's really good. It combines combines the classic dystopic scifi future with a scorched Earth a few heroes struggling against enigmatic aliens and a corrupt military force action style sequences that are at times quite intense and the typical slowpaced Asian movie storytelling. Add to this a rich amount of influences from the FF games including eight mysterious spirits that must be found in time or the heroine will succumb as well as a lot of mythological references that must be taken for granted rather than analysed to bits if the viewer is to find any pleasure in this film.The trouble is that the FF video game fans wanted a story based on the games or on their particular favourite in the series and were disappointed with both the story the setting and the characters. The average scifi movie fan though who ought to have loved the wicked general excellently voicecast by James Woods and his huge space cannon as well as the 'Aliens' styled surroundings and technology was put off by all the talk about spirits and world souls. Leaving for a few of us who went to see the film with no real expectations to enjoy it.Because it is a good film. The animation is for the most part excellent even if some scenes have a too blatant 'look what we can do' boast to them. Particularly all the scenes of Aki's hair waving in the wind.

	schema:reviewBody "Wow I guess there is SOME hope for video game adaptations. While not a direct translation of the Final Fantasy video game franchise it is written by the series creator whose name I cannot remember. On top of that his video game company branched off into a film company Square Pictures just to go and make this movie. At least one can't complain about the handling of the material.But the big question here is Do these guys know anything about filmmaking? Maybe. Maybe not. Truth be told they don't need to. The beauty of this movie is that it does something new. It blends the world of video game technology and storytelling with the art of filmmaking. It cuts corners on filmmaking but its uniqueness makes up for it. I will admit that I'm a gamer so I appreciate what was attempted here. What we get out of this movie is an impressive display of what animators and video game technology can do together. I know there are other CGI movies out there but unless I am mistaken they have all followed the overthetop cartoony path. This is where Final Fantasy stands out. The animation is swelling with reality. From a technical standpoint this is a gem and a reason at the least to give it a rent.The storyline is subject to much scrutiny though. It's not for everybody. This IS a film of Japanese origin so anime fans will be right at home with it. For the mainstream audience however that remains to be decided. Although the script was revised to suit North American localization and done very well might I add it still is very Japanese in style albeit with a bit less surrealism. It's fastpaced and a bit abstract at times but it is coherent.In the end I would say that one should rent this just to see the technological achievement at the least. It's safe to say that all would agree with that point. Depending on the person you may get into the storyline as well. Either way you'll walk away with at least part of you satisfied.".

I was drawn to this film because of the bold animations but didn't expect the film to do anything for me beyond simple entertainment. I was pleasantly surprised. The excellent voice talent and stunning animation allow Final Fantasy to drawn you in just as well as a liveaction version would have. It is very easy to forget that the characters you are watching are animations and the action is CGI.A meteor has struck the earth carrying with it phantoms who strip away the life energy of whomever they contact. Dr. Aki Ross and her mentor Dr. Ced are locked in a standoff against the earth's military forces whose solution to this invasion may be worse than the invasion itself and the mysterious phantoms who seem to have no specific purpose and can not be fought using conventional means. Following up on a quasimystical theory of Dr. Ced they set out to collect 8 living spirits which must be used to harness the life force of earth itself in defense of the planet.This film is dark and beautiful with each scene a masterpiece of animated art. It feels less like a computer game than an immersive experience in an alternative universe.A fastpaced action film Final Fantasy blends elements of folklore science and animated battle sequences into a satisfying well balanced and well paced film. It is probably the most thoughtful computer game inspired film I have seen.".

The main reasons people have dogged it is because they don't follow the plot and they don't think the animation looks real enough.I did not have any problem following the plot. The second word in Final Fantasy is a description of the type of movie this is. It deals with the supernatural. The spirits or essences of earth are gathered to fight the alien gaia as the arms and weapons used against the alien spirits are ineffective and in fact destructive.This movie introduced me to the concept of the gaia which I believe is a great metaphor for understanding how all life on earth shares a common spirit. I don't truly believe there is a gaia and you don't need to either to enjoy this film. But perhaps some found that this conflicted too much with their beliefs.Now as far as the animation this is the most realistic portrayal of human characters to date generated by a computer. If you watch some anime films where there is a lot of action they will show a frame for a long time with only the mouths moving. People enjoy these animations. Then why is this movie criticized so heavily for not looking real enough? It's rather ironic. You should watch this movie expecting an animation not a fullfeature film with real actors.One explanation for this reaction is that like figures in a wax museum characters that look too real but are not creep us out because they remind us of dead people. But perhaps this is fitting for this movie because the soul of the earth is sick and life on the planet is reaching its end.In any case I enjoyed this movie and I liked the message.

	schema:reviewBody "I've waited for this one for quite a while as have most of Square's fans. There is a lot riding on this film including the future direction of CG in movies the proud heritage of a name brand and the chance to release a worthwhile movie during a string of bad summer flicks.  So does Final Fantasy live up to it's hype?Mostly.First the bad.  No it has nothing to do with the games other than name but then the majority of the storylines of the games had nothing to do with each other either.  The plot is not necessarily original with marauding aliens nearly vanquishing humanity while a desperate band of outsiders hold the key to winning tired scifi to be sure and even the animation has it's faults mostly with the mouth movements and a few emotions lacking as the eyes and lips and even hair had detail but noone's cheeks or throats moved giving the characters a bit of a puppetry feel at times.  The movement of humans in CG is still not quite fluid but getting much better. Also the movie slows down considerably during the last twenty or thirty minutes which is perhaps necessary for the plot but the change in pace was notable even with the awe that the movie's end was aspiring too.But enough nitpicking.The Good.  The imagery in this movie is startling imaginative complex even awesome at times.  It's amazing that while the machines vehicles and mechanics in the movie are so realistic and detailed so too are the organic forms such as the alien presence sometimes seemingly more fluidly animated than the humans! and the incredible landscapes.  It is obvious how much imagination went in to so many aspects of this movie.  The soundtrack while not exceptional is very complimentary and captures the dark feel with the fast action and triumphant climaxes.  The characters were distinct likeable and voiced very well even if the digital mouths don't quite match up most of the time.  The emotional scenes while certainly not perfect and a bit awkward should be given grand credit for achieving the level they do convey.  If you let yourself go it's not impossible to be entranced by all that this movie actually manages to pull off.  If nothing else then the effects alone are worth seeing if the somewhat hokey spiritual elements of the plot turn you off.  If you consider the Force to be hokey don't bother.The Surprising.  Well I was a bit put off by the simplistic way the characters would look at each situation and then spell it out to the audience though there is more to the plot than casual scifi fare. Because of this the dialogue was a bit goofy at times but at least it usually fit the characters.  But every good thing you've heard about the quality of the CG work in this movie is true it really is a site to behold if nothing else than for the effects.  As I mentioned earlier if you consider how much this movie is trying to do it's amazing that it pulled off everything nearly as well as it does.So I think that most will be pleased some will critique it heavily on the negatives and not be as impressed but the bottom line is that it is definitely worth seeing.  Quality work in most areas even story and screenplay in my opinion though that's certainly the most debatable point. I left the theater without being disappointed something I cannot say for the majority of cinema fare.".

Also the movie slows down considerably during the last twenty or thirty minutes which is perhaps necessary for the plot but the change in pace was notable even with the awe that the movie's end was aspiring too.But enough nitpicking.The Good.  The imagery in this movie is startling imaginative complex even awesome at times.  It's amazing that while the machines vehicles and mechanics in the movie are so realistic and detailed so too are the organic forms such as the alien presence sometimes seemingly more fluidly animated than the humans! and the incredible landscapes.  It is obvious how much imagination went in to so many aspects of this movie.  The soundtrack while not exceptional is very complimentary and captures the dark feel with the fast action and triumphant climaxes.  The characters were distinct likeable and voiced very well even if the digital mouths don't quite match up most of the time.  The emotional scenes while certainly not perfect and a bit awkward should be given grand credit for achieving the level they do convey.  If you let yourself go it's not impossible to be entranced by all that this movie actually manages to pull off.  If nothing else then the effects alone are worth seeing if the somewhat hokey spiritual elements of the plot turn you off.  If you consider the Force to be hokey don't bother.The Surprising.  Well I was a bit put off by the simplistic way the characters would look at each situation and then spell it out to the audience though there is more to the plot than casual scifi fare. Because of this the dialogue was a bit goofy at times but at least it usually fit the characters.  But every good thing you've heard about the quality of the CG work in this movie is true it really is a site to behold if nothing else than for the effects.  As I mentioned earlier if you consider how much this movie is trying to do it's amazing that it pulled off everything nearly as well as it does.So I think that most will be pleased some will critique it heavily on the negatives and not be as impressed but the bottom line is that it is definitely worth seeing.  Quality work in most areas even story and screenplay in my opinion though that's certainly the most debatable point. I left the theater without being disappointed something I cannot say for the majority of cinema fare.";

	schema:reviewBody "This movie isn't a paramount to the 7th art but it certainly broke some new ground. I expected a lot in the animation department and I was pleased with what I saw. Being based on a video game prepped me for a rather unconventional and perhaps lame plot.Firstly the animation the use of realistic CG characters by this movie is good most of the movement of the animated people was very good except for a bit of problems with speaking and expressions you can also tell that the animators learned how to make the characters walk as they made the movie the walk during the first 20 minutes especially at the beginning is noticeably stiff. It gets better as the movie wears on though. The detail level of vehicles and scenery is superb you can even see dust falling as the light streams in a window this gives you an idea of how detailed it can be. Second story line not too original while not the best sci fi out there by a long shot it still has a decent if somewhat complex story line which is hard to follow at times. It borrows heavily from typical anime plots with the biblical and mythological references the mystic stuff and so on however what else can you expect. The ending is typical of anime so it seems that the animators and writers themselves still regarded this as animation and weren't trying to make it a true movie. It also borrows from well tried elements like the military commander bent of the use of force over logic but as an animation it sure eats up disney's childish plots.Summing up this movie is worth watching for the animation a second watching will also probably clear up some things in the plot it gives a good idea as to what to expect from future animation and sets a new standard. I came out of the theater with a sensation of money well spent and I'll probably watch it again not my favorite of all time but certainly decent.".

What I want to complain about are the characters themselves.They are FLAT.A lot of them die and we don't miss them except that they don't speak any more lines.

Oh and by the way there's almost no 'fantasy' elements in this movie with the sole exception of the Spirits.My two favorite games in the Final Fantasy series are numbers Eight and Ten. They are my favorites because they have unique interesting convincing characters.  True most Final Fantasy games take 40 hours or more to play giving the writers a lot of time to flesh the characters out but generally within the first five minutes of being introduced to a character sometimes within the first few SECONDS as with Zell and Kimahri you know most or all there is to know about themthey are already convincing already realized in the player's mind.  Square's GOOD at doing that sort of thing.If Square had bothered to invent real characters for Final Fantasy The Spirits Within the movie would have SOARED.  As it is it just barely limps along under the power of a few snappy lines of dialogue and a lot of pretty vistas.It's worth seeing once for the same reason any museum is worth visiting onceyou'll get to see things you've never seen before and may not see again.

	schema:reviewBody "This film has so little going for it it's a wonder I'm even rating it. With each subsequent viewing I am becoming more and more disillusioned with Final Fantasy The Spirits Within. It is an affront to nature.The film is supposedly based on the video game series of the same title but in truth I can see nothing which connects the two. A common thread throughout the game series I think there are 11 games now is that each one takes place in a completely different world with new characters and I can therefore see no reason apart from marketing purposes to even call this film Final Fantasy.I'm left cold be this movie. It has no heart whatsoever. Everything is formulaic and lifeless. To be honest I'm actually left wondering why it was even made. Actually no I'm not I know exactly why it was made it's a technology demo. Well then way to go Square Pictures! You managed to prove that you can create semiconvincing computer animation via motion capture that looks realistic. Remind me what the point of this was when you could just have shot it in live action anyway. Seriously why animate something when you can get the same effect and cheaper by doing it in live action? I'll tell you why because if this were a live action film it would be condemned as complete rubbish. Sadly because it is completely CGI many critics have been wowed by its impressive visuals... including Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper who felt compelled to give it their thumbs up.When I first reviewed Final Fantasy I gave it 6 out of 10. In retrospect I most certainly regret that decision. As it is I do feel that even 4 out of 10 may be a little overgenerous but there are a few moments within the film that rescue it from the depths of having no merit whatsoever. Despite the overall pedestrian nature of the film I will admit that Sakaguchi and his cohorts managed to create some pretty atmospheric dream sequences. A nice effect is the way that as Aki comes more and more under the control of the virus she is infected with her dreams become more desaturated.In many respects Final Fantasy tries very hard to be a computergenerated Akira. Shame on them for even trying. This film doesn't even come close to Katsuhiro tomo's 1987 masterpiece. Many of the same themes are present well you can't get much broader than end of the world but none of the imagination or heart. Final Fantasy is cold and sterile and for me it is adequate proof that if you use machines to make your movie you'll end up with a very mechanical movie. Especially after listening to the commentaries and watching the documentary I have become aware that this is obviously an assemblyline product not a creative endeavor. To reiterate Pixar can do it. They are able to use their computers as tools to project heart and emotion. In my opinion Square Pictures cannot do it. They use their computers to hide their own incompetence.The main character Dr. Aki Ross is voiced by the irritating MingNa. She gives the most bland lifeless reading you could possibly imagine. The other voice actors are equally disappointing projecting their lifeless voices on to lifeless CG models. Special mention must be given to Alec Baldwin who gives a laughably poor and clichd performance as Captain Gray although admittedly he's reading a laughably poor and clichd script.If proving that they could do lifelike CG animation was the production team's only goal then they have succeeded. However that means that Final Fantasy was nothing more than an experiment a test that was most certainly not ready to be released to the public. They should have spent more time on developing a story finding better voice actors and actually animating something rather than motioncapturing it all. It's hardly surprising that Square Pictures folded shortly after the film was released.".

Ross joins the elite military unit Deep Eyes to finish her quest but General Hein is determined to convince the ruling council that the best solution is the use of a weapon that will destroy the aliens despite Sid's protests that it could destroy the Earth in the process.This film got a lot of publicity about the fact that it was billed as the film that would trigger a whole new type of movie  those with no human stars well apart from their voices. Sadly this seemed to be all the discussion about the film amounted to and I think it put people off that nobody talked about the plot or whether it was any good or not  I know it put me off from bothering to go and see it. Another thing that put me off was that most people just assumed it was a kid's film because it was animated and was quickly dumped in matinee slots  even when I saw it on TV it was in the slot on Sunday afternoon used for mostly kiddie fare. Anyway let me just say that I have no knowledge of the games never played the games and will likely never play the games but I had no problem picking up the rough story even though I'm sure the wider FF universe has so much more story in it that this film does. I would have quite liked a greater understanding of the story the characters and the aliens but it did enough to support the film's plot as was.As a scifi film it works reasonably well but is not as intelligent as it clearly needed to be to support the story  if it had only aspired to be a good guysbad guys story then fine but it wanted more and it isn't well enough developed to do it. I still enjoyed it to a certain degree but it is evident from the film that the script writing and plotting took a backseat to the development of the computer graphics. Of course these look great for the most part and the film has delivered a visually impressive series of spaceships desolate cityscapes and blobby aliens. The only things that don't work ironically enough considering the film's boasts are the human characters. CGI has yet to manage to make characters that look and move as naturally as humans  we have seen it in Matrix Reloaded Blade 2 and also here. Admittedly it matters less here because we can get used to the characters looking like effects unlike say Matrix 2 where we are not meant to notice the difference between real and effect. Suffice to say though that this is an animated movie rather than the movie that triggers the onslaught of computer generated characters in films.The voice cast are pretty good and they do well to add a bit of a human touch to characters that for all the money spent on them still look and movie like computer game characters in an expensive cutscene between levels. MingNa hardly has that distinctive a voice and she is rather bland at times but she does OK. Baldwin is a strong voice and suits his character well. Sutherland is always welcome despite his small role and typical roles are filled by the likes of Steve Buscemi Ving Rhames Keith David and a typically untrustworthy performance from James Woods.Overall this is an OK scifi film but not any more than that. The plot is OK but it isn't as good as it thinks it is and certainly isn't good enough to support the slightly complex themesideas that it wants to deliver. It is good for older children and teenagers who will happily ignore the plot details but outside of that scifi fans may find it a bit lacking in bite and generally to be more about the graphics than anything else.".

The problems were that 1 the characters were not ones you could care about and 2 the film is too long. Anything over 100 minutes generally is too long for an animated film in my opinion. They are better around 80 minutes in length.It's not boring the visuals and sound alone are stateoftheart but it was just an uninvolving unlikeable story for me. After awhile it was hard to care for anyone and I mainly watched to admire the art work.It's an adult some swearing but mild scifi film with a lot of occult nonsense spirits ghosts and the like thrown in the mix. As usual the military man is the villain.This animation was made to look lifelike and it mostly succeeded. It almost was eerie at first hearing the voices of Donald Sutherland James Woods Steve Buscemi and Alec Baldwin but see other humanlike faces. It didn't seem to fit.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's not very usual that a movie based on a game turns out to be a stunning movie. But Final Fantasy The Spirits Within however is just that. The incredibly realistic characters and beautifully rendered backdrops in this movie make it a fascinating work of CGI. Unfortunately its story falls short of anything but a rather boring SciFi plot which I'm sure is what caused it to be such a failure in the boxoffice.The Spirits Within follows a young scientist named Aki Ross who shares a belief with her colleague Dr. Sid that with the collection of 7 spirits they can stop an invading alien race and save the earth. Being a fan of the video game series of the same name I remember getting pretty excited for this movie when it first came out. After seeing it for the first time I could not figure out why in the world they would call this movie Final Fantasy. Aside from a few subtle references to characters and themes from the video game series it does not contain enough blatant similarities to possess the Final Fantasy title and I feel like this should have been a more important goal in directing this movie. It was a great choice to have done this movie in CGI rather than in liveaction as one of the most captivating things about the Final Fantasy series are its fantastic cinematic scenes. To have a whole movie based on the quality of an epic Final Fantasy cinematic really shows the hard work that goes into creating all of these scenes. Every model in the movie displays a high level of detail from the main characters to the ships that they fly in. The freckles on Ross's face allow for intense closeups. The subtle movements of their facial structures make them more interesting to look at. It's an art form that was very well presented in this film. In fact this was the first full CGI film to feature fully realistic characters modeled to look like real actors. The fact that it is a computer generated movie allows more freedom to conduct scenes and also set camera angles in places that would be impossible to get if it were shot in real life.Final Fantasy The Spirits Within portrays a mastery of computer generated imagery for its time. It's a fine tribute to the wonderful cinematics of the Final Fantasy series. But it doesn't possess a very original plot line which doesn't even portray enough references to be called Final Fantasy and should have just been another Scifi called The Spirits Within.".

Now while I was disappointed the movie didn't hold any aspects to the games I was more unhappy with the story. This movie seemed like a test.  The only reason they made it was to see what they could do with the new technology. Granted what they did do was beautiful but you can't base a movie on looks alone.  Shrek also had new graphical advances and while more cartoony it still managed to have good story. Final Fantasy is very isolated cold and distant. It contained a good message of how you can't solve violence with violence and had some good suspense and action scenes but it didn't win me over. POSSIBLE SPOILERS The Final Fantasy games are primarily revered for their characters and stories but here I didn't feel any connections.  I also didn't like the way the alien ghosts would pass through people and just steal their souls. It just seemed so cheap and watered down the level of conflict. I liked the whole idea of how the phantoms got there but Dr. Aki's search for the alien secrets was a little dull.  I was hoping to see more aspects of the game carried over.  They did have a character named Sid not even spelled right but that's about it.  No Odin no spells no Chocobos no moogles nothing. Supposedly they based making the Shinra perspective on Final Fantasy VII by the success on this movie which in my opinion was very foolish.  Perhaps if the story wasn't so heavy and more appealing to a general audience it would have done better. I'm not saying that every movie needs to directed to a general audience but I think in this case that is what they were looking for. It just confuses me that in the games they've been so clever with their stories and with this movie it went out the window.  Yes the new advancement of graphics are great but the rest of the movie definitely suffered. It also has little review desirability as it has a tendency to drag.  I love Final Fantasy just not the movie.".

If it was then why are there so many unanswered questions at the end.  If anything it was too unpredictable. Somehow along the way the characters failed to explain how the eight spirits would get rid of the aliens.  Second I have a problem with the general.  OK his family was killed by the aliens and he is consumed with killing them.  But you don't get to that position without having some common sense.  He already had proof of her dreams to wake the council up why did he have to let the aliens in the city.  Third how come the Zeus cannon is so powerful that it can destroy the Earth's Gaiia but fail to kill Captain and Aki when they are down in the crater.  I guess I was expecting a nuclear blast or something.  Fourth how do the phantoms feed off the Zeus cannon? Fifth how does Aki manage to project the spirits to kill off the aliens and Sixth why does Captain have to die to save everyone?Overall a 7 for animation compelling characters and score.

The visuals are impressive but thats all the film is really visuals with a poor plot bad lines and flat characters personality with a Clichd ending.The plot feels rushed if not in the writing in the implementation. No sooner has the main character found one of the things she needs to than shes off again doing exactly the same thing fighting invisible enemies there just wasn't enough time between it felt like watching a long scavenger hunt. Now heres the bit that reeeally bugged me about this film the ENORMOUS continuity error we're talking a fairly large chunk of the film is affected by this. In the beginning of the film the ghosts cannot be seen. Later they can be seen and the excuse is given that its because they've collected energy from passing through the weakened energy barrier around the city...fair enough...but then...if thats the only reason they are visible without using the electronic gizmos they used at the beginning....why are they visible from that point onwards...no matter where they happen to see them surely not every creature on the planet passed through this shield of course not. Come on its animated....you'd think continuity would be high its not like make up or clothing will have randomly changed or a prop would have broken between takes.To make matters worse you just cannot connect with any character this isolates the viewer from the film they are no more real in this film as they would be as match stick men drawn on a piece of paper. don't get me wrong I've seen some good animated filmsNot only do i dislike this film but the figures prove it the general public hates it this film made an incredible loss at the box office and even through DVD and VHS sales it has not yet come close to making a profit".

	schema:reviewBody "I was surprised when Rob Marshall's Chicago took home the Oscar for Best Picture. A great movie but not my choice for best of 2002 that I would award to Gangs of New York. All that aside Marshall hasn't done much since. Only one movie Memoirs of a Geisha which I for some reason have neglected to see I try to watch films that win for best cinematography. That's all beside the point. In his third film Marshall goes back to his theatre roots and tackles another musical.This time he has chosen Nine a reimagining of Federico Fellini's classic film 8 12. Already I am skeptical of the situation. I am fine with musicals. Some of the best films on celluloid have been musicals. What I have a problem with is the reworking of such a classic film like 8 12. It would take a lot of convincing to win me over. Unfortunately it did not succeed.Daniel DayLewis stars as Guido Contini an Italian director who is planning on making the most important Italian film ever call Italia. The only problem is he hasn't written a script yet. To guide him he turns to the women in his life. His late mother Sofia Loren his wife Marion Cotillard his mistress Penelope Cruz his costume designer and closest friend Judi Dench a fashion reporter Kate Hudson a childhood temptress Saraghina Stacey Fergie Ferguson and his leading lady Nicole Kidman.Contini tries to escape the pressure looming overhead by the media his producers and his cast and crew. He is constantly searching for the answer bouncing around from one person to another. That's really all there is. He talks to people sleeps around and goes into his past.Right off the bat there is a slight problem. There are too many women! Not just for Contini but for the audience. There are too many big name actresses with almost equal parts. Who is more important? Who should we side with? It seems like he has such a close relationship with some of them and hardly any with others yet they all practically get the same amount of screen time. They all have at least one song to their own.That is another problem with the film. The musical aspect is distracting from the story. The music for the most part is average. A few songs like Be Italian and the Oscar nominated Take it All are very good but for the most part it's all bells and whistles. Like he did with Chicago Marshall takes us from the real world of dialogue to the imaginary world of singing and dancing. My issue with this is that he spends an almost equal amount of time in both places. With Chicago there was more story divulged in the real world. Nine has too much singing and not enough story telling.The musical numbers are impressive in particular the two songs I mentioned. Fergie really flexes the golden pipes with Be Italian a fun and sexy number that for me was the highlight of the film. Cotillard's number was also one of the better ones. This was a more emotional struggle and was one of the few numbers I felt really connected with the story. Kidman and Cruz each have decent numbers and Dench's number is a bit over the top. She is better with the real world scenes.I guess Marshall tried to replicate what he did with Chicago but came up short. I never was invested with any of the characters and Lewis' performance was not quite what I was looking for. I would have loved to have seen Raul Julia the original Guido Contini from the first Broadway production or even Antonio Banderas in the revival. I think someone with a more musical background would have been a more acceptable choice but nevertheless Lewis does a fairly decent job.".

	schema:reviewBody "Guido Contini a famous Italian director is struggling with his next big film. He has no script and no inspiration but everyone is counting on him. He tries to juggle both his new film his wife his mistress his producer and his muse. Oh yeah he also talks to his dead mother. Nine is an ambitious film I'll give it that. Rob Marshall the director of the Best Picture winner Chicago serves up a mix bag with Nine. The film feels like Marshall is trying to rekindle the magic he had with Chicago he comes up short specifically with the musical numbers. For everything that I liked about it there were two things I didn't. Nine needs to be more focused and shorter for it to be a film I would recommend. The film is about filmmaking yet the way Marshall presents the film to us is in the style of a stage play. Everything from the setpieces to lighting screams stage play. It was an interesting touch but felt out of place because it dealt with the art of filmmaking so much. The musical numbers all uninspiring and rather boring even attest to this. With the exception of Fergie who gives us the best song and dance number that uses sand in a creative way all the other numbers are generic and rather 'not good'. When you have a Grammy winner singing a song and then have Kate Hudson sing one there is a difference and it is more noticeable than the filmmakers might have wanted.Nine has a great cast most of them are Oscar winners too. Daniel Day Lewis with an amazing Italian accent is the obvious stand out. He plays sexy and stressed all in one look. Penelope Cruz is the mistress who has the sexiest scene of this movie her career and this year. Her work in this film is pretty basic the other lover who wants to be the one loved. With the exception of DDL the only other actor that is given any kind of emotional depth is Marion Cotillard. She has to go through the realization that her husband is cheating on her and make the choice to stay or leave. Everyone else is pretty much there to fill up time and sing their one song. Judie Dench is the fashion designer and she plays a motherly figure whereas Sophia Loren plays his actual mother well his dead mother but he still sees and talks to her. Fergie has her one scene in which she steals the show with her tune and then Nicole Kidman turns up at the end and makes you wince with her accent. Don't get me started on Kate Hudson.The problem is that these are good actors with just no material to work with. Daniel Day Lewis is great but he's a hard character to connect with he's sleeping around with a lot of women it feels like half the cast. Emotional scenes don't play out as well as they should and the film drags itself to the finish line near the end. I found myself wanting it to end sooner and sooner but it kept going. On the plus side the choreography is great and the cinematography really grabs you even if it is a little misplace with it's stage feel. The film is well put together and the editing is well done. It weaves it's story in and out of timelines from Guido's life during the musical numbers. The film isn't bad but it didn't do anything for me either. Leaving a musical not tapping your toes or even remembering the tunes may be a bad sign. I liked it enough to give it a good rating the cast and style are good enough for me to do so but everything else makes me lean on the side of telling you to rent this. It's well made but has no real heart and the film is a little on the long side you may be checking your watch.".

Daniel Day Lewis with an amazing Italian accent is the obvious stand out. He plays sexy and stressed all in one look. Penelope Cruz is the mistress who has the sexiest scene of this movie her career and this year. Her work in this film is pretty basic the other lover who wants to be the one loved. With the exception of DDL the only other actor that is given any kind of emotional depth is Marion Cotillard. She has to go through the realization that her husband is cheating on her and make the choice to stay or leave. Everyone else is pretty much there to fill up time and sing their one song. Judie Dench is the fashion designer and she plays a motherly figure whereas Sophia Loren plays his actual mother well his dead mother but he still sees and talks to her. Fergie has her one scene in which she steals the show with her tune and then Nicole Kidman turns up at the end and makes you wince with her accent. Don't get me started on Kate Hudson.The problem is that these are good actors with just no material to work with. Daniel Day Lewis is great but he's a hard character to connect with he's sleeping around with a lot of women it feels like half the cast. Emotional scenes don't play out as well as they should and the film drags itself to the finish line near the end. I found myself wanting it to end sooner and sooner but it kept going. On the plus side the choreography is great and the cinematography really grabs you even if it is a little misplace with it's stage feel. The film is well put together and the editing is well done. It weaves it's story in and out of timelines from Guido's life during the musical numbers. The film isn't bad but it didn't do anything for me either. Leaving a musical not tapping your toes or even remembering the tunes may be a bad sign. I liked it enough to give it a good rating the cast and style are good enough for me to do so but everything else makes me lean on the side of telling you to rent this. It's well made but has no real heart and the film is a little on the long side you may be checking your watch.";

	schema:reviewBody "I could honestly say that walking out of Nine I felt more conflicted over what I thought of the movie than I have in years. The film can be reviewed in two aspects though its performances and its story so I'll dissect those.Performances Let me first say that no actress delivered any less than they possibly could and you could tell that the cast had worked their butts off during production.The Great Marion Cotillard in particular delivered what is sure to be one of the most understated performances in recent memory as well as delivering the two most powerful and emotional numbers in the show. Penelope Cruz was SEXY and as her character's story was wrapped up she beautifully portrayed a mistreated mistress so to speak. Judi Dench was fantastic as the background player in Guido's career perfectly delivering wit while supporting her friend. Most importantly these three worked so well because they were interlinked in each other's story and as a result their plot lines flowed well into each other.The OK DDL and Sophia Loren were fine in their parts simply filling out their roles and not seriously improving on or dragging down the movie in any way.The Misused Nicole Kidman Kate Hudson and Fergie were all criminally misused although fantastic when on the screen. All three had stories that didn't synch with the movie whether they be Kidman who honestly needed a more fleshed out role that came in contact w other characters other than just Guido Hudson whose number really felt like it would have made more sense in the beginning of the movie or Fergie Be Italian felt shoehorned in and disconnected and would have been a perfect opener or closing number. All three felt particularly disconnected from the film.I can honestly say that not one of the players in Marshall's cast disappointed but it was Marshall himself and the messy script irony! that jumbled up the movie and left me with a very disjointed disconnected result. Each scene was Oscarworthy but they were only partially threaded together into a cohesive story.".

	schema:reviewBody "What do I know about musicals? From my limited experience of musicals Singing in the Rain Guys and Dolls The Blues Brothers yes it is considered a musical comedy and Legally Blonde the Musical here is the basic linear format as I see they are written in  opening dialogue singing more dialogue more singing even more dialogue and then a grand finale. Then for a week after that you have the songs stuck in your head. Director Rob Marshall chose not to follow the old standby format through to the end. His actions placed Nine in a different category from the standard musical.The movie focuses on Guido Contini Daniel DayLewis as a famous movie director in Italy in 1965. He is having troubles developing his next movie. More so he hasn't written a script. Even more so he is having trouble even coming up with an idea for his movie. He had successful movies in the years past but now we are watching him struggle after a few major flops.In his journey to make his next movie he is having marital problems along with mistress problems. Add in Freudian issues with his deceased mother and his working relationship with his costume designer and his muse. Don't forget to include yet another potential affair outside of the one he is having with his mistress plus there's the memory of an erotic lady on a beach from his youth that's seven women total for those of you who are keeping score at home.You know what is going to make this movie stand out from the crowd? It is the realistic singing by the actors. They are actors first and singers second except for maybe Fergie who plays the erotic lady from Guido's youth but she didn't say much in the film come to think of it I think she only sang. Since I don't know much about musicals and even less about how to sing properly I could grasp the singing. The tunes they sang aren't the kind you are going to be singing on the way home because a lot of the songs were simply narrated lines being sung. When a character wanted to express his or her thoughts they would sing their lines. Maybe that's what they do in all musicals  like I said my experience here is limited.The women. Oh the women. They all performed wonderfully and I don't just mean the singing. The female cast includes his wife Marion Cotillard his mistress Penelope Cruz his costume designer Judi Dench the woman from his childhood Fergie an American fashion designer Kate Hudson his muse Nicole Kidman and his mother Sophia Loren. They brought emotion and life to the story through their singing and their lustful yet sensual moves. I would also like to note as a guy the women were the reason why I kept my attention focused for almost 2 hours. I don't even watch a football game this intensely.Should you see this movie? Yes. But don't go in expecting a musical you can sing along with or a movie that will leave you feeling giddy with love. It dealt with some very real issues about infidelity. I will say this though after seeing this movie I do know a little more about musicals. And that's a good thing.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first found out that Rob Marshall was going to be making a movie version of Nine I was very excited because I knew he would be the best person to direct it because he could easily relate to the protagonist with his experience as a well known director and a women enthusiast. Also as a director he uses very creative imagery and elaborate sets to tell the story of a very specific situation instead of just a broad scenario that happens everyday. I particularly love this style because I hate stories that I've already seen and heard a million times.Because i felt this way about it i was shocked to hear that such a large majority of critic's thought it was so mediocre and I became hesitant to see it in fear of disappointment. Well I did see it and let me tell you there was nothing mediocre about it. It was a phenomenal movie. The dances and songs were beautiful creative and very well performed. The storyline was very fresh and it kept the viewer interested in what Guido would do next because he was such a dynamic character. The women in his life were perfectly cast and fantastically played especially Marion Cotillard whom I had never heard of before this movie it's fair to say she totally rocked her role instilling in me emotions that I never even knew I had. Penelope was ridiculously sexy yet still made the viewer empathize with her character. Nicole Kidman was great as the selfconfident and inspiring muse. Daniel DayLewis was very believable in his role as the immature child trapped inside the older man's body named Guido as his life spins out of control as reality finally begins to catch up with him.The main problem that critics had with this movie was that it wasn't like Fredrico Fellini's 8 12 on which nine was based but they shouldn't be comparing the two. This is a whole new movie and should be viewed for what it is and to me Nine is the most entertaining movie of the year and I am looking forward to seeing it again.".

Hey Rob where you put the camera is really important. I couldn't see inside any of these characters! I never felt sympathetic empathetic or even slightly connected to any of these characters.

I will bet had the camera actually looked into his eyes we might have had something there. One hour and forty five minutes into the movie the conflict with the wife happened. Finally some real drama. Had that been the first scene I might have decided to care about this man's journey. Kate Hudson's number was the highlight of the film although completely disconnected from the story. But then again everything is disconnected. And there really is no story. And making a film with an Italian sensibility in the English language is probably an impossibility. Remember when they dubbed La Vita e Bella into English? That like Fellini's work was beautiful in Italian. It sucked in English. I say leave the making of Italian films to Italian filmmakers.

	schema:reviewBody "I have to declare that Fellini 8 12 is first on my list of favorite films so it is rather obvious that as far as I'm concerned any one that tries to mess with it will be received with a huge amount of resistance. On the other hand I have been perversely attracted to the musical version from its initial opening on Broadway years ago. Nine both on Broadway and unfortunately of the new film clearly show that today's culture has exhausted its own creativity and simply lost any shame in accepting the lack of an original idea. From My Fair Lady to West Side Story or even A Little Night Music many great musicals are based not on an original idea but on famous classics stories books or films. Nothing wrong with that when the musical version adds a new layer a twist to the vision of the original and the music brings a new vocabulary to tell the story.The film of Nine doesn't feel so much as inspired on 8 12 but a real misappropriation of someone else's personal ideas. Whilst the change from screen to stage might have been challenging and innovative the fact that we are now back to the same medium than the original makes more obvious the inadequacies of the concept as well as the poor talent of the Rob Marshall and his MTV School of film direction style. The use of memorable imagery in black and white in a scene such as the Saragena and the boys on the beach seems not a homage to the genius of Fellini but simply a blatant robbery that should have been protected by copyrights or at least by Marshall's self censorship. The misconception was there from the start. The film as a musical simply does not work in any way. The music itself seems extremely banal and you know you are in shaky territory when you can tell exactly the next musical phrase or words in a song. Further more the introduction of the songs the sudden jump from action to singing feels totally forced.How on earth a talented a actor such as Daniel Day Lewis could ever have got involved in this mess of styles and accent with dubious content escape me. Did he really think he could pass as a reincarnation of Mastroianni or even as an Italian? It might sound odd but in the film not even Sofia Loren sounds convincing as an Italian! Interesting that at the core of the original 812there is actually the conflict of the creative process and the fear of not being able to say anything new or of value. What's could then be a better idea that cannibalizing Fellini's masterpiece and bringing its level to a lower common denominator in order to try to capture the interest of today's general audiences.".

It's a silly and presumptuous musical that makes you leave the movie theater feeling ashamed. Why did Kate Hudson say yes to this part? She's totally out of context here she doesn't even know what she's doing. Her musical performance is pitiful and I almost prayed it ended as quick as it could. As for the songs... all awful. Cinema Italiano makes you feel you're being stabbed in the ears. In general all songs are bad except for the one that's sung by Luisa. Penelope Cruz and Sophia Loren make good appearances but they're both too good to be here. This movie does not deserve them. Or Judi Dench. Or Nicole Kidman by the way what happened to her lips???.

	schema:reviewBody "Anyone who complains that this movie has no plot either hasn't seen or must feel the same way about Fellini's classic 8 12 since Nine has basically the same plot. And yes there is one.Guido Contini is a filmmaker facing an existential crisis of sorts as the deadline for shooting his next film is approaching and he hasn't even written a script as he's constantly distractedbattling with the women in his life  past present and possibly future. No it's not a complex plot but some of the best movies have simple plots  look at Best Picture No Country for Old Men A guy finds a bag of money and gets chased by a psycho for a couple of hours. Simple plot GREAT movie. Same goes for Nine. What makes movies with simple plots work are the characters themes and performances. Nine has those in spades. Daniel DayLewis shines yet again as this man with an insatiable appetite for life love everything  yet no matter how much of it he devours he remains empty. He wonders if he's capable of real love or even if he knows what it means. Of course DayLewis excels at conveying these internal struggles but the most pleasant surprise here is that he can SING them as well.Marion Cotillard may be the shining star of the film as Guido's longsuffering wife. The best part of her performance is that she doesn't play it as a victim  she seems to be the one in command during all of her scenes with DayLewis. Guido needs her and she knows it. And when Guido's transgressions which you can tell deep down she's known about for years become apparent she seems just as angry with herself for allowing them as she is with him. It's a masterful performance as are her two musical numbers in the film. The first song she sings conveys the sadness she refuses to show in public and the second is the polar opposite a raw angry cathartic release from a woman who refuses to be a doormat. It will be a crime if she's not recognized come Oscar time for this performance.Aside from DayLewis and Cotillard Penelope Cruz is the other standout of the film. As Contini's mistress she's very funny in her early scenes but when you start to see how much she loves Guido and wishes they could have their own life together she plays the heartbreak just as perfectly as the comedy. And yes her musical number is quite the showstopper.The film also features solid supporting performances from Judi Dench Kate Hudson Nicole Kidman and even Fergie. Though if I had to pick a weak link surprisingly it would be Kidman. She's not bad by any means but she was using some kind of unidentifiable and inconsistent accent that I found a bit distracting which is a shame because I usually enjoy her work. She just seemed miscast here.Finally the film looks great. Rob Marshall while using the same imaginary musical sequences technique he did on Chicago seems to have really found the perfect way to use that technique in this film. Since the story it's based on was really about what goes on inside the director's head that style seems better suited for this story than it did Chicago though I did enjoy that film as well. And his work with cinematographer Dion Beebe has created some beautiful and classic imagery that celebrates the movies and why we love 'em. It certainly made me want to hop on the next flight to Rome.Overall I found Nine to be fantasticyetslightlyflawed musical masterpiece. I honestly don't know how anyone could give this movie 1 star.".

	schema:headline " The best music film of 2009!";
	schema:reviewBody "Today I went to see Rob Marshall's new musical Nine obviously based upon the Broadway musical of the same name that based off Fellini's 8 12. It should be mentioned that the movie contains not quite as many songs as the stage performance does but each actress in the wonderful cast having one song and the way the songs are presented it certainly works. Daniel DayLewis leads the cast playing Italian filmmaker Guido Contini who is about fifty and going through something of a midlife crisis. Lewis brings a lot of panache to the role belting out his lyrics with such assurance that this part has been wellpracticed and a certain amount of passion has been brought into it playing the character perfectly. His longsuffering wife Luisa splendidly reimagined not played by Marion Cotillard is the one gem in the cast that outshines all of its other members. You feel emotion for her character that you don't feel for the others you can tell that her character has been through a lot and you're happy to see her come out on top at the end. Penelope Cruz also adds a lot to the film playing Contini's mistress Carla a role that 30 Rock's Jane Krakowski played on Broadway Cruz also brings a lot of emotion and sass often simultaneously to her role. You really understand Contini's predicament and sympathize with the character for not being able to break her heart or that of his wife. Her musical number brings a lot of excitement and her enthusiasm and her roaring Soprano is unlike anything we ever thought we'd see from this actress. I see her winning awards amany for her performance in this. Dame Judi Dench always worthwhile plays Lilli Contini's wisecracking costume designer and confidante. Dench brings comic relief having more scenes than any other of the actresses in the film but also brings depth playing a kind of a psychiatrist to the lead character and also bringing a fantastic voice for her musical number which contains many chorus girls in feather boas you think you're watching The Rockettes or something out of A Chorus Line but for the song it certainly works. Fergie plays Saraghina a figure from Contini's youth who taught him about love and how to attract a woman. Fergie only has one scene in the movie basically. She shows up in the overture and finale but her only big scene is her showstopping musical number Be Italian which generated applause in my theatre. It makes me wonder if they used Fergie less because maybe her acting talents were not up to par. I guess we'll never know but her singing voice is something we didn't even expect from her as she belts the lyrics with such undeniable passion and exuberance you're glad this minor role was played by her. Nicole Kidman plays Contini's muse actress Claudia Jensen who is mentioned in the film's beginning then disappears until close to the movie's end. I kind of feel like Kidman's obvious musical talent displayed previously in Moulin Rouge come off as a bit underused because she has one of the best singing voice among the cast and she only has one song. That's one of the few things that bugged me about this wonderful movie. Kate Hudson plays American magazine journalist Stephanie who isn't in very much of the movie either but Kate Hudson's big musical number Cinema Italiano written specifically for the movie is amazing. I hate to use the word amazing because I think it's overused and it's lost its affect but it's the only way to describe this scene the way that director Rob Marshall cut the number switching from sequences in black and white then color then black and white again it's a truly unique experience that you really need to see to completely understand. And here's a surprise Kate Hudson can sing. I thought she was only cut out for midlevel romcoms but I'm glad to say I was wrong she definitely fits in with the musically talented cast of this movie. Sophia Loren plays Contini's mother who is tragically underused but brought in at the right times in the movie. She again only has one song but it feels like enough for this actress who's still looking great at age 75 bringing drama to her role and she gives more than she needs to but it's certainly good to see her on screen again. The direction of the movie is just as much one of the stars of the show. Rob Marshall having directed Chicago and Memoirs of a Geisha knows a thing or two about grandscale production musical numbers and highoctane drama and he brings it all to this film although some of the songs are cut in a way that feels chaotic and rushed but I think it doesn't hurt the movie at all. It's a movie built on high caliber acting beautiful music and gorgeous imagery and it's something you have to see for yourself. It's that good.".

Sophia Loren plays Contini's mother who is tragically underused but brought in at the right times in the movie. She again only has one song but it feels like enough for this actress who's still looking great at age 75 bringing drama to her role and she gives more than she needs to but it's certainly good to see her on screen again. The direction of the movie is just as much one of the stars of the show. Rob Marshall having directed Chicago and Memoirs of a Geisha knows a thing or two about grandscale production musical numbers and highoctane drama and he brings it all to this film although some of the songs are cut in a way that feels chaotic and rushed but I think it doesn't hurt the movie at all. It's a movie built on high caliber acting beautiful music and gorgeous imagery and it's something you have to see for yourself. It's that good.";

	schema:reviewBody "Let's just start by saying this Nine is one of the best of 2009. Not to be confused with District 9 and 9 Rob Marshall does a splendid job bringing the Broadway musical of the same title to the screen. The whole main cast is great at acting as well as singing. The movie is also an adaptation of Federico Fellini's 8 12 and it's a nice homage to that as well.My only criticism of Nine is that it has a very loose plot. The small plot that is present is still quite good. It follows Guido Contini Daniel DayLewis an aging director who has reached a breaking point in his life when he realizes everything is spiraling out of control. His movies have turned bad over the last few years and he is hopelessly in love with nine women who very important to him. The female cast includes his wife Marion Cotillard his mistress Penelope Cruz his costume designer Judi Dench a prostitute from his childhood Fergie an American fashion designer Kate Hudson his muse Nicole Kidman and his mother Sophia Loren. The film also marks one of Anthony Minghella's last screenplays.Though the cast is mostly responsible for why the movie is so great it's also Rob Marshall's direction. Anyone who has seen Chicago will know that his type of movie involves sexy women writhing and twisting as the dance and not in a bad way. Nine is quite similar but Nine made me feel as though I was actually sitting in a Broadway theater watching a Broadway musical. Anthony Minghella's snappy script the art direction and the cinematography are just some of the things that make Nine such a sensory overload. Marshall also even brings the cast out at the end for bows.The most important thing in movie musicals is the singing and dancing. Nobody needs to be worried about these things in Nine. Every cast member sings and dances beautifully with the exception of Kate Hudson whose voice is unfortunately changed for the trailer. Daniel DayLewis is a surprisingly good singer and dances pretty nicely too. The two great numbers are Be Italian and A Call to the Vatican. Fergie totally rocks her number in which she plays an overweight prostitute and Penelope Cruz blew me away with her sexy number involving a striptease. Yet it really is Marion Cotillard who takes it all no pun intended. I've been watching Marion Cotillard since she first starred in La Vie En Rose and it's fortunate that she's finally begun to star in big movies. Hopefully she'll get more recognition now.The bottom line is Nine is great. Though the film does get a bit tiresome midway through the songs are energetic and make you remember why you love it. Rob Marshall does a great job directing his stars and the art direction and cinematography are sure to win some awards. Every actor who is part of the main cast sings well and the choreography is very nice. Rob Marshall has done it again with Nine and I totally look forward to seeing it take home awards on Oscar night.".

I find myself hoping that the seemingly arbitrary dismissals by some critics and users of both Chicago and Nine not to mention poor box office returns and perhaps low DVD sales and rentals will not discourage Marshall from reaching for yet another musical. How about Sondheim's Follies? Please.What is to dislike about the film Nine? I suppose it depends upon the viewer's expectationsa peculiarity of the dramatic arts perhaps especially cinema. My expectations were at least 95 fulfilled. I had only a casting problem. As talented and as beautiful as Nicole Kidman may be she does not evoke the haunting angelic perfection of the original Claudia Claudia Cardinale. Her beauty is if one may say so tough Australian rather than ethereal Italian. But Nicole did well as did everyone else in the film. Is there any character Daniel DayLewis can't play to perfection?Nine says essentially the same thing 8 12 did making movies based on personal biographical visions and mistakes can absorb one artistically at the cost of real life relationships. It's something great directors such as Fellini Bergman and Scorsese just have to deal with. Thanks to Arthur Kopit Mario Fratti and composerlyricist Maury Yeston the story the point the dialogue expressed the theme absorbingly and intelligently.But most of all it was a joy to hear and see the musical numbers so faithfully presented worked into the story executed. As with every film adaptation of a Broadway musical I missed some numbers that were in the show most notably Only With You and Simple. However it was nice to hear a few new Maury Yeston songs especially Cinema Italiano. So if you're expecting a musically and dramatically satisfying film version of a hit show see Nine.".

	schema:reviewBody "When I first heard the announcements for Golden Globe nominations they announced a film called Nine. I thought to myself 'wow Tim Burton's has done it again...' then they announced the cast 'Daniel Day Lewis Nicole Kidman Fergie...' and I thought...They were not in that movie nor did the do the voices for it. LOL Little to my attention were their 2 movies this year with the title 9. lol.Anyway on with the review...We have Guido who has lost his inspiration and desire to produce a movie. He cant sleep cant eat and can't rest in peace. Everybody loves him and his work except for his last 2 films which were considered flops and he doesn't understand why everyone thinks he is so special. So he searches for a source of inspiration from his dead mother  played wonderfully by the never aging and always beautiful Sophia Loren. He looks for inspiration in loving and dedicated his wife Marion Cotillard. He also talks to his mistress played wonderfully and seductively by Penelope Cruz. The only person who seems to keep him leveled is his wardrobe designer played stunning and remarkably by Dame Judi Dench. His movie has a press conference poster and is being promoted even has a release date...However he doesn't even have a cast the main actress Nicole Kidman nor has he even wrote a script yet.The lights and camera angles and color schemes were all brilliant just like Chicago. however the filming wasn't as crisp. it looked smokey and grimy like a bar scene..but maybe that is how Rob Marshall wanted it to look. The best scenes in the movie for me were the Dame Judi Dench I didn't know she could sing and with an accent as well. lol and the Fergie sequences. that was Fergie?!?! she looked incredible. Not like a teeny hiphop wannabe girl but a sexy sultry mature lady you want to lead you down many roads of temptations. The only down side is Nicole Kidman who looked flat and out of place in this film.I would definitely see this movie again and I hope there are many extended extras on the DVD when it comes out.".

	schema:reviewBody "While I believe people and critics will be mixed on this it is a very sold film. The story is limited as in most musicals due to the large amount of time spent in song however that's not a bad thing. The awkward part of the film is that all the female characters are fully drawn out characters with minimal screen time. Each character is basically given one song and possibly part of a second which all show a deep emotion. The actresses all created fully drawn characters with histories and emotional depth but we as the audience don't see the development of any character except Guido which is unusual. I don't see that as a bad thing however I believe some will. Visually this movie is brilliant and some moments are breathtaking. Each song has it's own unique look and feel. There are flashback style moments that have the feel of an updated French New Wave style. Anyone who loves films will find a lot to praise in this one! I felt the actresses were all solid save for Nicole Kidman who wasn't believable as the beautiful young goddess actress. She just seemed miscast. Marion Cotillard is amazing. Her emotional depth is undeniable and she has a very nice voice. Good old Fergie was also a pleasant surprise. She has the smallest part but her musical number is energetic and visually amazing. I've never liked her music much but her voice is perfect for this part.I recommend watching Federico Fellini's 812 before this film as that is what it is based on and it will give you a little more background going in. Go in with an open mind and enjoy what's happening in front of you. Don't get bogged down in the lack of character history we see just trust that the actors and actresses know the character histories and the emotions they are playing are honest and true.".

Also the separate but not separate stories of the woman who influence his life are not even remotely interesting the muse the angry wife the desperate mistress the childhood whore the seductive blonde strumpet the close female friendmother figure and the actual mother are all things that have played out a million times before not to mention a cheating Italion husband? Stereotype central is the basis of this movie. As I watched I kept expecting something exciting or even interesting to happen but no I was sorely disappointed. Essentially this film is about a man who tries to make a movie fails because of his miserable reality and then finds himself the only lovely thing in the film was the costuming and cinematography... if you are looking for a film with some mediocre singing some boring and ultimately meaningless plot as well as some great actors performing below their normal standard then feel free to see Nine  this is the movie for you!".

The film stars a studdedcast of Alist celebrities including Academy Award Winners Daniel DayLewis Marion Cotillard Penelope Cruz Judi Dench Nicole Kidman Sophia Loren Oscar Nominee Kate Hudson and Stacy Ferguson a.k.a. Fergie. What the film is proud of is ultimately its failure. Marshall Oscar nominated for his breakthrough directorial debut Chicago lost all the flavor and originality we once respected him for. The performances of most are right on target get the job done and sure to break through some awards buzz this season. The narrative by Michael Tolkin and the late Anthony Minghella is flat unemotional and vacant. The songs are tedious and a bit monotonous in their delivery despite the cast surprisingly having good vocal chops. You would think that a big time musical such as Nine would have big notes that engage the viewer and an interpretation that would move the viewer. None of those occur often enough in the film. Nine is not a failure it just suffers major malfunctions that don't keep the machine moving. Daniel DayLewis helms the picture as Guido Contini an Italian director looking for inspiration for his next film. DayLewis gives a solid effort which we haven't seen from him before but in comparison to his previous works in There Will Be Blood and Gangs of New York he doesn't elevate the material as often or doesn't translate his musical numbers like he should. When he's not singing DayLewis is in charge in top form and showing what he's always excelled at decode a character's feelings and become an inferno of talent.Marion Cotillard is easily the most sentimental and profound player in the entire picture playing the heartrending Luisa Guido's adulterated wife. What Cotillard has demonstrated beyond any type of acting capacity a sexy stylish and devastating performance. With her two musical numbers Take It All and My Husband Makes Movies Cotillard improves and exalts one of the most poignant performances of the year. This is the single performance of the film that Oscar shouldn't miss out on.Nicole Kidman Oscar winning actress for The Hours is as wasted as she is unimportant playing the beautiful Claudia Guido's muse for his film. Kidman's one big scene of the film becomes a borefest of words that have no verbal value to the viewer or the story. Unfortunately Kidman is the forgettable cast mate that is ultimately invisible. She's unused underwritten and employed as movie wallpaper. For shame.Judi Dench as the costume designer Lilli has one big musical number which again is uninspired and lackluster. She has charisma in her speaking scenes and sort of upstages DayLewis much of the time she eventually falls victim to a bland insipid account.Sophia Loren the beautiful veteran Italian actress plays Mamma as in Guido's Mom and gives a presence of royalty that the film lacks. She walks through the film with a manifestation of poise and allure. Kate Hudson as the cute Stephanie the fashion critic for Vogue Magazine is surprisingly fresh and fun. Her Cinema Italiano is one of the more pleasurable and enjoyable numbers in the film. It's nice to see Hudson give a bright inventive cinematic turn in lines with her Oscar nominated work in Almost Famous.Fergie is one of the sexier parts of the film as Saraghina the lust of Guido's adolescence. Her Be Italian in terms of vocal capability is the best of the movie experience. Big notes modernlike and innovativeness Fergie is one of the memorable players here but in terms of actual acting she's never given the chance to show what she can do.Penelope Cruz in one of her most aggressive and provocative turns yet plays the luscious Carla Guido's married mistress. Cruz in the film's opening number is eager and provides hope to what seemed was going to be a promising experience. Along with Cotillard Cruz is an Oscar worthy player. Fascinating passionate and enthusiastic along encompasses the traits in Ms. Cruz's arsenal.Technically the film sits very well. A stunning art director controlling the date and time of Marshall's film is quite good. Dion Beebe regulates our essential point of view and how dazzling it can look despite any flaws narratively. At it again Colleen Atwood shows how she's one of the top designers in the business. Marshall in the end copycats himself which is not a directorial style rather a Chicagorepeat without the razzledazzle.Consequently Rob Marshall's Nine isn't terrible which doesn't say much. It's passable average and done before. It may not have been the screen writers liability for the strikeout it's just an unfascinating and awkwardly weak show. Nine the film however is awkwardly coy which is not an imaginative sense that the viewer anticipated. Nine in the end in the finale walking out of the theater everything you thought about it levels out just fine which I guess is admirable. Is it Oscar bound? Unfortunately yes.".

Cavalcade is the nearepic tale of two British families one set of aristocrats led by Oscarnominee Diane Wynyard and Clive Brook and the other a set of servants led by Una O'Connor and Herbert Mundin and their experiences from New Year's Eve 1899 to the start of 1933. As the film opens the country is entangled in the bloody Boer War in South Africa. Queen Victoria's death soon follows and naturally the loss hits the entire country very hard. The sinking of the Titanic also effects the richer group as they lose family members on the doomed liner. Of course World War I produces a terrible situation for the two groups' children. The film progresses through the Jazzy 1920s and then we revisit the couples in the early1930s as they reflect on eventful dramatic and tragic years since the start of the century. A new hope seems possible by the end of course history would continue to be unkind as World War II would soon become a sad reality for the English but far from certain. Frank Lloyd Oscarwinning for his direction crafted a vastly interesting film that is technologically strong for the time period the Titanic sequence in particular is something to be appreciated and very intelligent from the start. The editing techniques are revolutionary with impressive fades throughout to show the passing of time and the cinematography still holds up strong even today. One good thing about the Academy Awards is the historical significance it gives to films like Cavalcade. True the film is not always wellknown among movie enthusiasts but that does not mean that this is not an excellent production and one of the first truly excellent movies that Hollywood would develop for the world. 5 stars out of 5.".

	schema:reviewBody "CAVALCADE is an extremely good example of films made in the first few years following the advent of sound an era in which actors directors writers and cinematographers struggled to find a new style that could comfortably accommodate the new technology. During this period many actors and writers were drawn from the stageonly to discover that what seems real and natural in the theatre seems heavily mannered on screen.This is certainly the case with CAVALCADE. The film presents the story of two London families whose lives intertwine between 1900 and 1933. The film begins with the upperclass Marryot family and their servants Mr. and Mrs. Bridges facing the Boer Warand then through a series of montages and montagelike scenes follows the fortunes of the two families as they confront changing codes of manners and social class and various historic events ranging from the sinking of the Titanic to World War I.From a modern standpoint the really big problem with the film is the script. CAVALCADE was written for the stage by Noel Coward who was one of the great comic authors of the 20th Century stagebut the sparkling edge that seems so flawless in his comic works acquires a distastefully precious quality when applied to drama. Although the play was a great success in its day it is seldom revived and the dialogue of the film version leaves one in little doubt of why it feels ridiculously artificial and that quality is emphasized by the grand manner of the cast.That said the castin spite of the dialogue and their stylistically dated performancesis quite good. This is particularly true of the two leading ladies Diana Wynyard and Una O'Connor best known for her appearances in THE INVISIBLE MAN and THE BRIDE OF FRANKESTEIN both of whom have memorable screen presences that linger in mind long after the film ends. The material is also quite interesting and startlingly modern although it is more covert than such films as ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT CAVALCADE has a decidedly antiwar slant and the characters in the film worry about where technology which has produced such horrors as chemical warfare by World War I will take them in the future.I enjoyed the film. At the same time I would be very hesitant to recommend it to any one that was not already interested in films of the early 1930s for I think most contemporary viewers would have great difficulty adjusting to the tremendous difference in style. The VHS the film is not yet available on DVD has some problem with visual elements and a more significant problem with audio elements but these are not consistent issues. Recommendedbut with the warning that if you don't already like precode early talkies you will likely be disappointed.Gary F. Taylor aka GFT Amazon Reviewer".

It is a golden cinematic treasure waiting to be found anew for those who may know nothing of its existence.It is dated only for those who have no sense of history or cultural depth. It tells the story of England and western civilisation through the history of two families the Marryots and Bridges.  It is the same technique of intimate narrative history that was successfully used in Roots and other familyhistory sagas.Noel Coward's highly successful Londonset stage play Cavalcade was adapted for the big screen with a cry of A love that suffered and rose triumphant above the crushing events of this modern age! The march of time measured by a mother's heart!  It tells of the struggle of civility against the brutalising effects of war and in particular the Great War.It tells the story of Britain's struggle against barbarism in the late 19th and 20th century and of old fashioned virtues in a world that seemed determined to leave them all behind.  The final march of the heroes of history is perhaps quasi melodramatic Wagnerian mysticism but it tightens the stiff upper lip and makes me for one proud of Britain's contribution to the modern world.".

It is the same technique of intimate narrative history that was successfully used in Roots and other familyhistory sagas.Noel Coward's highly successful Londonset stage play Cavalcade was adapted for the big screen with a cry of A love that suffered and rose triumphant above the crushing events of this modern age! The march of time measured by a mother's heart!  It tells of the struggle of civility against the brutalising effects of war and in particular the Great War.It tells the story of Britain's struggle against barbarism in the late 19th and 20th century and of old fashioned virtues in a world that seemed determined to leave them all behind.  The final march of the heroes of history is perhaps quasi melodramatic Wagnerian mysticism but it tightens the stiff upper lip and makes me for one proud of Britain's contribution to the modern world.";

	schema:reviewBody "A sloppy but beautiful British family saga chronicling the lives of two families the Marryots and the Bridges the former upper class and the latter their servants from the end of the 19th Century up to 1933. A few major events are portrayed. At the beginning of the film the patriarchs of the two families go off to fight the Boer War. Much later on in the film we experience WWI and in between we see the Titanic sink. The film is filled to the brink with good characters all of them being portrayed by very good actors as well. There are a few very bad scenes most notably the one on the Titanic I know it was an important event in this time period but it's handled very poorly and predictably in the screenplay. The final speech a necessary element in every film of this subgenre is particularly bad too. The film ends during a worldwide depression and there is a halfattempt to provide the audience with hope. Unfortunately there is none to be found. I would have hated to be an audience member at this film in 1933! The many good scenes do far outweigh the bad ones though. There are a couple that are really masterful. The very long montage that paints a portrait of WWI is gorgeously done and appropriately harrowing. The scene in which the matriarch of the Marryot family watches her youngest son go off to war is exquisite. After he leaves she attempts to light a cigarette. At that moment a young nurse and a wounded man in a stretcher pass by the nurse lights a cigarette for the wounded man. The match goes out between the matriarch's fingers as she stares at them. This very economical scene expresses both the cold fear she has for her son and the ways in which the boundaries between the classes were fading. The theme of class in Cavalcade is important although I wish it had been developed further. Early in the film the Bridges family moves away and amasses something of a fortune of their own. As history marches on we do see the class lines falter a bit. Cavalcade may actually have been an influence on none other than Jean Renoir at least in The Grand Illusion. That film also deals with the melding of the classes as a result of wars. There is one scene in Cavalcade that is simply too close to one in The Grand Illusion to be a coincidence. A theater show is interrupted to announce that the Boer War is over and that the troops are coming back. Together the audience members stand up and begin singing. It looks very much like the scene where the P.O.W.s sing The Marseilles in The Grand Illusion. 810.".

Unlike 42nd Street and Dinner at Eight which are other films from 1933 that I think most Americans would find very accessible today you might not care for Cavalcade if you don't know what to look for.This film is totally British in its perspective and it is also very much in the antiwar spirit that pervaded movies between 1925 and 1935 as WWI came to be seen by nearly all its global participants as a pointless war and caused everyone to lose their taste for fighting another.The British perspective that you have to realize is that the Marryotts are accustomed to being on top  both in the world as England had dominated the globe for centuries and socially as they were part of the aristocracy. That didn't mean that they were snobs  they were very friendly and compassionate with their servants. But the point is they were accustomed to the relationship being their choice and under their control. Suddenly England appears to be on the decline on the world stage and the servants they were so kind to are coming up in the world on their own and don't need their permission to enter society. Downstairs is coming upstairs like it or not.Downstairs is personified in this film by the Bridges family Marryot servants that eventually strike out on their own and into business. Eventually the daughter Fanny enters into a romance with the Marryot's younger son. When Mrs. Marryot learns the news she is not so shocked as she is resigned to the fact that this is another sign that her world is slipping away. As for Fanny Bridges she seems to personify postwar decadence as she grows from a child to full womanhood in the roaring 20's. At one point in the film as a child she literally dances on the grave of a loved one. This is not a good sign of things to come.If the movie has a major flaw it is that it goes rather slowly through the years 1900 through 1918 and flies through the last fifteen years. Through a welldone montage you get a taste for what British life was like during that time  in many cases it looks like it was going through the same growing pains as American society during that same period  but it's only a taste.Overall I'd recommend it but just realize that it is quite different in style from American films from that same year.".

	schema:reviewBody "I suppose you don't have to be an Anglophile to like Cavalcade but it certainly helps. The film it seems to be most like to me is Giant. Just as the Edna Ferber based film is some 25 years of the second quarter of the last century as seen through the eyes of the Texas Benedict family Cavalcade is a British social history through the Marryots Robert and Jane played by Clive Brook and Diana Wynyard. Though the Benedicts have their problems they don't go through near the tragedies that the Marryots do.Cavalcade was presented on the London stage a few years earlier and it never made it to Broadway unlike most of Noel Coward's works. It was an expensive production with revolving kaleidoscope like sets that probably made American producers on Broadway shy away from it.A lot of standard English Music Hall numbers were used instead of Coward writing an original score. He did contribute one number however 20th Century Blues which was a whole commentary unto itself of the roaring twenties.Although at that point in time our history in the USA certainly does connect with the United Kingdom's during World War I for the most part Cavalcade deals strictly with British subject matter. I'm afraid unless one is a fan of Noel Coward or is familiar with 20th Century British history it's hard for today's audience to appreciate Cavalcade.Cavalcade however was the Best Picture of 1933 and Frank Lloyd won for Best Director. He'd win another Oscar for Best Director on another but far different British subject in Mutiny on the Bounty. Diana Wynyard was nominated for Best Actress but lost to Katherine Hepburn for Morning Glory.Two other good performances are Una O'Connor and Herbert Mundin as Mrs. and Mr. Bridges. They are the downstairs in service couple to the upstairs Marryots. Both play far different parts than what we normally see of them. Most film fans remember Herbert Mundin as the meek mess man from Mutiny on the Bounty and Much the Miller from The Adventures of Robin Hood where he's paired with Una O'Connor. He's quite different here.Cavalcade is good but terribly dated. Still it should be seen and evaluated as a commentary of how the British saw themselves at the beginning of the Great Depression.".

	schema:reviewBody "Unlike the big Oscar winners of later decades the Best Pictures of the 1930s have largely been neglected the only notable exceptions being It Happened One Night and Gone with the Wind. Of them all Cavalcade is perhaps the most rarely remembered and if remembered at all frequently dismissed as a dated stagy melodrama a product of an embarrassing era in cinema's history that even film buffs tend to shy away from without even the added attraction of some precode naughtiness. But are bare legs innuendo and meanfaced gangsters the only things worth salvaging from this era? The accusations of staginess are not surprising Cavalcade being adapted from a Noel Coward play. But while Coward may have been a bit of a theatre snob with a naively upperclass attitude he is not as impenetrably British as he may appear at first glance. Although Cavalcade focuses ostensibly on the concerns of a typical welltodo English family Coward strings together his story from universally emotional events many of which would have related to the lives of people all over the world and most of which still bear a kick today. Granted Cavalcade's social conservatism and stiffupperlipped fustiness can be a little alienating but this is not a preachy movie and nothing is forced home or laid on too thickly. Besides Coward's warm humanism pervades even the most clichd of characters.The director is Frank Lloyd himself an unfairly forgotten man of old Hollywood. Many will not understand why Lloyd one an Oscar for his work on Cavalcade because he does not use any overt camera tricks but the truth is Lloyd is too much of a master to need any tricks. Many of the claims of stiltedness probably stem from the fact that Lloyd uses a lot of long and often static takes but there is still subtle and clever technique at work here. Take that first scene of Diana Wynyard and Clive Brook making their preparations for New Years Eve. A large chunk is done without a single edit yet with a few simple panning manoeuvres Lloyd's camera is smoothly changing the focus and keeping things feeling fresh at one point having Brook's face appear in the mirror then following her over to the table where the two of them stand with a garland of flowers framing the lower edge of the shot. Another director might have used a dozen cuts in the same scene but Lloyd does it with just one or two. And the great thing is you don't notice. Often he will shift our attention from one place to another but do it by having the camera follow a walking character to disguise the movement such as the father carrying off a crying child on the beach. In spite of this unostentatious approach the style is purely cinematic.To be fair however most of the accusations of theatricality fall upon the cast. I would however describe the performances here as being stereotyped rather than grandiosely hammy. Diana Wynyard was the only Oscar nominee for acting although she does little here but emote rather wetly. In her favour she does put a lot of expression into her small gestures and as the picture progresses she ages her character convincingly. More realistic turns however are given by Clive Brook and Irene Browne. The real surprise performance of the lot though is Herbert Mundin. In his many supporting roles Mundin typically played a bumbling yet lovable comedy character but here he is forceful passionate and rather moving. Had such a thing existed in 1933 he could have been in line for a Best Supporting Actor award.But aside from all these qualities why did Cavalcade of all things appeal to the Academy which was not exactly cosmopolitan in those days? The answer may be that the mood of the picture was very apt for the times. This was of course the height of the depression and despite appearances Cavalcade is a rather downbeat affair. The gung ho optimism of the Boer war is replaced by the bitter folly of the World War characters disappear from the narrative everyday life becomes increasingly impersonal until the final scenes are almost despairing. And yet this is not some tale of personal tragedy. Crowds are a constant presence in Cavalcade with Lloyd using them as a backdrop to a teary farewell the bookends to a scene or even just a noise heard through a window. In Coward's play characters are killed off in significant events making them symbolic of the losses of a nation. This is a story of great suffering but it is a story of collective suffering and this makes it comparable to the most poignant and affecting pictures of depressionera Hollywood.".

You won't forget this image.Sumptuously shot and beautifully directed the film is best when it is visual as it does suffer some of the sound problems associated with early talkies  and some of the acting is a little melodramatic.  Diana Wynard's performance alternates between magnificent and hammy constantly  suggesting she was a little uncertain how to act for the camera.  And look out quickly for an early portrayal of a gay male couple snuck in by Coward I suspect!.But this film is astonishingly relevant to us as we move into a new century. Let's not repeat the mistakes of the last.  Coward speaks to us strongly from the grave.".

You won't forget this image.Sumptuously shot and beautifully directed the film is best when it is visual as it does suffer some of the sound problems associated with early talkies  and some of the acting is a little melodramatic.  Diana Wynard's performance alternates between magnificent and hammy constantly  suggesting she was a little uncertain how to act for the camera.  And look out quickly for an early portrayal of a gay male couple snuck in by Coward I suspect!.But this film is astonishingly relevant to us as we move into a new century. Let's not repeat the mistakes of the last.  Coward speaks to us strongly from the grave.";

This stillborn chronicle of British life as experienced through the eyes of the wealthy Marryot family and their servants The Bridges spanning from 1899 through 1933 is instantly forgettable and tiresome and leaves nary a clich unplumbed. It plays like a Cliff Notes version of Upstairs Downstairs with none of the depth sophistication insight or wit from that later series. The screenplay inexplicably with Noel Coward as one of the writers is more concerned with integrating events from the time period into the mix than fleshing out the people with whom the viewer should ostensibly identify with most of the events flying past at such a speed that it is nearly impossible to have much of a reaction to them. When family members are lost it is difficult to much care as we have barely been introduced to them before they are sacrificed for the cause. Most of the scenes are stagy moments that seem lifted directly from a play to film brimming over with stilted dialogue and wooden performances. As the heads of the elegant Marryot family Diana Wynyard and especially Clive Brook are the quintessential caricatures of the stiffupperlip British couple who feel that no sacrifice is too great for the Empire. The final moments when they look back at the loss of their entire family and decide that it was all worth it so long at Merry Old England can carry on into the future is surely one of the most laughably delivered and flat conclusions of any acclaimed film.".

Not in any way snobbish the Marryots in fact have a very close relationship with their servants. But class is class and the class system declines to the point where the daughter Ursula Jeans of Ellen and Alfred Bridges O'Connor and Herbert Mundin becomes involved with her childhood playmate Joe Marryot Frank Lawton a sign that the world the Marryots knew is fading away. All three Marryot men are involved in the Boer War and two fight in World War I to the distress of Jane Marryot Wynyard who is the representative of the antiwar sentiment.There are other world events that touch the family as well the death of Queen Victoria and the sinking of the Titanic.The film is a bit on the slow side and spends more time on the early period than the later. Coward however with shots of men blinded in the Great War young men being shot etc. makes his point very well.My big quibble with this film is that it goes for 34 years. At the beginning the Marryots have young children. Even if the Mr. and Mrs. Marryot were 30 years old at the beginning of the film  why at the end of the movie did they look and act 90? It was hilarious as they're probably in their sixties. It goes to show how the concept of age has really changed.This film is okay but somehow not as involving or as good as David Lean's This Happy Breed which concerns a middleclass family post World War I to World War II  also written by Noel Coward. I think This Happy Breed has a better cast some of the acting in Cavalcade is a little stiff. Still there are some striking scenes.".

And on top of it all they were even taking advantage of the visual medium. The sets the ability to shoot on location the cinematography the lighting and down the road the color of the film itself all helped contribute all kinds of creative ways for these filmmakers to either make the impossible possible or reliving the past. King Kong a film that came out in 1933 is one of those films that accomplished this task and so much more.But unfortunately we're not reviewing King Kong today because it didn't win Best Picture. It wasn't even nominated. What won instead unfortunately was a film that made no attempt at all to take advantage of what film as a medium has to offer Cavalcade. Yeah they adapted one of the drollest of plays into a feature film and people actually loved it.What's the story? It's the life of an English couple from the New Years Eve of 1899 up until thenpresent day 1933 as they experience historical events include the Second Boer War the death of Queen Victoria the sinking of the Titanic and World War I among many other things. And within the nowreasonably short running time of 110 minutes then that means the film's going to be either exciting or rushed. This film is anything but exciting it's dull as a rock. There is absolutely no soul in this picture at all.And the picture is indeed rushed. These events are just glanced over for no good reason other than to show that they lived through them and they never seem to show how much they impacted them or the world around them. There's nothing interesting about these characters or this story whatsoever. And what's worse is that these events don't seem to impact the viewer in any way because those scenes are executed in a manner identical to those of a play you never see these events happen. Come on! We already had 2 War films win Best Picture in the past where's the budget? Where are the calamities? For a sentimental film this film sure does feel devoid of any real emotions.And that's why I call this film dull and soulless there's no logic or reason no critical thinking not even pure sentimental hogwash. At least all the previous nominees had a semblance of a soul this film doesn't. This film is completely static and unmoving to say the least. The acting is boring the characters are boring and the story is boring. There is nothing positive to say outside of the fact that the premise had promise. More extravagance to help these events leave a bigger impact about 20 or 30 more minutes added to the running time and more interesting characters. That is all that is needed to make this film any good. So while the film is pretty bad it is salvageable. I would just skip it if I were you. 2.5 out of 10 rounded up to 3 out of 10.".

Such a declaration reveals that their knowledge of motion pictures is limited. Greatest Show actually is an entertaining picture one cannot say the same for such early Oscar winners as Cimarron and Calvacade. While Cimarron at least has some value as a spectacle due to its depiction of the Oklahoma Land Rush Calvacade has no such redeeming virtues.This is simply the worst film ever to win a Best Picture Oscar. It is incredibly boring and primitively made. It is the epitome of the type of film that gives the early talkies such a bad name. The film should have been called Calcified rather than Calvacade. The photography stinks the acting is wooden and the story is so hackneyed that it would cause even the most devoted Masterpiece Theater fan to contemplate suicide.What is it about boring stilted English films about the upper middle class or the aristocracy that gives Hollywood hot rocks? Anthony Holden in his book Behind the Oscar 1993 quotes one wag as saying If there is anything that moves the ordinary American to uncontrollable tears it is the plight  the constant plight  of dear old England.

Noel Coward was a genius anyway but in 1930 he wrote a play Cavalcade in which the first decades of the twentieth century were refracted through the eyes of two families in London one upper class one lower who go through lives punctuated by births marriages and deaths against a backdrop of major events. It was a brilliant concept and Coward liked it so much he did it again nine years later in This Happy Breed but more than this others jumped on the bandwagon not least Upstairs Downstairs which even borrowed Coward's coup de theatre of having a honeymoon couple deliriously happy talking and planning in front of a ship's lifebelt and moving away to disclose the name of the ship Titanic and later still Downton Abbey like the man said there's nothing new under the sun. To watch a film shot in 1933 in 2017 is to expect the worst but Coward's superb craftsmanship holds up remarkably well he was a super patriot and he wears his patriotism proudly. It reeks with the kind of chauvinistic sentiment that writers today are either ashamed to display or no longer feel having lost an empire. Three cheers for Coward.".

This is reenforced with the use of the medieval cavalcade to indicate the march of history. As a piece of writing this is a deeply unconventional film in structure but that unconventionality is put to service of some deeply conservative themes. It's the deep traditions that this film celebrates especially God and Country. Note how the troubled times sequence is focused on gasp atheists!Visually this film is breathtaking. Lloyd had a keen eye for composition and the visual grandeur of the film really helps with its epic scope and feel. I especially was impressed with the Zeppelin attack sequence and the WWI montage. I don't think I have seen the meat grinder of war portrayed like that before.The acting is uniformly excellent. That really helps with the lacking of narrative drive. And I think the actors made their characters feel alive with minimum screen time. This is a weird film but there is one thing it is perfect at.

Like many of the films to be recognized by the Academy in the early years of sound it's creakier and much less cinematic than any number of much better films in any given year that were completely or almost ignored but Oscar has a long legacy of passing over the truly worthy for the mediocre so it doesn't much surprise me that Cavalcade won the Best Picture Oscar over far better nominees like I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang and 42nd Street.Frank Lloyd won the Best Director Oscar for the second time for his efforts on this film and the many sets needed to give the film its historical sweep won William Darling the award for Best Art Direction.

She performs the role as if she's on stage understandable given that the material originated as a play but still...plenty of other actresses at the time Barbara Stanwyck Norma Shearer Jean Harlow knew how to give performances on film that were unique to the medium.Grade B".

The relationship of our protagonists is mirrored by the incestuous and equally ardent love between a nobleman and his sister played by the beautiful Laura Antonelli.Belmondo certainly not a great actor is perfect in this film because he plays not a hero but someone who often can't act but simply has to react with a blank and uncomprehending face to the strange events that take place around him for example there is one scene in court where he is sentenced to death within minutes. I have seen this film many times and am still amazed by the sheer pace of it. The script is brilliant and one of its most beautiful features is the triptychlike structure curiously about at the same time Stanley Kubrick made his own triptych masterpiece A Clockwork Orange First the prologue then the first part leading to the centerpiece and climax of the film then the third part being a mirror image of the first dissolving with a stylish transition to the short and sweet epilogue that in itself is a mirror image of the prologue Although many years have passed nothing has really changed.

	schema:reviewBody "Enjoyable fastmoving comic and romantic drama set in the USA and France during the eventful year of 1793. Central to it is the stormy relationship between Nicolas Phillibert JeanPaul Belmondo and his childhood sweetheart Charlotte Marlne Jobert daughter of a wine merchant in the port of Nantes. The ups and downs of their rocky marriage and of their temptation by others are played out against the much greater dramas engulfing France. We see the Reign of Terror raging with kangaroo courts drowned corpses in the river and royalists carted off to the guillotine. We also see the royalist counterrevolutionaries at war against the new rgime in the Vende. Finally we see the Soldiers of Year II the mass levy raised to fight the Austrian invaders. Much of the film was shot in the unspoiled Romanian countryside using thousands of soldiers with authentic weapons and kit. As a recreation of a complex historical time as well as a humorous exploration of a quirky couple's on and off relationship the film is constantly exciting. Belmondo gives us his usual action man indulging in continual fights chases and dramatic escapes while exuding manly charm. Jobert shines as his spirited wife switching from combative to coquettish in less than an instant but collapsing in a swoon if caught out. Smaller roles are well fleshed out so we continually meet interesting and original characters while the score by Michel Legrand adds an often ironic period flavour. Recommended!".

However during the ceremony an unkind soul points out that Nicolas has a legitimate spouse back home in his country of origin. When the dust has settled Nicolas decides to travel back to France in order to obtain an official divorce from his wife Charlotte. This is not going to be easy since the French Revolution is still moving at a good clip complete with battles trials and bloodbaths. Meanwhile Charlotte has shacked up with a dashing marquis who wants to restore the monarchy... This is one of the great French classics. There are many things to like about the movie  the funny twisty story the superb costumes and the rousing musical score with its many clever references to the historical era. The main attraction however is the Jobert  Belmondo combination which in the early 1970's must have meant box office gold and which even nowadays provides the viewer with a great deal of fun. Jobert is in charge of charm frivolity and smallboned fragility while Belmondo who is in great swashbuckling shape takes care of the countless fistfights stunts and escapes. Together they are pretty near irresistable. Still it needs to be said that this is not your runofthemill comical adventure movie. To begin with during the first half of the movie the Charlotte character is living together with a handsome and charismatic young aristocrat. The young man who is gallant and dashing has a beautiful young sister who is also gallant and dashing. After some adventures brother and sister decide to ditch their respective lovers and admirers since they are each other's great love. French aristocracy was indeed inbred but this is taking things to a whole new level... Secondly it was a very unusual idea to set such a light sunny story in such a dark period of history. In the movie the juxtaposition pays off mostly but one cannot shake the idea that most reallife Frenchmen of whatever origins or convictions went through a living hell. As a child I had a little playmate who had a French family name and who did indeed descend from a French ancestor. The said ancestor had fled all the way to Belgium under a variety of aliases after having been condemned to death during the French Revolution. His great crime was this  as an infant he had been baptized something like Aim Dieudonn Leroy Wellbeloved GivenbyGod King. This was an inoffensive traditional name but some twenty years later it could qualify as treason against the State.

	schema:reviewBody "Hum Aapke ... is basically a case of real talent gone to waste.

At the end Kajol's character still remained misunderstood.

It seemed as though he decided to go back to his wife not because he fell in love with her but because of the gratitude he felt towards her which does not address the void Kajol's character was feeling throughout the movie.  A potentially good plot gone to waste.The comedic subplot was repetitive and completely unrelated to the movie hint keep your thumb on the fastforward button.The songs are mediocre at best and the first one which includes a Hindi rap is off the charts as far as horrid music goes.  This movie is worth a watch only if your other choices are unavailable.".

The storyline was good something a viewer wouldn't expect from a bollywood movie. But in the end there truly was something missing. Maybe it was the fact that i never felt Vijay's love for Megha! We couldn't see it through his acting and that let down the movie a lot because we could see the love in Megha's eyes even after she was sacked from her job. Overall something people would enjoy. A definite tear jerker i must admit. Overall OK songs except for the first one that was a poor poor effort.

	schema:reviewBody "Legendary Swedish director Ingmar Bergman's probable precursor to Wes Craven's notorious 1972 shocker 'The Last House on the Left' is a far more compelling and emotionally draining film that adroitly and continuously switches the viewers sentiments up until the despondent tranquil and haunting ending. While one minute the viewer is laughing along with the youthful if nave exuberance of the young Karin Birgitta Petterssen the following minute will encourage different emotions as Bergman plunges the viewer into the middle of a nightmarish crime perpetrated by nothing less than the evil inside man. Although the portrayals of the acts committed in 'The Virgin Spring' are far less graphic than the modern viewer may have become accustomed to they still retain an immense power to horrify as one cannot ignore the great lengths Bergman has gone to in order to give his characters a base in order to harden the impact of what we see. With just the simplest of dialogue the viewer continues to learn about the relationships and personalities of each of the characters so that we may appreciate the consequences and in some ways forgive the actions that we see. This film is after all a tale of morality and repentance and therefore even while in some cases the actions may be evil it is necessary to accept the goodness that is still there. This thought is made no clearer than during the solemn and subdued final scene which fades out abruptly and leaves the viewer in a state of quiet reflection.Bergman's pacing and subtle direction which at one point leaves the viewer in suspense for what seems like an eternity is surely the reason for the greatness of this film. As if he were playing chess he manipulates not only the characters but the emotions of the viewers with intelligent and surprising maneuvers while pressing home his own sentiments regarding the story so that we may at least take into great consideration the events that we have seen. Bergman has an amazing ability to flip the atmosphere of a movie in a split second using various lighting and camera angle techniques as well as motivating his performers to follow suit. The simple expression changes on the faces of Birgitta Petterssen Max von Sydow Birgitta Valberg and Gunnel Lindblom at various points throughout the film quickly alter the mindset of the viewer and indicate that all is not well so beautiful in undeniable simplicity.'The Virgin Spring' is nothing short of a masterpiece and a film that few will be able to forget. 910".

Bergman pulls no punches the medaeval world he shows is a hard harsh bleak place. There is a sense of menace in almost every scene and the actual rape is graphic and nearly unwatchable. The characters are not finely drawn but after all this is a fairy tale in the older mould. They are there to represent types and conditions. The sad doting mother the unbending Christian gentleman the flawed cleric the ferocious deceitful rapistmurderers. The tale on one level is very simple and can be simply followed jealous sister curses more favoured sister favoured sister is cruelly killed killers ironically claim refuge of her father father exacts revenge on them. So far we have something that could have come out of many a European ballad tradition. However on another level it contains fundamental comments on humanity and human behaviour Christian moral theology and our reaction to it. The father's faith is tested he is not the man he thinks he is and his religion is not what he thinks it is either though he submits and adopts a position of blind hope. The killers represent the complete absence of good that Aquinas maintained was the definition of evil. The young brother is the pain of conscience. In many ways it is a play on the deadly sins apart from gluttony they are all there wrath on the part of the father and pride in his daughter envy in the halfsister lust and avarice in the herdsmen and so on. It is truly an exemplary tale as a medaeval legend should be. I bought this film casually at a street stall in Taipei for an absurdly small amount of money and it lay on a shelf unwatched for quite some time. In a bored moment one night I slipped it in the player and found myself enthralled until the finish. The cinematography of course is excellent but the joy is the dark threat that filigrees it the simple but powerful emotions both quietly and violently displayed. It lacks the grandeur of The Seventh Seal. It's a smaller and more compact number but it some ways the better for it the evocations are more direct and the violence unnerving. I recommend it very highly indeed you will be thinking on its themes long after this simple little tale finishes.".

	schema:headline "  VIRGIN SPRING is a spellbinding masterpiece by the great Ingmar Bergman with awesome cinematography by Sven Nykvist";
	schema:reviewBody "The picture is set in Sweden  during the Dark Ages  14thcentury . This the story about a young naive virgin named Karin Petterson who's sent by her parents Max Von Sidow and Birgitta Valverg towards a church to hand over candles for the holy Virgin . She's accompanied by Inger Gunner Lindblon  a pregnant and envious young . They meet a group of peasants and the young virgin is cruelly raped whose images in some countries were rated R. Later on  the killers ask for help and shelter from the parents .The movie displays haunting and powerful scenes  it's plenty of images which stay forever in mind . Although it is sometimes slow moving  however  the thoughtful screenplay is narrated with intelligence and sensitivity but here are developed ethic and moral issues just like death  God  religion and vengeance . The movie realizes an excellent reunion of Swedish actors with usual Bergman's players Sidow and Lindblon  among others showing the different characters and exploring their apprehensions  ambitions  fears and circumstances .

This the story about a young naive virgin named Karin Petterson who's sent by her parents Max Von Sidow and Birgitta Valverg towards a church to hand over candles for the holy Virgin . She's accompanied by Inger Gunner Lindblon  a pregnant and envious young . They meet a group of peasants and the young virgin is cruelly raped whose images in some countries were rated R. Later on  the killers ask for help and shelter from the parents .The movie displays haunting and powerful scenes  it's plenty of images which stay forever in mind . Although it is sometimes slow moving  however  the thoughtful screenplay is narrated with intelligence and sensitivity but here are developed ethic and moral issues just like death  God  religion and vengeance . The movie realizes an excellent reunion of Swedish actors with usual Bergman's players Sidow and Lindblon  among others showing the different characters and exploring their apprehensions  ambitions  fears and circumstances . Glimmer and riveting cinematography by Sven Nykvist he won an Oscar for Fanny and Alexander  he's deemed by many to be one of the world's greatest cameramen  he achieved give the movies on the most natural and simplest look imaginable  he replaced Gunner Fischer The seventh seal as Bergman's cinematographer .

Max von Sydow plays the father who is a Godfearing believer yet finds himself overcome by his own sweet desire for revenge against those who wronged his little girl. I am happy to say I appreciated Ingmar Bergman's genius just by this movie alone. It's a visually beautiful piece to look at but also with a story and strong convictions. So much is said without really needing to go overboard. I can see there is a recurring theme in his work where he questions the existence of God or at least the complicated ways in which God works things out on Earth. I'm not sure whether Bergman was a fullblooded atheist or not at this point but I'd suspect he was at least a questioning agnostic. I'm sure this is partly why Woody Allen is so enamored with the director as a similar religious thread runs through some of Allen's own movies. For the record I am a strong believer in God though these days I too have been faced with personal issues which have had me having difficulties in understanding much like the father of THE VIRGIN SPRING. So this movie also touches a personal nerve within me.

Just because it is doesn't mean the story although a legend is not worth telling. The murdered girl is just like a dear friend of mine so it's particularly distressing to sit through. I can see where Tarkovsky got his floating pollen from or maybe both he and Bergman were influenced by Dreyer. Great scenes include the guilty boy staring up at the stars while a grandfather torments him with a speech about conscience and the cruelty of the heavens and Sydow's stabbing of one of his daughter's killers. It happens unsparingly in front of the camera and is absolutely searing and indelibly imprints itself upon the memory as it shows the slow hard reality of taking a man's life from him. Sydow is also superlative after he has killed the child and stares down at his hands unable to reconcile them as being his own. He brilliantly conveys a man who expected to be rewarded for his virtuous life in service of the lord and his bitterness over God's perceived betrayal. Or is it about betraying ones self?Bergman admitted that the ending with the spring was somewhat tacked on and over didactic even bogus as he had already said what he had wanted to say on the matter of religion in previous films and that the matter was 'closed' in his mind to a certain extent. Perhaps this is why Kael questioned whether the film really needed to exist. I can't answer that one but it is a film of authority and power which makes you question what you would do in similar circumstances and how you might reconcile your actions with your faith. Leaving aside the religious issue which Bergman does appear to be half hearted about it unquestionably sides itself with the need for forgiveness and the moral duty to do good. Recommended and great performances.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Virgin Spring is a film so graceful subtle and omniscient that when we experience powerfully emotional moments we haven't even expected them and when we have it's already hit us. With every detail of every department the result is utter simplicity utter docility no fluctuation in the face of whatever brutality or emotional quakes making them all that much more profoundly moving. The story reveals and illustrates the characters up until the fatal flaw causes the end of the movie to be inevitable but we never saw that particular element that way because everything is utterly natural.Its pitchperfect genuine bloom is the effect of the film being pared down to its barest intentions. And these are not only fundamental questions but fundamental questions in a time and place in history where needs and desires were purely fundamental. The characters existing in medieval Sweden could have no concept of how complicated human beings' intentions could be as they are in modern times. It begins with a prosperous Christian whose daughter Karin played by Birgitta Pattersson is appointed to bring candles to the church. This is a big deal around here. Karin is accompanied by her pregnant foster sister Ingeri played by Gunnel Lindblom who secretly worships a Norse pagan God. What conflict! What happens from there I will not say. But anywhere you may read about this film you will see that it was the basis for Wes Craven's exploitation flick The Last House on the Left but in that exploitation of a genuine bloom of grace the ensuing turning points in the plot achieve the exact opposite effect in every way I've explained. When you see The Virgin Spring you will be presented with people who search for the same answers and consolations most of us still seek today. Even if a viewer would sooner find themselves watching Craven's film than anything by Ingmar Bergman once they would get around to The Virgin Spring they'd find themselves subjected to an unexpected and wholly memorable experience more rare than the later film.Max Von Sydow's performance is truly unforgettable in every sense of the word burning every line of his ultimate soliloquy into you with an impact lasting longer than the movie or the day you see it. He is a giant unabashedly masculine yet incapable of artifice. Even so he stands out no more than any other actor all of whom beautifully share the screen with one another which emboldens the impact of where his character goes.Ulla Isakkson's story yields a multitude of moral examinations in our minds. There are certain peculiar characters who have no human sympathy and are unashamed of a laundry list of barbarities. Bergman shows the Christian Orthodox family spending every waking moment preoccupied with purity altruism and decency in the eyes of the god they passionately look to with faith that the world they live in is inherently good and just. Their concept of evil is the notion of a Pagan god. How are they to act when crossing paths with the former set of characters?".

Her less fortunate pregnant step sister is asked to go along. While on their journey the step sister develops a fear of the forest and also complains of being sick. Karinthe privileged daughter has her stay with a hermit in the forest while she continues the journey alone. Along the way she runs into a three goatherdstwo man and a young boy who are brothers. They complain of being hungry due to their long journey so out of kindness she offers to picnic with them in which she shares her bread with them. The two man proceed to rape her and then kill her while the young boy watches helpless. Her step sister had left the cabin where she was staying and witnessed the whole thing but did nothing to help Karin. By chance the three brothers turn up at Karin's parents farm. The herdsman tries to sell Karin's valuable garments that they had removed from her to her mother. This leads the father to take revenge on the herdsman.This is a film I would strongly recommend to anyone especially lovers of classic cinema. The only other Bergman film I have seen is The Seventh Seal which is also outstanding. This film was extremely troubling to me not only because of the brutal act but also because Karin did not deserve this. We have a young innocent naive girl whose trust was betrayed. In this film we see the dynamics of these two sisters. Karin was privileged and spoiled by her parents especially her mother. Her father is more stern but she is still able to break him down with her charm. The step sister is of a much lower stature. She works as a servant and farm hand while Karin doesn't have to do any work. As a result the step sister has a strong resentment toward Karin. Unlike the Cinderella storey Karin is very kind to Ingeri her step sister. She is also very concerned for her as a result of her being pregnant. When she comes across the herdsman being from the wealthy upper class she could have easily blown them off but instead she spends time with them and offers them her food only to get violated and murdered in return. In actuality seeing three menwhile two men and a boy in the forest should have caused her to run away. As an example of her gullibility right before she is about to be raped the men say things like what white hands you have and she replies buy saying something to the likes of because a princess never has to work then they proceed by saying What a lovely neck you have while sitting very close to her. She than says something to the likes of I am going to be way off here! how else can a lovely princes wear her bracelets. She then goes on to tell them about their farm and her well to do life. She is not saying all this in a stuck up way trying to brag. Again she is a very naive girl who has lived like a princes. She expects the men to share her enthusiasm! The step sister did not do anything possibly out of resentment to her step sister or it could have been out of fear. When the herdsman arrive at Karin's parents farm and her father finds out what they have done to Karin he kills them including the boy. This is another very tragic part of the movie. Like Karin the boy was also innocent. He had nothing to do with the rape and murder of Karin. One could argue that he could have stopped his brothers instead of just watching. In reality their is absolutely nothing he could have done. His older brothers are grown men while he is just a small boy. As a matter of fact they physically abuse him. Not only is the boy a victim like Karin but he is also an outcast like Ingeri the step sister. He is treated bad by his brothers and Ingeri is treated bad by her family although not by Karin. After Torethe father kills the two man and goes after the boy he runs to Mareta the mother for protection. She tries to protect him from Tore but is unable to do so and the father proceeds to kill him.Tore immediately feels remorse for what he had done. The parents and farm hands go to find Karin's body led by Ingeri. When Mareta lifts Karins body from the ground a spring arises from the site. Tore vows to God to build a church there.".

	schema:reviewBody "This small film may not be as ambitious as Bergman's more renowned The Seventh Seal but I have seen so many movies from throughout history and I have seen very very few that affected me so deeply.  It is such a simple story but Bergman's direction makes it a film that stays with viewers forever.The opening shot of the frightening Ingeri is chilling.  We don't know anything yet about any of the characters or the story yet this is still scary because of the dark lighting and the actress's brilliant mannerisms. Ingeri clearly looks possessed and when we find out later that she placed a horrifying curse on Karin it makes sense.  The use of lighting and imagery throughout the movie is incredible.  When Karin  was first introduced I immediately fell in love with her.  She was so gentle and so caring and looked like an angel especially with the way shots of her were lit.  She invites Ingeri to go to the church with her because Ingeri doesn't get to go out much.  This review contains spoilers When the story reaches the woods Karin's sweet innocent nature is further established when she gives much of her food to the swineherds and gives them company.  Knowing what was going to happen made this scene unbearably tense and of course that gets much worse when Karin realizes their intention and tries to escape but is cornered and then falls over a branch and is left vulnerable.  The camera cuts away but next we see the men after having laid her on the ground lifting up her legs and spreading them apart. That's certainly not graphic compared to some things we see nowadays but I found it devastating to watch because it was Karin such a beautiful girl who deserved nothing of this sort.  While Karin is getting raped we see Ingeri across the river holding a stone at first but then letting it fall and simply watching contentedly as Karin continues to get violated.  With all the sincere kindness Karin has show Ingeri the hatred she receives in return is absolutely appalling.   Then we see Karin get up after the rape and her dirty tear stroked face is such an awful contrast to the smiling picture of beauty we saw earlier.  As if taking away her purity wasn't enough one of the men picks up a huge stick and strikes a fatal blow to her head and then they steal her dress. Bergman's miseenscene throughout this scene is outstanding.Later after Tore finds out the truth about his guests the scene with him preparing for his bloody revenge will scare even the most jaded viewer.  The miseenscene is once again amazing during the murders especially the use of the fire.  After he is subdued by his horror at his own rage I was moved by Mareta's quietly saying Let us go find Karin.  Karin's dead unclothed body with her eyes chewed out by buzzards is one of the most unforgettable images in a movie absolutely packed with them.  When Tore picked up the body and the spring magically appeared it put a bittersweet smile on my face as though God was saying everything would be okay.  The final shot with Tore asking God for forgiveness as he had the body of his only child was moving beyond words.  I've read criticism of the ending as some feel the spring didn't belong and it was not like Bergman to include something affirming a belief in God like that.  If it had not been there the film would have been that much more cryptic but I feel it was incredible either way.  I actually woke up in the middle of the night after I watched this movie recalling images after that rape and thinking I can't believe those monsters did something so horrible to such an innocent young girl but then I reminded myself that the film is teaching us not to be full of hate and vengeance.  I compared the rape images to the one of Tore murdering that young boy.  Wes Craven's horrible remake Last House on the Left used the tagline Keep telling yourself 'It's only a movie' but this is the film that needs that tagline.  I had to tell myself that to keep from being depressed.  This one movie is enough to show why Ingmar Bergman is considered a filmmaking immortal.".

As the rape begins to encroach as a reality you fight as hard as Karin did against believing that such a thing could really happen to one so pure.

For instance I am not sure what exactly was being said about Christianity or religion in general in this film. It ends quite proChristian where one would expect a Bergman film to be ambiguous about this subject. I must contemplate it further but also like his other films I never expect to understand it fully. Thus I could theoretically watch all of his films as many times as possible and I would still get something from them. Anyway I would just like to say that if you are a Bergman enthusiast you have to see this film. Just be prepared to feel sick during your viewing. 1010".

	schema:reviewBody "I don't know why but it has seemed to me that Ingmar Bergman's reputation was in a type of eclipse in recent years. Except for Woody Allen an admitted active admirer no recent director of stature suggested that he or she were influenced by Bergman. It did not help that his last major work FANNY AND ALEXANDRA dated from the early 1980s and that for many years he concentrated on theater work. Still that string of masterpieces he produced in the 1950s through 1970s was astounding doing much to establish Swedish cinema as a major force in film at the time. But the choice was Bergman's  he may have felt that nothing further existed to discuss in terms of film stock.One thing I liked about Bergman's classics VIRGIN SPRING and THE SEVENTH SEAL was that those were two of the few films of real note and strength dealing with the Scandanavian world of the Middle Ages. Of course Bergman was doing more than just making two historical films just like SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT is more than just a look at life in the 19th Century in Sweden. Bergman tackled the major philosophical problems of man in his films. His handling of those issues make them all relevant.The issue here is the loss of innocence. Max von Sydow in a terrific performance is a wealthy farm owner named Tore married to one Maretta Brigitta Valberg who have had many children  but only the youngest one Karin  Brigitta Petterson has survived. She is the idol of their eyes but she favors her father more than the mother  much to Maretta's quiet sorrow. But despite a typical Christian form prayers before ritual family  farm workers meals gifts of cheeses to the local church von Sydow is a hypocrite. He has had an affair with a servant producing a good looking daughter Ingeri  Gunnel Lindblom but she is an unwanted bastard child and must be beneath the salt with the other servants von Sydow apparently feels he is doing his due to this child by giving her food clothes and a home although only if she works for it!.Ingeri naturally resents the petting of her halfsister Karin. But she has no real option against the situation. Karin is sent with Ingeri to deliver gifts of candles and cheese to the local church. The film shows how the girls quarrel finally all of Ingeri's resentments come to the surface and she deserts the other. Karin does not care nor does she note that it is not safe for wealthy young women to travel alone on roads in 1200 or so. She meets three herdsmen brothers a talkative blond  Axel Daberg a sinister bearded brunette  Tor Luda and a silent boy  Ove Porath who pretend to be friendly and have lunch with her. Shortly after they rape her the blond and the bearded ones while the boy watches and then one of them kills her with a heavy tree branch. Across the river watching the whole tragedy is Ingeri who is fascinated but does not aid her halfsister.The film's remainder is how the murderers turn up at von Sydow's farm for food not realizing who came from there. They spin a series of lies to their hosts both Tore and Mareta are very anxious because their daughter should have been back by now. But they feed the three despite the obvious emotional turmoil of the youngest  the boy  who can't eat and offer the two oldest work. Everyone is going to sleep when Ingeri returns and tells what happened. Tore acts carefully  he has already been made suspicious by the behavior of the boy and by the stupid act of the blond herdsman of offering family heirlooms of his dead sister to Mareta  who recognizes that they look like Karin's and shows them to Tore. Now he goes into the field and in his mounting fury rips down a young sapling symbolic of his lost daughter. It is in many ways the tragic center of the film  and the best remembered moment.Soon he confront the murderers and kills them  and then comes the irony as his fury leads to the killing of the boy a symbol like Karin of innocence. Even Mareta tries to save the boy. The rest of the film is how the family goes to find Karin's body and finds it. Tore asks God how he could allow his daughter to die like this and expect to be worshiped. But he still agrees to pray to this seemingly twisted deity even promising a church in repentance for his sins including the killing of the boy. As Tore lifts the dead Karin's body a spring of holy water starts flowing to cleanse the spot and the sins of the onlookers.There are nice little allegorical touches look at the bits dealing with a piece of bread that Ingeri packs for Kristin's lunch with a living toad  a sign of malevolence in medieval art. The toad reappears among the doomed rapists later on. The end result is that the indifference of God to right and wrong and the unhappy fates of the innocent Kristin and the boy is never settled accept by resignation and admission of powerlessness. Tore's punishment for his sins of the flesh and ignoring Ingeri is to accept God's indifference to him as much as Ingeri has to accept Tore's indifference to her.".

But they feed the three despite the obvious emotional turmoil of the youngest  the boy  who can't eat and offer the two oldest work. Everyone is going to sleep when Ingeri returns and tells what happened. Tore acts carefully  he has already been made suspicious by the behavior of the boy and by the stupid act of the blond herdsman of offering family heirlooms of his dead sister to Mareta  who recognizes that they look like Karin's and shows them to Tore. Now he goes into the field and in his mounting fury rips down a young sapling symbolic of his lost daughter. It is in many ways the tragic center of the film  and the best remembered moment.Soon he confront the murderers and kills them  and then comes the irony as his fury leads to the killing of the boy a symbol like Karin of innocence. Even Mareta tries to save the boy. The rest of the film is how the family goes to find Karin's body and finds it. Tore asks God how he could allow his daughter to die like this and expect to be worshiped. But he still agrees to pray to this seemingly twisted deity even promising a church in repentance for his sins including the killing of the boy. As Tore lifts the dead Karin's body a spring of holy water starts flowing to cleanse the spot and the sins of the onlookers.There are nice little allegorical touches look at the bits dealing with a piece of bread that Ingeri packs for Kristin's lunch with a living toad  a sign of malevolence in medieval art. The toad reappears among the doomed rapists later on. The end result is that the indifference of God to right and wrong and the unhappy fates of the innocent Kristin and the boy is never settled accept by resignation and admission of powerlessness. Tore's punishment for his sins of the flesh and ignoring Ingeri is to accept God's indifference to him as much as Ingeri has to accept Tore's indifference to her.";

	schema:reviewBody "In The Virgin Spring Ingmar Bergman returns to the Medieval Ages which he had brought to life before so beautifully in The Seventh Seal. Set on a farm we follow the beautiful Karin the adolescent daughter of the farmers Tre and Mreta as she travels with her halfsister Ingeri to church to deliver handmade candles in honor of the Virgin. On the way she crosses paths with a trio of herdsmen who rape her and kill her.By chance they end up in the farm of Karin's parents and although they're initially kindly received their own greed and behavior leads the parents to discover their crime and plot a terrible revenge. The plot give or take a few more situations is basically this. This one of the simplest movies I've seen by Bergman. It doesn't have the visual metaphors that The Seventh Seal has nor does it have the awkward behavior his characters indulge in like in Cries and Whispers. No it's a simple beautiful story about innocence lost revenge grief and coming to terms with one's own conception of existence.Like The Seventh Seal this movie focuses on deeply religious characters. God and religious rituals are present in the lives of the farmers and in many of their daily actions and they find comfort in the fact that God is watching and protecting them. But how does one reconcile this belief with the brutal murder of one's own daughter an innocent adolescent? That's the final question that haunts Tre and will surely haunt some viewers. Bergman like a true artist doesn't give an answer although he gives Tre some peace of mind at the end.Max von Sydow gives a great performance as Tre Gunnel Lindblom and Birgitta Valberg give amazing supporting performances. Without these actors who brought so much sorrow and compassion to the movie it wouldn't have been very good. A characterbased movie like this needs the best actors and I can't think of anyone better than Von Sydow when it comes to express emotions on screen.Ingmar Bergman is a director I respect but don't particularly love. I find his work most of the time depressing bleak and humorless. He focuses so much on the pain of existence that he forgets that existence is multifaceted and is always in flux it's bright as often as it's dark. That's why I love The Virgin Spring  it's a very humanist movie one that shows Man at his best and worst one that realises how complex and undefinable humans are. For me this is the purpose of a true artist.".

In other words it is not clear to me whether The Virgin Spring looks upon the simple faith of some fourteenth century peasants in the same way that parents will smile at their child's belief in Santa Claus or whether the movie actually shares that faith in God and encourages us to do likewise.Anyway as I said there is this fourteenth century family of Swedish peasants headed by Tre. His daughter is Karin who is a blonde virgin. Well her body may be pure but her soul is not. She is lazy vain and spoiled smug in the fact that she is so cute and adorable that she can do as she pleases. She has a foster sister Ingeri who is a brunette a bastard soon to give birth to a bastard of her own. The two of them set out for church to do something or other and on the way it turns out that the other night Karin was flirting with the man that got Ingeri pregnant. Though there is no hope that he will marry Ingeri yet Karin's dalliance with him infuriates Ingeri. Just to rub it in Karin taunts Ingeri for no longer being a virgin while gloating over the way she will someday be married in all her virginal purity. She really made my flesh crawl.They get separated and soon after Karin comes upon three goat herders that rape and murder her. They strip her body of her beautiful clothes. Later they ask for lodging at Tre's house not realizing he is Karin's father. That night they present Karin's clothing to her mother as a gift saying it belonged to their sister. She tells Tre about it. He asks Ingeri what she knows and she admits that she witnessed the rape and murder and feels guilty because she wanted Karin to get her comeuppance. Tre then murders the three goat herders one of whom was just a boy who had nothing to do with what happened to Karin. Then Tre feels guilty for having committed murder. The whole family goes out to where Karin's body lies dead. When they find her Tre raises the ancient problem of evil asking why God let this happen and then let him commit murder while at the same time saying that he begs God's forgiveness.Now this is what I was talking about. Are we supposed to approve of Tre's attitude or should we be disgusted? I mean I'm disgusted. In fact it is even a little disgusting that he had to wait until his daughter was raped and murdered before questioning how an allpowerful loving God could let this happen. After all God has been standing by and letting girls get raped and murdered for centuries and it is only now when his daughter is a victim that he takes exception to God's indifference. So am I being disgusted with the movie or with the religion that this movie is premised upon?It gets worse. Tre promises to build a church on the spot where Karin died in hopes of being worthy of God's forgiveness. Then when they lift up her body water begins to gush from the ground where she lay becoming a spring. The family treats the water as if it is a miracle a replenishing gift from God. That's right. Karin's rape and murder have been worth it because now we are going to get a church with a little spring nearby. Perhaps I should point out that there is no shortage of water in that area the family having crossed a large stream on their way to get to Karin so it is not as though the spring will bring needed water to a parched region. It's just more water.Here we go again. I don't know whether we are supposed to regard that spring as a real miracle or not. If it is a miracle then we have to wonder as long as God was willing to perform a miracle why didn't he miraculously save Karin instead? If it is not a miracle are we supposed to despise or admire the family for thinking it is one?I give up. I'll have to let someone who actually believes in God tell me what I am supposed to make of this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "As part of my Bergman marathon some for the first time some for more I watched The Virgin Spring and was blown away. The film is not just a stark study of the cruelty and superstition of the Middle Ages but also a very powerful revenge story that is dripping with symbolism though not too much to overshadow the storytelling. The story may be bleak this is often considered one of Bergman's bleakest and most hardhitting films but always compelling and moving the ending especially is miraculous. As ever with Bergman The Virgin Spring is superbly directed and very atmospherically photographedI did have difficulty believing that this was Sven Nykvist's first collaboration with Bergman and I mean that as a compliment. It also has a haunting score and a thoughtprovoking screenplay. The scene with Karin being murdered is harrowing and I think it really stays with you. The acting also has a lot of intensity I especially want to single out Max Von Sydow who is magnetic in presence and equally telling in his facial expressions. Overall a brilliant film. 1010 Bethany Cox".

The film is not just a stark study of the cruelty and superstition of the Middle Ages but also a very powerful revenge story that is dripping with symbolism though not too much to overshadow the storytelling.

	schema:reviewBody "The tension and anxiety that this film induced in me kept me glued to my seat for the entire running time. On the surface it's a simple enough story. A lovely maiden sets out to bring candles to the church in the village. Only a virgin may do this. On the way she encounters two ruffians and a boy who persuade her to dally awhile. The girl naive on the threshold of womanhood with her whole life before her suggests a picnic where she spins fanciful tales of her being a princess. The two men don't believe the girl and inflict their brutality upon her. They strip her of her finery and bring it to sell at the dwelling of the local feudal knight who just happens to be her father. Big mistake.The story is set in a land where Christianity paganism and witchcraft compete for the hearts and minds of its inhabitants. Guilt and redemption are forefront in the tale as the leading characters ponder their part in the tragedy. There is a sense even early in the film when the girl delirious and rapturous is getting ready for the journey and working her guile and charm on her doting parents that no good is going to come of this. She's hated by her sister a surly wench a lost soul who accompanies the girl on her journey and witnesses the brutal events with carnal excitement. Indeed it's all downhill but once the knight Max von Sydow exacts his terrible revenge on the killers in a scene of horrifying intimate violence he  and the viewer  are plunged into hopelessness and chaos. Now the guilt has spread like a stain. How can man or God ever rectify this?The Virgin Spring did something very special for me something that few films do It transported me to another world. It created a time and place that was so completely realized and convincing that It seemed as if I was watching not a fictional creation but the real thing. I absolutely adored the mother her strength her love her serenity and couldn't take my eyes off her. For me the pivotal dramatic moment in the film was when she recognizes the bloodstained clothes of her daughter. The scene is heartwrenching as she struggles to maintain her composure and pretend that she doesn't recognize the garments.I'm adept at suspending disbelief but usually there's something that breaks the illusion I remember noticing in Marie Antoinette that there was no litter in the streets of the Paris slums. The settings in this film are astonishing in their detail intimacy and human scale. Sven Nykvist the photographer creates an early Spring in black and white that is crisp refreshing and beautiful.".

Finally one man having just seen his wife die with child is left.  Death Line is HIS story such as stories go.  And this is a sick story to boot.  The man grabs people unawares in the subway tunnel and drags them back home for supper...only they are the meat du jour.  The man has a huge wound on his head he mumbles mind the doors incessantly that is of course when he is not severing heads and drinking blood splitting someone's head down the middle with a shovel sticking a stake clear through someone's chest biting the heads off of rats and so on and continually drools long strands of saliva as he menaces and kills.  Now this is not a normal man to be sure.  The budget for the film was obviously limited but I think much was made with these limited resources. The director Sherman may have overdone the gore a bit but his use of the old tunnels as setting is very effective.  There are some wonderful and shockingfrightening scenes in this labyrinth of old no longer used tunnels where some moments the only sound her is a continual drip.  Despite the bizarre nature of the story the plot inconsistencies and the general lack of artistic appeal the film does have some fine points to offer.  As stated the sets contribute a very eerie and claustrophobic sense to the film.  The acting is generally good all around.  Donald Pleasance however makes the film a film worth seeing as he essays the role of a police inspector.  Pleasance chews up every scene he is in and plays his role with obvious relish.  He is a joy to behold.  As for Christopher Lee...well he is good in his five plus minutes of work..his role is totally devoid of any importance to the storyline however.".

Noone talks to each other on or off the underground everyone is miserable even the young student lovers have a fairly rocky relationship the man being totally lacking in compassion. The use of the genuine ghost stations of the London Underground is an excellent idea and even if the storyline is ludicrous it is handled with far more depth trhan your average slasher movie. The killer is a tragic figure and the scene where his beloved finally dies is shocking and heartbreaking. The special effects are nothing short of repulsive with particular attention being paid to the sound. It revels in gore and depravity unflinching but not exploitative. It runs like a modern day legend working on so many levels. The only thing which spoils the film is Donald Pleaseace hamming it up shamelessly in a badly characterised role which tries to offer comic relief but is simply irritating and unpleaseant. Look out for a remarkable tracking shot in the creature's lair early on and a lovely touch with the students enquiring about a book on Poltergeists more a mood device than anything to do with the plot. Seeing this is a cinema would certainly put you off your popcorn!".

The movie is also quite gruesome at timesthere's very little violence but there are long shots of decaying or halfeaten bodies and body parts.  Look for the sequence where a supposedly dead body can be seen blinking his eyes quite a bit!  Also there's a very disturbing near rape scene.The most amazing thing about the film is that the cannibal comes across as a sympathetic character!  He only kills for survivalnot for evil purposes. As for the actingPleasance is just great herehe attacks the role full force and is having a grand old time doing ithe really brings the film to life.  Gurney is very good as the English girl but Ladd is truly horrible as her boyfriend.  And those 70s hair and clothes!  Armstrong is as I said very sympathetic and also vicious as the cannibal.  Also Christopher Lee has an amusing short sequence in this.So it's gruesome but worth catching but it's shown very rarely on cable so good luck!".

But it did leave an impression that stayed with me all these years. Couldn't even pinpoint it really......up until now. After my rewatch I can say that it's still those four things but it's also a wellaccomplished genuine '70's shocker. And if you don't mind me saying so Donald Pleasance does steal the show as the straightforward be annoyed then if you don't like me  I don't care obnoxiously funny teadevouring police inspector Calhoun. I had quite some chuckles with the way he delivered his lines. It's all rather subtle mind you as this movie is anything but a comedy.If this film would have been made these days it undoubtedly would be up there with the works of Christopher Smith Michael J. Bassett and Neil Marshall. At least that's how I feel about it.For those days  and even up until this day in my humble opinion  DEATH LINE is pretty damn good  solid. Straightforward story. Vintage shockfeel to it. Capable cast. A good ending that proves sometimes a movie doesn't even have to have a drumrollin' climax to end it on the right note. And the most surprising thing was that the screenplay has a few moments where it takes the time to learn us a bit about the psychology and emotions of our cannibalistic brute. It tricks you into feeling sorry for him but witnessing his brutal acts conflict severely with this emotion. A nice touch that didn't even take up that much of the movie's running time. And the screenplay doesn't even forget that it did that making you feel something for the villain as near the end Sharon Gurney's character says one little thing that reminds you of all this. She understood it too.Speaking of Ms. Gurney For some reason I really liked her on the screen. What happened to her? As an actress you cannot fail to notice that she's got what it takes. And then she stopped acting in 1974? Anybody have any info on that perhaps?I'm trying hard to look for things that I didn't like possible big flaws or something but I just can't find any... I agree that DEATH LINE isn't the world's greatest horror film ever made but it sure must have hit the mark back in '72. One jumpscare still even worked on me! And the gory makeup effects were pretty darn excellent for that time. But there's only just enough of them in this movie so don't expect a splatterfest or anything. Christopher Lee has a fun cameo in it and Donald Pleasance just seems to love pulling his leg in that scene.Thankfully DEATH LINE has been restored and fully uncut released on DVD as RAW MEAT in the US. It deserves a wider recognition and I'm happy to see it's finally getting it.".

	schema:headline " Too slow and stretched out.";
	schema:reviewBody "Especially considering its potential this could had been a way better movie. It showed a promising concept with cannibals in the London underground and featured Donald Pleasence in the lead role. How could you go wrong with this?Problem is that the story doesn't move along quick enough and the events in the movie all feel rather stretched out. Some sequences and dialog are go on for far too long. But even with those extended overlong sequences the movie is still only 87 minutes short. I think this says something about the original script that just doesn't seem to offer enough. Jokes get used multiple times and some dialog seem to repeat itself over and over again. This also really takes away the pace out of the movie at times. It tries to bend its slowness in to their own advantage by making it part of the horrormystery buildup of the movie but it's even too slow for that. The movie simply misses the mark with that.Nothing wrong with the atmosphere though. It has a typical '70's fairly cheap looking British movie making like style all over it. The cinematography of the movie was also really good. It featured some great and 'experimental' different sort of compositions and was dark in a good and right required way.It's not the sort of horror movie with lots of scary moments but fans will be able to appreciate the uncomfortable dark atmosphere of the movie. Also on top of that the movie features some pretty gory moments.Donald Pleasence of course was a great leading man for this movie. He always seemed to add a certain amount of humor into his roles without ever loosing character credibility with this movie also as an example of that. Also Christopher Lee makes a great enjoyable small cameo appearance. Too bad that the movie also decided to throw in some other less interesting characters also played by some definite less capable actors.Not the best example of British horror from the '70's but the genre fans will probably still be able to enjoy it.510httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	onyx:emotionText "Especially considering its potential this could had been a way better movie. It showed a promising concept with cannibals in the London underground and featured Donald Pleasence in the lead role. How could you go wrong with this?Problem is that the story doesn't move along quick enough and the events in the movie all feel rather stretched out. Some sequences and dialog are go on for far too long. But even with those extended overlong sequences the movie is still only 87 minutes short. I think this says something about the original script that just doesn't seem to offer enough. Jokes get used multiple times and some dialog seem to repeat itself over and over again. This also really takes away the pace out of the movie at times. It tries to bend its slowness in to their own advantage by making it part of the horrormystery buildup of the movie but it's even too slow for that. The movie simply misses the mark with that.Nothing wrong with the atmosphere though. It has a typical '70's fairly cheap looking British movie making like style all over it.

The only interesting element of this otherwise unremarkable thriller is the 'humanisation' of the monster a thirdgeneration caveman living in squalor below Russell Square station. It's clear that he still has human emotions though he can't articulate them. His degradation to a semisavage is creepy rather than scary and the ending inspires none of the cathartic feelings of relief and triumph that horror films usually leave us with.".

People start disappearing but the ball only really gets rolling when a prominent public servant top character actor James Cossins vanishes. The chief police inspector on the case Calhoun Donald Pleasence realizes that he has his hands full but vows to stick it out despite the matter now being more in the domain of MI5.This marked the debut fictional theatrical feature for the young American director Gary Sherman who also came up with the story he went on to direct such nifty 1980s pictures as Dead  Buried and Vice Squad. He and his crew make excellent use of some extremely atmospheric locations. They're dark they're filthy and they're dripping with water. Death Line a.k.a. Raw Meat can take credit for bringing horror to the London tubes almost a decade before An American Werewolf in London. The makeup effects and gore are very well done and this is additionally blessed with a highly offbeat music score composed by Wil Malone and Jeremy Rose. The camerawork is utterly fantastic  wait for the approximately 10 minute sequence from about 23 minutes in to 33 minutes in for a memorable tracking shot showcasing the monsters' lair.It's well worth noting that our hideous killer is far from being malicious. He's really more pitiable than anything else especially as he goes into mourning at one point and tries to make a connection with lovely young Patricia Wilson Sharon Gurney uttering the only English words that he's ever managed to learn. You really feel his despair and sadness when it comes to his companion the Woman June Turner.Donald Pleasence is an absolute delight in our lead role playing the material with a heavy dose of humour. His Inspector Calhoun is hilariously surly and witty. David Ladd one of Alan Ladds' sons does okay as American student Alex Campbell but the character is pretty insensitive and hostile for a while only earning our sympathy towards the end. Gurney is highly appealing as his girlfriend. Top notch supporting players include Norman Rossington Clive Swift Heather Stoney Hugh Dickson and Ron Pember. Sir Christopher Lee is great fun to watch albeit kind of wasted in a cameo role as MI5 agent StrattonVilliers.Horror fans need to add this one to their watch list if they haven't seen it already. It's too good to pass up.Eight out of 10.".

	schema:reviewBody "Death Line is a horror movie that hits all kinds of unexpected notes on the horror scale. The film strikes deep into urban myth territory with its tale of something alive deep in an abandoned section of the London underground snatching hapless victims from a nearby subway station. It preys on our deepest fears regarding our vulnerability in such places. In one extraordinary tracking shot the film takes us alone into the lair of the beast. There we find a scene of incredible rot and decay including the manbeast himself himself decaying mourning the death of his only companion a pregnant woman. He emits a primal scream that raised the hairs on the back of my neck. This is classic horror reminiscent of films as diverse as The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Cronenberg's version of The Fly as well as tales of Appalachian inbreds. The monster that invokes both pity and dread. And yes there's a beauty involved. There is such pathos here that it actually augments the horror of the story. The lair itself is simply indescribable. I'm used to superior art direction in British horror films but this is a rare achievement. The other elements of the story the police procedural plot for example are relatively mundane though efficient and Christopher Lee makes a cameo appearance that stops the show. There's a genuine scare done without shock SFX but by using timing silence and suspense. Films like Death Line and Cronenberg's early lowbudget horror films are unique and ought to be cherished. You'd be hardpressed to do it the same way today. You'd want CGI creatures faster editing and more violence. The director of this film achieves a lot with little and all that's required of the viewer is to sit back and allow oneself to be drawn in. This movie is a real find.".

Placed alongside the new wave of US horrors the hip and socially relevant likes of Rosemary's Baby Night Of The Living Dead or Last House On The Left Hammer's Dracula and Frankenstein's monster seemed about as bloodcurdling as Hinge and Brackett.Unlike their US counterparts Brithorrors also endured disastrous relations with everybody from distributors downward. As with Robin Hardy's The Wicker Man Sherman's debut feature was left to rot by its own distributor Rank after almost uniformly negative reviews. It's been argued that had it been produced in the States subject to the same hellforleather marketing campaign enjoyed by Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre it would doubtless now occupy some benighted place in the horror pantheon. Well possibly.Chicagoborn Sherman had in fact found it difficult to get backing for the project in the States and hauled production over to London. Drawing inspiration from the legend of the interbreeding Sawney Bean clan the 18thcentury Scottish brigands who robbed and ate passing travellers Death Line sees Inspector Calhoun Pleasence and Sergeant Rogers Rossington investigating disappearances in Russell Square tube station. Prominent among these is one James Manfred OBE whose unconscious body  which later disappears  is discovered lying on the station's steps by a student couple American Alex an economics student and his British girlfriend Patricia.Courtesy of an extraordinary sevenminute tracking shot we shortly discover Manfred's fate deep within the bowels of the station a bearded 'thing' riddled with open sores and trailing ropes of drool is feasting on passengers  a food supply for him and his heavily pregnant 'wife'. This wordless unbroken shot of his lair filled with halfglimpsed skulls crawling maggots scuttling rats and meathooked cadavers is mostly the reason the critics got their knickers in such a twist it's a truly nightmarish vision intensely claustrophobic  but offset by the Man and his lover's pitiful circumstance.Though slow to act in the face of previous vanishings including a Jewish dentist and a Polish grocer from Kilburn Calhoun is rather more receptive to the issue of missing English diplomats. He soon uncovers a possible explanation behind the phenomenon. It transpires that in 1892 12 Victorian underground workers eight men and four women were left for dead after the section of tunnel they were working on collapsed. As London Transport CID man Bacon tells the bemused inspector The company went bankrupt. There was a bit of a stir at the time because no effort was made to rescue the trapped workers. Interbreeding for several generations the survivors staved off their hunger through a unique protein diet. Following the pathetic death of his wife the Man  whose dialogue consists of whines grunts and his learned cry of Mind the doors! has become the last remnant of this betrayed and forgotten humanity.StrattonVilliers from MI5 played by a bowlerhatted Christopher Lee wants a coverup. The reason Manfred had been travelling by tube was because he'd been caught short after visiting the vicepits of Soho while no government wants to admit culpability for deliberately abandoning its workers however long ago. Cocky Alex therefore becomes a potential scapegoat for Calhoun even after Pat is abducted by the murderous Man looking for another dietary supplement  or a new mate to breed with.As with a select handful of Brit horrors from the era  From Beyond The Grave The Abominable Dr Phibes Psychomania The Wicker Man and the wonderful Theatre Of Blood Death Line these days enjoys something of a modest but rabid cult following especially in America. Its influence on John Landis' An American Werewolf In London and especially London Underground shocker Creep is clear.Shot exclusively on location in the UK including Aldwych Tube Station it's one of the few UK horrors of the period focusing squarely on the national heritage and identity and its sophisticated political themes  the literal collapse of Empire class segregation and exploitation and high level corruption  were particularly relevant in the early 1970s an era mired in financial and vicebased scandals.It's also one of the few horror films in which our sympathies lie with the 'Monster' the Man can't help his animal instincts but 'humanity' comes off the worst. Civilisation is seen throughout to be lacking in comparison  a mildewed nation of racist sexist hypocritical bureaucrats bent coppers and jobsworths and in Alex's case totally lacking in compassion. On first discovering Manfred's prone body Alex advises Pat to simply step over it as he does back home on the New York subway. His chilly demeanour will drive Pat to temporarily split up with him a negative of the scenes played out 'down below' in which the Man displays a genuine heartbreaking grief following his wife's death.The dialogue is a joy and stems mostly from Pleasence's interplay with everyone within a 10yard scowling distance the kind of senior workingclass copper who instinctively mistrusts anyone he thinks is putting on airs and graces like educated Alex or his more refined underling Rossington. Courtesy of his antics we're propelled right back into the unreconstructed 1970s of 'The Sweeney' and 'Love Thy Neighbour'  with cultural conventions Sherman both acknowledges and deliciously sends up.And Pleasence is by far the most enjoyable thing in this a snuffling misanthrope constantly bawling for more tea! from his underemployed secretary and contemptuously flicking tea bags into the bin. If he's not advising Alex to hurry back to school  there might be a protest march for you to join he's shirking his duty and getting drunk down the pub with Rossington. Are you aware that our gracious Majesty is overseas in the farflung Empire flogging her pretty little guts out so you can live in a democracy? he drunkenly berates a publican trying to turf him out at closing time. It's totally hilarious.".

Civilisation is seen throughout to be lacking in comparison  a mildewed nation of racist sexist hypocritical bureaucrats bent coppers and jobsworths and in Alex's case totally lacking in compassion. On first discovering Manfred's prone body Alex advises Pat to simply step over it as he does back home on the New York subway. His chilly demeanour will drive Pat to temporarily split up with him a negative of the scenes played out 'down below' in which the Man displays a genuine heartbreaking grief following his wife's death.The dialogue is a joy and stems mostly from Pleasence's interplay with everyone within a 10yard scowling distance the kind of senior workingclass copper who instinctively mistrusts anyone he thinks is putting on airs and graces like educated Alex or his more refined underling Rossington. Courtesy of his antics we're propelled right back into the unreconstructed 1970s of 'The Sweeney' and 'Love Thy Neighbour'  with cultural conventions Sherman both acknowledges and deliciously sends up.And Pleasence is by far the most enjoyable thing in this a snuffling misanthrope constantly bawling for more tea! from his underemployed secretary and contemptuously flicking tea bags into the bin. If he's not advising Alex to hurry back to school  there might be a protest march for you to join he's shirking his duty and getting drunk down the pub with Rossington. Are you aware that our gracious Majesty is overseas in the farflung Empire flogging her pretty little guts out so you can live in a democracy? he drunkenly berates a publican trying to turf him out at closing time. It's totally hilarious.";

The cavernous underground system is exploited brilliantly for its unsettling potential and even at a short 84 minutes there's still time for the camera to linger about the darkest nooks and crannies in a couple of creepily extended sequences.The film shows well how society's attitude steadily becomes more callous with each passing year with the British according to the American being behind the U.S. but competing gamely all the time. Donald Pleasence is the audiences intermediary for this in perhaps the film's nicest surprise. I had no idea he could act so well given that I've only really seen him in the Halloween films and here he brings a welcome 'acerbic' nature to all the degradation he's forced to see in his job. If more of his lesser known films are as good as this then it would seem I'm in for a treat! I love it when a film unexpectedly delivers more than I'd anticipated.

While still on this side of the Atlantic we got to treated great Donald Pleasance performances in films such as The Flesh and the Fiends CulDeSac and this film! Death Line is an odd film as it handles a theme not often seen in horror cinema. The closest film I can think of to this one in terms of theme was the recent thriller 'Creep' which is pretty much the same although that film doesn't have the nasty nature and fetid atmosphere of Death Line! The story is very original and also rather terrifying. It handles the idea of a bunch of subway workers getting trapped in the tunnel after part of it collapsed. Rather than suffocating to death they were 'lucky' enough to find a pocket of air and survive for many years. The descendants ended up deformed as you'd expect from a people exclusively living underground and have taken to abducting and eating people unlucky enough to find themselves in the subway after dark. The last remaining descendant's life is shattered when his wife and unborn son die leaving him with the task of finding a new mate.Anyone who's ever been on the London Underground will know that it's generally very packed. I've never been down there during the night but if this film is to be believed  it's likely to be a very frightening place! Director Gary Sherman who went on to direct the imaginative Video Nasty 'Dead and Buried' in the early eighties draws atmosphere from this fact and manages to ensure that the film always feels very desolate which bodes well with the festering corpses that the director so enjoys depicting. The film is very British in style and tone and Donald Pleasance is the perfect leading man in this respect. He can become a little ridiculous at times but in general his role as the cynical and sarcastic police chief fits the film very well and usually manages to entertain. The film lays its cards with regards to the central plot theme on the table rather early but it's obvious by then anyway and the real surprise is nicely kept until the end. To criticise the film it has to be said that the plotting is sometimes a little too relaxed. There's a lot of standout scenes however  the grisly sequence that sees three men killed on the subway is the best of them  and the director manages to implement a lot of memorable images into the film. Overall Death Line is a forgotten gem and well worth checking out!".

There were most contemporary genre efforts mainly coming from Hammer Studio and Amicus exclusively tried to disgust their viewers with eerie monsters and sadistic murderers Gary Sherman's Death Line also aims for other much deeper sentiments. The basic premise of the film is quite horrific and extremely grim and most of the elaboration is suitably alike but the screenplay also dedicates a lot of time to showing the other much more tender side of the 'monster' hiding in a liarnetwork underneath the London Underground. When a couple of young students discover the nearly dead body of a Military Intelligence Officer at Russell Square station and report it to the police the investigation quickly gets stuck as the victim vanishes and his service attempts to cover up the mysterious disappearance. The cynic Inspector Calhoun against his will has to team up with the teenagers  he hates teenagers he actually hates everything  to unravel the secret of the London Underground. The audience finds out about this secret long before the protagonists do as we're informed about the story of tubeworkers trapped by a cavein at the end of the previous century and the subsequent subterranean culture they slowly developed. The last remaining inbred descendant has now tragically lost his wife and unborn child which forces him to leave his trusted hideout place and search for a new partner. The extended images of the underground liar are utterly repulsive with decomposed and halfdevoured cadavers rotting away all over the place but the cannibal himself is an oddly engaging and genuinely pitiable villain who treats his dying wife with rarely seen acts of patience and tenderness. He isn't the kind of deranged madman who hunts and butchers for no reason but an atypical kind of loving husband. Eventually the whole film actually becomes more saddening and moving instead of scary which is possibly the most unanticipated twist in a grisly 70's horror film EVER! Also Raw Meat is packed with an overload of brilliantly dry British humor and extremely clever dialogs. Donald Pleasance  what an amazingly versatile actor he was  is just perfect as the cynic Inspector whose investigation isn't really making any progress but his confidence in solving the case actually makes you believe he's a great policeman anyway. Inspector Calhoun is the funniest British stereotype ever depicted in a horror film an arrogant and negativeminded guy who drinks copious amounts of tea every day and suffers from a seemingly permanent cold. Writerdirector Gary Sherman greatly captures the atmosphere of workingclass Britain here with long and frustrating workdays ending with excessive drinking in the nearby pubs and good cops that are forced to cover up the truth regarding the whereabouts of prominent missing citizens. By the way for this otherwise irrelevant sub plot Christopher Lee makes a cameo appearance as a Military Intelligence officer. The pace sometimes feels a little slow and dreary mainly because there's very little action on screen but Sherman maintains a respectable tensionlevel and regularly provides an effective shocktwist. To my knowledge two other horror movies make use of the terrifically sinister London Underground setting. The Hammer classic Quatermass and the Pit although that one deals with alien invaders and the much more recent Creep which totally aims at gory special effects and nauseating murders. Raw Meat is highly recommended viewing for fans of vintage Brithorror.".

However after the show one of his partners played by Dick Wei decides that he doesn't want to go back to his country and during his getaway he accidentally kills a cop. Jet is wrongly accused of the crime gets arrested escapes and finds refuge in the home of a guy who had seen and admired him in the show while Dick becomes a wellpaid assassin in the service of a gangster. Through a few too many coincidences the paths of these two former friends cross again...Because so few people have seen Dragon Fight it hasn't even been released on DVD yet! there is a temptation to say that it's a hidden treasure in Jet Li's filmography. Well it isn't. It is a rather unremarkable movie. But what is remarkable about it is some of the fighting which is refreshingly realistic the word refreshingly goes for those who like me hate flyingfu. Jet Li is at his most youthful handsome and likable but Dragon Fight is almost as much Dick Wei's film as it is Jet's. This is the only time they worked together on a film and their final showdown is definitely worth waiting for. 12".

Wei quickly and I mean quickly works his way up the crime corporate ladder while Li gets a job as a stock boy. Who's gonna clash? You guessed it! This is an early film for both Li and Stephen Chow who plays the goofy sidekick who leads to everyone's death. Thankfully the film also includes the gawky Americans that THE MASTER had. Where do they find these people? Do they put up signs around town reading Do you speak English bugeyed with wild gestures? The best thing about the film are the fights which are thrown in every 10 minutes or so. The end showdown at a ranch between Wei and Li is quite good with lots of contact blows and beautiful weapon work. Sadly the next time Li worked on these shores the results weren't nearly as entertaining.".

However this should be no surprise this is how action films generally are.The fights were not the best I've seen but they're pretty good mostly gritty and realistic type fight scenes. I was a bit surprised because I thought this style only became popular much later when martial arts became a common element in American action films. For example some of Tiger's fights like the one where he choked the guy to kill him as opposed to using some sort of fancy looking kungfu technique. Because of that to me some of the choreography actually look sort of modern.Although I have to admit I was rooting for Tiger the whole time. Jet Li's character was too goodytwoshoe.".

Dick Wei wants out and while in America he runs away. Jet follows him and ends up getting taken in by the police for killing a cop. But Dick Wei is the one who killed the cop. Now Jet goes to prison but escapes on the way there. Dick Wei becomes a bigtime gangster and is doing fine in his new life. But Jet' becomes friends with Stephen Chow and Chow is always up to trouble and they end up getting in trouble with Dick Wei. After certain events happen which I don't want to spoil Jet goes to fight Dick Wei at the end of the movie.Stephen Chow does good in his role. Mostly comedy but also some drama. This is one of the few movies where you will see any dramatic acting from Chow. Not even a year after Dragon Fight came out is when he began starring in the movies that made him famous. The Year this was made 1989 Chow costarred in 3 movies no leading roles and he starred in 11 movies in 1990 being the lead actor in all 11.Jet Li is very young here and that is a BIG problem. This was only his 5th movie and he just hadn't become an actor yet. That didn't happen until his next movie Once Upon a Time In China. He just isn't able to diplay the anger he needs to show in the final fight. You know the staredown that happens between 2 former friends who now have to fight to the death. Dick Wei has that classic gangster look and he couldn't have given a more perfect facial expression in the staredown but Jet doesn't give anything back. His acting the whole movie is not even close to being on par with his later movies.This movie should be good but the story is badly done and that is the main reason why it is a bad movie. Another big problem is the choreography. While this movie is pretty terrible it does get good at the end well at least the choreography finally gets good. Dick Wei and Jet Li have a great fight against each other then they go off and have separate fights and then after that the dessert is Mark Williams vs Jet Li. Williams really gets to shine but it's only for about a minute. The only other movies I have seen him in are The Master with Jet Li and College Kickboxers a fun little movie which can be found in a 10pack called Bullet Wounds. I don't know why he wasn't in more movies. He kind of reminds me of Ron Van Clief with the way he acts and similar body build but their on screen fighting skills look a lot different. Van Clief's moves are much cleaner and he looks a lot more skilled but Mark Williams has got him beat in jumping kicks which is why I don't get why he wasn't in more movies. When you see his jumping kicks trust me you will be in awe.Now when you watch this you will see what I'm talking when I say the fights get better at the very end. Jet was the choreographer but by the end he was frustrated and Dick Wei took over at least I think that's the story I heard about it a long time ago. Dick Wei was not an action choreographer by any means but luckily he took the job on because without the final fights this movie probably would have gotten a 1 star rating.".

Unfortunately the Nazis eventually come and round up all Jewish families in the village. The final scene shows the boy watching as his parents are hauled away like cattle.I don't know whether or not Hitler's Third Reich was the most evil act in history there have been numerous genocides throughout the centuries. Maybe the Third Reich is different to the extent that Europe at least has had such a hard time getting over it. Some of the greatest movies The Great Dictator and Schindler's List for example have dealt with the Third Reich. The Revolt of Job certainly belongs in that number. After watching this movie you will never be able to forget what people went through in Hungary. It is truly a masterpiece.".

A recalcitrant and feisty little critter at first the boy learns to love his adoptive parents and learn from them as he begins to sense the ominous turbulence of life about him. The inevitable and utterly heartrending separation of the affectionate boy from his loving adoptive parents concludes this humane recollection by director Imre Gyongyassy who as a child had himself been adopted by a Jewish couple under similar circumstances.

A truly remarkable and irrepressible little boy is adopted by an old Jewish couple. I read that the director of the movie interviewed over 1000 children to find the little actor in this story. The movie is filmed in Hungary just before the Nazi invasion. The country village is colorful and charming. Yet one knows what is coming. The ominous foreboding is off set by the wonder of the relationships. He collects frogs in a bucket and accidentally lets the out in the kitchen. Then the fun of catching them. The couple teach this little gentile their rich Jewish traditions. And then the inevitable... As a gentile I found the Jewish life wonderful. And because of it have become hooked on Jewish film festivals. I love this film and want to see it again!".

Not operating with violent scenes or showing hordes of German soldiers or SScriminals gas chambers or concentration camps but every single minute of the movie is full with fear love and struggle for a future. The shepherd's stubborn fight against his own destiny and the destiny of his people filled with so much plain human depth what is almost unbearable. I saw men crying like babies watching this movie I must admit  I was one of them because its beauty and tragedy are simply not conceivable. You feel hopelessly lost and helpless but somehow being a better human being by the catharsis. The movie is also a trustworthy authentic and accurate testimony of the destiny of hundreds of thousands of Jews from the rural countryside in Hungary. A must see.".
