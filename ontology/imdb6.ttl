I think it's cool that she is so inviting with her fans and still appears to be downtoearth. The studio audience appears to be rather small but that just makes for a cozier environment. Some people have posted that the show sucks. I guess it depends on your own interpretation of it and of her. If you notice the early episodes of 30 Minute Meals you will see a completely different personality than in those of the past few years.

The set is appealing and there are some fresh ideas I love the lazy Susan that the audience sits on. There's just enough of a celebrity segment and she stays away from controversy and debate there's enough of that on daytime TV. The show is a lighthearted escape and she hasn't moved away from her strength cooking which is very good planning. I know there are people who hate her and hate her show that's OK you can't please everybody. And somehow I think Rachael knows and accepts that. So just turn the channel I don't think she'd mind.".

A segment tooting Rachael's own horn  i.e. I Lost 500 Pounds with Rach's Recipes Rachael Ray Saved my  Life Rachael's Fashion Tips. 5. A totally useless D.I.Y. tip i.e.  how to engrave words into casserole dishes how to use your washing  machine as a salad spinner how to build a tube of lipstick with a  light on it. 6. The unleashing of horrible recipe on the unsuspecting  audience reaction shots of first bites are never shown. 7. A  celebrity guest with an awkward interview followed by some obviously  scripted questions from the audience. 8. A person who gets help from  one of Rachael's cronies i.e. the I say yes to everything woman the I  own nothing but overalls lady and the I can't find time to put on  makeup housewife. What would they do without you Rachael. gasp  Reasons that this show should be avoided like the plague 1. Fakeness  Rachael Ray claims that entire show is unscripted. Many people who have  attended tapings of the show have claimed that the entire show is  scripted. Many of these same people have also mentioned that there is  even a very strict dress code for the show.   2. Her show jumps around too much Where as Oprah who is the highest  rated talk show host of all time has a definite theme for her show  Rachael's jumps around like an ADHD soda child on crack. Her show  averages perhaps 10 short worthless segments a show. On second you  will be getting fashion tips from Kojo and the next Rachael will be  making gross stuffed Spanish peppers with manchego cheese and the  next their will be a giant anaconda up on stage and the next well you  get the picture.  3. Rachael is a poor host with bad ideas Aside from her grating  personality Rachael's hosting ability is terrible at best. Her  questions for her celebrity guests are poor and often times not even  relevant to the interview and her segments are unappealing and offer  little educational or humorous value.  In conclusion you need not waste your time with this schlock. It will  be canceled soon anyways.".

	schema:reviewBody "My Architect by Nathaniel Kahn is that ancient story the search for a man's father.  Nathaniel was the illegitimate son the bastard' of Louis Kahn the architect who died in Penn Station New York in 1974 coming back from Bangladesh.  Kahn had three children but only one by his wife the second daughter and only son were by two other women.  The architect was a nomad and a man obsessed with his work.  He saw Nathaniel and his mother once a week but Nathaniel never got to know his father well.  Lou Kahn died when his son was only eleven and the secret children and their mothers weren't supposed to come to Lou Kahn's funeral though they did.So 25 years after his father's death at the age of 36 Nathaniel set out to make this film to find out who his father was  and he has done an amazing and triumphant job.  He begins with a sketch of Kahn's origins the fire that disfigured his face it looked pockmarked and his early displacement to America.  We learn about Kahn's development over time and the sources of his style.  They look back to the archaic and the monumental not to anything his contemporaries did.Nathaniel visits all the significant people and places in his father's life as well as a number of important architects. He starts out with the man with the glasses' Philip Johnson.  Johnson talks about what a nice guy' Kahn was.  All the rest of us were bastards' he says.  Johnson's point is there was a lack of jealousies or rivalry a selflessness  that focus on the work it's also clear Kahn is a member of the Johnson pantheon..  I.M. Pei makes one thing emphatically clear  he considers Kahn his superior. It's quality not quantity that matters' he says rapidly and bluntly when Nathaniel suggests Pei was more successful.'  Kahn may only have completed a few buildings Pei says but they are great masterpieces.  Later in the film Frank Gehry says Kahn was his original inspiration that without Lou Kahn he would not be.  It's plain that the most famous architectural figures of our day are all in awe of this man. A failure morally a man who couldn't do right by the people closest to him in his life Louis Kahn is perhaps the greatest American architect.  That fact emerges as powerfully as do his personal shortcomings.Nathaniel interviews' the great buildings too most beautifully and movingly.  His camera scans their spaces.  It peers at them far and near in different lights and shadows.  We even see him from far above roller blading around the space encompassed by the Salk Center in La Jolla casually making friends with and taking possession of it after an interview with the man Kahn worked with when the center was designed.  These viewings of the buildings a revelation of the man's achievement presented for the most part without commentary are deeply moving both in and of themselves and in the context of the searching portrait of the man behind them.To skip forward to the end  in the film's final segment Nathaniel Kahn tells Shulyar Wares the Bangladeshi architect that his three days of photographing the government building at Dhakka Kahn's last great project will only yield at most ten minutes of film.  Ten minutes!' Wares exclaims. You would try to do justice to this building in ten minutes!  To its spirit its power the ambiguities of its spaces!' Wares then speaks about Kahn's achievement and character. It's not unusual for a great artist to fall short as a man he says  the one failure may be necessary for the other success. It's an eloquent seemingly spontaneous speech and a perfect finale to the portrait.It's hard to do justice to this film without summarizing it scene by scene. It's the cumulative effect of the interviews plus the fine photography and the brilliant editing that all add up to an extraordinary portrait of a great artist and a flawed but complex man.  Nathaniel Kahn's simple bravery before the camera leads to a series of intensely revealing often moving scenes with the people in Kahn's life. There are quite searching conversations with the two other women including the filmmaker's mother. Nathaniel Kahn never falters or spoils the tone  he isn't confrontational but neither does he avoid hard questions.  He's serious but without an ounce of selfimportance.And while the interviews are powerful they are paced by visits to the few but great buildings whose effect at times is transcendent and needs no inflated commentary from Nathaniel or anyone else.It's astonishing how the film modulates from some rather petty remarks by men who worked with Lou in Fort Worth who considered the architect impractical and airyfairy to the building that resulted backed up by Beethoven's Ninth.  If you can look at a building with Beethoven's Ninth as background and the music seems right you know it's a great building.  And this is the revelation of My Architect  that Louis Kahn's buildings are magnificent radiant visions of serenity vastness and beauty  that they're among the artistic masterpieces of the twentieth century and we're fools not to go see them.  I for one plan to make the pilgrimage to La Jolla for the Salk Center as soon as I can.The triumph of Nathaniel Kahn's documentary is its balance.  While the exploration of the buildings and the processes behind them goes along so also the search for the secrets of Kahn's life continues through the course of the film. We realize that indeed as Wares says Kahn's weaknesses and his virtues are inseparable. If he was a bit of a Don Juan it's because he was a man of great personal charm a man without poses or pretenses whom everyone liked  though sometimes they had to give up working with him to save their health and sanity because he worked so relentlessly.  Neither of the other women' would have had it any other way.  The first found working with him tremendously rewarding despite the painful secrecy she was an architect too and the second the filmmaker's mother still believes that Lou was about to come and live with them when he died. And if Kahn was irresponsible toward women he was passionately committed to his work and the result is a lasting monument of triumphant buildings.There is a surprising amount of footage of Kahn himself so that his face his stature even the way he looked walking in and out of his offices in Philadelphia are always a reality to us. It's appropriate that Kahn died in the huge train station his address mysteriously obliterated from his passport.  He died as a nomad exhausted from his great final project in Bangladesh driven isolated.  Nathaniel even managed to find and interview  in California!  the railroad employee who found his father's body in Penn Station 25 years before.  The whole film seems a combination of diligence and serendipity.  It's a homage with equal measures of passion and restraint.  Though a search for self in a way it's selfless and compassionate.".

	schema:headline " Mesmerizing Portrait of an Artist By a Son";
	schema:reviewBody "Documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and by the process their own lives are not that uncommon.  Also not uncommon are results that reflect lack of talent a failure of introspection an abundance of narcissism and perhaps an unsubtle quest for publiclysplashed revenge for countless past hurts real and fantasized. What is unusual is a brilliant fair and engrossing portrait of a fascinating parent and My Architect A Son's Journey is that rare achievement.Louis Kahn emigrated to this country as a child his face irreparably and brutally scarred by an accident.  He and his parents settled in Philadelphia where the talented youngster loved art and music.  Soon he became enamored of buildings and decided only an architect's career would answer his creative abilities.Kahn became an architect but as this film shows it took a long time before he attracted the attention of the leaders in his field. One architect suggests that he was a victim of the yellow armband that antiSemitism that along with bias against women was long a disreputable aspect of the American profession of architecture.When he did achieve notice he was seen clearly accurately as a selfassured workaholic prophet exclaiming unyielding demands that his vision and only his vision be realized.  That inflexibility was the reason that while he drew wonderful plans for many buildings he built but a few. The interview with an aged gentleman who fired Kahn in Philadelphia because of his unacceptable dream of a transformed urban center where people left their cars on the perimeter and walked into the city is hilarious.Kahn was a born teacher and some of the extensive archival footage here shows him with students his voice steady but passionate their gazes respectful and intense.Many architects were interviewed by director writer and project honcho Nathaniel Kahn the architect's only son.  Some are world famous  I. M. Pei Robert A.M. Stone Moshe Safdie Frank Gehry and the still active nonagenarian Philip Johnson.  Their comments paint a vivid picture of this idealistic but in the end financially unsuccessful designer of buildings that blended the castles fortresses and grand buildings of past centuries into designs for the present.  Kahn's buildings are shown among the most impressive being the Salk Research Laboratories in La Jolla CA.  To me his style has a neoRomantic air deadened by too much blank space that repels rather than attracts human interaction.But Kahn's son was after more than the story of his father the architect. For many years Louis Kahn had three families a wife with whom he had a daughter and two longterm relationships one of which produced a daughter the other the son. Kahn visited his son at the mother's home often but at the end of an evening mother and son would drive Kahn back to the marital home.  Nathaniel clearly wanted to know about this unusual set of relationships but he doesn't appear to be scarred by what was certainly a strange affair for a little boy.  When Nathaniel was a young boy Louis Kahn died of a massive heart attack in the men's room of New York's Pennsylvania Station after returning from India where he had pitched one of his massive projects another one that was never built.  At that point his Philadelphia firm was at least 500000 in debt and had he lived a trip to the federal bankruptcy court was probably in the offing.Kahn left several monumental structures of which the government building in Bangladesh is clearly the biggest.  A teary local architect hails Kahn for having created a building where democracy may and hopefully will flourish.Fellow architect Moshe Safdie opines that there might have been something fitting in Kahn's suffering a mortal heart attack in a train station given his incessant globetrotting.  I disagree it's sadly ironic that Kahn should die in the faceless replacement for one of America's true architectural gems the old Pennsylvania Station wrecked to make way for a sterile replacement with no character and no continuation of civic memory.There are a number of emotional moments filmed during the younger Kahn's journey including with his halfsisters and his mother but they're genuine and moving not maudlin and staged.  Historians of architecture will always study Kahn.  His son found reasons to remember him as a flawed but very iconoclastic and ultimately private man.910.".

I find the movie very rich on all accounts.I found the son's search very moving and one I immediately connected to emotionally. The father's story is very interestinga lot of mystery but also a lot of information including film of the father which greatly enriches the story. And the architecture is quite wonderful and presented in a very moving way.The movie is full of interviews many quite wise and spiritual. A few folks present the other side of the coin so we get a good picture of the contradictions of Louis Kahn his family and colleagues.The editing and pace of the film drew me in and kept me engrossed throughout. Especially wonderful was the music. For me this movie is like going to a concert a museum and a spiritual event all at the same time as well as seeing an engrossing story. A wonderful experience!".

As I listened to each recollection my own opinion of this man would range from beautiful to horrible sometimes in the span of a moment so you get a good feel for the rollercoaster that Nathaniel's emotions must have been riding.The final sequence in Bangladesh totally made the film for me.

He took five years to make it a labour of love and longing. I can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process what to leave in what to take out. His father the renowned architect Louis Kahncomes across as a man too selfish and selfabsorbed to be emotionally available to even one wife not alone three. But like many men of his character he attracted women who were spellbound by the remoteness and entranced by the creativity. One of his mistresses said he was accessible but that is never explored. Other comments by people who knew him well suffer the same fate. A pity. The tension between the three halfsiblings in the room of a home Louis designed is also palpable. The unsaid hovers over the conversation. The only tracks that his father left were in the buildings he left behind some great some not so great. I was captivated by the music ship and the Salk Institute. Saddened by the baby mothers who got caught forever by his callous impregnations never more exemplified than what he said to the director's mother upon being told of her pregnancy  not again! 8 out of 10 beautifully filmed genuine. It appears in this case at least the son is not the father of the man.".

	schema:headline " Don't try this at home!!! Use a trained architect to design a building ... and a trained director to make a film.";
	schema:reviewBody "A frustrating documentary. Louis Kahn's son who saw his father only minimally during his childhood because he was a member of just one of the three separate families his father had created takes on the task of trying to learn more about his father through an exploration of his architecture and his life. It sounds like a great idea for a documentary but it ends up flat and uninteresting.Sadly the basic problem is that Kahn's son Nathaniel is not just one of the film's protagonists  he is also director writer producer interviewer and narrator. Nathaniel seems both too inexperienced and possibly too close to the material to function well in any of these roles. Further while he seems like a nice enough guy he doesn't have much screen presence so the fact that he is the only constant in the film becomes wearing. Nathaniel also comes across as an unprepared and amateurish interviewer  there are several points where an interviewee makes an interesting or provocative statement and the camera cuts to a shot of Nathaniel offering little more than a blank stare and a sort of timid uhhuh as if he's a little panicked that he's going to have to come up with something to say in response. At times I felt embarrassed watching people who might have had truly interesting things to say about Kahn or at least better things to do with their time seeming to realize that they were in the hands of an interviewer who was going to rely on them to direct the conversation. Nathaniel's dual role as both documentarian and lost son seem to do more to hurt the film than help. One senses that some of the interviewees are a little reluctant to really open up about negative aspects of Kahn's personality and career presumably because it's not clear from Nathaniel whether he's looking to dig into the truth or simply wants to hear nice stories about his Dad  preferably ones that will confirm his hope that his Dad really did care more for Nathaniel and his mother than seems likely. His passive approach as an interviewer may stem directly from this conflict. The only person Nathaniel does push is his own mother but those conversations tend to feel a little like bad teen drama Aren't you ANGRY Mom? and don't offer much in terms of helping us or Nathaniel understand Kahn or the loyalty he evoked from those around him. What the film desperately lacks is shaping by an experienced and independent hand not to exclude Nathaniel but to balance his subjectivity and inexperience. An independent director could have stood away from the material given more thought to what the interviewees could contribute and one hopes cut out those portions of the documentary process that just don't work such as the weird segment with the guy who claims to have see Kahn die which made it look as if Nathaniel was just being taken in by some loony or the entire bit about hooking up with Kahn's first cousin who had nothing to add about Kahn or Nathaniel. Too many times Nathaniel makes us watch him standing in or near a Kahn building buttonholing strangers to tell them that his father was the designer. Ahhh huh. Thaaat's nice sir. UmmI gotta go now. I understand why these things might be important to Nathaniel and that showing the documentary process is sometimes interesting but this is one of those examples of when a documentary can be TOO personal.As an aside I thought the score written for the film was great! But one of the oddest moments in the entire thing for me was when during the tour of the Kimball Art Museum the voiceover quotes Kahn as making a comparison between architecture and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. The music being played at the same time? Beethoven's NINTH Symphony. A mistake? A miscue? Who knows? It did make me laugh. Kahn was a great architect and it's clear that he was an unusual human being and had an intriguing life story. There's definitely a good documentary to be made about him. One is sympathetic to Nathaniel's search for the father he didn't know but I'm not sure whether THAT is an interesting story. Neither works so well in this film.".

	schema:reviewBody "What a tribute to his father! He set out on a quest to learn more about a man whom he knew little of and by the end of the journey I believe Nathaniel Kahn is content with what he learned and personally felt. The film is 5 years in the making and a quarter of a century after his death Louis I. Kahn's total commitment in his work  consistent strong desire to build buildings that are meaningful to humanity and timeless to the whole world with insight into his life is proudly depicted by his son Nathaniel in the documentary My Architect A Son's Journey.The film is by no means an anthology of Louis' work. There are plenty of books and archived materials that have records of Louis Kahn's projects and buildings. This documentary works like a mystery writerdirector and coproducer Nathaniel Kahn was searching for the man whom he briefly knew as his father. The film is in chapters. In Heading West we're at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies at La Jolla California. It's a sight worth beholding  Kahn's integral concept of building and environment optimizing light for the scientists at work is amazing. From a former colleague who worked with 'Lou' 35 years ago we hear about his meticulous attention to detail also how 'rambunctious' he could be  certainly didn't mince words in his criticism. A memorable scene is when the camera pulled back wide and we see Nathaniel skating around at the plaza area of the Salk Institute  a tiny figure like a child happily playing in the bowl of his father's hands. The Immigrant segment brought us to meet Anne Tyng the architect who collaboratively worked with 'Lou' and also bore him a daughter Alex. Now at 80 Tyng's return with Nathaniel's film crew to the Bath House project at Trenton New Jersey was nostalgic. In Go to sea we get to see the Barge for American Wind Symphony Orchestra  all made of steel and meeting Robert Boudreau who was surprised by Nathaniel when he finally told him he's 'Lou's' son. Boudreau was touched he said he had seen Nathaniel when he was six with his Mom Harriet Pattison and he was not to tell anyone that Lou had a son. It was a 'chokingly' emotional moment of reunion.Like his father The Nomad Nathaniel traveled to Jerusalem and learned about the Synagogue project that his father began but not realized. He visited the wailing wall and seeing his yarmulke kept falling offbeing 'breezed off' his head gave me a sense that he need not be 'totally' Jewish to be his father's son. We continue with sitting down with his two halfsisters at the Family Matters segment. We also hear him conversing with his Mom at Maine and from talking to previous office personnel at his father's office we come to know how his father intensely worked and practically lived there sleeping on a carpet on the office floor weekends and all. The End of the Journey brought us to Ahmedabad India to the Indian Institute of Management building. Talking with architect B.V. Doshe was a revelation. In the end Nathaniel found a very much alive Louis Kahn his father  his spirits live within him. This documentary is very much a tearjerker for me. I was tearyeyed most of the time  it was very touching and am in awe of the man the architect and his son and the women in his life besides his famous works and buildings. Louis I. Kahn wanted to give his love to the 'whole world' juggling work and three families you might say he has three women in his life to keep his inspiration going. As Shamsul Wares the architect at the Capital of Bangladesh complex completed 9 years after 'Lou's' death so poignantly noted Louis Kahn has given the people of Bangladesh a lot spending time at Bangladesh understanding the culture of the place and people  as well as giving them democracy through what he has achieved and for such a dedicated man usually the people close to him he'd often miss seeing. It seems the price of being great comes with inevitable personal sacrifices. This film reminds me of King Vidor's The Fountainhead 1949 good dramatic story in BW with music by Max Steiner based on Ayn Rand's novel with Gary Cooper as the uncompromising architect who stands by his own ideals and Patricia Neal as the parallel supportive woman in his life.".

There are plenty of books and archived materials that have records of Louis Kahn's projects and buildings. This documentary works like a mystery writerdirector and coproducer Nathaniel Kahn was searching for the man whom he briefly knew as his father. The film is in chapters. In Heading West we're at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies at La Jolla California. It's a sight worth beholding  Kahn's integral concept of building and environment optimizing light for the scientists at work is amazing. From a former colleague who worked with 'Lou' 35 years ago we hear about his meticulous attention to detail also how 'rambunctious' he could be  certainly didn't mince words in his criticism. A memorable scene is when the camera pulled back wide and we see Nathaniel skating around at the plaza area of the Salk Institute  a tiny figure like a child happily playing in the bowl of his father's hands. The Immigrant segment brought us to meet Anne Tyng the architect who collaboratively worked with 'Lou' and also bore him a daughter Alex. Now at 80 Tyng's return with Nathaniel's film crew to the Bath House project at Trenton New Jersey was nostalgic. In Go to sea we get to see the Barge for American Wind Symphony Orchestra  all made of steel and meeting Robert Boudreau who was surprised by Nathaniel when he finally told him he's 'Lou's' son. Boudreau was touched he said he had seen Nathaniel when he was six with his Mom Harriet Pattison and he was not to tell anyone that Lou had a son. It was a 'chokingly' emotional moment of reunion.Like his father The Nomad Nathaniel traveled to Jerusalem and learned about the Synagogue project that his father began but not realized. He visited the wailing wall and seeing his yarmulke kept falling offbeing 'breezed off' his head gave me a sense that he need not be 'totally' Jewish to be his father's son. We continue with sitting down with his two halfsisters at the Family Matters segment. We also hear him conversing with his Mom at Maine and from talking to previous office personnel at his father's office we come to know how his father intensely worked and practically lived there sleeping on a carpet on the office floor weekends and all. The End of the Journey brought us to Ahmedabad India to the Indian Institute of Management building. Talking with architect B.V. Doshe was a revelation. In the end Nathaniel found a very much alive Louis Kahn his father  his spirits live within him. This documentary is very much a tearjerker for me. I was tearyeyed most of the time  it was very touching and am in awe of the man the architect and his son and the women in his life besides his famous works and buildings. Louis I. Kahn wanted to give his love to the 'whole world' juggling work and three families you might say he has three women in his life to keep his inspiration going. As Shamsul Wares the architect at the Capital of Bangladesh complex completed 9 years after 'Lou's' death so poignantly noted Louis Kahn has given the people of Bangladesh a lot spending time at Bangladesh understanding the culture of the place and people  as well as giving them democracy through what he has achieved and for such a dedicated man usually the people close to him he'd often miss seeing. It seems the price of being great comes with inevitable personal sacrifices. This film reminds me of King Vidor's The Fountainhead 1949 good dramatic story in BW with music by Max Steiner based on Ayn Rand's novel with Gary Cooper as the uncompromising architect who stands by his own ideals and Patricia Neal as the parallel supportive woman in his life.";

	schema:reviewBody "Nominated for best documentary feature at 2004's Academy Awards My Architect follows filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn in his quest to find out about his father the legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lou Kahn died in 1974 when Nate was 11 years old leaving behind an incredible but limited body of work unpaid debts and three separate families all living within a few kilometres of each other. My Architect follows Kahn's life through chronologically examining his buildings and interspersing their beauty with the story of a charismatic but selfish and emotionally immature genius. As the son which Lou never publicly acknowledged during his lifetime Nate has delicately placed himself in the story without overpowering the main focus. When examining the magnificent Salk Institute in California Nate evokes his father's mythic use of space and light in his buildings making it a peaceful and fascinating experience for viewers. The shot of Nate rollerblading in Salk's smoky white central meeting place emphasises the building's harmony with nature. It's breathtaking. My Architect also covers the difficulty Louis Kahn had with getting his designs accepted. Several fantastical buildings exist only on paper dismissed by more practical architects and property developers. It wasn't until Louis Kahn went to the East that his visions were enthusiastically embraced. In India where he built the Indian Institute of Management a former coworker describes him as a guru. In Bhangladesh where he built the magnificent National Assembly Building citizens consider him a father of democracy. Watching My Architect is a wonderful way to begin or continue learning about architecture and the importance of space. But it's the irony of Lou Kahn's egotism combined with the transcendence of his work that will inspire you. 4 stars.".

The mathematics or whatever is acknowledged but not revealed and the tortured souls involved might as well be sportsmen.That's a loss.

Perhaps no person working in space understood space as well as he. This is quite apart from the ability to shape and manipulate space something he did with only ordinary skill. So in his case it is not even enough to introduce us to buildings but we have to go into the buildings in dimensions other than the space they enclose.There are dozens of people alive who could have spoken to the matter to have enlightened us. What we get is search by an undernourished child some pictures of clouds as they pass over Kahn buildings some spewing of irrelevant platitudes by lesser architects and finally a teary testament of inspiration from a thankful Bangli.There's no architecture here.Kahn's notions had nothing to do with recreating ruins and everything with revealing order order in utility in forms usually classical forms and order in light.

Unmarried mother number one was Anne Tyng who was more than a mere draftswoman. for several decades she was the center of distributed collaboration in revealing the postmodern form of the new brick. As a young architect I communicated with her on this and feel sure that she was a key influence in his late education. I have since spent quality time with the fellow who actually did much of the design work while Kahn was jetting around speaking and am convinced that the insights were both more collaborative and profound than reflected here.This is as far from actual architecture actual notions of where we fit than Mel Gibson's iconography has to do with Jesus.Ted's Evaluation  2 of 3 Has some interesting elements.".

Nathaniel Kahn has not made himself a very likable character and for that I suppose one must respect him. He wavers between cloying innocence and childish sullenness and smugness. I think especially of his near fallingout with his mother. He comes across as downright cruel in not allowing his mother her idealizations and delusions about Lou's intentions toward her. Watching this film the viewer does see the damage losing a parent does to a young child. Nathaniel is stunted and boyish and sweet in an altogether unlikeable way. The Nathaniel we are given in this movie haunted by his father and his inability to understand him or to resolve his feelings toward him. Little Kahn does have a number of interesting interviews with the people who knew his father it's an interesting study of how greatly people are affected by a single person how disparate their recollections of the person are and also how similar they sometimes are too. Apart from a few biographical facts this film could have been about anyone who was greatly loved and deeply complicated i.e. about a quarter of the people most of us know.

	schema:headline " Louis Kahn would have no doubt been moved";
	schema:reviewBody "Nominated for the Best Documentary Feature Academy Award this HBO documentary follows Nathaniel Kahn as he tries to discover more about the father he never knew the great architect Louis Kahn. Dying alone of a heart attack in a train station 25 years before Louis Kahn was left unclaimed for days due to him mysteriously blacking out information on his passport. He was married but not to Nathaniel's mother  she was one of numerous mistresses he had during his later years. The film takes Nathaniel on a journey where he interviews friends family and colleagues as well as visiting some of his father's spectacular works.The fatherson story of discovery has been done numerous times in cinema to various degrees of success but I've never experienced a film so personal. It is peppered with scenes of raw emotion including a moving scene where Nathaniel reveals himself to be Louis' son to a man that knew ouis well. Yet amongst all the emotion the standout scenes are the sections where he visits his fathers works. The Salk Institute is simply an outstanding piece of art and the film captures it beautifully in all its glory. Even though it is arguable that such a journey needs such a detailed account I found the film slightly overlong and I found my interest sliding at times. But this is a film that successfully explores the complexities of the man whether you feel he was a philanderer a tyrant or a troubled genius through the eyes of a son who wants to see good in and love his father. I have no doubt that Louis Kahn were he still alive would have been deeply moved.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

His Salk Institute would not look out of place as a location for a movie about the apocalypse.Anyone trying to talk to me about his prodigious talent justifying his having two children by two different women while he was married to yet another woman and then denying paternity may as well be talking to a wall. There is no excuse for what he did no matter what his profession or his fame. None. He didn't care about his wife his mistresses or his children while he was alive and he certainly didn't care what happened to them after he died.The words in the title of my summary belong to his outofwedlock son Nathaniel who directed this documentary. The last segment of My Architect is subtitled The Truth about the Bastard. And that is exactly what Louis Kahn was.There's enough blame to go around. I don't feel sorry for the women who knew he was married and had unprotected sex with him anyway or for the wife who must have suspected what was going on and didn't put her foot down because she enjoyed the status of being Mrs. Louis Kahn.Nathaniel Kahn's mother comes off as the world's biggest dimwit. Somehow she has managed to delude herself into thinking that when her baby's daddy dropped dead in Penn Station in 1974 he was leaving his wife and on his way to be with her and Nathaniel for good. Yeah right.The true victims in all of this were his children who had their father's love and attention doled out to them with an eyedropper and will never be able to confront him about his reprehensible behavior. Not that they would get a straight answer people like Louis Kahn have a way of justifying everything they do no matter how vile. The scene where they meet and share their separate memories of their father and of the tension between their mothers at his funeral should be an education for those who think that children are resilient.As Nathaniel interviews those who knew his father professionally the crocodile tears flow fast and furious. I knew about you. But your father was always very private. Please. With colleagues like this who needs friends?The funniest lines belong to patrician Edmund Bacon who presided over the 1960's bulldozing of a good portion of Philadelphia's downtown in the name of urban renewal. No gushy posthumous testimonials for him. He fired Kahn in a dispute over the direction that renewal should take and his fiery convictions about the inappropriateness of Daddy Kahn's ideas are still evident forty years later as the son interviews him. I won't spoil it see the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this documentary Nathaniel Kahn son of architect Louis Khan sets out on a journey to find out about his father. I knew nothing about Louis Khan the father and I found the documentary a thorough and revealing investigation of one very imaginative and unconventional human being. His son revisited his father's past from his birth in 190102 in Estonia where as a child he suffered severe scarring when he burnt his face with hot coals to his last day in Penn Station New York City where his body was found. As a young immigrant he found his home town of Philadelphia a place where he could excel. Architects such as Philip Johnson and I.M. Pei agreed that he was brilliant thinking and creating on a grand scale. Another from Fort Worth was visibly angry comparing his work to a selfish flight of fancy. Through interviews with his partners and their families we see the lengths he went to in order to keep secret three separate families with two born out of wedlock. One woman was bitter that he never lived up to his promise to marry her. An observer of his work felt that he had such an immense love for all people that he could not show love to the ones closest to him. Nathaniel also talked to taxi drivers and even the man who witnessed him die who found a parallel in his relationship with his own father. Louis had three children with three women married to one and succeeded during his career in keeping his personal life a secret except to a few people because in his time such a scandal would have shaken his career. His architectural works are now viewed as powerful achievements although they met with decidedly mixed reviews at the time. Colleagues held him in the highest regard while admitting they knew little about him. In the end he died in Penn Station New York with no proper ID and lay in a morgue unidentified for three days. He was bankrupt after spending time in India and Bangladesh where he was greatly revered. It was agreed that Louis was a workaholic with a limited output of the highest quality. At the end we feel that his son Nathaniel would have gained tremendous insight into a life that had seemed mysterious and misunderstood yet interesting lived to the fullest and highly original.".

The inconsistencies in Kahn's life were abundant. Louis Kahn My Architect is a documentary found with some hunting on youtube because the many excerpts vids with the same title make the full documentary an unlikely first click. It begins with the surviving illegitimate son reading the late architect's obituary on fiche which is a symbolic scene. In addition to opening with the man credited for making the film as a product of oldfashioned thorough research it also shows a man under credited for being the late architect's son who today is largely under credited for his architectural achievements. Dear kind readers Declaring boring and clicking beyond is the most common reaction to this movie  it's not a blockbuster. If you want to give yourself hope of finding the KOemotional punch then look for the documentarian's image reflected in the glass as he scans fiche on the projector. Sincerely Tom Doody. It's a magical filmmaking moment at the start of a film Hana and I have seen to the end three times. Hana and I have plans to visit Salk Institute on California's Pacific Coast. Why? Because it's more practical than a visit to the Capital of Bangladesh. Kahn's life was filled with inconsistency and one of those inconsistencies produced Nathaniel Kahn who survived the late architect lived to make this film and Nathaniel lives today. With this film he has unearthed some deepseated emotion and exposes it. The surviving son generates scenes of emotional awkwardness which are tortuous. It's ironic how the awkward scenes are self inflicted and not the work of manipulative pop media trying to expose dark moments of celebrities. The brilliance of the film is how the documentarian's emotion becomes central to the film without distracting his viewers from the subject. Alternatively his emotion illuminates his father's achievements. Like all great men Louis Kahn was a great man  sort of.".

The scene with the three children was poignant with the unspoken suffering of their childhoods. Younger viewers today  cannot understand the disgrace in those days for illegitimate children growing up. Ann Alix's mother was the most dignified and selfrespecting of the bunch. Of course he couldn't divorce Esther she supported him most of his life and probably had the money in the family. He never even supported those children financially since their mothers worked and he died bankrupt. As for his work I thought the Salk complex was one of the coldest most barren sites I have ever seen. Frankly Kahn deserved to die as he lived  aloof and alone.".

Younger viewers today  cannot understand the disgrace in those days for illegitimate children growing up. Ann Alix's mother was the most dignified and selfrespecting of the bunch. Of course he couldn't divorce Esther she supported him most of his life and probably had the money in the family. He never even supported those children financially since their mothers worked and he died bankrupt. As for his work I thought the Salk complex was one of the coldest most barren sites I have ever seen. Frankly Kahn deserved to die as he lived  aloof and alone.";

Although wellknown he cannot be identified because he scratched out the personal information in his passport and his body lays unclaimed at the city's morgue for three days. It turned out to be the body of what many consider one of the greatest American architects of the twentieth century Louis I. Kahn. He died at the age of 73 on his way from India where one of his greatest projects the Institute for Management in Ahmedabad was nearing completion.One of the most influential postwar American architects Louis Kahn's architectural legacy includes the house of parliament in Dhaka Bangladesh the Kimbell Art Museum in Forth Worth the Yale Art Gallery the Salk Institute in California and a kind of mobile music boat designed to give concerts in harbours in various cities around the world.While celebrated as an architect very little was known about his private life. In addition to his wife Esther and their daughter Sue Ann Kahn was survived by two mistresses Harriet Pattison and Anne Tyng and their two children. All three families lived within miles of each other in suburban Philadelphia but their paths never crossed until the funeral. His son Nathaniel the director of this film was only 11 years old at the time and had only a few memories of his father's weekly visits at Harriet Patterson Nathaniel's mother in Philadelphia. Twentyfive years later he sets out on a journey to confront his father by visiting Kahn's buildings talking to relatives and colleagues and visiting the places that played a role in Louis Kahn's life.One of the most moving confrontations is when Nathaniel asks his mother a landscape architect and mistress of Louis Kahn why she kept up with playing second fiddle to his wife and never confronted him with this. Tears shed her eyes but she has no regrets. It was worth it. It's such an intensely sad moment. She's obviously shattered treated as an outcast at his funeral which she was forbidden to attend it's almost as if she led a substitute life. It all feels strangely unreal. Another interview with Edward Bacon Kahn's architectural nemesis who was in charge of the rebuilding of his native Philadelpia in the fifties and sixties almost suffers a stroke on the spot when he is reminded of Kahn's unsavoury ideas about architecture. His son Nathaniel listens uncomfortably when a very senior Bacon literally screams with anger whenever Kahn's name comes up. The final scene is reserved for Kahn's grandest creation the Capitol in Dhaka Bangladesh. It took 23 years to complete a vast and extraordinary building of which the Bangladeshi are extremely proud. It's one of the very few national symbols with stature in this impoverished nation. Some of the interviews with the locals brought tears in my eyes especially when they find out they are talking to  God forbid  the architect's own son!The film is as much a personal journey as it is an account of Kahn's grand architectural legacy and is above all about the fruition of the film itself and filmmaking in general. Perhaps Louis I. Kahn faltered as a father but these shortcomings in his personal life make for an all the more interesting portrait in this extraordinary film.Camera Obscura  910".

OK Pei and Gehry must be in on the con but that's not impossible. This director don't forget has gone on to make an accepted fake film re The Village.A few quick reasons in no particular order 1 Whether your movie costs 50K or 500K there's no reason in this day and age for the picture quality to be so poor this is way worse that digital video at least as shown in London UK I suspect this is to blur the line between the archive footage and the new footage. 2 You can't walk up to a bunch of Philadelphia cab drivers and they not just one guy but they remember your dad from 25 years back. Nonsense. Making documentaries just isn't like that. 3 Some of the interviews are shot continuously but from more than one angle. How many cameras could this guy afford? And if he could afford two why is the picture quality so terrible?? 4 The archive footage makes no sense at all. Is it home movie footage in which case how in the late 60's is it sync sound? If it's Museum type footage as the end credits claim then it's too badly shot and the newsreel bit with voiceover has some footage as he goes into the shadows across the edit which would never have been acceptable onscreen at the time. 5 I felt that it the film wasn't fake then it's not interesting enough to make yet alone finance or distribute. 6 OK this may just be deliberate style but why is none of the handy archive footage of his Pop put into context. We meet none of the directors or camera operators who filmed the man and we never learn anything about the films or programmes that these extracts are taken from. Curious. Anyone else agree??".

This film has all the elements of the Italian mysterythriller genre known as the giallo but really pulls the viewers in by having each key character with a skeleton in hisher own closet. This keeps you doing as much detective work as the detectives in the film itself. Who is killing the young boys in town? The young rich woman who is so bored that she sexually taunts the eventual victims the reporter who likes to tamper with a crime scene to get a better photo shot the townswoman with a mentally retarded daughter the local witch the town idiot....the list goes on and you have to keep mental notes like a true game to play and solve. The themes in this film are very daring and done with that perfect Italian style in the early 1970s. It is certain that no American studio would have even considered making a film of such strong content and that is precisely why this is such a satisfying film despite some unusual accent choices for the dubbing and will definitely have people discussing its meanings long after viewing it.

The landscape may be quite picturesque but there's madness herein concealed behind the mask of a person who seems outwardly normal. This person kills little children.In style and tone this film resembles Dario Argento's famous Italian giallos those fascinating whodunit horror films except that Argento's films are much better looking. Still the visuals in Fulci's Don't Torture A Duckling are competent with some interesting compositions and lighting. Lightning and thunder on a rainy night enhances suspense in one sequence wherein one of the ducklings is vulnerably alone.In one sequence the gore is a bit overdone. But this is no slasher film. A legitimate theme undergirds the story. And that theme is that madness can take many unexpected forms not just the obvious delusions of people who practice voodoo or black magic.Plenty of red herrings render the puzzle solution difficult if the viewer doesn't assume an agenda on the part of the director. Don't dismiss someone who might not seem to be a suspect. The twist near the end provides good misdirection. However in one scene midway through a line of dialogue could have been added to clarify the relationship between two characters one of whom is the murderer. The film's finale takes place on a beautiful mountaintop with the wind whistling in the background. We see flashbacks to clues and get insights into the killer's mindset.I don't care for the film's widescreen projection. But background music is effective and ranges from jarringly creepy at the beginning to lowkey jazz to indigenous Italian songs. Acting is generally average though in a couple of cases it's a bit overdone.Though not as visually brilliant as Argento's giallos Don't Torture A Duckling nevertheless is a fine film one that contains a thematic storyline and enough of a whodunit puzzle to interest most viewers who like thrillers and murder mysteries.".

All of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns until the actual killer is revealed...DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING is neither a classical giallo or a typical Fulci gore film. Although it does contain elements of both  it is more of an oldfashioned murder mystery with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence although nothing nearly as strong as some of Fulci's later works. This is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end. Recommended for giallomurdermystery fans or anyone looking to check out some of Fulci's nonsplatter films  but don't despair DON'T TORTURE still has more than it's fair share of violence and sleaze. Some may be put off by the subject of the child killings and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys which is also kind of disconcerting  but if that type of material doesn't bother you then definitely give this one a look. 8.510".

Some may be put off by the subject of the child killings and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys which is also kind of disconcerting  but if that type of material doesn't bother you then definitely give this one a look. 8.510";

	schema:reviewBody "Sporting a title seemingly more suitable for a Looney Tunes featurette than a grisly giallo Don't Torture a Duckling 1972 is nonetheless a Grade A thriller from horror maestro Lucio Fulci. In this one someone has been strangling the preteen boys in a rural southern Italian village and typical for these gialli there are many suspects. There's Barbara Bouchet Patrizia looking more scrumptiolicious than you've ever seen her a rich girl hiding out after a drug scandal Florinda Bolkan Martiara the local epileptic voodoo woman her witchcraftpracticing beau Giuseppe the local idiot the sweetfaced priest his dour mother and on and on. The film features some unusually violent set pieces including a chain whipping of one of the main characters in a graveyard one of the most realistically bloody sequences that I've ever seen and a nifty dukeout when the killer is ultimately revealed. The film's bursts of violence compensate for the fact that there are no real scares or suspense to speak of. Still this giallo fascinates with its unusual rural backdrop unsettling child murders oddball characters and freaky score by Riz Ortolani. The film has been beautifully photographed in what I presume to be Monte Sant'Angelo near the Adriatic in southern Italy at least that town's police force is thanked in the closing credits. And while subtitling would've made this finelooking DVD work even better the American slang doesn't convince in this rural Italian setting Anchor Bay is to be thanked for another job well done. Oh...that title DOES eventually make perfect sense too!".

	schema:reviewBody "DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING Lucio Fulci  Italy 1972.Definitely a prime candidate for the most insane movie title ever conceived and that's quite an achievement in gialloland. Originally the film was titled even more absurdly Don't Torture Donald Duck literally translated from its Italian title. A small Donald Duck figure features briefly as a toy but hardly enough to render a title like this but apparently it was changed in fear of legal ramifications by Disney. I railed quite a bit against Fulci's earlier LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN 1971 but here all the right ingredients are present. A surprisingly effective mystery a good cast and imaginatively shot against an unusual rural setting. Everything just clicks. I think it's justly hailed as one of the director's most accomplished achievements.The story is set against the backdrop of a small mountainside town in Sicily where someone is killing young teenage boys. Among the suspects the most obvious one is a young woman Maciara Florinda Balkan a selfproclaimed witch who is seen suspiciously unearthing the skeleton of a baby and sticking pins into way effigies. Guiseppe the village idiot is under suspicion as well since he made a feeble attempt to profit from the disappearance of one of the boys and walked right into their trap. By the time a quickwitted newshound Tomas Milian arrives from Milan to cover the murders he immediately begins to question the authorities' assumptions when he meets two other potential suspects Don Alberto the local priest Marc Porel with a highminded attitude and Patrizia Barbara Bouchet a bored young woman from the city with a troubled past of drug offense who also fancies having sexual relations with the young boys in town. Talk about your prime red herring.Fulci nicely contrasts modernity and tradition with the newly constructed elevated highway meandering through the Sicilian hills past old towns where life is still firmly rooted in tradition and superstition. One could debate about the film's political stance as The North versus The South or as commentary on smalltown virtues  society's conventions in general  that are all too often dangerously close to tipping over into moral disintegration chaos and  ultimately  selfjustice by the populace. The film has often been lambasted because of its anticatholic tone but it's hardly an important element here except for obvious plotrelated reasons which would be giving away too much. It's actually rather tame compared to a film like Jol Seria's DON'T DELIVER US FROM EVIL 1971. Probably the film's rather unflattering portrayal of smalltown Sicilian values when another boy is killed the local populace are depicted as a retarded lynchmob might be cause for some offense in Sicily but  considering Sicily's problematic relation with the rest of Italy  hardly problematic for other Italians I would think. The film vanquished into obscurity far too quickly to have much impact anyway.When talking Fulci the amount of gore is usually a prime subject for discussion. Although eyesgouging scenes are lacking the film does contain two very graphic scenes. In the grossout finale the killer falls of a cliff smashing his face along the rocks on the way down with gruesome results albeit not very realistic. And the chainwhipping sequence with Florinda Balkan in the graveyard shows Fulci's penchant for sadistic violence and typically he's not holding back at graphically showing what most filmmakers would merely hint at. Surely one of the most horrifying scenes in Fulci's repertoire. Above all this is a taut wellwritten effective little mystery nicely lensed by Fulci with an impressive cast of genreregulars like Barbara Bouchet Marc Porel not very convincing as a priest Tomas Milian and Florinda Balkan mouthfoamingly crazy as the town's witch.Camera Obscura  810".

The direction was perhaps a bit rough around the edges but on the whole I thought the film worked really well and the ending was great a real cliff hanger!. I thought one scene was particularly disturbing when the locals beat the hell out of a poor women while the radio played in the background. The inappropriate music made the images even harder to swallow but also gave the scene an emotional punch uncommon in a Fulci movie. I also felt that the story worked coherently and that the twist at the end was great. Fulci obviously has a rather low opinion of rural Italy's inhabitants because in this film all the villagers are presented as simpletons prone to masshysteria who live by their own backward laws illustrated by the remorseless killing of the women and religious beliefs.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a small picturesque Sicilian village someone is brutally killing young sexually curious boys. The local police force keep busy trying to track the killer and whittle the list down to five or so main suspects including voyeuristic village retard Giuseppe Vito Passeri and an elusive grungy voodoo dollpoking backwoods witch named Maciara Florinda Bolkan. There's also Don Alberto Marc Popel a handsome young priest who runs the local boy's school Andrea Tomas Milian a journalist helping to aid the police and the beautiful Patrizia Barbara Bouchet a gorgeous but seriously screwedup drug addict who seems to have a thing for very I mean VERY young boys. As typical with the giallo subgenre the plot won't be fully revealed until the last few frames but if you can hang in there long enough this film pays off. The script written by Fulci Gianfranco Clerici and Roberto Gianviti keeps red herrings to a minimum and will keep you interested and the story is ably supported by excellent location work cinematography by Sergio D'Offizi and musical score by Riz Ortolani. The acting particularly Bolkan is also very good. Fulci fans who were weaned on his 80s grotesqueries like THE BEYOND and ZOMBIE will find more artistry and less gore on display here than they might anticipate but they'll still enjoy a particularly nasty chain whipping scene in a cemetery bizarrely yet effectively set to singer Ornella Vanoni's ballad Quei giorni insieme a te and a long tumble down a rocky embankment that Fulci liked so much that he reused it in his film THE PSYCHIC 1977. Scenes of the children being killed is mainly kept off screen except for a brief strangulation but the camera doesn't hesitate to linger on their corpses. The film was not released theatrically in America and presumably because of some antiCatholic elements in the storyline received only a limited theatrical release in Europe.".

	schema:reviewBody "I tend to get furious when hearing about Lucio Fulci's reputation as a director. Too often he's categorized as a notalented filmmaker only out to shock and disgust entire audiences with images of pure gore. True his films contain more explicit filth and sickness as your average mainstream American production but his films always are of wide range and the plots are gruesomely morbid. Don't Torture a Duckling is yet another story! This film is a pure gem of the Italian shock cinema! I easily dare to call this film a masterpieceit's an oldfashioned giallo that includes all brilliant aspects of genuine horror. The film shows the search for a inhuman serial murderer in a small Italian mountaintown. The bodies of  3 young boys are found horribly mutilated. There are quite a lot of pseudomadmen in the town but every trail leads to nowhere. Among the suspects are a greedy bum and a scary woman obsessed by witchery and voodoo. Like a true mastermind Fulci knows to find the right creepy tone for his film. He portrays the small town as a claustrophobic and inescapable setting of macabre happenings supported by a giddy soundtrack. Fulci also develops himself as a genius storyteller here. The script always is one step ahead of you and the complex plot will mislead you more than once. In other words this is a unique giallo horror slash murder mystery. The gore isn't presented as grotesque and explicit as in Lucio's later milestones among them are the legendary Zombie 2 The Beyond and the New York Ripper although there still are a few nauseating and hardtowatch shocksequences shown. Don't torture a Duckling is the most compelling and effective achievement Lucio Fulci ever brought forward and it easily ranks among the greatest Italian horror movies ever made. Right next to the masterpieces made by Mario Bava and Dario Argento. The film is fascinating from start to finish some plot aspects are alarmingly realistic and the tension is adrenalinrushing at all times! A must see for horror fans and an absolute priority for Italian shocklovers!".

Could it be the village idiot who is constantly pestered by the kids? Or maybe the local witch with a skeleton in her closet? Or the luscious and rich woman with a thing for young boys? Or maybe...This is held by some as Lucio Fulci's masterpiece and one of the best giallo films out there at least on par with the best of Dario Argento. But unfortunately I never really was a fun of giallo so even though I have give this movies thumbs up for an extremely tight script for an Italian horror movie I just didn't feel overawed. The movie leaves you guessing as to who the killer is but unfortunately my gut feeling from about 13 into the movie turned out to be true. In the end instead of being on the edge of my seat I basically waited out to the movies conclusion  satisfied on many levels but ultimately underawed and slightly bored.I really liked the story as well as various quirky moments especially the lynching of Maciara coupled with some odd but surprisingly effective musical choices. The gore is limited especially for a Fulci movie but all in all this one is more about the mystery than the blood and guts...Very nice camerawork and as someone once said  they don't make movies like this nowadays. Definitely worth the watch but don't go in expecting a masterpiece.".

	schema:reviewBody "Being a seasoned fan of Italian thrillers and directors Dario Argento Mario Bava Sergio Martino and Aldo Lado I thought of Lucio Fulci as an overrated hack. I had seen The Beyond which I think is totally overrated I found The New York Ripper to be simply appalling and I didn't particularly like The House By the Cemetery. These three movies left me to conclude that Fulci is the least interesting of these Italian filmmakers. But my stubbornness prevailed and I had to check out more of his films. City of the Living Dead was a film I found very interesting but Don't Torture a Duckling is very nearly a masterpiece.Set in a small town in the Italian countryside in a repressive religious community where young boys are being murdered. The authorities are clueless as to who's behind these crimes especially after their prime suspect has been cleared. An eager young reporter along with a rather slutty girl who seduces young boys investigate and eventually get to the bottom of it.Brilliant atmosphere combined with a good story and a good cast not always the case with 70's Italian thrillers make Don't Torture a Duckling a crackling good thriller. The plot is well constructed not easily figured out and the end conclusion is very satisfying. Fulci creates a dynamic atmosphere of repression and guilt in a very unforgiving and ignorant community and creates some very strong visuals particularly in a scene where a woman gets beaten to death by some local townsfolk. Fulci's social commentary concerning religion and innocence are quite edgy and every aspect is well handled. When thinking of his zombie flicks and his ultra violent giallo New York Ripper it's amazing how well he balances his critique with explicit violence and makes an even stronger point. So far I haven't seen any Fulci film made as professionally as this one.While not a traditional giallo film Duckling has many of the genre's trademarks. Fulci displays complete control over the format only once going overboard with an unconvincing goremoment but overall he seems to be even better at making mysteries than full blown gore epics. The extreme scenes here are much more powerful and really pack a punch.So far Don't Torture a Duckling is Fulci's best film by far in my opinion. Edgy social commentary combined with explicit scenes of violence and a crackling good mystery to boot.".

	schema:reviewBody "Set in the lush of rural Italy there is something altogether different with the locale of 'Don't Torture a Duckling' in comparison to Fulci's later works. This does not go amiss and is perhaps one of the strengthening factors of this satisfactory film.While it is true that many of the characters are developed throughout the plot this is not altogether convincing yet should be noted with some merit. Several reviewers have taken the opportunity to compare this film to say 'Zombie Flesh Eaters'  the latter usually coming under fire for it's alleged lack of characterisation. Let's remember though that 'Zombie' in essence is an exploitation film and should be noted more for being a timely piece rich in visceral shockvalue. Characterisation and  plot development are not strictly paramount  although some would disagree.This is not to say that 'Duckling' is in any way a 'bad' film but it is certainly lacking something and it becomes a difficult task to put a finger on what that is. There is a degree of realism to the film itself and it's portrayal of violence and emotions. Sure there are no exploding zombie heads or pierced eyeballs but that does not mean to say that 'Duckling' doesn't fail to shock in places. The film may look dated but in regards to it's subject matter this film is still as relevant today as it was when released maybe more so. Particularly here in the UK any film dealing with the death of young children religion it is debatable as to whether or not the Catholic Church is being swiped at here sex and superstition is going to create strong resonances.Having heard nothing but good about this film I do feel rather uneasy by not rating it nearly as high as I thought I would. The giallo characteristics of the film are a catalyst and the musical score is very apt and helps to create a chilling ambience. The camerawork is impressive and noteworthy. It just seems that some leads and ideas never really seem to anywhere in particular...take the woman who seems to flirt with literally everyone this may be justified by fails to rouse much interest at all. Certain parts take the end montage of flashbacks for example seem emphatically 'corny' and unnecessary indeed. It may be clear that Fulci can create a film that isn't dependent on gore and can move the viewer but this isn't as groundbreaking as some have made out.To conclude 'Don't Torture a Duckling' is an overrated underrated film but do keep an open mind. It seems like 'Duckling' is going to everremain as the 'tender' or 'intelligent' film that Fulci directed merely because it has little bloodshed.".

Fulci's absolute greatest film however dates back to 1972 and while it is definitely gritty and violent it is not nearly as gory as many of his other films. Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino aka. Don't Torture A Duckling of 1972 is not only by far Fulci's greatest film this tantalizing and utterly brilliant Giallo is one of the absolute highlights of the genre. The stunning atmosphere and tantalizing suspense the great Sizilian setting the intriguing story the brilliant performances or the intense moments of sheer shock  I don't know what to praise most about this ingenious Giallo! Don't Torture A Duckling truly delivers cinematic perfection in every aspect which makes it an absolute masterpiece of Italian Horror cinema.Contrary to other Gialli it is not seductive beauty queens who are slain one by one but little boys who fall victims to a killer on the loose. Bodies of little boys are found in rural Sicily. While the police are desperately searching for the killer the little town is basically full of strange people and the townsfolk are screaming for a culprit...The film is stunningly suspenseful and uncompromising from the very beginning with a gritty dark and constantly tense atmosphere that has yet to find an equal. The acting performances are among the best in Italian Horror cinema. Tomas Milian one of my personal alltime favorite actors is excellent in the lead as journalist Andrea Martinelli who is investigating the crimes. Sexy Barbara Bouchet delivers both eyecandy and a brilliant performance. Equally outstanding performances come from Irene Papas and Florinda Bolkan who is utterly brilliant in her role. The great score by Riz Ortolani brilliantly intensifies the suspense and atmosphere and the film is ingeniously shot in fascinating Sicilian landscapes. Although not as gory as many other Fulci films this film is definitely gritty and uncompromising in its violence with a few shockingly brutal scenes.Don't Torture A Duckling has everything brilliant Horror requires. This is not quite as easy to get hold of as most other Fulci flicks but I assure that searching it will pay off. Any Horror fan MUST see this personal favorite of mine and I highly recommend any true lover of film in general not to miss this. A Masterpiece!".

Fortunately I decided to give Fulci one last go and am glad I did Don't Torture A Duckling is without a doubt the director's best film and is also one of the best giallos that I have seen.A spate of child murders in a rural Italian town has left the locals in shock. After incorrectly arresting both the town idiot and the local crazy woman the police are baffled as to who the killer is. There are plenty of other suspects who could be the murderer and in true giallo style the identity of the psycho responsible is only revealed in the final moments. Until that point Fulci not only fills his satisfyingly sick story with plenty of twists and turns but also finds time for some gratuitous nudity courtesy of the gorgeous Barbara Bouchet and even a smattering of his signature gore which is used sparingly but effectively.Fans of Fulci's later splatter 'classics' might find this film too 'dry' for their taste and perhaps a little slow moving. Giallo aficionados however will appreciate the lovely cinematography great score and satisfyingly logical conclusion yes this is one Italian murdermystery that actually seems to make sense!.Even if like me you think you have seen enough Fulci films to last you a lifetime give Don't Torture A Duckling a goit's worth it.8.5 out of 10 rounded up to 9 for IMDb.".

Until that point Fulci not only fills his satisfyingly sick story with plenty of twists and turns but also finds time for some gratuitous nudity courtesy of the gorgeous Barbara Bouchet and even a smattering of his signature gore which is used sparingly but effectively.Fans of Fulci's later splatter 'classics' might find this film too 'dry' for their taste and perhaps a little slow moving. Giallo aficionados however will appreciate the lovely cinematography great score and satisfyingly logical conclusion yes this is one Italian murdermystery that actually seems to make sense!.Even if like me you think you have seen enough Fulci films to last you a lifetime give Don't Torture A Duckling a goit's worth it.8.5 out of 10 rounded up to 9 for IMDb.";

I really like giallos and I thought Argento was the master of this genre after seeing films like Tenebre and Phenomena. But after I saw New York Ripper by Fulci I found out that he could do pretty good giallos besides his graphic zombie movies and even outdo Argento on a certain level.I love Fulci's style and yes I love gore but this film I think although it has a more developed plot and characters than his other films is not his best one. What I don't like is that it can be confusing at times especially at the end. And the fact that we go from one suspect to another and then another until we even suspect the retarded little girl for a moment I think it goes too far. I know giallos are supposed to keep you guessing until the end and the killer should be very hard to find but this film plays a little too much with our minds. However I did like the scene when the witch is killed I think it is very well done and gave me the chills. The acting is also pretty good and the photography is great.Although this is not a bad film I think Lucio Fulci has made better films than this and I think his best one is The Beyond a very different movie but a more atmospheric and visual experience.I give Don't torture a duckling a 7 out of 10.".

	schema:headline " a high point artistically for Lucio Fulci with a murder mystery Giallo par excellence";
	schema:reviewBody "Don't Torture a Duckling or Don't Torture Donald Duck rises above what some might think of the Italian horror film or in the more specific connotation Giallo which refers to mysterycrime stories. Perhaps some of it was director Lucio Fulci's own doing as he sort of merged Giallo and bloody Horror in the prime of his career and made it over the top perhaps even other masters like Argento could be partially guilty. But here is a film that takes its subjects seriously doesn't scoff at anything and really how could it? It's a story of young boys murdered and a small village in uproar with a local Priest a crazy witchlady with mojo dolls an interested Romebased journalist and an attractive maybe too attractive young woman the main figures. When it's violent it stays true to itself it's not the kind of horror movie where you expect it to go super bloody and gory but when it does its visceral in impact and there's even some really good acting which is hard to find in some of these Italian procedural. But what makes it a lost classic? Lost as in only discovered for American audiences ten years ago For one thing it rises not only above its expectations of silliness and carnage as one might see in other Fulci work not least of which a movie more on common with ducks New York Ripper and even its setup of the usual sort with the crimes being committed and the police being only somewhat apt to investigate leaving open an outsider i.e. a journalist and an attractive young woman to look into it themselves doesn't feel worn out or too typical. Maybe it's the setting of the village and how the people in it respond to the crimes. They're not the more sophisticated or weird types one might find in Deep Red. These are rural folk who have a deep religious feeling to them and feel real fear at this killer who walks among them but can't really know who is who.Fulci leaves the audience guessing up until the end but it doesn't feel cheap or cheating. Far from it it is a shock that makes perfect sense and adds a whole other deeper philosophical dimension to the film if it was just who we are led shallowly to believe it is hint it's not the attractive young woman played by Barbara Bouchet who appears stark naked in a staggering inappropriate but oddly seductive scene in front of one of the boys. What also makes it fascinating to watch is how Fulci shoots and edits his scenes. Sometimes it seems like a scene will cut off short but it's really a method of editing that is like pre postmodern crosscutting if that makes sense. In other words Fulci's film feels fresh like it could have been shot yesterday. Dutch angles responsible zooms and a sense of using music that is invigorating and involves the viewer in the suspense and at one tragic moment the sadness hint it's three songs from a radio. And yes the acting is somehow better than usual. Some of it comes from that 'witch woman' played by Florinda Bolkan and also some from Irene Pappas or the actor playing the Priest. They take the material and the drama therein as serious as Fulci and it pays off. What should be just a pulpy mystery story has a soul and a presence cinematically. You can feel the tension as Bouchet drives at night or is at the phone booth or the terror unintentional or not when Bolkan is chased by the dogs into a circle where they all are barking all at once at her. Consistently the film has sharp intelligent direction and is far from the occasionally truly sloppy times Fulci could get later in his career. He and his crew and cast have a sensational film here waiting to be discovered. Out of his oeuvre this and The Beyond are the ones to beat really in terms of quality and substance. And what a title!".

	schema:headline " Darkest of the gialli";
	schema:reviewBody "No wonder this was Lucio Fulci's personal favourite out of everything he directed. This is just about the darkest giallo you'll ever see as it throws out all the kitsch quirks and style and replaces it with social commentary rage and genuine emotion. some spoilers ahead but I don't reveal the killerFirst off the film is set out in rural Italy swapping luxurious apartments for rocky hills and shepherds and it's not sexy models being murdered but a group of young preteen boys who are turning up strangled around the town. It's a strongly religious town where the boys are part of a youth club run by a young priest but there's also an old magician living in the hills with Florinda Balkan as his acolyte.Florinda sets the tone of the film as we see shots of her digging up a child's skeleton cut with that of three young boys taking the pish out of the town idiot. One of these boys encounters a totally naked Barbara Bouchet who is new in town and winds up the young guy by pretending to seduce him.One of the boys goes missing and soon the town and land are full of Italian policemen with dogs. An mystery person claims to have kidnapped the boy and blackmails the family only for it to turn out to be the town idiot who found the body and buried it. The cries of horror from the townspeople as the body is uncovered and their continual invading of scenes raises the tension throughout this film as they turn on any suspect and bay for their blood  especially that of 'local witch' Florinda Balkan whom we see doing voodoo on some child like dolls!Most of the cops aren't used to dealing with these mountain folk and the only voice of reason seems to be journalist Tomas Milian who is very restrained here. He seems to be the only one with any chance at all of figuring out the case as he's the only one who seems to take a step back from the mounting hysteria. Unlike other gialli Fulci really seems to have something to say here and goes on to attack organised religion and its affects on sexuality how it controls the masses and the general ignorance of rural communities and the mob mind. No one in the film is entirely likable at all and there's a whole vibe of alienation throughout the whole film punctuated by an unidentified woman who sings somewhere out in the hills.Of course the most famous scene of this film is where Florinda Balkan is cornered and beaten to death with chains by the murdered kid's fathers. With a car radio blasting inane tunes Florinda is gorily ripped to shreds by chains and left to die. Except she doesn't. She crawls painfully to the highway the only modern thing in the film as happy families in cars blissfully drive by and dies looking on a world she was never allowed. Fulci lingers on her corpse for a painful amount of time afterwards. The man was no hack and it's easily one of the most emotionally effective scenes in giallo.There's many other themes at play here but I can't touch on them as they'll reveal the killer. This is a truly great giallo and just a plain great film. Viva Fulci!Fulci got hauled over the coals for a lot of reasons because of this film but he was brought to court for using a child in the nude scenes with Barbara Bouchet. Fulci had to reveal he actually dressed a dwarf in the kid's clothes for the scenes they appear together on screen. He also got blacklisted for having a go at the Catholic Church!".

	schema:reviewBody "Another early giallo from Lucio Fulci and I admit that I enjoyed this a lot more than his muddled A LIZARD IN A WOMAN'S SKIN at first. Gorgeous scenery of the Italian countryside and a tight plot weaving in and out of about a hundred different subplots and strands help to keep this one intriguing throughout. The identity of the murderer is kept hidden well and the final revelation comes as both a shock and a surprise.Due to the longerthanaverage running time and the complicity of the plot this film feels like an epic. At first it seems rather muddled and confusing we are unsure of what we are watching until all the pieces of the jigsaw begin to fall into place. Suspense builds as the hunt for the real murderer progresses and things finally erupt in an exciting clifftop battle between the heroes and the villain over the life of a mute child.Sometimes the film threatens to give you a headache as Fulci is never content to keep this camera still instead weaving it in and out of his actors and actresses constantly. This makes some shots look very nice and artistically composed others jolting and difficult to watch especially some of the scenes where people are running through the woods  I thought I was watching THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT at one such point!.Fulci's later penchant for nonstop carnage and over the top gore is foreshadowed here in a couple of graphic moments. In one of these an innocent woman is chainwhipped to death by frightened villagers which prefigures the later chainwhipping of the warlock in THE BEYOND in fact it's filmed in EXACTLY the same way. Fulci zooms in as blood spills from the jagged wounds on the woman's body in this moment of sadistic glory which is quite shocking to watch. The other excessive scene comes at the end of the film when the killer falls to their death over the cliff. In a normal movie you would see the killer fall and then cut away. Not so with Fulci. Every time there's a rocky outcrop on the cliff the killer gets their face mashed up. Again and again. All while a crooning song plays over the action. Art or lurid exploitation? You decide.The script is a literate one with just about every character in the film falling under suspicion at some point. The actors and actresses do their jobs well especially the child actors who are surprisingly good in their parts. Barbara Bouchet is around to lend some muchneeded glamour the first shot we see of her has the actress sitting naked on a chair. Yes this is indeed an adult film tackling many controversial issues neither politics nor religion are safe from Fulci. In all this is a wellshot and tense murder mystery which makes use of some beautiful locations and a good cast.".

Of course some people may find this movie not frightening at all but personally I spent a very good moment. This movie alterns very well sex scenes with frightening scenes. There is also a nice touch of humor. For example when the wife tells her husband that in her childhood she was abused by her father and then her husband says how can someone abuse someone like you and then he attempts to attach her on the bed for sexual games D Very funny ! I recommend this movie to everyone and by the way sorry for my poor English I'm from France.".

	schema:reviewBody "What we have here is an original twist on the classic haunted item story. Tanya Dempsey and Brave Matthews are a young couple who move to an old apartment in Hollywood. Soon they'll discover although we the audience knew it since the first scene that there is an old 30s bed where a horrible murder happened. Strange things will occur as they start using the bed.I found the idea of a haunted bed very original even when this kind of story have been told since the beginning of civilization. The story was well developed and the effect the bed has over the couple was very interesting. Nightmares hallucinations and poltergeists disturb the mind of Tanya Dempsey's character and she gives a very good performance. She will have a bright future if she keeps up the good work.Sadly the rest of the cast is not that convincing. Joe Estevez makes an appearance as the owner of the building but his performance is forgettable. Brave Matthews just was not up to the role. Dempsey owns the screen and carries the film even with its problems. She makes the film enjoyable although she can't save it completely.The film gets boring at times mostly due to the poor development of characters although that makes it clear that the writer intended the bed to be the main character.It's very good to note that there are no overthetop effects or gore and that the scares are very subtle something very different from typical Full Moon Bmovies.Something bad about the film were the flashback sequences which were poorly done. The problem here is that the DV camera shooting is very bad for the BW shots in contrast to the rest of the movie where the lighting works in awesome ways the flashbacks are noticeable for its poor lighting. I think that it is a major but understandable. flaw.The cast  crew of this film have a bright future to come even though this film may not be the Classic horror that Stuart Gordon who produced it usually creates it is a promise of the talent that we'll see in the future.Very Good 610".

Wait i'm getting ahead of myself sorry. The film really starts in black and white. An old bed sit's with this scary pig faced guy chocking a women who looks like Catherine ZetaJones in Chicago Anyways lets get back to now. The two lovebirds get the loft from a guy who looks just like Martin Sheen and this all leads up to them finding the same bed old pig guy was on in the 20's.The bed makes them do some crazy things. It turns are poor lead into a whore! But really I have to say I liked the big orgasims and hard gasping that the very cute Karen and her stud hubby Jerry did while being under the beds control. I myself had a similar trouble with a bed but it just made my heart beat faster Long storyOkay so every chance they get there's more sex. One funny part is during the 3rd love scene Jerry is holding Karen's breasts while being chocked by her so you couldn't see her nipples. That's what I like you don't have to show much of anything for the two to be sexy and that's a hard task. So very good you two!Jerry later on has a dream with the same Chicago gal that has been in Karen's dreams too. This gal goes out and seduces him and there's another sex scene. This time Chicago gal takes off her top! Hey I thought this was a good old family ghost movie? Why doesn't Jerry hold her nipples to block them from the camera? Anyways lets more on you pervert's. The movie ends on a sad note. Cutie Jerry is possessed by pig face and ties to kill his wife. But she doesn't go down without a fight.with a hammer! She grab's a hammer and in the funniest part of the film wack's JerryPig Face with it. But no not once but over and over so that his skull sinks into a pool of blood and guts. And when it comes on contact with his skull the sound effect is like she's hitting a 200pound metal weight. And watch to see how she swings it classic!Now it may sound as if I didn't like this movie but I did. The main leads are sexy and keep you into the story. It was their first movie but I hope to see more of them in the future. The film plot is very oringalha ha and it is filmed okay.".

It is of course about a bed that is haunted by the spirit of a man or something that once killed a woman with a wig and long false eyelashes. Along the way we get a five minute opening credit sequence is the one for Lawrence Of Arabia even as long? a murderer with Marylin Manson contacts who kills using the same technique as the troll in Cat's Eye demonstrations of a sexual practice Michael Hutchence may have employed a preview of what Emilio Estevez will soon look and act like soft core porn even Cinemax would pass on manbutt and one topless scene a wacky or is it whackee? ending involving unintentionally hilarious hammer hits and leftover strawberry pie well it looked that way to me and a rudimentary surprise ending apros pos of nothing much. It's like the screenwriter even fell asleep on the Deathbed before finishing the last draft.It's not scary it's not sexy it's shot on hidef video and doesn't look bad but doesn't look good either the acting is just good enough to not be bad enough to be fun and so is everything else. No one would probably have even seen or heard of it unless it was on a disc with another movie the modern day double feature. I wasn't paying attention for parts of it so I may have missed something.

	schema:reviewBody "Where do I begin its one of the most frustrating movies I've seen because it makes a lot of sense in terms of the point but it comes off as seriously stupid. A movie about a ghost inhabited bed?? The first 2 minutes of the movie shows a black and white flashback of a weird looking fat dude going dominatrix on a Fabienne from Pulp Fiction lookalike contest winner and strangles her with his tie. This is supposed to set up how the bed factors into the story. Still though if you wanted an opening to keep people interested or send them away early having a strangulation is the way to do it. Fast forward to the present day a married couple moves into an apartment with a friendly landlord and begins unpacking their things so far everything's normal. Then one night while doing the hippity dippity on a single mattress they realize they need a bed frame. This is where things get fishy why didn't they bring or buy a gd damn bed frame before they got there? We learn that the door leading to the attic where the first 2 minutes took place doesn't open but then once the couple realizes they need a bed frame the door magically opens. They go up to the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it downstairs and their lovemaking days are saved...or so they thought. The rest of the movie centers around the both of them being haunted by the bedframe. The female is an artist so she starts drawing up the ghoulish images she dreams about and the male is a photographer so he starts having his models act as if they're bring tortured or tied up.one of which has gray hair and appears over 50 years old yuck The female grows increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in was once a haven for serial killings and murders which bring about the end to the movie. They find the friendly landlord murdered which makes no sense since ghosts need to take a human form to kill and decide to get the hell out of dodge. While packing up the husband moronically goes up into the attic where he is possessed by the crazy fat dude and the female bashes his skull in before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills some dude trying to hit on her.Well if you've read this far you have to be thinking one thing.......WHY THE HELL DIDN'T THEY JUST THROW THE BEDFRAME OUT THE WINDOW???? Seriously they never said anything about the actual house being haunted just the bed....so why not get rid of the damn thing and move on? That's why the movie is so frustrating because it actually is a good plot and the actors follow suit accordingly but there are more holes in it than Sonny Corleone at a toll booth. The couple did try to leave town as upposed to every other movie that has the ol oh lets give this place a chance honey scheme going so props to that. Still though me and my buddy who watched the movie kept saying every 5 minutes....why didn't they just throw the bed out? Especially once they learned it was haunted would have been a good time to set it on fire or something.All in all its a nearwatchable movie with plenty of porno like bed scenes and a believable plot to an extent but the solution is so simple you're scratching your head by the end of the movie wondering how stupid can the married couple be? The highlight of the movie is when the husband tells the 50 year old model to spread her legs and his assistant tells him that he can't shoot her like that.4 out of 10 a low budget porno The Man Show would love".

A movie about a ghost inhabited bed?? The first 2 minutes of the movie shows a black and white flashback of a weird looking fat dude going dominatrix on a Fabienne from Pulp Fiction lookalike contest winner and strangles her with his tie. This is supposed to set up how the bed factors into the story. Still though if you wanted an opening to keep people interested or send them away early having a strangulation is the way to do it. Fast forward to the present day a married couple moves into an apartment with a friendly landlord and begins unpacking their things so far everything's normal. Then one night while doing the hippity dippity on a single mattress they realize they need a bed frame.

They have all woken up inside there and have no idea where they are what they're doing there how long they've been there or even who they are or how long they'll be there. They apparently are unable to feel anything and every now and then a loud clanging sound makes them all fall down. All of them have tried various ways of finding an exit unsuccessfully. The army major especially is determined to escape. He tries all sorts of ways to find an exit but he cannot find one. Even when he hits the walls with his sword it shatters. The major suggests that they are in Hell so there IS no way out. Eventually the five characters decide that the only way out is to make a human tower. But then when the ballerina nearly reaches the top the clanging sound goes again ...";

	schema:reviewBody "For those curious this episode is based in theme upon Pirandello's play Six Characters in Search of an Author and JeanPaul Sartre's play No Exit as indicated most obviously by its title but of course with a Sterling twist. Five very different individuals find themselves in a round room with no idea who they are other than the indication of their attire. A bell intermittently rings perhaps also a Hemmingway allusion? increasing the agony of their incarceration. The newcomer to the group a Major is determined to escape while the others are resigned to their fate. Unlike Pirandello these characters don't even have a story. They have nothing other than the experience of the room in their consciousness and no one to author their nonexistent story so their position is even more hopeless than the characters in Pirandello's piece. Unlike both Pirandello and Sartre there is no relationship involved between the characters and therefore no real conflict between them though the theme of personal responsibility versus apathy is prominent in this story. Though this diverges significantly from the storyline of the authors alluded to in the title themes of Sartre and Pirandello and many other authors of the twentieth century come through with absolute clarity. This is very obviously a piece which addresses postmodernist perspective in the context of the Cold War era. There is also an emphasis upon issues of personal insignificance. This is easily one of the best episodes I've seen and still exceptionally relevant to current experience as are Sartre and Pirandello. Exactly what makes a good piece of writing into a classic.".

As the other characters come together they seem resigned to their fate of remaining trapped in their cylindrical prison. It's only the Major freshly introduced as a new character in their presence we find out how and why later who challenges the Clown's Murray Matheson insistence that trying to escape would be 'exerting themselves for nothing'. Gradually winning them over to his point of view the players make a stab at freedom only to be frustrated once more. The message is that it's better to try and fail than to not try at all with success measured by one's insistence on maintaining self awareness and free will against daunting odds. It's a timeless message that Serling returns to again and again sometimes subtle 2.7  Nick of Time and sometimes more obvious 2.22  The Obsolete Man. Even though Serling seemed to get repetitious with his themes from time to time it was with a firm conviction that each person alive was the master of his own fate and entrusted with personal responsibility to make full use of his talents.".

But this one is certainly one of those that merit such a rating. It is claustrophobic and colorful. The suspense is built up and we cannot wait for the reveal of the secret at the end. But whatever that secret is what these people are it doesn't really matter. Most of the beauty of the episode is to lead up to that. It would be just as powerful if we never find out what these strangers in a strange place really are.";

They feel neither hunger nor thirst but they still try to get out and find out what the hell is going on. Oh they try! They bang on the walls try to slash the metal cylinder and stand on each other's shoulder in an attempt to reach the top. The Army major finally makes it over the top of their trap but it's unclear whether he's able to tell the others what he's discovered or in fact whether he's discovered anything at all.But questions like What's it all about? and Why am I here? have no answers anyway. These five figures are ontological in the sense that they're aware of themselves and the questions they're asking are ontological questions that have no answers. The Major at least takes the lead in asking an ontic question How do we get out of this prison? That apparently has an answer.Now personally if I had been the Major I'd have settled down and accepted my fate and after a suitable period asked the ballerina to teach me some steps. That is presuming she knows some. Her arms seem stuck in the first position. No really. I happened to have studied dance in college and discovered that I was extremely good at falling down.When you get right down to it the ballerina isn't that unattractive either. She's played by Susan Harrison who was Burt Lancaster's younger sister in Sweet Smell of Success.

It is his prime directive to escape and so he garners the forces and puts them to work to reach the top of the cylinder. There is much discussion about purpose and reason and speculation on their pasts but no one can remember anything. They represent different jobs a piper a ballerina a clown a man in a tattered hat. Why are they there? It leads to an adventure and is resolved at the end but I guess I had a pretty good idea before it all happened.".

Because of this a while back I reviewed all the original Star Trek episodes the good and the bad because the overall ratings and reviews were just too positive. Now it's time to do the same for The Twilight Zone.Now I was very surprised when I saw reviews for this bland episode that described it as being among the best and gave it scores of 10. If this is the case then why is it that everyone I know who has seen this episode hates it as much as I do? It's possible that me and my family and friends are all cranks but it's also possible this is yet another case of rabid fans rabidly inflating the rating on an average or below average episode.The episode itself stars William Windom and others as various archetypesa soldier a dancer etc. They are all stuck in a cylindrical room with no escape and only at the end do you realize the shocking truthwhich isn't at all shocking and is in fact majorly lame. No this is a badly written and unengaging episode. Yes there were plenty of episodes of the series that deserved a 10 but few as undeserving as this one due to a shallow script and an unappealing resolution.".

	schema:reviewBody "Amazing Astounding Brilliant Superb. Those are the four adjectives that prop up in my head when I start describing The Kite Runner. Khaled Hosseini's book adaptation had already captured many minds in fact it is rumored that he himself broke down in to tears after watching the premier. I must say before I even start that I had read the book before I saw the advanced screening of The Kite Runner. So my judgment and views may be slightly biased.Firstly let me say it that even though in my opinion the book was better than the final product of the movie it is by no means a bad adaptation. I mean for a two hour movie it's got the deserved response. Things do appear a tad fast in the final twenty odd minutes but apart from that it has succeeded what the book did. It has captured the minds and imagination of millions all across the globe. The magic woven by Khaled Hosseini to give us a sense of remorse of joy of sadness of pain of loyalty is astute in this adaptation. Especially in the very first scene when young Hassan says If you tell me to eat dirt I will. but I know you won't ask me to. Such a touching line is bound to capture the hearts of many. The two young actors were brilliant absolutely superb. Especially the boy who played the innocent but loyal Hassan a boy who refuses to give up a kite he caught because he promised his best friend that he would bring it to him only to be abused by large bullies who beat him up and use him sexually and then to be rebuked by his best friend as a coward. The entire act is so touching that it cannot but wet your eyes.The entire movie is well placed save the last bit. The point when Amir learns of his true relationship with Hassan and reads Hassan's first and last not to him when he breaks down in tears feeling helpless lonely and remorseful that appeared a bit rushed and felt that Amir was behind a facade. In the book Khaled Hosseini had dedicated some 1012 pages to describe Amir's state of mind in that position. But that his made up for in the penultimate segment of the movie when Amir stands up for Hassan's boy his nephew Sohrab in front of his commanding fatherinlaw. The ending was well deserved and I am sure will be well appreciated. It felt witnessing the torch pass down from one generation to another.Coming over to the technical aspects. First of all the acting. Just one wordSuperb. From start to finish young Hassan and Amir their father his friend Rahim Khan. Everyone has been superb especially young Hassan. Second the direction was amazing coupled with some brilliant camera work. The background score was also impressive. Right from the start credit track to the end credit and I especially loved the one when Amir is in the mosque in Pakistan the western and Islamic fusion made that extra special.All in all this is definitely one of the better movies and it's a welcome break from all those Iran inspired movies that we have floating all over this year. 910 !!!".

The scenes between him and Baba were especially touching. I thought the locations they used were interesting... scenes set in Afghanistan were shot in China and one scene that took place in Fremont CA the graduation scene was actually shot on Treasure Island in San Francisco. I worked one day as an extra on Kite Runner and it was that day the day they shot the graduation scene. We reported to Treasure Island in the morning they checked everyone's wardrobe to make sure it looked like the late 80s an then we took our places in the audience. They shot the scene over and over again until they were happy with it. It was cool to see the actors up close and also to see the book's author who was on hand as a story consultant. I thought this book was excellent and I recommend both the book and the movie to anyone. This is a moving story about friendship love guilt and eventual redemption. There is a way to be good again.".

They shot the scene over and over again until they were happy with it. It was cool to see the actors up close and also to see the book's author who was on hand as a story consultant. I thought this book was excellent and I recommend both the book and the movie to anyone. This is a moving story about friendship love guilt and eventual redemption. There is a way to be good again.";

	schema:reviewBody "This really is a film of two halves. The first detailing the lives and friendship of two boys one a privileged Pashtun and the other a downtrodden Hazara in late 70s Afghanistan before the invasion by the USSR works extremely well. The young actors turn in convincing performances and seeing Afghanistan as it once was throws the present situation there into stark relief.The real problem comes when we move into the later phase of the story where we join the Pashtun as a man living in America. Ancient debts to his young friend lead him to return to his homeland and it is really at this point that things break down. The central adult character is clearly supposed to be sympathetic but in fact comes across as wimpish and wallowing in self pity. It is hard to really care for him and one cannot help but feel that the really interesting story is the one we do not get to see  that of his boyhood friend.Once he returns to Afghanistan the narrative becomes bogged down in a series of highly contrived coincidences. Most remarkably he manages to come across his childhood enemy after all these years almost immediately even though he is not looking for him despite the chaos that has since consumed the country. This enables him to confront past demons in a way that is simply too convenient to be credible. The resolution of the narrative is also run through with an awful mawkish sentimentality which undermines any really serious points the film may be trying to make.Although it is possible to start seeing characters and the abuses of their lives as symbols of a state which has been torn apart by world politics it is hard to really see this as a film which engages with any wider political discussion. Instead the narrative becomes reduced to one character's emotional journey of self discovery and healing. Unfortunately this character is so dull and wrapped up in himself that it is hard to really become engaged in his story while opportunities to make a really interesting film about Afghanistan itself are wasted.".

Assef isn't even German which was a small but important part of his character and his obsession with Hitler at least explained more of why he was so crazy at the end. oh i almost forgot i HATED that they gave the blue kite a face. it was unnecessary and leaving it out would have allowed more important things from the book to be put into the movie. the movie on its own was pretty good but just lacked the overall feeling of the book and there were WAY too many pointless changes from the book for me to like it.".

A good example  Hassan actually had an operation for his birthday present from Amir's father to correct his harelip not a kite! I think because so many of the scenes in the film were very short as they were trying to fit so much into the film there is little time to engage with the characters and have any emotional attachment to them. This made the film almost not caring about its purpose. The emotion of the book never appeared in the film. I was not upset or distressed at all. I should have been.

	schema:reviewBody "It was AMAZING. As a librarian and an attendee at the New York Library Association's Vitality Fund Event on Thursday night October 18 I was privileged to see a prerelease screening of the new movie The Kite Runner. The release of the movie has been delayed because of concerns about the welfare of the child actors involved. I am grateful that the NYLA event was allowed to go on as planned.Regarding the movie I feel it was masterfully done. It had as much impact on me I think as Stanley Kubrik's A Clockwork Orange even though it is much less graphic  MUCH less. There is no comparison between the horrendous shocking violence and rape shown in A Clockwork Orange and the small amount of violence actually shown in Kite Runner only the subject matter and the implications for the human psyche are comparable. I have written more details about the violence and child rape and how it was handled on my MySpace blog. My overall impression was that this film was fantastic one of the bestmade films I have seen. The depiction of the Afghani boys flying their kites captured some of the beauty and grace of an art form unknown to most of the world. The subject matter is intensely serious and the movie carries the emotions of the audience into that subject matter without many jarring Hollywood touches which have ruined other movies. Although the overturned cart of pomegranates was an obvious bit of symbolism to me.Finally I must mention the excellence of the sound track. The recitation by the boy of poetry by Rumi as two main characters are fleeing the country during the Russian invasion  under terrifying circumstances  truly showed the power of those poems. I urge anyone watching to disregard the subtitles in that scene to the extent that you can and just listen to the beauty of the language. I don't even know what language Amir is quoting whether his normal Dari Persian dialect is the same as Rumi's original Persian dialect. Also please note the sound heard every time a kite line is cut. I found it a profound distinctive sound though the librarians who were with me did not notice it at all. I can't help but wonder if kites actually make a sound like that when they are cut or if it gives a sense of the vibrationsound experienced by the kite flyer during competition.".

Meanwhile director Marc Forster and screenwriter David Beniof lace the film with the major motif kite running to such an ingenious extent that it not only ties in the hero's youth with his maturity it also provides a figurative way of showing the desolation and hope of the country mixed of course with contradictory elements such as cutting string and blessed artificial legs.Thus the film as metaphor is a success in showing the dismal past of a struggling country and its hopeful future.

Based on the megabest seller from author Khaled Hosseini the film provides us a peak at the ugliness of postRussia invaded Afghanistan and the terror of the Taliban. Director Marc Foster adds a gem to his resume which already includes Monster's Ball Finding Neverland and Stranger Than Fiction.The story of young friends Amir and Hassan and the unknown bond they share into the next generation. This is a story of honor and courage and loyalty and is an unusual comingofage tale. Some great scenes of the boys when they are kids and then a couple of truly amazing scenes as Amir returns as an adult to find Hassan's imprisoned son.This is tight compelling story telling with a message. The acting is solid throughout with no one actor stealing the screen. Although not a pleasant story to watch unfold it is certainly meaningful and heart felt. Plus a quick shot of Midnight Oil playing in the pool hall is a welcome gift.".

Almost right from the start I started seeing signs that the film was not going to be quite as good as the book but I tried to remain entirely optimistic and separate my expectation from the book as opposed to the movie. The script ended up being very underdeveloped and did not give the viewer the opportunity to emotionally connect with many of the primary characters.I ended up giving the film a rating 5 out of 10 when I weighed in the beautiful cinematography which was absolutely breathtaking... but not worth the bore. Look for a picture instead.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all the hype about The Kite Runner was wildly overblown and sadly the movie is just as disappointing as the book. Most of the novel is outstanding but it completely falls off a cliff at the end and then closes with a happilyeverafter ending that seems just as tackedon as the worst of the Hollywood offenders. True the movie is remarkably faithful to the novel but the whole story especially because of the cartoonish confrontation at the end gives me the feeling that it is little more than a childish revenge fantasy which is only legitimized because author Khaled Hosseini really can write. I was an English major when I was in college and one of the things that I noticed in any creative writing class that I ever took was that because almost every single person wrote stories starring themselves as Hosseini has clearly done and like for example Stephen King almost always does many of them wrote stories about something bad that happened to them in which they augmented the wrong committed against them and then issued a perfectly planned and executed retribution against their offender. This ladies and gentlemen is what you have with The Kite Runner.Now I won't say that Hosseini was bullied as a child lived in a harsh environment and therefore wrote a heroic story about that. Indeed the setting in Afghanistan and the oppressive atmosphere is both wellpresented and an important real life issue. But when the Taliban appears and starts stoning adulterous women to death in front of packed stadiums and bad guys parade little boys around in makeup and get shot in the eye with slingshots then it all becomes clear what's really going on. I remember that the novel was extremely popular when it was released and I remember being at a loss to explain the fame after I read it. It is indeed a pageturner but it has an unfortunately combination of amazingly realistic descriptions and situations with goofy overblown movie villains that gives the whole thing a feeling of being an artificial contraption drummed up by someone trying to make his way into the writing business. But hey Hosseini has succeeded in making the artificial successful twice now so maybe it's me who should take some advice. But I think it would be difficult for anyone to argue that Hosseini has succeeded as much in the quality of his storytelling as he has in the BUSINESS of storytelling. In that regard this is definitely a success story!I also feel like a lot of people are going to pick up on the arrogance of presenting America as this holy land a paradise on earth where all you have to do is get there and everything will be okay. Of course it is true of the little boy living under the iron fist of the Taliban but it's that kind of thinking that has gotten America into a lot of trouble in the past. And I also love how Amir our hero goes to Afghanistan but doesn't know enough not to stare at a passing pickup truck full of bearded guys holding AK47's. Smart.And by the way can I just say one thing? What is the deal with the Taliban? Those people are totally insane. Oh and the best thing about the movie is that little kid who played Hassan. He had the most important role in the movie and he was OUTSTANDING.".

Amir feels that his wise and good father Baba Homayoun Ershadi blames him for the death of his mother in the delivery and also that his father loves and prefers Hassam to him. In return Amir feels a great respect for his father's best friend Rahim Khan Shaun Toub who supports his intention to become a writer. After Amir winning a competition of kitting Hassam runs to bring a kite to Amir but he is beaten and raped by the brutal Assef Elham Ehsas in an empty street to protect Amir's kite the coward Amir witness the assault but does not help the loyal Hassam. On the day after his birthday party Amir hides his new watch in Hassam's bed to frame the boy as a thief and force his father to fire Ali releasing his conscience from recalling his cowardice and betrayal. In 1979 the Russians invade Afghanistan and Baba and Amir escape to Pakistan. In 1988 they have a simple life in Fremont California when Amir graduates in a public college for the pride and joy of Baba. Later Amir meets his countrywoman Soraya Atossa Leoni and they get married. In 2000 after the death of Baba Amir is a famous novelist and receives a phone call from the terminal Rahim Khan who discloses secrets about his family forcing Amir to return to Peshawar in Pakistan in a journey of redemption.I am not familiar with the Afghan culture and I did not read this novel in spite of the recommendation of my daughter and yesterday I decided to watch this movie on DVD. I found a good story of loyalty cowardice betrayal and redemption with a brief insight in the recent history of Afghanistan from a peaceful period in the 70's to the present days with the Taliban. The actors and actresses have great performances giving credibility to the realistic story. The arid locations in China recall the images we see in television from Afghanistan. In the end I found The Kite Runner a good movie. My vote is seven.Title Brazil O Caador de Pipa The Kite Chaser".

	schema:reviewBody "THE KITE RUNNER is one of these movies that' gains a limited release on the art house foreign language circuit is totally loved by critics and people who never pay a penny to watch a mainstream movie . It's also a film with a message and a deep subtext about friendship in the face of adversity which can be a rather hit and miss concept for a movie . Knowing this I delayed watching the film until tonight where I chanced upon it . It's a fair enough film though certainly not a great one What the film does succeed in doing is not painting 1970s Afghanistan as some sort of third world cess pit . For an adventurous backpacker from the period it was a favourite destination on the Kathmandu  Istanbul  Hippy trail  and the Afghans are painted as sophisticated intellectuals whose only link to the past is in keeping with an honor system along with the portrayal of division among the differing Afghan tribes . Unfortunately bad things in both films and life happen to nice people and the upper class Baba and his young son Amir flee the Soviet invasion to Pakistan and there to America where Amir grows up to be a novelist unable to shake off a feeling of guilt about abandoning his childhood friend Hassan THE KITE RUNNER also deserves slight credit for the portrayal of the Taliban . To quote Christopher Hitchens  They're not the wretched of the Earth  they're the scum of the Earth  They patrol the rubble of Afghanistan on beard patrols  provide half time entertainment during soccer matches by stoning adulterers and despite banning music visit orphanages to satisfy their lust for children  Along with flying kites  they're not above keeping a ghetto blaster or two for themselves Why did I say  slight credit  ? To be honest I don't think the violent  stomach churning and often hypocritical theocratic tyranny of the Taliban was shown harshly enough . You can't give a dog like the Taliban a bad enough name and would have liked to seen the way they treat the inhabitants of Afghanistan . There's also a Pashtun character who is introduced early in the story and appears later in he film which gives the impression that the Taaliban are an Afghan organisation when in reality they're a Pakistani militia which invaded the country of Afghanistan in the mid 1990s . Many Pastuns did join the Taliban  but many didn't and they suffered by the regime along with Hazaras  Tadjiks  Uzbeks and the other Afghan tribes Undoubtedly the biggest failing of the film is that I never felt engaged for much of the running time . It's difficult not to compare this movie with THE KILLING FIELDS since both movies feature a deep subtext of the bond of friendship enduring through adversity and war . . Of course THE KILLING FIELDS is based upon a true story whilst this merely based upon a novel . It's a film that's directed in a rather flat manner by Marc Forster which isn't necessarily a criticism because the acting is convincing and was shocked to find Khalid Abdalla is Glasgow born  I genuinely though he was an Afghan  but I was left with the feeling that despite THE KITE RUNNER being a fair movie it should have been a great and unforgettable movie experience".

The spoken message is a message of redemption. After returning to Afghanistan to rescue and be rescued by his halfbrother's son Amir finds a degree of contentment upon becoming good again. It was not until I continued to reflect upon the movie that I recognized the unspoken message. I was troubled by what drove Amir to find the courage the backbone the character to stand up to his General fatherinlaw when he was disrespectful regarding his halfbrother's son. Although I can see where finding contentment from becoming good again contributed to finding the character to stand up to the General  of itself  it did not seem sufficient.Throughout the movie Amir desired to be like his father to have his father's character and to be respected by his father for the character that his father recognized in Hassan. Amir saw his father as an individual of towering and unassailable character which he was. One of the reasons Amir did not see himself with the character of his father was because he saw himself with flaws that would prevent the attainment of those heights. It was not until Amir learned that his father was not without faults fathering a child with his servant's wife that he recognized that his father's flaws did not prevent his father from developing and attaining character. It is this recognition the unspoken message  that we can have flaws and still have character that allows Amir to find his own character to stand up to the General.In essence the unspoken message is telling us that we as individuals may have deficiencies but that should not stop us from developing enhancing and embracing our own character. We are too often overly critical of our own shortcomings and do not give ourselves credit for the quality person that we are. If we are not perfect today there is always tomorrow! This is an ongoing ever evolving ever improving process. The past cannot be changed only tomorrow can be improved!".

The scenery etc... all made you feel like you were in Kabul. The acting was all very good although I am sure some of the emotions were lost in the translation. And the story itself was good and pure and uplifting. Yes the story was very sad but at the same time uplifting.And I will be honest as a white American... made me see aside of Kabul and Afghanistan that I never picture in my mind when I think about it. Showed me a Afghanistan before the Taliban. Showed me a place that was beautiful. Showed me a place with good hearted people. I community that was like a family aside from a few bullies.Anyways I recommend this movie to everyone. It is one of the best I have ever seen.".

For those who haven't I advice you to read the book and avoid the film as does not hold a candle to its source.The big problem with the film is its apparent lack of care for its source material as all the big events are simply glossed over and never given the impact they should have. The movie seems to just want to hit its mark and leave it at that. This gives everything a rushed feel with big moments from the novel happening in the film way too soon and only lasting a couple of seconds.Another problem it has are the parts that it leaves out. I know a movie based on a book can't get everything in from the book but The Kite Runner leaves out way too much mostly in its attempts to get to the bigger parts of the story. It doesn't realize that having those smaller moments are what make the big moments have impact because through these smaller moments we learn who these characters are and why we should care about them. Without them they might as well be completely different characters in every other scene.That's about all I can say about The Kite Runner other than it is in desperate need of a narrator. To sum it all up this adaptation is more based on the Spark Notes of the novel than it is on the novel itself. Just avoid it and read the book instead.".

In 1989 Michael Crichton directed an explosive and tense thriller and he chose the star Burt Reynolds to interpret the main character... Perhaps Crichton didn't know but the heavy powerful and lowering presence of Reynolds helped to transform  Physical Evidence  in one of the best and more violent films of the gender better than  Payback  or any other...with a hate and frustration glance  a cynic and bitter smile and his black and big mustache Reynolds built one of the most complex and lowering characters of Hollywood's history. Joe Paris Reynolds is a hard cop alcoholic and violent. A man who hates the world and the people in it.He doesn't get to control his temper and he is a true clockbomb an unexpected man who is capable to kill somebody at any second. When the body of a wellknown boss of the crime is found with his throat cut Paris becomes in the eyes of the police the main suspect after all the criminal was an old enemy of Joe. Jenny a public defender decides to help him she trusts this mysterious man and she tries to at every cost prove his innocence and she finishes falling in love for him. Managing Michael Crichton builds an excellent film with a good rhythm always maintaining the exact dose of suspense and tension.As he had already shown in his other films Crichton demonstrates that he knows how to ally a good plot with a cast at the same height and value. The scene in which Paris literally destroys some men who insult him is really frightening. He even  threads a man's head through the window of the car. Paris is not without a doubt the good and nice cop that Bruce Willis interpret on the contrary Paris is a killing machine a man who finds himself strange and full of rage! unlike the characters that Bruce Willis interprets Joe Paris is revengeful unfriendly explosive and intolerant that is to say he is not afraid of anything the death in the vision of Paris is a marked encounter for which he waits a long time. Paris is not afraid of death he knows he has no limits and he'll kill anyone who trespasses it.  Physical Evidence  is a dark and dramatic thriller. It seems the crimedrama films of the seventies. The movie explores the corrupt policemen's cruel and degrading routine the prostitutes the homosexuals the criminals. In this film the cops smell cocaine and they kill without pity. The streets are filmed as stages of betrayal and tragedies. In the middle of this treacherous sets Physical Evidence  intrigue is developed. This is not a film for sensitive people. Reynolds after his fascinating return in the masterpiece  Boogie Nights  signed a contract with the television net TNT owner of the best and largest studio for films made for television and he offered to his fans of the whole world the same character type again. In  Hard Time  Reynolds interprets a violent dangerous and explosive policeman but perhaps Joe Paris has been his most frightening and mysterious character a man consumed by the drugs and the hate... Fascinating and violent this film is a true masterpiece of the gender! watch it! Burt Reynolds once again gives an interpretation show and he demonstrates the reason why he is one of the most consecrated actors of Hollywood! and in this film he has the chance of exploring all his charisma all his charm and talent. Unlike similar films like  Die Hard  a shot in  Physical Evidence  is more violent and shocking than each one of those films together exactly because Reynolds' film explores the reality! in the films when a thief is wounded he falls down on the ground and he dies at once. In  Physical Evidence  you are wounded you fall and you die well slowly as it is in fact! intrigue romance and action all this is shown in this sad and dark film!it is sad the fact that the Academy didn't recognize the effort and the beauty of this work and it is also sadder for this film not to have been seen a lot. But you have to discover this work! rent  Physical Evidence  and get ready to root for the bad guy! and this time the bad guy isn't Mel Gibson  He is Burt Reynolds the man who makes all the difference!...".

Unlike similar films like  Die Hard  a shot in  Physical Evidence  is more violent and shocking than each one of those films together exactly because Reynolds' film explores the reality! in the films when a thief is wounded he falls down on the ground and he dies at once. In  Physical Evidence  you are wounded you fall and you die well slowly as it is in fact! intrigue romance and action all this is shown in this sad and dark film!it is sad the fact that the Academy didn't recognize the effort and the beauty of this work and it is also sadder for this film not to have been seen a lot. But you have to discover this work! rent  Physical Evidence  and get ready to root for the bad guy! and this time the bad guy isn't Mel Gibson  He is Burt Reynolds the man who makes all the difference!...";

Clear evidence is in his room that he committed the murder but he was so drunk that he can't remember a thing. Public defender Jenny Hudson Theresa Russell fights to get the case thinking she can save the man but before long her life is in danger as there's much more going on than she originally thought.If you're looking for a hardhitting courtroom drama then I'd highly recommend INHERIT THE WIND. If you're looking for an A quality Reynolds film then I'd recommend DELIVERANCE. If you're looking for any of those things or any sort of art then you're not going to find it here but at the same time as long as you don't take the film too seriously you could get some mild entertainment out of this. There's no question that by this time Reynolds wasn't a A list star anymore and this is the perfect example of a B movie.I call this a B movie because the material isn't very strong. I mean everything pretty much falls into place without too much logic and the ending seems more like something from ScoobyDoo more than anything else. The entire murder rap has countless bad guys brought into it and any of them could have been guilty so this too works against any sort of logic. I'd even argue that by the film presenting Reynolds as being innocent it takes away possible drama because it would have played out better if the viewer didn't know if he was guilty or not.With that said I still found myself enjoying PHYSICAL EVIDENCE thanks in large part to the cast. I wouldn't say Reynolds gives a great performance here but he's at least entertaining and this fits well with the aftermath of some of the rough cops he played earlier in his career. He's certainly believable in the role and I thought it was a good fit for him. Russell is good in her role as the woman trying to get him off although the screenplay doesn't do much with her character and the forced attempted love story is trash. Ned Beatty is always good and he adds some nice entertainment value as does Kay Lenz Kenneth Welsh and Tom O'Brien. Married With Children... fans will enjoy seeing Ted McGinley here although his character is yet another weak one.As you can tell there's a lot of negative things about this picture but it still kept me entertained throughout. I think it's best that you turn your brain off and just watch this on a boring day whenever you just want some light entertainment. This certainly isn't a masterpiece or a very good picture but if you're a fan of Reynolds then you should enjoy it.".

This film first began as a sequel to Jagged Edge but when that film's stars Glenn Close and Robert Loggia wisely took a hike it was reworked with different characters. Reynolds plays a suspended police detective with many brawls in his past and many enemies who is accused of murdering a shady character he'd been tangling with previously. Russell is the public defender assigned to him who is trying to make a name for herself in the boy's club though Reynolds is often more of a problem to her case than a help. She comes up against various roadblocks and red herrings as she tried to unravel what happened with Reynolds he blacked out and can't even remember the night in question! Meanwhile prosecutor Beatty plays any dirty trick he can and her yuppie boyfriend McGinley whines about how little time she is spending with him. Reynolds was at this time in the midst of a string of unsuccessful films which portrayed him as a tough guy despite the fact that his health was failing somewhat and he was no longer able to bring his trademark sparkle to the screen as effectively as he had before. Fortunately for him the TV series Evening Shade would soon rescue him and give him a steady  and awardwinning  job for about five years until he made a comeback in supporting roles in feature films a few years after that. If he'd been playing opposite someone more appropriate in age and demeanor than Russell his performance here probably would have come off better. As it is he waffles between fainthearted antagonism and near narcolepsy battling a preposterous script that wouldn't be worth anyone's effort anyway. Russell is profanely wrong for her role and is often unintentionally funny. Not aided by a severe all grey and black wardrobe ugly oversized jewelry tightlyknotted hair and pallid ghostly makeup she flounders helplessly as she tries to deliver her lines with anything other than a flat monotone. She seems out of place and shares virtually no chemistry with Reynolds. Beatty whose Boston accent comes and goes tries to steal every scene he's in and usually succeeds thanks to the lack of opposition on that front. Lenz appears as an exlove of Reynolds and manages to inject some emotion into her few moments one of which includes an uproarious Jazzercise getup. Gorgeous McGinley is both intentionally and unintentionally funny as the uppity persnickety jerk with whom Russell lives. His blinkandmissit scene walking to their hot tub in some skimpy briefs is about the best thing the film has to offer. Baker O'Brien and Welsh appear as other potential suspects in the murder which is revealed in a wacky tacky prelude involving a suicide attempt. It's a mindblowingly idiotic affair that wavers between dullness and jawdropping amusement. Though it was routine and inconsequential upon release at least now it offers up some laughs as McGinley decked out in the designer gear of the day and Russell debate the merits of a cellular phone and Welsh speaks into one the size of a small Kleenex box! The convoluted plot at least keeps viewers guessing though it probably left the screenwriters guessing almost as much!".

Every scene she's in is the worse for it she is truly the most destructive force I've ever seen in an otherwise decent movie. And she's acting against a string of B and C grade actors most delivering belowpar performances yet they still seem Oscarworthy next to her.I'm giving the movie a couple of extra stars for the idea of a story that could've been entertaining if it had a real actress delivering the main female part and for a couple of decent scenes without her presence but really this movie should be avoided at all cost!".

And she's acting against a string of B and C grade actors most delivering belowpar performances yet they still seem Oscarworthy next to her.I'm giving the movie a couple of extra stars for the idea of a story that could've been entertaining if it had a real actress delivering the main female part and for a couple of decent scenes without her presence but really this movie should be avoided at all cost!";

	schema:reviewBody "Yes I know it's not THAT old of a movie it only dates to 1995. However so much has happened in our world since then it just seems like it's been around for years.I think the movie is very good and very funny and certainly much better than critics gave it credit for every time I see it in the TV listings it has only one star by it. Why?!. I watch it routinely it's on TV a lot especially USA network. Two things I like about it are the pacing and the deeper story that plays in the background.First the pacing this movie hits the deck running and never stops moving it just keeps rolling right along from one nutty event to the next but it is all carefully intertwined and everything works in   symmetry to bring the viewer to the admittedly schmaltzy happy ending. Anyway I like it when a movie maintains a good pace or a rhythm never letting itself get too bogged down. Tommy Boy is one of those.Second the deeper story in the background all the times I've watched this movie I've never lost sight of the fact that the story didn't just revolve around some big dumb guy who couldn't seem to find his way out of a wet paper bag. No there was always in the background the sad issue of Tommy Boy's beloved father dying. Plus another sobering issue that of how all this will lead to rather dire economic consequences for a business Callahan Autoparts that's been around for a long time and has employed lots of people in the town of Sandusky. Those two grim facts of life  death in the family and impending economic consequences  make this movie more compelling watching than one may realize and I think this movie will hold up well over the years to come just for those reasons.But enough with the gloom already. This movie is just plain FUNNY thanks not just to Chris Farley but to an entire cast that seems to work really well together. I couldn't envision the cast members being changed or replaced in any form. And Chris Farley did such a seamless depiction of this funny guy named Tommy Boy that I still in my heart of hearts just know that there really IS a big dumb funny guy named Tommy Callahan somewhere in Sandusky Ohio who is running an autoparts factory. No there really IS a Tommy Callahan believe me... It's kinda' like PeeWee Herman that wasn't really an actor named Paul Reubens playing him no!  there really IS a PeeWee Herman who is totally in love with his bicycle and has a dog named Speck...Funny but I look at waitresses in restaurants just a little differently now thanks to that wonderful scene where Tommy Boy explains to Helen why he sucks as a salesman. And any time I'm feeling down I just remember Fat guy in a little coat. Hey Prehistoric Forest! Holy Schnikees! Hey quit playin' with yer dinghy! plus many other lines LOL LOL Those will always cheers me up!".

	schema:reviewBody "What can you say about Tommy Boy well its without a doubt stupid over the top and not a film with any real message to make you think about life in general. But its also a very very funny film and most likely my favorite Chris Farley film Black Sheep coming a close second.I should point out that i am English so i haven't seen any Saturday Night Live shows and only know Farley and Spade from their films and Spades stand up comedy. I think that if you want a film to watch that kills an hour and a half and keeps you laughing from start to finish then this is for you.It does have moments of slushy i love you in it but they are very few and far between and the slapstick comedy is well worth the wait. The story line is very basic Farley must sell his late fathers brake pads to keep his business alive. But its the amount of situations that both Farley and Spade encounter along the way that make the film so funny and watchable.I can't say enough about this film to really sell it to anyone but it simply is a very very funny film and ironicly if it has a message to leave the viewer with its how sad the loss of Farley is and how much great comedy was lost once he died.Watch this filmRotten Addict!".

	onyx:emotionText "What can you say about Tommy Boy well its without a doubt stupid over the top and not a film with any real message to make you think about life in general. But its also a very very funny film and most likely my favorite Chris Farley film Black Sheep coming a close second.I should point out that i am English so i haven't seen any Saturday Night Live shows and only know Farley and Spade from their films and Spades stand up comedy. I think that if you want a film to watch that kills an hour and a half and keeps you laughing from start to finish then this is for you.It does have moments of slushy i love you in it but they are very few and far between and the slapstick comedy is well worth the wait.

His father Thomas 'Big Tom' Callahan II Brian Dennehy owns an auto parts factory in Ohio. When Tommy arrives back home he finds he has a position at the factory waiting for him. His dad also introduces Tommy to the new brake pad division of the factory and to Tommy's soontobe stepmother Beverly BarishBurns Bo Derek and her supposed son Paul Barish Rob Lowe. But when Big Tom dies the factory threatens to go under unless the new brake pads are to be sold. Therefore Tommy must go on the road to sell them along with the assistance of Richard Hayden David Spade Big Tom's righthand man.  Beverly and Paul who are con artists and also husband and wife who try to con Tommy and his family out of the company's money.  Tommy and Richard travel all over the Midwestern United States trying to sell a half a million brake pads.  If they don't sell the half a million brake pads the company will be sold to Ray Zalinsky Dan Aykroyd.  This movie is full of great laughs and everybody will enjoy it. If Chris Farley was alive today I bet there would be many more great and funny movies like this one.  There are plenty of great passages that I hear everyday from this movie.  I have seen it so many times I have lost count. I pretty much know it by heart.  It is that great of a movie.  Everybody needs to see it.".

There is one particular scene that had me going from tears of sentiment to tears of laughter in a matter of seconds the singalong in the car  you know the one if you've seen the movie. Even Rob Lowe had some very funny moments. Frankly I don't know how they ever managed to finish this movie as I wouldn't have been able to keep a straight face had I been one of the actors.

Tommy Boy is a character right from SNL  a big fat lovable in their opinion goof who doesn't know anything.David Spade gets the Thankless Overwhelmed Everyman role. He's paired with the Annoying Overweight Slob and they endure Miserable Misfortunes as they travel cross country to Save Daddy's Business.The plot for starters is really faulty. The whole premise  daddy dies and rich stupid son has to save the family biz  can be traced back to just about any movie you want. Like any SNL style film it is reduced to a simple motivation  empty shallow just a reason to see a fat guy and a thin guy be funny together.The movie's biggest influence is the 1987 comedy classic Planes Trains  Automobiles. That movie is great because the plot isn't stale and recycled. It's basic yeah  a guy traveling home for Thanksgiving gets stuck with a slob. But it's real dammit. It makes all the difference. The characters are real the situations are far more real. Tommy Boy is pure slapstick and its ridiculous situations undermine the characters  we feel nothing for them and we don't care about what's happening onscreen. PTA walked the careful line between outrageous and utterly believable and relateable  Tommy Boy is simply absurd with jokes like a simple deerintheheadlights turning into a crash turning into a struggle with a dead deer that really isn't dead then awakens and wrecks their car.The whole wrecked car thing is stolen completely from PTA and it's eerie how much stuff in this film actually does resemble the Steve MartinJohn Candy movie.Farley is simply way too obnoxious to find likable  I've never enjoyed watching him in any movies and this hasn't changed my mind. Spade's given very little to do serving as the movie's most thankless character.Dan Aykroyd is wasted as the Evil Baddie who plans to destroy Daddy's Business. The ending is a joke and not in a harhar funny way. More like a oh god are they serious?! way.Some people dig it that's cool. But I just can't get into it nor do I appreciate all the stuff it borrows from  not just counting PTA  without any credit whatsoever.".

And now there's Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo followed by sequel Deuce Bigalow European Gigolo.......I smell a pattern. Perhaps soon there will be Spiderman European webs are Hotter.....or not I am writing about this much maligned at time of release film. I was one of those maligners I must admit. I turned my nose up at it even while Chris Farley shoved cocaine up his nose and the SNL cast struggled through one of the worst seasons in their history in '94'95 the Norm McDonald anchorship notwithstanding. Films like Happy Gilmore Tommy Boy and Black Sheep came out in the couple years after this period and we realized there was a dark future for the caliber of SpadeFarleySchneiderSandler films. However I watched this film the other day ten years after and 8 years after Chris died and could not stop laughing. Yes it's not particularly sophisticated. Farley does what Farley does not unlike Manny being Manny but his Van Down By the River motivational speaker shtick in which he laments that while he may not wash enough or wear wellfitting clothes or use deodorant more than twice a week translates well here as the ever selfeffacing character who realizes he's not the brightest not the bestlooking and could stand to lose a few pounds. All the same he's trying his best to do what he's supposed to. And David Spade just tosses off his snide oneliners as he did for Spade's Hollywood Minute and basically stings Farley's selfesteem. There's really not a whole lot more to say than that. I love the one scene when Farley catches Spade spanking his monkey and then makes a couple quips about it. Can't remember what the first one is but the second one they're lying in their hotel beds and Farley says to Spade Do you like baseball?. Spade mutters something inaudible in response and Farleys says the New York YANKees? Anyway Farley does his awkward painfully sensitive fratboy shtick. If you like you like it.

Though their subsequent buddy flick Black Sheep was a much weaker film it showed that the duo had the potential to continue churning out comedies while sticking to the basic formula.

Too bad the SNES died out not long after this title. And clever the level names range from trademark playsonwords Lake Orangatanga to witty references that the game's targeted audience won't get for many years to come Bleak's House.What irks me about most people's criticism of this game mainly comes down to two words Kiddy Kong. He is a worthy littlebuddy successor to Diddy Kong and certainly does not deserve to be referred to as that retarded monkey. DK3 will remain a classic until the end of time.".

I guess the producers didn't think the audience would have noticed this ridiculous inaccuracy but I know I did . The producers also probably hoped the audience wouldn't notice the lack of continuity such as dogfights with Iraqi jets that suddenly turned from Migs to F4 Phantoms then back again but I did . Even stranger characters would take off in F16s then when they arrive back at base there jet has changed into a Soviet built Mig Oh and if you're expecting a dumb action movie you're only half right because it's dumb but most of the plot centres around a BASIC INSTINCT revenge plot . I'll give the producers some credit  Maybe credit is too strong a word  because after seeing plots featuring nannies from hell  policemen from hell  flat mates from hell we now have a fighter pilot from hell which means every single occupation of the 20th century has featured in a from hell type plot with perhaps TATICAL ASSUALT being the worst movie of the lot".

Seriously if Hauer is what an Iraqi POW looks like after six years in prison then hungry people everywhere should make a bee line to a jail in Baghdad.  Overall Tactical Assault rates 2 stars instead of 1 because Mike Mitchell as Hawk is terrific.

He is an Air Force pilot but he also has ninja skills riding on a truck and messing up missile programming killing armed guards and surviving tank explosions. There was also some pretty sad security on that military base. A fence a 12 year old could clime is all that stands between tanks that you can just jump in and ride. There are no guards there either? Robert Patrick goes into that munitions storage and comes out with an RPG which seems to magically reload itself. Hauer's tank also got off three shots....I thought a tank had to be reloaded after firing a shot? Hmm...The dialogue in the last ten minutes was gold. Hauer has killed Patrick's squad...and is heading towards the base to kill his wife...who of course is on the exact floor he blasts his machine guns into. Patrick says something like You S.O.B. you're no pilot! Well Hauer's character is an S.O.B and he is also crazy but he is a pilot and all. That's how this whole thing started.After Hauer's plane crashed into the water at the end I expected him to spring out of the water ala Jason in the first Friday The 13th as Patrick walked with his wife and newborn child.".

Former flying partner and friend Colonel Banning helps him get his old job back and the two are in action again over Bosnia as part of a NATO operation. However even though the report of the incident looks clean Holiday blames Banning for the years that he lost and seems not all together right in the old head there. As minor peculiarities turn into out and out barking behaviour Banning starts to worry.Fifteen minutes into this film and I had yet to hate this film as much as everyone else seems to have done I had managed to ignore the madeup history and enjoy the scenes of jets flying and men going alpha roger I'm taking fire etc etc. However at this point the film shifted slightly to Banning's wife and the backstory where Holiday starts to semistalk the family. With this the film joined the heap loads of films that already exist within this similar manwoman appears normal but gets obsessively crazy genre trips off the tongue doesn't it and it doesn't even match the low standard of the majority of them.Let me just deal with the whole setting  that of military action in Bosnia in the midnineties now I'm no expert but the whole thing was not only horribly simplistic Americans were the good guys in the conflict and those on the ground were bad but it is also plain wrong. I won't linger on this too long though because facts are not the point of this film and to be honest if you're coming to a Rutger Hauer film expecting a history lesson then you deserve all you get. Ironically the rubbish history provides the only pieces of vague entertainment as the usual stock footage of planes and explosions and the actors inside planes against blue screens at least provides some distracting motion even if it never is exciting or involving and potentially annoying if you pay too much attention to the identityswapping planes. Meanwhile the usual stalker stuff plods around on the ground until finding itself with no dramatic drive at all it simply ends with a ludicrous set piece involving tanks that have the keys left in them and a dogfight high above Bosnia. It is poor throughout and only made more annoying by just how obvious and predictable it all is.The cast act as a clue as to how average this is going to be given that it features two men who really don't do anything to deserve bigger projects that this. Hauer is obvious from the start to the end and never makes for an interesting character. In his defence Patrick at least comes across as a sort of real person but even he can find little of value to use in his performance. Glasser is the damsel in distress and does nothing but that. The support cast are all average with nothing to do but spit out the required lines in the basic required fashion.Overall this is a very poor film that tries to milk two genres but does neither of them well at all. The Top Gun action is distracting but full of stock footage and historical stupidities meanwhile the stalker stuff on the ground is plodding dull and tiresomely predictable. Don't make the same mistake as me  just avoid this.".

Tactical Assault is just one of those military movies that hits the viewer with standard issue plot and an incredibly inconsistent storyline. It almost makes the lowbudget Dolph Lundgren movies look good by comparison. Basically the story of Tactical Assault revolves around one insane Airforce officer Holiday attempting to inflict his anger and revenge on another Banning all while a military operation rages on in Eastern Europe.  It's basically the airtoair version of Dead Calm combined with Death Race 2000 in a sense. This movie is essentially insanity bordering on comedy. The funniest scene is in the end where Colonel Banning says hey it's just a civillian vehicle about a dozen times to Captain Holiday who's about to 'accidentally' destroy a white American cadillac driving haphazardly down a road.  The only redeeming value to this movie is Robert Patrick who does a surprisingly good job as the hunted Colonel Banning.".

You won't have heard of the rest of the cast and you won't recognise them either. I may have been tired while watching this film but not many movies have me struggling to stay awake. The acrobatics and shooting in the sky have always been boring and thrillfree for me while the tank chase at the end seems to be from a different film as Hauer suddenly changes from lowkey threat to allout psychopath. This ending is kind of fun but it comes as too little too late.

The pace is also a little slow but it fits with the feel of the movie. The young Australian actors are all stars in their own right in particular Theresa Palmer who's heartbreaking performance earned her an AFI nomination.The film is very well shot with terrific direction. Some scenes are a little hard to watch  in particular the fiveminutelong suicide scene but overall it is a film that leaves a big impact on its' viewers. It draws you in right from it's shocking opening scene and keeps you guessing as to which of the six main characters is going to be the one to end up in the bathroom.

This is Definitely one to watch.I think the fact that the DirectorWriter was in school only a few years ago is a major contributing factor to the raw honesty expressed in the film. The film is shot in two separate 'modes' if you will. Firstly there is the smooth observation style where we get to know the characters in their school environment as they go through their drama but the stunning part of the film is in the interview sections where we get to know the characters back stories and their deepest darkest thoughts.You keep wondering who is it going to be who commits suicide and as the drama unfolds you keep changing your mind until bam it hits you in the face in the final five minutes. I am all over the place in my writing but I've just seen it at a Media screening in Australia and I am still in a bit of shock. It's one of the best Australian Films I have seen in recent years.".

Firstly there is the smooth observation style where we get to know the characters in their school environment as they go through their drama but the stunning part of the film is in the interview sections where we get to know the characters back stories and their deepest darkest thoughts.You keep wondering who is it going to be who commits suicide and as the drama unfolds you keep changing your mind until bam it hits you in the face in the final five minutes. I am all over the place in my writing but I've just seen it at a Media screening in Australia and I am still in a bit of shock. It's one of the best Australian Films I have seen in recent years.";

I applaud the fabulous casting of this film. These are regular looking Aussie kids who invite plenty of sympathy because of this.

It's a very well shot first film though the DV format begins to show itself in outside scenes and I'm sure it has good intentions of showing us the dark side of high school  in other words every side of high school. But the filmmaker doesn't have the talent to write or direct up to the premise's promise. There are several characters but none of them are any more than what the plot requires them to be. There's no depth to these caricatures beyond the machinations of I am troubled teen X I have Y problem. The perceived roles of men and women in this story are phenomenally troublesome.Let's start with the men. You have the stoner kid who's gay the jock who's also gay the boy who rapes his sister and Mr. Peepants. As the stereotype requires all gay men must be sexually unfulfilled and violent toward women and themselves. Naturally or unnaturally as the stereotype assumes the two gay male characters beat up women Peepants and themselves. I'd be perfectly fine with these characterizations if the stereotypes were turned on their heads or if the characters somehow transcended them. Yet neither took place and that's all there is to these characters' stories.Next the ladies. One young woman wants to be a bulimic housewife another is the pregnant rapee of the sisterraping brother and there's the girl who kills herself I'll get to that later. Again I don't think there's a requirement of political correctness for filmmakers I'd be out of a job were that the case but I do think that it's only justified if there's more to that character or story. If that archetype were being used to reveal something about character other than I'm a teenager and life sucks I'd be happy as a clam. But nothing new is revealed! Nothing is subverted or changed or sublimated.Finally the girl who kills herself. This is blunt and HIGHLY sloppy storytelling. We're supposed to sit through 5 minutes of a girl violently killing herself who we've seen for maybe 30 seconds through the whole film? We've followed all these other stories for an hour and a half and now we're invited to torture ourselves for a character that isn't part of the story? It's cheap exploitative and sloppy. Despite the millions of crappy indie films that came before this you have to EARN something like that. You can't simply purchase it on credit. So this suicide happens we get wrapups from the characters that go similarly nowhere but down and the film ends. What have I learned? I already knew high school sucked  been there done that. I already knew people have stereotypical views of gay men and young women. I already knew that kids with disabilities are mocked.What else is there then? Smoke mirrors and some really nice views of leaves. Oh and the nastiest deus ex machina I've seen in a while.".

In carries on interrupted by short interviewstyled bits of the kids who live on their marry lives with each bit rather distressing in its plain stupidity on the basis of each worthless monologue. Thalluri means to introduce the characters this way to give a kind of fastasjunkfood insight look into their hearts ... and fails once again. Not five minutes later Thalluri ultimately screams at the audience Yes people! I stole this movie and for some curious reason I am proud of it! by taking Gus Van Sants most unmistakable narrative style from Elephant He shot scenes twice to let the viewer follow each character involved in a scene on his particular way and role in a school situation. Hm doesn't this seem awfully familiar? To me this certain level of very forgiving tolerance had been infringed right there to a point at which I couldn't stand this dreadful movie any more. Shame on you Murali K. Thalluri I say! I am especially surprised that 237 has reached the official selections in Cannes as of 2006 whereas everyone must have certainly remembered Elephant 2003 at the very same Film Festival just a few years ago! So how in the name of the lord did this most disgraceful ripoff end up being shown there? I find myself absolutely puzzled by this mistake.Directors like Thalluri use the ignorance of audiences who aren't and cannot completely be aware of every independent film out there. As Elephant has little to do with mainstream cinema although it is without a doubt a masterpiece few people notice that the story as told in 237 had been told before! How that is possible at a Film Festival of such importance as attributed to Cannes I cannot say. It is sad and shameful that such things are passed on and hardly anyone sees the true fraud in it.237 is by all means solely commercial worthless as an independent film and on a certain level rather a phoney parody of its obvious idol Elephant.".

However what I take exception to is the infantile grubby and sensationalist approach that the makers of 237 took.A prime example is how it raises so many issues and yet fails in any significant way to comment or reach a resolution on even one of them.My other major problem with this film apart from its complete plagiarism of Gus Van Sant's Elephant surprised Van Sant didn't sue is its 'bull loose in a china shop' attitude to quite delicate issues such as incest and particularly suicide.In short avoid this film like the plague and anything that this filmmaker ever is involved with subsequently. I've heard that his motivation for making 237 may or may not be based on lies. Having seen the substandard result this doesn't surprise me in the slightest. This is a glorified student film exercise that has no place whatsoever being in a cinema or on DVD. Pure and simple.".

	schema:headline " Exploitative but with one saving grace";
	schema:reviewBody "I couldn't relate to this film. I'm surprised that people are lauding it for being so 'realistic'. How many people at your school were victim to incest? How many closet homosexual jocks were there? How many quiet people that you never noticed committed suicide? Hmmm. OK you wouldn't know even if their were. But really these are explosive problems which many us never deal with. And yet there are so many teenagers with subtle problems which could have been explored. But hey where's the 'entertainment' in that?With regards to the girl who committed suicide  I found this to be exploitative. I actually think MANY people in High School at some stage feel invisible ignored and unwanted. But what possesses someone to violently commit suicide on just another day of being ignored and unnoticed? The filmmaker decided this girl would suicide to make the film more provocative. And the graphic nature of the suicide to make it even more provocative. I didn't buy it as a real life scenario.And the problems of the other students I didn't fully relate to. Bullying is explored but that's been done to death we all know it goes on and it truly is a matter of resolve within that person. Closet homosexuality? Pfft another clich gets rolled out. Thats the thing really too many clichs. I guessed the ending at the start. There was a predictable unpredictability if that makes sense. You've got all these characters with explosive problems and one with apparently none. And I thought what is the point of this character unless she's the unsuspecting suicide victim? And surely enough..One thing I will say and it is the saving grace of the film is that it does NOT glamourise suicide. The suicide is very graphic and heartbreaking to watch. It is a powerful scene regardless of how contrived it isand one that dismisses suicide as the easy option. But the film is really not very imaginative and used stereotypes.Not bad but certainly not groundbreaking OR worthy of a 17minute standing ovation at Cannes???".

The various characters each have a problem and the film shows how bad each problem is for them but only as a way to get them each to a place where you think they might kill themselves. Despite the different points of view offered by the camera on the key events there is NEVER another way of seeing the events themselves. So in 237 the arseholes are arseholes the angels are angels. This is simple stuff.Without this complexity the film emerges as a voyeuristic tale of youth sex and violence. You hardly get to know the kids as much as the breasts bodies and limps that the filmmaker passes off as characterisation.In the end if you know ANYTHING about film in the last 5 years 237 is just an immature rip off of Elephant  not a meditation not a progression. Yet while the filmmaker and distributor use the alleged suicide of a friend at every chance to give the film some legitimacy they never talk about Gus Van Sant or Elephant. The positive posts on IMDb curiously avoid any mention of this or simply don't value originality. If you do want something with heart and voice  avoid this piece of youth exploitation. I was surprised by the filmmakers age when I found out after seeing this film  I had assumed a 13 year old had made it. The Twenty Somethings I've always known are too busy trying to express something real in them to lift the work of an old man.".

We need others and we need them desperately. Thalluri's film deals with the intensity of high school and the need of the other presenting a handful of characters that coexist in the same place. We cannot say they are friends they barely know each other each of them carries a burden so heavy that they become estranged alone and that's when the fear of losing one's own humanity is ignited.We have the case of Marcus and Melody brother and sister. They come from a wealthy family well structured around male hegemony. Their father is very much alike the primordial father from a tribe that Fred describes in Totem and Taboo. This primordial father can have carnal knowledge with his offspring because in these mythical prehistoric time no such thing as incest exists however the jealous sons will savagely kill the father this powerful alpha male a figure that bears some resemblance with Lacan's inverted E which symbolized the one man not castrated. By killing the totemfather only taboo remains and thus incest becomes the ultimate sin. When Marcus witnesses his father having sex he attributes this attitude as a total disregard for moral codes after all Marcus seems to imply that his father acts in such a way that he has no choice but to witness the coitus. This traumatic event triggers something deep inside his consciousness and as a result the incest fantasy and the rape fantasy will become firmly inserted in his psyche.The first scene with Luke the high school jock is most revealing as we see him in his bedroom in front of his computer stroking his penis most vigorously. What images appear in the computer screen? Luke is struggling with his own sexuality he is in a place that Lacan would denominate 'minus phi' which is the inscription of a point of fracture in the imaginary that indicates a certain fissure that affects the constitution of the libidinal object in which one's own image finds support.Uneven Steven is a kid that suffers of genetic malformations not only does he have one leg longer than the other but he also has a condition that makes him lose control of his sphincters and as a result he wets himself in class becoming the target for everyone's cruel jokes.Then there is Sean a boy that openly assumes his homosexuality and pays the price for it being constantly mocked by Luke's friends and other guys in school. The only way for him to cope with this is escaping into a world of stupor produced by his marijuana consumption.Finally there are two girls that play a very relevant role in this film that owes much to Gus Van Sant's listed in the credits realistic and insightful approach of adolescence Sarah Luke's girlfriend makes the mistake of caring too much for her boyfriend and consequently once she begins to have doubts about her future with him everything falls apart. Kelly on the other hand is perhaps the nicest person in school. She seems to genuinely try to help everyone she is kind with boys and girls instead of creating problems she tries to find a solution for them. When everyone attacks Steven she makes sure he's going to be OK.However all of them suffer from teenage angst. But this is not the typical clich angst. Lacanian psychoanalysts might ask why despite all the amount of scientific knowledge that has been accumulated and the efforts to establish theories that presuppose to grant us reassurance Levis Straus structuralism and Hegel historicism that aims towards the acquisition of the Absolute Knowledge in other words a conceptualization that implies a theory without remainders we still experience restlessness? Lacan asked himself why is it that we so much want to preserve the dimension of anxiety?. Anxiety is a horrible thing and yet is there a human need to preserve it? In this regard Kierkegaard may be closer to the question of angst when he speaks about the psychological ambiguity concerning this concept Anxiety is a sympathetic antipathy and an antipathetic sympathy. Arguably the existence of angst points out to something that cannot be reduced to a rational category and without which a truly reflection on the question of ethics is useless. We find this sympathetic antipathy in characters like Marcus who has a strong relationship with his sister and at the same time despises her. The antipathetic sympathy is present in Kelly the sweetest girl that treats everyone kindly but that secretly feels alienated incapable of anything but antipathy for herself.However they are all connected and what they do will affect the lives of the others. What happens then when during the first minutes of the film someone commits suicide? Life is a tricky business that's for sure. But life as teenagers can be even trickier.".

	schema:headline " I guess we all have to start somewhere.....";
	schema:reviewBody "This movie made me think....of how I could write something about it without personally dissing the director and all the actors who as an Australian I am proud of for actually getting out there and making a film.But the movie itself? Let me tell you a story....Found this DVD in my local rental shop yesterday and had vague recollections of the reviews at the time of cinema release here so I thought I would give it a go.For some reason I decided to watch the 'special features' before I watched the actual movie not something that I usually do. Turned the 'making of' off halfway through as I'd had enough cringing at the 'aren't we so wonderful for putting together such a hard hitting film with such a raw script' attitude.The movie? Ugh. Full of clichs and pathetic character development. The actors? Well done guys you are Aussies and I applaud you. And just like a footy team is only as good as the coach that directs them you unfortunately did NOT have a great script to work with.I felt that the movie actually trivialised so many of the subjects that it seemed to want to cover. I have seen many reviews here that refer to it as nothing more than a soap. Agreed.Finally and forgive me if I don't phrase this correctly I was extremely disappointed that there were no optimistic overtones at all. Yes we all know that life is full of hard stuff and yes we know that things such as incest DO occur but I really find it hard to applaud a movie that has not one piece of joy in it. I believe that a director has a responsibility to put it in there SOMEWHERE. Otherwise the movie is all about THEM and THEIR feelings they have created it for themselves not for an audience.Which I think is the basis of why this movie isn't so great. The special features mention that the director wrote the screenplay in a 36 hour sitting the day after he himself tried to end his own life. Well it may have been cathartic for him to do this however the movie reeks of selfindulgence when you know the story behind why it was written. I feel horrid I'm going to write a movie about feeling horrid. Note I have read the interview with Andrew Urban and understand WHY Thalluri needed to write something to help him through his own issues but I believe there is a line in film that cannot be crossed  the line of making a movie purely for your own emotional needs and I feel that this is what has unintentionally happened hereBy his own admission the director had no technical experience at all and sadly this makes the movie come off looking like nothing more than a year twelve media project.As for any recommendations that this movie should be studied at school or that all teenagers should watch it  not sure there either. Because there is a VERY dangerous line at the end. I too have been in a place where I have thought that someone who no longer has to 'face life' is 'lucky' but as an adult I do worry that this line could be influential on a young viewer that was in a vulnerable frame of mind. Might be in there to promote discussion but again it reflects no possibility of redemption or joy in this story as a whole. In fact it almost indicates that there is more sadness to come.I haven't seen Elephant but I just might go find it given all the comparisons here.Nothing personal here guys I do hope you can make another movie someday and we all have to start out somewhere so forgive me if I've been too harsh. I am glad that you are proud of what you created which in the end is what life is all about. It's not a movie I would recommend though.Oh I DID like the way the timeframes often collided thought that was an interesting way to film.

	onyx:emotionText "This movie made me think....of how I could write something about it without personally dissing the director and all the actors who as an Australian I am proud of for actually getting out there and making a film.But the movie itself? Let me tell you a story....Found this DVD in my local rental shop yesterday and had vague recollections of the reviews at the time of cinema release here so I thought I would give it a go.For some reason I decided to watch the 'special features' before I watched the actual movie not something that I usually do. Turned the 'making of' off halfway through as I'd had enough cringing at the 'aren't we so wonderful for putting together such a hard hitting film with such a raw script' attitude.The movie? Ugh. Full of clichs and pathetic character development. The actors? Well done guys you are Aussies and I applaud you. And just like a footy team is only as good as the coach that directs them you unfortunately did NOT have a great script to work with.I felt that the movie actually trivialised so many of the subjects that it seemed to want to cover. I have seen many reviews here that refer to it as nothing more than a soap. Agreed.Finally and forgive me if I don't phrase this correctly I was extremely disappointed that there were no optimistic overtones at all. Yes we all know that life is full of hard stuff and yes we know that things such as incest DO occur but I really find it hard to applaud a movie that has not one piece of joy in it. I believe that a director has a responsibility to put it in there SOMEWHERE. Otherwise the movie is all about THEM and THEIR feelings they have created it for themselves not for an audience.Which I think is the basis of why this movie isn't so great. The special features mention that the director wrote the screenplay in a 36 hour sitting the day after he himself tried to end his own life. Well it may have been cathartic for him to do this however the movie reeks of selfindulgence when you know the story behind why it was written. I feel horrid I'm going to write a movie about feeling horrid. Note I have read the interview with Andrew Urban and understand WHY Thalluri needed to write something to help him through his own issues but I believe there is a line in film that cannot be crossed  the line of making a movie purely for your own emotional needs and I feel that this is what has unintentionally happened hereBy his own admission the director had no technical experience at all and sadly this makes the movie come off looking like nothing more than a year twelve media project.As for any recommendations that this movie should be studied at school or that all teenagers should watch it  not sure there either. Because there is a VERY dangerous line at the end. I too have been in a place where I have thought that someone who no longer has to 'face life' is 'lucky' but as an adult I do worry that this line could be influential on a young viewer that was in a vulnerable frame of mind. Might be in there to promote discussion but again it reflects no possibility of redemption or joy in this story as a whole. In fact it almost indicates that there is more sadness to come.I haven't seen Elephant but I just might go find it given all the comparisons here.Nothing personal here guys I do hope you can make another movie someday and we all have to start out somewhere so forgive me if I've been too harsh. I am glad that you are proud of what you created which in the end is what life is all about. It's not a movie I would recommend though.Oh I DID like the way the timeframes often collided thought that was an interesting way to film. But the whole Its the quiet ones you have to watch  we already know that.";

This scene is left unresolved as we revert to the beginning of the day and are introduced to the teenagers getting ready to go to school. The audience becomes intimate with each of the main characters and explores the daytoday issues facing teenagers  including drugs promiscuity being gay bullying and violence. Each scene is played again and again from different teens' perspectives and is reminiscent of Gus Van Sant's Elephant. This is a remarkable film by firsttime director Murali K. Thalluri. It was made with nonprofessional student actors and workshopped through an unprecedented 76 drafts of a script. It features stunning performances by a number of the student actors particularly Teresa Palmer in the role of Melody. This comingofage film is both intimate and thoughtprovoking with a surprising and disturbing ending.".

	schema:reviewBody "Honestly Mr. Thalluri.... if you do a drama movie in a highschool setting following a bunch of teenagers through a school day and if you mess up the timeframe and jump back and forth... if you do that you can't use the exact same visual story telling device of Elephant which is using a camera that is passing of from one character to the next and having scenes shown 3 times from different angles. You just can't do that because this is such a blunt rip off its hard to believe anyone gave this more than a 5 rating.Where Elephant which was released 3 years prior to this movie uses school shootings or to be exact the Columbine shooting as the focal point for its script 237 uses teen suicide and seeing the reviews the shock value of that subject worked. Its the same slow story telling a lot of dramatic piano music all leading to a finale you know from the beginning. At least the characters look like they tried hard to be somewhat different in that department. So you got a untypical gay guy who looks acts like a stonerskater a hunky loverboy who can't deal with his gay side brother and sister from a rich family who both got their very own problems and here comes the nose dive. You also get a spoiled bulimic chick and one of the most ridiculous characters ever... a guy with medical conditions who wets his pants because of 2 urethra syndrome who actually never heard of the invention of diapers but rather pisses his pants in the classroom and then change into new clothes and does so EVERY DAY! WOW as hard as this movie tries to be realistic this is the most absurd thing I have ever heard. He gets beaten up on the toilet and is obviously ashamed of it but doesn't wipe the blood of his nose when going through the whole school with wet pants and a bleeding nose. Thats newage realism directly leading to the twist and final character who turns out to be the suicide victim...After watching the very realistic life of teenagers one day including incestrape teen pregnancy bulimia parental pressure for grades and appearance and the gay subject mentioned before kind of like your very realistic daily soap... trying hard to be we watch a girl die we met once in the beginning of this movie and who has no reason but that the guy she had a crush on left the room when she was talking to him in a thoughtful piano playing sequence BTW seen that somewhere before??. And it gets even better... before slitting her wrist in a painful long scene of Yes and No she asks 2urethraguy if he is OK constantly smiling and then she cuts her wrist with scissors in a school toilet. Now you got a movie that is a total ripoff of Elephant fails with some really sloppy story telling the whole rapeincest thing was pretty unbelievable too by the way and people call this a shocker.What the heck is going on?? Is all it takes to take some pseudodramatic music boring story telling and adding a shock subject on top and people think there is a major deep message here?? I think Elephant is way overrated already but that movie was the original while this here is an obvious ripoff failing on many more levels. I have never ever seen a more brazen stealing of a whole movie concept in my life... and believe me I watched a hundred of horror movies so I know how low you can go there. This is a total let down in all departments... its nor realistic its stolen its damn slow and by all means I wonder whats more useless... another romantic suicide many give this point to the movie which makes me wonder if they only watch RomeoJuliet all day long because there is dozens of movies which deal with the subject in a clear nonromantic and MORE REALISTIC way or this ridiculous set up... Come on! I am still trying to work out if 2urethraguy or the suicide itself is more unrealistic and ridiculous.".

The hard part about this scene is the complete intrusion and discomfort we have as an audience watching someones life end in a gruesome fashion.

Not the kind of money you should be owing when your wife is the kind of person who spends over a 1000 on one shopping trip.Even when he tries to sell it it brings him misfortune as selling so much as a cigarette or a pair of stockings to the natives is punishable by court martial so you can imagine that a 17500 transaction practically has the firing squad polishing their rifles.His potential purchaser is also causing him problems as he is a disgustingly handsome Bullfighting Spanish nobleman who's interest in the car has lead to a stronger interest in Ford's wife made worse by the fact that a rich jetset lifestyle is being offered and is what she has sought for so long.With Ford's sexual frustration rising and jealousy in his love rival mounting coupled with Reynolds' materialistic attitude and flirtatious behaviour around the enamoured Spaniard serving to drive the wedge deeper between the two it seems that their whirlwind relationship is destined to end.But can whatever love and attraction that threw these two love birds together in the first place shine through and keep them together?Not the best example of this genre of film but due to the watchable performances by it's principles and the enjoyable plot line it is certainly a fine one.".

	schema:reviewBody "It Started With a Kiss is a movie that has several funny story elements but the overall picture never quite works. Much of it is because the characters particularly Debbie Reynolds' don't make much sense and were poorly written.When the film begins an Air Force sergeant tries repeatedly to pick up a model working at a charity event. Joe Glenn Ford is boorishly persistent...something considered acceptable in films back in the day though with changing attitudes he'd DEFINITELY fall into the category of a sexual harasser today! Maggie Debbie Reynolds isn't impressed and repeated tells him to get lost. In a last ditch effort to get her he kisses her...and apparently is such a stud that she falls for him and they immediately marry. Does this make sense? No.Two days later Joe is flown to duty in Spain and she is to follow a month later. During this time period she learns that Joe's lone raffle ticket from the charity event was THE winner...and he's the new owner of the Ford Futuraa oneofakind concept car. She writes Joe that she has a huge surprise for him. He oddly assumes that means she's pregnant...but considering they only were apart a couple weeks at this point you can only assume Joe is a total moron and knows nothing about sex education. Even if she WAS pregnant which she wasn't she wouldn't have known for sure for at least a couple months. Does this make sense? Nah.While in Spain the Air Force personnel are told to not be ostentatious about money and be conservative...and then Maggie shows up with the spectacular car! However when Joe's commanding officer tries talking with her she repeatedly treats him like crap...and with open contempt. So your husband is a sergeant and your wife is mouthy with the Major. Does this make sense? Nope.After Maggie arrives she has the bright idea that because they really didn't know each other AND because they have little in common other than sexual attraction. Because of this she insists that they sleep apart. Does this make sense? Not much...and there are a lot of scenes showing a VERY frustrated Joe!Soon the couple learns that they are in serious trouble with the Internal Revenue Service. Why? Because they won a 40000 car probably worth about 200000300000 in today's money...and they owe 17000 in taxes on the car...on a sergeant's salary!! They never even thought of this!! Does this couple seem like they have a brain between them? Nah...especially when Maggie doesn't seem to understand that they cannot keep it!Later the General is upset and understandably so because not only has the Sergeant been showing off by driving around with the car but he sells it to a bullfighter for 17000. So Joe just eats the 23000 difference...and the bullfighter was 'willing to pay ANYTHING to get the car'! And now he's in trouble with the General. So what dumb thing do they do? Maggie begins yelling at the General and threatening him!The film goes on and on like this...with two really incredibly stupid people doing incredibly stupid things. This makes it difficult if not impossible for the audience to care about these dodos...especially Maggie. The bottom line is that the film has amusing moments but the overall picture just doesn't make sense or work well. All you know is that Joe and Maggie are stupid...but have great sexual chemistry together. All in all a very disappointing film with little to recommend it other than the car!This bright red Futura went on to become very famous. Hollywood paid to have it completely restyled and repainted and it became the Batmobile on the Batman TV show! I am sure today it's worth considerably more than 40000. In fact it recently was sold for 4.62 million!!!".

Does this make sense? Nope.After Maggie arrives she has the bright idea that because they really didn't know each other AND because they have little in common other than sexual attraction. Because of this she insists that they sleep apart. Does this make sense? Not much...and there are a lot of scenes showing a VERY frustrated Joe!Soon the couple learns that they are in serious trouble with the Internal Revenue Service. Why? Because they won a 40000 car probably worth about 200000300000 in today's money...and they owe 17000 in taxes on the car...on a sergeant's salary!! They never even thought of this!! Does this couple seem like they have a brain between them? Nah...especially when Maggie doesn't seem to understand that they cannot keep it!Later the General is upset and understandably so because not only has the Sergeant been showing off by driving around with the car but he sells it to a bullfighter for 17000. So Joe just eats the 23000 difference...and the bullfighter was 'willing to pay ANYTHING to get the car'! And now he's in trouble with the General. So what dumb thing do they do? Maggie begins yelling at the General and threatening him!The film goes on and on like this...with two really incredibly stupid people doing incredibly stupid things. This makes it difficult if not impossible for the audience to care about these dodos...especially Maggie. The bottom line is that the film has amusing moments but the overall picture just doesn't make sense or work well. All you know is that Joe and Maggie are stupid...but have great sexual chemistry together. All in all a very disappointing film with little to recommend it other than the car!This bright red Futura went on to become very famous. Hollywood paid to have it completely restyled and repainted and it became the Batmobile on the Batman TV show! I am sure today it's worth considerably more than 40000. In fact it recently was sold for 4.62 million!!!";

They escape and won't have to work for the rest of their lives. But there is one problem they didn't take into account Someone within their own ranks doesn't like to split the loot but wants to keep it all for himself even when that means he will have to kill the rest of the crew. But all but one survive and they are out for revenge. One year later in Los Angeles this time the surviving team members create a smart and devious plan to steal back the gold and get their revenge on the traitor...The story on itself is of course not very original since this is a remake of the original 1969 movie but it has plenty of goodies to offer to make you forget about that. This is a typical heist  action movie but it certainly is one of the better ones in its kind. The action is very nice the landscapes and Venice are real eyecandy the story is OK and the special effects are stunning. Even the acting is very good something which you'll not often see in an action movie. I must admit that I really liked what I saw and I give this movie a well deserved 7.510.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Italian Job is a real blast to watch. It's a genuinely entertaining film something you watch just for the sheer enjoyment of it. It's not heavy with drama or emotional handwringing it has no cosmic statements about life and it's not violent or profane. It's just a fun movie. Between watching the little Mini Coopers fly around the crowded streets of L.A. and the great bits by stereotypical computer geekturnedcrook played gleefully by Seth Greene I had a lot of fun watching this film.Special kudos to the background music. They truly set a masterful tone for such a movie so subtle yet keeps you on the edge when needed. Apparently a lot of artists contributed to the music I found it to be the classiest part of the film.8 out of 10. Not aweinspiring but a great film to watch at the end of a lousy day at the office.Barky".

	schema:headline " Slick amusing caper film Gray's best movie featuring Davis' best soundtrack";
	schema:reviewBody "My reaction to this remake of The Italian Job is probably hopelessly mixed up with the events occurring in my life when I saw it This is the first movie I saw after I had just landed a job after 8 months of unemployment and going back to school for retraining. Money was still tight but I no longer had to choose between seeing a movie in the theaters and paying bills or eating lunch and the sense of relief and gratitude I was feeling at the time was enormous. In consequence my enjoyment of Italian Job was probably far out of proportion to its actual worth. Still I picked it up used on DVD a few weeks ago and watched it again and I still enjoyed it immensely. I have never seen the original though I have heard it is an absolute classic but its modern day counterpart is eminently watchable if you have a taste for modern day production values applied to older films plots and themes. What initially won me over to this movie was the soundtrack  IMO Don Davis writes some of the most supple textured and aurally pleasing soundtracks around. IJ opens with a sly witty pulsing arrangement that combines strings guitar harmonics brush work and quiet moments  it won me over completely from the opening seconds. And the whole movie is like this  I haven't heard this kind of ringing chiming pulsing soundtrack music since Stewart Copeland left the Police and started doing soundtracks for movies like Rumble Fish. There are at least a dozen irresistibly scored motifs in here along with some pop song remakes that range from all right to inspired. For people to whom the soundtrack is important this movie is a delight. On to the movie I can take or leave Mark Wahlberg but he's okay here as the leading man and the movie doesn't ask him to do anything he can't do well. He's the weakest major actor in the film but that's because the rest of supporting cast is so strong especially Donald Sutherland in a bit part. Mos Def Jason Steadham Ed Norton Seth Green and Charlize Theron all turn in solid fatfree performances. Norton seems to mostly be phoning it in rumor has it that he didn't really want to be in the film but he's still a natural even at 12 power. My one quibble with the casting and acting is with the character Wrench who seems to be a male model pretending to be an actor. His part seems to be shoehorned into the movie and he has little chemistry with the rest of the cast although you can blame some of that on the size of the part and the late walk on nature of the character. If I were a cynical sortI would wonder who the actor slept with to get put into this movie in such a supernumerary role? Nah never happen...Production values camera work stunts plot...everything cooks along quite nicely and Gray and his production crew pull things together pretty seamlessly with the exception of the Wrench character see above. The dialog has a nice light touch that rewards your indulgence and there are several satisfying major and minor plot payoffs along the way. My favorite moment  when Norton's character tells Wahlberg's character that he's just lost the element of surprise. Wahlberg proceeds to cold cock Norton with a right cross and then asks him Were you surprised?? Hmmm maybe you had to be there... Of course the movie requires a certain level of suspension of disbelief to work but if you just relax and go along with it and don't think too hard about the mechanics of cracking a safe underwater or the likelihood of anyone being able to successfully hack and manipulate LA traffic via a laptop etc you'll have a fun ride. The Italian Job it's lightweight summer fluff but it's very good for what it is and it doesn't try to be anything else. It isn't good enough for an 8 but I'd give it a 7.5.".

I like the mini coopers. The expert thieves used mini coopers for the getaway cars. The chase between the mini coopers and the motorbikes is amazing. They chased underground. I can say there was not a moment I was bored. Mark Wahlberg Charlie Croker Charlize Theron Stella Bridger Donald Sutherland John Bridger Jason Statham Handsome Rob Seth Green Lyle Mos Def Left Ear and Edwin Norton Steve really did a good job. I like the actors in this film. I have seen a lot of heist movie but The Italian Job is one of my favourites. A great Hollywood action movie without a drop of blood.

Look people it's just a fun movie. This is the type of picture where you're supposed to sit back relax and just enjoy the steadymoving pace of the film. Like Ocean's Eleven 2001 you can concentrate on the characters and the plot at the same time without having to do much thinking lucky for some of us. Granted Ocean is a better movie but who cares? The plot may have some holes there's a huge one about 34 of the way through the action may not be as gratifyingly gratuitous as the trailers made it out to be and some of the dialog may seem pointless and cheesy but again who really cares? Cool characters Mini Coopers big explosions Charlize Theron. What more do you want? I think it's time to drop the fake Roger Ebert meets Gene Shalit act and enjoy yourself for once! Oh and another thing whatever you do don't compare it to the original because to reiterate what F. Gary Gray has told the press a million times THIS IS NOT A REMAKE!! My advice if you're interested in nitpicking your way through a goodhumored fun flick don't even bother seeing The Italian Job. But if you don't have a severe inferiority complex andor want to see Ed Norton get jacked by a bunch of Ukranians go ahead. The Bottom Line my fellow moviegoers is Lighten Up and Have Fun Dammit.".

This is especially true since they appeared in the trailers for the film so I already knew what to look for.For me a caper film works only if it has an element of realism  that maybe just maybe it could be pulled off without relying on a deux ex machina or just because moments. Parts of The Italian Job just throws that out the window with computers doing things that computers can't do the good guys not hitting anyone with their driving especially going down the stairs and not one single police car responding to street explosions recklessly driven minis or even a low flying helicopter. Must be a heck of a city for these things not to rate a response.The acting is passable with the crew Seth Green Jason Stratham and Mos Def being at least fun to watch. Mark Wahlberg is just too smarmy as the nice guy hero while Charlize Theron is about the only actor called on to display some kind of range. Donald Sutherland is a class act as always and shows up Wahlberg's deficiencies every moment they are together.Overall this is a pretty uninteresting film. Given the IMDb ratings it's the girls that really love this film which I can understand to some extent but there are such better caper films out there  even the vapidness of the recent Ocean's Eleven outshines the nonevent that is The Italian Job.SPOILERAt the conclusion take a moment to think about what is going to happen to Norton's character. Are we meant to be cheering the good guys for causing his demise especially since it would appear to be long and painful? He didn't deserve that simpering creep that he was.END SPOILER".

Everything that made the original Italian Job entertaining has been bled out of this festering sore of a movie scripted by Donna and Wayne Powers and listlessly directed by F Gary Gray. I am amazed that Troy Kennedy Martin the screenwriter of the original film allowed his name to be used in the credits for this pig's ear. Martin has worked on some of the finest film and TV projects of the last 40odd years. Even being vaguely associated with this stinker is NOT A GOOD THING.The humour is forced the drama is laboured all the characters are cookiecutter likable crims with the exception of Charlize Theron's implausible beautiful safe crackerrally driverand the plot only matches the original on the following points1 Three Minis the modern BMWmade versions but Minis nonetheless2 Use of the names Croker and Bridger for 2 of the main characters3 Disrupting a city's traffic control system to provide a safe route through it.4 Er that's it.Otherwise what you get is a bland and implausible American bythenumbers heist movie in which a gang of jolly pirate chums eventually get the better of their evil associate. Believe me it feels like an awful long time before they do. The cast do their best with what they're given but it seems that they all accepted it as a turdpolishing exercise after reading the script. None of the original film's quirky nature and distinctly British flavour has survived being fed into the Hollywood hamburger machine. Do yourself a favour and watch the original 1969 movie instead of this sucking chest wound. It's a wonder that Noel Coward hasn't done an Aunt Nelly jumped out of his grave and kicked the teeth of everyone involved in this tepid remake halfway down their throats.Italian Job?

	schema:reviewBody "I must admit I was against this movie from the outset but I tried my hardest to be impartial I really did but the very idea of remaking a sophisticated witty entertaining quirky British classic full of character has to be dubious from the outset.People in my house were watching this so I swallowed my pride and told myself to be professional about films I have studied them at Uni after all.As expected for an American film of this sort the movie began with a chase which wasn't bad. Indeed many of the action sequences are credible and this alone lifts the mark.Yet the characterisation was abysmal the setpieces could very easily have been spliced from any American schlock blockbuster you might have had the misfortune to watch and it lacked all character.Seeming to take a skewed angle on the original film with a failed initial robbery the US version does the predictable thing and introduces an emotional factor with the death of Donald Sutherland's character. This allows our US cousins plenty of opportunity for sycophantic dewyeyed vengeanceseeking against the 'evildoers' which it milks to predictable excesses. This is never more so evident as in the scenes featuring Charlize Theron oh pretty! oh so pretty! Look at her pretty wounded Bambi eyes everyone! which were thoroughly nauseating. Her entrance scene particularly was like something out of Resident Evil or Tomb Raider which were both a more entertaining and b had better beginnings because they couldn't mess up a game like they could with British cinema which was already chockfull of spark people you genuinely feel something for and moments of inspiration. But I digress the whole inclusion of a pretty girl for the sake of it just seems like the most hamfisted manoeuvre I've seen in some time and exposes cynical Hollywood blockbusterlust for what it is.If you like any of these actors by the way and you agree with any of the above comments DO NOT GO TO SEE THIS FILM! If I had the opportunity of watching 'Fight Club' or 'American History X' after seeing Ed Norton in this I would have declined. Likewise Jason Statham with 'Lock Stock' and I suppose 'The Transporter' is okay if you like that sort of thing.Sadly all the setpieces are designed in the most transparent possible way to get you thinking 'Wow! He's smart!' 'Coo! He's cool!' 'Hey! What a tough guy!'. Then there's the 'funny PC guy' who has 'comic relief' splattered across his forehead but whose humour content can be anticipated two minutes in advance. To be honest if you've seen one or two films like it you might easily confuse the two as clones from the Jerry Bruckheimer stable. Not that Jerry is irredeemably awful by the way but he just uses the clichs to excess as everyone knows or should.This is where I have to come clean. I didn't manage to make it to the end so I couldn't even say whether the brilliant ending in the Michael Caine version made it but I'm sorry it's just one of those extremely rare films that if I'd seen it at a cinema I would have walked out and staged a small protest outside. It's not just that it is another identical bythenumbers Ocean's 14 or something Ocean's Eleven was fine but don't bother with the rest! with all the glitz glamour fake sass and pantomime heroics of such a film but I couldn't recognise anything from the original at all.So if you are expecting 'THE Italian JOB' and not 'OCEAN'S 14' albeit badly written with a less established cast and characters some disingenuous elements and cardboard cutout scriptwriting then DO NOT WATCH! I don't mind people liking a bit of mindless fun but this is a criminal hatchetjob that does not deserve in any way to parade itself under the title of a classic. Seriously show some pride! I felt thoroughly justified in my outraged and sickened reaction when I first heard that the film would be made. Avoid at all costs!P.S. Some of the action sequences aren't bad at all so add an extra '1' to the mark if you like this sort of thing.".

What he does I can't say but it's the equivalent of directing a mouse in a maze.This version of The Italian Job can safely stand on its own merits as entertaining and thrilling. Even without me seeing the first one as of yet.";

This one is very loosely based on the film of the same name in the 1960's starring Michael Caine and Noel Coward with Benny Hill as the comedy relief. That film was a soso farce but this one is a runaway hit. The action starts at the beginning and keeps the pace throughout the film. Mos Def and Seth Green are our comics in this film but their abilities to shift from comic to dramatic are well played. Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron are well suited to their roles and come off with a very reserved but appropriate sexual tension to add interest to the already interesting hitech portions of the film. Sutherland's role while brief is the perfect set up for the remainder of the film. Statham does what he does best and his character is a mix between The Transporter and The Mechanic with a splash of smooth to balance it out. As always whether good guy or bad guy Ed Norton's presence is perfect to create the correct tension in the movie. Good plot great scenery and exceptional photography make this a film the entire family can enjoy together despite the PG13 rating. Collectible if you like action adventure although you will probably pull it out as an afterthought.".

The director who has done nothing noteworthy since Friday clearly didn't care if there was any chemistry on screen or if the words coming out of the actor's mouths actually fit their characters.  He just wanted all the words in there.  At one point a Ukrainian does a whole routine about how the CIA rigged the 2000 election  why even keep that in there?most of the characters have cute nicknames which just makes the whole script seem even more forced.  in the first 20 minutes you are hit over the head repeatedly about the relationship between Marky Mark and Donald Sutherland so that you know he'll be dead before the second act. obviously there is a romantic relationship that suddenly blossom's between Sutherland's daughter Theron and Marky Mark.  Like you couldn't see that coming before you even walked into the theater.Speaking of which Theron clearly filled in for Angelina Jolie playing exactly the same role that Jolie played in Gone in 60 seconds.  there are several points in the movie where she is vulnerable maybe trying to show more range than Jolie? and in each of those scenes when Wahlberg comforts her or says you can do it i thought i was going to puke.worst offender of all is Norton who sleepwalks thru one of the least complex characters he has ever played.there are all sorts of continuity problems with the movie and several characters are introduced and then grossly underused there's a 400 lb somoan looking dude who may have been an interesting character if we saw him for more than 2 minutes.every plot twist is predictable 30 minutes ahead of time every funny part is given away in the trailers except some of seth green's screen time and everyone is dragged down by the poor script and direction.

	schema:headline " The best retelling of the Robin Hood legend  ever!";
	schema:reviewBody "This retelling weaves myth and magic with the Robin Hood legend and indeed Robin becomes associated with the forest god Herne the Hunter reinforcing the idea that Robin is a medieval incarnation of The Green Man the 'foliate head' of the old religion which is often found carved on many churches.The scripts were were well written the plotting well thought out and the characters  and ensemble cast  excellent. In particular congratulations to Mark Ryan  who became Nasir the Saracen. Due to be killed off at the end of the the first episode he was so good that he remained as a permanent cast member.Ultimately though the series' immediate appeal was due to the amazing onscreen chemistry between its two leads Michael Praed and the beautiful Judi Trott as the first Robin and his Marion. Praed's youthful dark good looks had an almost 'fey' quality which made the magical element entirely believable. And by 'fey' I don't mean to imply any loss of masculinity. The first two seasons  with Praed  were by far the best.In the third season Jason Connery had a hell of a task following an actor so perfect for the Robin role but he did reasonably well and the strong ensemble cast carried the change of lead well. Richard Carpeneter's wise decision to make the new 'Robin Hood' a completely different character with a completely different background was a very wise move.I suppose any review should mention the immense debt Costner's Robin Hood Prince of Thieves owes to Robin of Sherwood. Some might say that 'debt' was putting it mildly! Costner not only retained the Saracen who until Nasir had never been a Robin Hood character at all but he filmed in many of the same locations used the same horsemaster Stevie Dent and clung to the magical elements  though being a good old American boy stuck to the idea of Christianity good  old religion bad whereas Robin of Sherwood often showed the political corruption of the Church historically accurateand the simple spirituality of the old religion unrelated to 'black' magic. Alan Rickman's OTT sheriff was a wilder version of Nickolas Grace's sly characterisation.What more can I say? If you've never seen Robin of Sherwood rush out and buy the complete thing on DVD  I guarantee you'll watch it again and again for the lovely filmic quality of the camera work the leisurely but never dull pacing which invests in the attention span and intelligence of its audience the acting the ideas the very real emotional kick and much praised the delightful music by Clannad.And did I mention Michael Pread...?".

As well as taking me back to a time in my life when the words mortgage and bills meant anything to me  and when Saturday night primetime entertainment didn't involve reality TV people wanting to be pop stars and hourlong programmes to pick lottery numbers when I could do it myself in ten minutes at the most  there is no other TV show or movie about Robin Hood that even comes close to being on a par with Robin Of Sherwood.Every member of this young cast brings their character to life and the Merry Men are perfectly written and acted. The Sheriff Of Nottingham breaks away from the usual mustachetwirling sceneryeating bad guy and has more in common with a corrupt politician than his previous incarnations.Michael Praed's Robin Of Loxley was certainly a better Robin than Jason Connery's but that isn't to take anything away from Connery. Praed's swansong in The Greatest Enemy is one of the best episodes of any TV show I have seen in such a long time. Richard Carpenter's knowledge of both the legend of Robin Hood and beliefs in England at that time clearly show here  and it goes without saying that if the people behind Prince Of Thieves had this much insight and knowledge of the source material their Rawbin Hood would not have been so dismal. Blatantly stealing elements from RoS and yet ignoring others make this film merely a pale imitation of RoS.Without wanting to sound harsh Connery seems to have been chosen to garner a little publicity for this often underrated show the son of a former incarnation of Robin Hood playing a modernday Robin Hood. Connery handles the part extremely well but isn't the actor Praed was. That said I do prefer the third season episodes and stories to the first two series'. No one would envy having to follow in the footsteps of a role made famous by someone else for two series and there is  as in all the series'  an excellent camaraderie and relationships  between Robin his Merry Men and his Merry Woman. The addition of the old religion trying to continue while the new religion of Christianty tries its hardest to stamp it out. It's ironic that this reminds me of Prince Of Thieves in relation to RoS borrowing a lot of elements from the original and tweaking them a little. Still though the old version prevails over time.Clannad's soundtrack works excellently alongside the programme  and I doubt RoS would have been the success it was without it. If you don't already have Clannad's Legend go out this weekend and treat yourself.All of the stars appear on the DVD boxsets and everybody has good memories and making this show. Now a huge star Ray Winstone seems genuinely pleased to take time out to talk about his experiences and love of the show.Whoever suggested in this discussion that Carpenter should bring all of the Merry Men back together as older wiser outlaws is 100 right. Do it now.Nothing's Forgotten. Nothing Is Ever Forgotten.".

The Sheriff of Nottingham Nicholas Grace and Guy of Gisburne Robert Addie are present as the classic villains but they both go far beyond the usual limited parameters of these roles.The characters are all comfortable and unselfconscious as though they don't realize that they are legends.  To me this is their most appealing trait of all.The creators of the show also deserve kudos for their brave move in replacing Michael Praed when he opted out after two seasons  instead of recasting another actor in the same role a different Robin Hood was introduced  a man of noble background played by Jason Connery yes the son of that Conneryas opposed to the peasant upbringing of Michael's Robin.  The show thereby manages to address both accounts of Robin Hood's origin.  Many people prefer Jason's Robin.  I personally still gravitate toward Michael.  It is an ongoing debate among fans.Even after all this time the show still has a devoted cult following who gather for yearly conventions with the stars.

Since I grew up watching this by many fires on misty and snow bound nights it is probably my favorite telling of the Robin Hood story.What I liked best about this show growing up and still like best although I do have more appreciation for Judi Trott was the mysticism of the show. All the other tellings told of Robin Hood's rise to heroism and then his ultimate triumph and then that was it and while it was certainly fun this series seemed to have more meat to its bones because of its introducing all those mythical elements. The music was also pretty cool haunting and beautiful.After watching this and Excalibur one misty day I noticed that some of the myths here were similar to Arthurian legend. Herne is to both Robin Hoods Praed Connery what Merlin was to King Arthur. And the two Robins are later given a magic sword Albion which later became the name of our family dog.The show ran for about 4 seasons I think the first two featured Michael Praed as Robin of Loxley and the last two featured his successor Robert of Huntington played by Jason Connery Sean's son Sean also played Robin Hood in case you didn't know in Robin  Marion opposite Audrey Hepburn's Maid Marion. But both Michael and Jason's characters become known as Robin Hood andor the Hooded Man. I was surprised to read in the archives of reviews that many people prefer Jason over Michael since people often get more attached to the first guy maybe it's name recognition. I think they're both capable actors and they both brought something different to the show but while Michael and Jason's Robin Hoods were both likable characters I think I like Michael better as he had that dark brooding intensity about him. This is not to say that Jason while more of a pretty boy did not have his moments the best part of Jason's reign was watching him struggle to prove he was a worthy successor. What I find ironic is that Jason's character RobertRobin 2 has the noble man who rejects his heritage origin that is often attributed to Michael's character Robin of Loxley.The rest of the cast was great too. Judi Trott was a beautiful and believable Marion who had to stand up to have a place for herself in Sherwood. Ray Winstone was an intense and dangerous Will Scarlet. Clive Mantle was a lovable Little John as was Phil Rose as Friar Tuck Peter L. Williams as Much and Mark Ryan as the strong silent type Nasir. Nikolas Grace was a great Sheriff Robert Addie an over the top Gisbon.A great show with great stories and a great cast. To this day I wish they could have gotten Michael Praed or Jason Connery to reprise the Robin Hood role for Robin Hood Prince of Thieves. I'll take them over Kevin Costner any day.".

Indeed more than 20 years after it was originally transmitted it is still watched and watched again and has a huge global fanfollowing something which must indicate that the makers of this series undeniably got something right.The root of the series' brilliance and remarkable appeal has however got to be that it rests on wonderfully written dialogue and timeless characters  all of which are brought to life by marvellous actors. The characters are wonderful in particular because of their complexity. In contrast to many other Robin Hood adaptations and indeed many other film and TVproductions in general the good guys in this series often make mistakes and can be seen to have apparent flaws while the baddies although put forward as evil and ruthless frequently can be understood and even on occasion seem quite sympathetic. This very much makes Robin of Sherwood into a story about multifaceted REAL people  rather than of good and bad people  something which very much adds to its uniqueness and remarkable appeal. Also although very much being an actionpacked series featuring numerous amazing stunts which are remarkable in themselves seeing as this was made long before today's computer animation green screens and so forth. Thus behind every one of those endless guys falling off castle walls horses and catching fire there actually is a real person who at some point DID fall off a castle wall or a horse or catch fire there is always amazing dialogue going on between the different characters in each episode. In the final analysis however it is generally the series' baddies  Nickolas Grace as The Sheriff of Nottingham Robert Addie as Sir Guy of Gisburne and Philip Jackson as The Abbot Hugo de Rainault  who get the very best lines and who more than often steal the show with their arguments full of wit and cant. It's a wedding not a celebration! is just one of their many timeless pearls of wisdom which seems to follow one through life .20 years after the fact it is indeed hard to believe that Robin of Sherwood was originally something made for television  and apparently not with a great deal of money  in order to provide fleeting Saturday afternoon amusement for small children in Great Britain. Filmed in beautiful locations with clever amazing scripts and featuring remarkable stunts and fantastic actors  many of whom give the performance of their lives in this show  this in numerous ways seems to be more professionally made and have more production value than many a Hollywood film.".

It has its own charm and for me will always have.

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of my favorite series all categories all time.I was fortunate enough to get a hold of the whole series on VHS a few years ago. I loved it when I saw it back in 91 92 when I was about 12. I love it as much or more today which is remarkable considering my hopefully improved film appreciation and criticism skills. Most of the movies I liked back then I'm not that fond of today besides for the nostalgia factor. That factor is present here as well but there's so much more to Robin of Sherwood than nostalgia.There are only a few bad things about this series. First the picture and sound quality is soso at least in the first couple of episodes. Fortunately it gets better. Secondly you could have wished for a bit more blood and realism in the fighting scenes although I know that was not an option in this case.So on to the good things! And there are a lot of them. First of all Michael Praed IS Robin Hood. I don't think I have seen him in a single role since then which only strengthen this fact for me. He delivers such a believable performance as Robin. Jason Connery had an impossible task replacing him. The fact that Michael Praed hasn't become a bigger name as an actor is unbelievable. Or perhaps that was his fate to do this one role perfectly then disappear.I love Nickolas Graces Sheriff of Nottingham. He is really not a complex character but totally rotten. The relation between him and Gisburne is just hilarious. Actually just looking at de Rainault sitting in his throne bored glaring makes me laugh even before he has said anything. Another actor that deserves extra praise is Ray Winstone as Will Scarlet. You can really feel the sadness inside of him as well as his hate for the soldiers who killed his wife. Winstone is an actor that finally has gotten his well deserved Hollywood breakthrough in films as The Departed and Beowulf. There are a lot of other great actors here too.I love the portrayal of the Robin gang. They are having fun playing laughing you really get a feel of the camaraderie between them the closeness that comes from a tight bound group such as this. Those bonding scenes are so important.I think that it being UK produced with British actors really made it better compared to for example the 92 feature film version with Kevin Costner that just feels fake fake fake. Christian Slater as Will Scarlet come on.. The cast being able to speak English with British accent makes it more believable and I get the feeling that the actors as well as the director and writers behind the series can put themselves much more into the shoes of the Robin Hood gang than an American crew could have. The music is wonderful Clannad is perfect for the feel of the series. The music is another of those things they just nailed.An exciting addition also is the fantasy and magic spice that is put in there. It's not over the top but believable and just makes the whole thing better and more interesting. I also love how nicely the mix of comedy adventure and drama is blended.Those are a few of the things that makes this series so alive and so genuine. It's by far the best Robin Hood version I have ever seen. I won't wrap up with the Nothing's forgotten quote. But one thing that never will be forgotten for me is this fantastic Robin Hood retelling. See it.".

The chemistry shows in the interaction between the characters with the acting coming across as natural and not strained.Combine this with beautiful locations well written plots and the inimitable Clannad theme and support music and the basis for a cult classic is made.This is one of the shows that few will ever tire of watching and for many forms the definitive version of the Robin Hood legend.Michael Praed was in his early 20s when he did this role and he really put his stamp on it  it is doubtful if anyone else can or will command as much onscreen presence as he does playing this character.  When he departed the series at the end of season 2 he did so in a way that probably furthered his fan following.  Pity then that he did not find many meaty screen roles after doing Robin Of Sherwood until the recent 'Secret Adventures Of Jules Verne' although his stage performances in 'Aspects Of Love' 'Carousel' and others confirm his inherent talent.The rest of the cast also deserve mention particularly Nickolas Grace as the Sheriff and Robert Addie as Sir Guy the hapless fall guy throughout the series.  Guest stars read like a who's who of British drama thus reinforcing the fact that Robin Of Sherwood was a mover and shaker in its day.  It remains so today.Thankfully the Praed series have now been released on DVD and many be pucrchased through Amazon UK making them accessible to a whole new generation of viewers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Fantastic series one of my few favorites Miami Vice and Tour of Duty are the other two and this series is right up there with them.These guys aren't into wearing frilly tights  they dress more like woodsmen. Everything about this series breathes an aire of realism artistic license or not.It paints a picture of a Europe only slightly out of the grasp of paganism as most of the villagers still have their local deities and there are Satan worshipping nuns and magi witches and sorcerers casting spells.However what comes to the fore most is that it's a series of it's time. Rather than the version of the fifties which was a lament against centralized government and the McCarthy era persecutions this series is thoroughly grounded in the 1980s Thatcherist bleakness and has a strong environmentalist leaning. Robin's protector is a nature worshipper called Hern The Hunter who often appears wearing the head of a deer and is a personification as is this Robin of The Green Man an alternative version of Osiris the Egyptian god of vegetation and resurrection  it is interesting to note that in these series Robin In The Hood isn't a person but a concept when the old one is killed a new one is summoned telepathically by Hern  the person may die but Robin In The Hood will live forever hence the concept of resurrection.The music and score are really outstanding and performed by the Irish formation Clannad. When watching it I couldn't help but think how boring authentic medieval Anglosaxon folk music would have been. All this is beautifully shot in the lush forrests of Wales which pass for The New Forrest.The only down side is that in the initial episodes of both series the actors have to overcome their own skepsis and convince themselves that this really is a serious work. After that they get into it and the acting is great! Michael Praed as the first Robin the second is played by Sean Connery's son Jason Judi Trott makes a beautiful and fragile redheaded Marion Phil Rose as the portly and really kindhearted friar Tuck Ray Winstone as the volatile and lovelorn Scarlet Clive Mantle as the giant shepard Little John Peter Llewellyn Williams as Little John's bumpkin friend and fellow shepard and Mark Ryan as the exHashashinAssassin Nazir  all of them giving great performances. Also great are the steady Bad Guys Nicholas Grace as the bugeyed scheming Sheriff of Nottingham and his aristocratic bumbling sidekick and Robin's half brother as it turns out Robert Addie as Sir Guy of Gisburne. Really cool too is fashion designer Richard O'Brien as the evil Lord Owen of Clun's Olliver Cotton magician Gulnar he appears near the end of the first series and later in the second.The Tithe Barn in Bradford on Avon stood in for the Sheriff's castle. Check it out on bradfordonavon.co.uk under places of interest.So if you're at all into mythology the Middle Ages romanticism don't waste your time on Xena or Hercules  this is the real thing so go out and watch it!Alex".

	schema:reviewBody "I agree with all the previous comments concerning the quality of this excellent series. I enjoyed it when I saw it for the first time more than 20 years ago and I have enjoyed it just as much on seeing it again now. However I can not offer equal praise for the NTSC DVD set from Network. The audio is fine though limited to a Dolby Surround presentation. 5.1 audio would have been nice. Still the audio shines compared to the video quality. I understand from the commentary track that the series was originally shot on 16mm. That does mean it will never look as good as a movie shot on 35mm but there is no excuse for the extremely poor digital transfer that Network has made. The picture is full of grossly obvious digital artifacts primarily blocking. This is due to poor compression encoding not the source material. I have a better quality transfer that was made from the 1950's Richard Greene Robin Hood series purchased on a DVD that cost one dollar. The source material for Robin of Sherwood couldn't have been worse than that but the DVD looks worse. I don't even see how this can be blamed on trying to squeeze too much on to each disc. Three episodes plus another hour of bonus materials is not much more than the four episodes on each disc in a Star Trek set and the quality of those is excellent. The DVD set does provide an eclectic and engrossing set of bonus materials. That and the high quality of the series are enough for me to recommend the DVD set but be warned that the video quality is not up to current standards especially for a set that will cost about 200.".

	onyx:emotionText "I agree with all the previous comments concerning the quality of this excellent series. I enjoyed it when I saw it for the first time more than 20 years ago and I have enjoyed it just as much on seeing it again now. However I can not offer equal praise for the NTSC DVD set from Network. The audio is fine though limited to a Dolby Surround presentation. 5.1 audio would have been nice. Still the audio shines compared to the video quality. I understand from the commentary track that the series was originally shot on 16mm. That does mean it will never look as good as a movie shot on 35mm but there is no excuse for the extremely poor digital transfer that Network has made. The picture is full of grossly obvious digital artifacts primarily blocking. This is due to poor compression encoding not the source material.

An aspect that lures me back to keep watching is the dramatization of Herne and the imaginative attempt to guess at what life in a pagan enclave in a land dominated by a colonial Christian power would have been like.The one element that I personally find jarring is the Clannad soundtrack.

Clannad were right place perfect timing for this 80s Gem. I remember watching this with my late grandfather who was a massive fan too and inspired most of what I have achieved in life. The story is simple really Robin of Loxley and his band of merry men and woman outwit the sheriff of Nottingham and Sir Guy of Gisborne on many occasions. The lead played by a young in his element Michael Praed is just perfect. A young Ray Winstone who based his character on a football hooligan is superb and adds the soldier that the merry men needed.The rest of the band slot nicely into place. The irony of the story is of course that although a saracen is one of the merry men since this version in reality there is no mention ever of a saracen in any of the stories. The one thing that I always feel saves this production is that the acting is very good standard just my opinion of course. I love the premise of being Herne the Hunters son and once called you are it basically also the fact that in theory the mantle passes from son to son so never dies. Quite clever and a battle you cannot win. I am a leaf driven by the wind......... Please watch and enjoy a superb series.".

This is no children's television programme it deals with witchcraft treason rebellion and injustice. And it manages to do it without showing too much blood. As far as I can recall you only see a bit of the red stuff in the Pilot film Episodes 1 and 2 on the DVD set. The DVDs are great containing a wealth of extras including cast commentaries on Series 3 only the Jason Connery Robin and crew commentaries for Series 1 and 2. The picture quality is very good and the remixed and remastered surround sound is amazing.The idea of freedom is important freedom prevails. Nothing's forgotten. Nothing's ever forgotten.".

If you allow yourself to identify with the Patricia Arquette character you will find it to be a very moving story of a woman regaining a sense of purpose to her life and finding a new will to live.Arquette's performance is brave because it is purposefully wooden  it's a way of defining her character's spiritual death her complete lack of a desire to be alive.  She moves through life like a zombie because her family has been murdered and she can't see the point of living.  What is moving is how in the course of the story she is reawakened  by the Burmese landscape by the beautiful quality of its people and landscapes and by the primal choices she is forced to confront.Boorman supports this visually and Hans Zimmer supports it with one of his most gorgeous haunting scores with an often static camera and with a propensity to shoot through glass windows windshields etc.  We are on the outside looking in just like Arquette.... until she finds herself deep in the jungle and is forced to choose whether or not to fight for her life.I recommend the 1954 movie THE PURPLE PLAIN as well.  It's a similar story in a similar setting and makes for a fascinating comparison.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie was working toward two goals to make a political point and to tell a scary adventure story. It's often difficult to do make a political point and still tell a good story consider the highly political but rarelyentertaining final season of Ellen. Beyond Rangoon finds a good balance between politics and storytelling.I already knew that Aung San Suu Kyi had won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize and knew something about the oppressive political situation in Burma so the political message of the movie was mostly a dramatization of what I already knew. But I thought the movie did a good job of telling about Aung San Suu Kyi and the mostlyfaceless dictators who have for years tried to silence her. The device of presenting an unfamiliar setting through the eyes of a character that viewers can identify with is fairly common but it's quite well done in this movie.Of course the real measure of the movie was its entertainment value. Arquette was excellent as a young woman whose sister took her to a distant unfamiliar place to shake her out of her depression over the violent deaths of her husband and son. She is convincingly detached and depressed. Her grieving condition gives her a clear reason for her distracted wanderings into the thick of a dangerous situation she does not understand something she'd otherwise be much too intelligent to stumble into.Once the dangers become so obvious that she can see through them even through the cloud of grief she's trapped with no easy escape. That sets her on a path of adventure where she needs her intelligence to survive. The writers deserve much credit for making her intelligent and resourceful enough to deal with numerous dangerous situations while still finding a plausible reason for her to be foolish enough to get into trouble in the first place. The directing is strong also keeping up the tension throughout the race to escape the forces of the dictatorship.This movie had additional impact on me and my wife because of other events of the same time period. We were preparing for a trip to India and heard news reports of Western tourists who had been taken hostage by a terrorist group in India. Avoiding isolated terrorists in a peaceful democratic country is quite a different matter from escaping an oppressive dictatorship. But the movie and the news shared the element of avoiding danger in an unfamiliar country. That common characteristic gave the movie meaning beyond the strength of its own skillful storytelling. The movie illustrates the international tourist's worst nightmare.".

	schema:reviewBody "The trip was Andy's idea. It was easier to say 'Yes' than argue. Always that way with my sister. She meant well. A touch of the exotic east would take me away from everything that reminded me of what had happened...So begins the film Beyond Rangoon about an emotionally troubled American who is urged by her sister to take a vacation in Rangoon Burma to try and get over the devastating loss of her husband and child. While there she becomes entertwined in very real political upheavel. The film depicts the marches and rallies and protests realistically and shows massacres that are hard to watch but need to be heard. The political upheavals that really happened in Burma in 1988 were never heard or talked about in the US and needed to be. Aung San Su Kyi was a woman who was trying to bring Burma Now Myanmar to democracy but was denied by the government. She still tried to lead her people to freedom and the struggle still exists today. The film has powerful writing directing cinematography and acting. The absolutely chilling and powerful score by Hans Zimmer lends riveting power to each scene and fills triumphant moments with triumph. Patricia Arquette portrays the American Laura Bowman with depth very frozen by the horrors of her loss I tried finding something in those stone statues but nothing stirred in me. I was stone myself but slowly she sees the meaning of her life and others in her journeys throughout Rangoon and beyond. A terrific film. And it needs to be watched. At home and in history or government classes.  stars.".

	schema:headline " Wonderful work by ARQUETTE as usual...where is the DVD???";
	schema:reviewBody "Beyond Rangoon is simply marvelous. From the traumatic opening to the uplifting ending you will be amazed at how well put together this film is. Patricia Arquette amazingly portrays Laura Bowman who we meet as a shutdown and quit despondent young doctor unable to deal with her grief over the loss of her husband and son. Throughout the course of the film as she is trapped in Burma witnesses the Democratic uprise and massacres in the capital city of Rangoon flees for her life and saves her tourguide's U Aung Ko's life she is regaining her will to live. This may seen contrived or heavy handed it is not. John Boorman a master at spiritual and emotional conflict paints the film with broad strokes and often uses symbolism to capture Laura's emotional state and physical predicament. Patricia Arquette as usual gives a wonderfully convincingly and believable performance as the emotionally wounded Laura. What Arquette does amazingly in any role that she plays is give us a window into her character's heart without words. Every time she is given a close up in the film the audience is given insight into her character. She does not need to speak to convey emotions or be over the top. Some critics were harsh on Arquette's performance in the film when it opened on August 25 1995 deeming that she was flat or dull in the role. I found her characterization deadon staying well away from the melodramatics that typically are part of an actor's performance when having a personally tragedy take place. She is on shock and is reserved about her feelings that is just as normal as screaming lashing out at those around you. I am hoping that Warner Brothers releases this title on DVD very soon. With Arquette's hugely successful NBC drama Medium bringing her to household name status not to mention an Emmy win and now 2007 nomination it would be in the studio's best interest to do so. Hopefully there will be extras with the alternate ending. Do not by pass by this film. It is one that you will certainly not forget after seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "This amazing film is probably the greatest triumph of John Boorman's long directing career. All the fire of his blazing courage and outrage are blended in this incredible portrayal of the dilemma of modern Burma. There is probably no military dictatorship anywhere in the world more brutal than that of Burma which surpasses even the unlamented tyranny of Saddam Hussein for cruelty and sheer evil. It was like that when this film was made and it is still like that now 16 years later. Nothing has changed except that Aung San Suu Kyi is 16 years older. She is played delicately and to perfection in this film in a brief and moving scene where she gracefully walks up to soldiers pointing rifles at her brushes them aside and passes on. In a sense she is not just the Conscience of Burma but the current Conscience of the World. For she remains faithful to a cause which the world has heartlessly abandoned. Because there is no oil in Burma it will not be invaded by the United States Tony Blair will not go there with his pious platitudes and grin of a madman BP will not ruin the coastline and the arms industry must be content merely with selling guns for the population and 'rebels' to be murdered not for invading troops to be opposed what a pity there is less need for tanks and fighter planes not to mention drones. Why is it that the Burmese population are so thoughtless that they allow themselves to be shot with simple rifle bullets so that cannon shells are not required? The Burmese military really are bad customers they kill on the cheap. But of course like the Nazis they get plenty of raping and torture in first as what fun is it being a vicious brute if you cannot lord it over the people you are about to massacre before you do so? Even a Burmese soldier has his vanity. The most amazing performance in this film is by a Burmese man whose own name is the same as that of the character he plays U Aung Ko. This is the only film in which he ever appeared according to IMDb so he was not an actor but 'a real person'. Note do real persons exist on screen outside of documentaries? This is an existential question for cinastes. In trying to find out more about this man I googled the name and discovered that there is another U Aung Ko actually U Aung Ko Win also known as Saya Kyaung who is closely connected with the present sinister regime probably a relative but certainly not the same man as our hero in the film. Then I discovered that our hero lives in exile in Paris having left Burma to live in France in 1975 where he had previously studied at the Sorbonne where he is married to a French woman has assisted in the preparation of a documentary film about his country's plight and works as a translator and language teacher. So that's who he is. The other lead in the film is Patricia Arquette who gives a magnificently stalwart and powerful performance and clearly endured a great deal of physical hardship in doing so. The two of them work very well together and generate significant chemistry not of the romantic kind but of the rarer kind based on understanding and friendship which helps make the film such a spectacular success. Frances McDormand appears early in the film as Arquette's sister who has to leave her behind because she is forced to leave Burma with a tour group while Arquette is stranded while she waits for travel papers from the incompetent US Embassy. McDormand is as usual wonderful but then she is one of our most admired actresses who never disappoints. Arquette has been widowed and is recovering from intense grief and as a result of her amazing adventures which ensue 'beyond Rangoon' when she gets out into the countryside officially barred to foreigners she finds a new meaning and value to life in helping others. Several of her companions are killed along the way. There are many excellent performances from young Burmese or actors who play Burmese since obviously this film could not be made in Burma it was filmed in Malaysia and Thailand and several of the players are really of diverse ethnic backgrounds. We see many horrible massacres and rampant violence and oppression taking place continually. Unfortunately though many films with an axe to grind have tended to show these things for tendentious purposes in this case I fear it is all too true. It does not appear that one can exaggerate on film any of the atrocities committed either by the Nazis of Germany or the Burmese military of today. This film really should be shown in schools. It is such a powerful lesson about the real world so inspiring and horrifying at the same time. And yet those same parents who are content to let their kids sit around all day watching meaningless blood and gore on the screen with fictitious 'action heroes' and play computer games where everybody gets rewarded for killing other people is that sick or what? would doubtless complain because there are many grim real life situations portrayed here. Such is the 'hypocrisy of suburbia' into which real life rarely enters. We should all be giving copies of this film to all of our friends. And if the politicians were not all such thickos they might even do something about the West's foreign policy.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is the worst of Boorman's movies I have seen. Boorman is a fine actor and has made many great movies  like Excalibur and Hope and Glory but this is a total failure. Why? First The bluescreen shooting is terrible with many darklines still left around the actors this is most visible when they are on the raft in the river. Second The movie is too short. This movie is only 1h 35min and that is too short for a movie of this kind. Because of its shortness it fails where movies like Killing fields and Salvador triumphs. It is impossible to unite with the actors and actresses world in so short a time and therefor one only looks at this movie and don't feel anything about the horrors that it is supposed to make you upset about. But there is at least one thing good about this movie and that is the performance of Arquette  very convincing and colorfully done but why didn't you give her an other half hour to give us more depth? Therefore I can't recommend this movie  insteed I advise you to watch Killing Fields by Roland Joffe or Salvador by Oliver Stone or watch another of Boorman's movies.".

The story makes no attempt to give us a comprehensive picture of those events just an introduction but it is a solid introduction.  I feel I know a lot more and I have a sense of connection with those people that I did not have before however tenuous from my place of privilege.Overall I found the story moving and filled with meaning.  I always like Patricia Arquette and her leading man in this film is just great. Actually she's the lead in this film and that is what is great.So much of the film is told with film language that is images that I can see some critics being a little impatient with it but it is probably because they overanalyze and find it fearful to feel anything too deeply.Anyone out there wondering if this movie is worth it should watch it to find out.  It will not be a waste of your time whether you like it or not.".

Apart from the fact that filming was done outside of Myanmar in Malaysia  Thailand and that I missed the exotic Burmese locales I could not find much fault in the film.You cannot blame the film for the desperation of the people and the resulting overwhelming actions. It is after all real events of a civil war. The music by Hans Zimmer is definitely the USP of an otherwise adventurous tragedy for people who have no connection to it.I was only a year old in Rangoon now Yangon during this tumultuous time. When I heard a movie was made on my reallife experience which I was too young to absorb I had to get the DVD and needless to say I could hardly have any complaints about it as it is an eyeopening wonder for me.".

Patricia Arquette was out of her depth in such a role and her acting was wooden and unconvincing. Mind you being saddled with such an awfully conventional script maybe boredom set in and was such reflected on the screen. A lot of the film was just plain laughable. At one stage Arquette's elderly companion is shot and he is prostrate on the ground. In the next scene he is sprinting through the forest obviously attempting to break the world 100 meters record!  or maybe he's just trying to run away from Boorman!!. If you find it hard to sleep one night then play Beyond Rangoon on your VCR and you'll be snoring in no time.

However a midnight walk brings her into the middle of a student demonstration where she loses her passport. Left behind by her tour group she begins tour of discovery through the troubled country led by U Aung Ko.  She discovers a world of atrocities that have not been exposed to the media.There's no denying that there is a great story here  it is a powerful tale of injustice military rule and massacres that happened away from the public eye.  However this film does not really tell that story.  Instead it focuses on an American doctor on holiday in Burma who allows us to see all these things.  However it comes across like it's about her rather than the country.  She is seen as the most important character and we have a subplot about her overcoming the loss of her family in the US.  It takes away from the central story and makes this feel like a soap.Of course it needn't have been like that.  It's only a terrible flat lifeless performance from Arquette that does this.  She is so flat that it's hard to care about her and it comes across even more like a soap.  She gives us shock selfrighteous indignation etc all under a monotone voice over than made me want to sleep.  She manages to come across as more important than everyone else in the country and it's as she only sees events in terms of how they affect her.  Outside of Arquette the support cast are good  U Aung Ko in particular but McDormand and Grey are OK.The film continues with Hans Zimmer's standard Far East' score compare this to Black Rain to see what I mean and Arquette discovering herself and spuing philosophy everywhere.  However at the end the film acts as a metaphor for why the US didn't know about events in Burma  because no one cares about massive deaths unless a Westerner is involved.  We see in on the news everyday  hundreds killed in a third world country is relegated to the end of the news after a story about what Brittany was wearing that day! But if one American was killed then it would be the lead story with politicians running from all corners to comment on it.The film manages to take a terrible emotive story and make it into a beautifully shot drama about one American woman who only sees things in terms of how they affect her.  Boorman has a good try but really needed a much better actress to lift the script.".

	schema:reviewBody "Brave performance here by Patricia Arquette making up somewhat for any lack there may arguably have been in her being cast for the part. The rest of the cast as well as the photography keeps the film at an acceptable level. Not so the music from Hans Zimmer which as often happens in other films with his music one senses the plagiarism as he wanders about from cuasiIsham to almost Vangelis forms Boorman's directing was rather loose at times and some poor editing did not help. Notwithstanding all this the film maintains interest precisely because it is Burma  now Myanmar  which is the true protagonist of the unfolding story  not the actors. It is the tragedy of Myanmar hardly ever in the headlines that keeps interest for the discerning viewer.A second viewing of this film recently confirmed this way of watching the film for me.I was in Burma then in 1971 rebuilt Japanese war vehicles converted into little buses ran the streets of Rangoon nearly a quarter of a century later Boorman was filming the same vehicles! From the fabulous insult of Shw Dagon north to Pagan and Mandalay and east to Karen country around the lake at Inl repression was evident at all times. The poverty of the filthy streets in the capital with open drains and sewers .. and amidst all this the incredibly beautiful British colonial architecture of the Government house presiding over the mess. The Shw Dagon pagoda displays that magnificent heritage of 10th and 11th Century Burma as well as many others around the country but is an insult to the peoples striving to live in the ruins of a despotic rgime.If Boorman sought to illustrate this pity indeed he did not do it 25 years earlier. But whilst the mixture of races  Indians Bangladeshis Laotians Karens and other indigenous Burmese races  continue to suffer but the repression does not affect interests of other nations above all the US there is no Nobel Prize which will change the course of events and no film will do it either. With its back to the world shut in inside its frontiers the tottering rgime stumbles on in no direction stagnating in its own mire and shunning anything anyone may say or do about the situation.So you can see that my interpretation of the film is rather tainted a very personal point of view. But do not be dissuaded the story line maintains a certain coherency though at times Patricia Arquette running and running and running at times had me almost laughing.".

Not so the music from Hans Zimmer which as often happens in other films with his music one senses the plagiarism as he wanders about from cuasiIsham to almost Vangelis forms Boorman's directing was rather loose at times and some poor editing did not help. Notwithstanding all this the film maintains interest precisely because it is Burma  now Myanmar  which is the true protagonist of the unfolding story  not the actors. It is the tragedy of Myanmar hardly ever in the headlines that keeps interest for the discerning viewer.A second viewing of this film recently confirmed this way of watching the film for me.I was in Burma then in 1971 rebuilt Japanese war vehicles converted into little buses ran the streets of Rangoon nearly a quarter of a century later Boorman was filming the same vehicles! From the fabulous insult of Shw Dagon north to Pagan and Mandalay and east to Karen country around the lake at Inl repression was evident at all times. The poverty of the filthy streets in the capital with open drains and sewers .. and amidst all this the incredibly beautiful British colonial architecture of the Government house presiding over the mess. The Shw Dagon pagoda displays that magnificent heritage of 10th and 11th Century Burma as well as many others around the country but is an insult to the peoples striving to live in the ruins of a despotic rgime.If Boorman sought to illustrate this pity indeed he did not do it 25 years earlier. But whilst the mixture of races  Indians Bangladeshis Laotians Karens and other indigenous Burmese races  continue to suffer but the repression does not affect interests of other nations above all the US there is no Nobel Prize which will change the course of events and no film will do it either. With its back to the world shut in inside its frontiers the tottering rgime stumbles on in no direction stagnating in its own mire and shunning anything anyone may say or do about the situation.So you can see that my interpretation of the film is rather tainted a very personal point of view. But do not be dissuaded the story line maintains a certain coherency though at times Patricia Arquette running and running and running at times had me almost laughing.";

	schema:reviewBody "It is now clear that the true golden age of American film was from the mid60s until just before the release of Star Wars. Before then there was too much Hays Codeconstricted pap. With Star Wars the green light was lit for most films to be directed at children and morons a practice which continues to this day. THE SEVENUPS truth be told contains a couple hackneyed lines of dialogue  We can do this the easy way or we can do it the hard way is one  but I'm damned if I can find anything else wrong with it. In fact that line may not even have been stale when this film was made. THE SEVENUPS demonstrates all that was right with the best films of the golden age sparse dialogue realistic acting real locations winter in a dirty New York has never looked betterworse propulsive stories and yes the best car chase ever filmed. Bill Hickman is the driver Scheider is chasing you will recognize him from Bullitt and the structure of the chase is fairly similar to the McQueen one but I prefer Scheider's facial intensity here the pacing the terrific closeups of the schoolchildren and the shattering conclusion. That VW bug going about 2 mph always bothers me in the Bullitt chase. A stringy screechy score by Don Ellis sets the perfect mood. THE SEVEN UPS bleak grim actionoriented grownup. This is a film that couldn't be made today there's no gimmick for the kiddies or preposterous ending. Thank you Philip D'Antoni Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco for as long as cop films are watched THE SEVENUPS and its 1970s brethren e.g. THE FRENCH CONNECTION will set the standard.".

	onyx:emotionText "It is now clear that the true golden age of American film was from the mid60s until just before the release of Star Wars. Before then there was too much Hays Codeconstricted pap. With Star Wars the green light was lit for most films to be directed at children and morons a practice which continues to this day. THE SEVENUPS truth be told contains a couple hackneyed lines of dialogue  We can do this the easy way or we can do it the hard way is one  but I'm damned if I can find anything else wrong with it.

As a child growing up in the NY Metro area in the late 60s and early 70s I was often afforded the opportunity to visit NYC with my grandfather or father as they conducted business there. The gritty bustling human reality of that city particularly in winter have stayed with me. This film very aptly captures the stark cold matteroffact feel of the NYC winter season while keenly exposing the underbelly of the region's infamous underworld of crime and policing. A great snapshot of a place and a time and a culture. And the car chase is simply amazing. At least on par with the one in Bullitt and surpassing the chase in The French Connection. I can watch time and again as the suspension comes unstuck on that Plymouth Fury police cruiser barreling toward the GW Bridge in pursuit as it lurches into that sharp right curve bouncing and scraping into oncoming traffic. The stunt driving coordinator for that scene did Bullitt and The French Connection as well as many other noatable movie chases. Good acting too and a decent plot line. The musical score is edgy and compelling and the cinematography and direction are top notch. A great if underrated 1970s cop drama. A keeper. Not out on DVD yet though.Comparable in style and content to The French Connection and Super Fly. Early 1970's cop dramas set in the bleak NYC winter months.".

	schema:headline " Good Basic Cop Movie that we need more of";
	schema:reviewBody "I love the other reviews of this movie. They mirror my attitude. I am a 70's sort of guy minus disco and Star Wars childishness. There was nothing great about this movie except for a chase scene. That is why it was good because it was tough basic and economical. Roy Scheider carried the movie which was based on the crew the 7 Ups that backed up Gene Hackman in the French Connection. The people in it were believable and average who burned themselves pouring coffee showed fear in chase scene and almost lost it after a close call crash.Maybe it would be easier to tell you what it lacked. There was no fancy weapons just basic revolvers and crude sawed off shotguns. There was no tough guy philosophizing ala Tarantino. There was no kung fu or samurai nonsense and no fancy trick shooting either. There was no clever guy who carries out some complicated scheme based on hundreds of things going just the way he planned including everyone else's reactions. The criminals were bad guys but they didn't shoot people for the hell of it. As a matter of fact there was a body count of just three. something that the average movie these days would pass in the opening credits. It could be a G movie today! No bus load of orphan school children were kidnapped nor were terrorists threatening to kill half of the city. There were no high tech hijinks nor were the crimes themselves very moving or ingenious the highest tech thing I saw was a touch tone ATT wall phone. It had no subplots or amusing character developments. Also no sex or women except for one mobster's wife who did some screaming as the Buddy our hero had her menaced.It was some little undertaker who exploited his connections with the local mob and the police to kidnap local mobsters for some easy payoffs. The undertakers. Vito was played by Tony Lo Bianco who did a great job as good as Roy Schneider Buddy the head of 7 Ups cop whom he informed and exploited. What ever happened to Tony Lo Bianco he seemed like a Pacino shoe in good looking and talented? What it did have was a great NYC backdrop to a simple crime story. Locations that were bleak and dehumanizing without being a sociological study. It had a simple plot that involved this kidnapping scheme where one of Buddy's cop got accidentally involved literally accidentally dragged in then accidentally shot dead. Since Buddy and his 7 ups are a hot dogs unit both the NYPD Brass and mobsters thought he was involved since the kidnappers masqueraded as plain clothes cops to lure the mobsters into compliance. Obviously the mobsters figured they had lawyers and rights to protect them from normal police. Even the mobsters were plain old and ugly no Godfather royalty or Soprano hipness here.It is a good basic movie with a standout chase scene between two 70's d Pontiacs. Even the cars were plain and economical not even a GTO or a Trans Am like the acting and the story. In the days of Batman uberhype or 24 levels of intensity doomsday scenarios this movie reminds us that less is better. It should be shown to movie screen writers and directors as a caveat not to dazzle amuse then ultimately insult us with stunts gadgets and clown psychotic behavior galore.".

	schema:reviewBody "I think the filmographic lineage may run like this. Pay attention please because I had to look this up. In 1967 Peter Yates an ex auto racer directs the English caper movie Robbery the most thrilling part of which is a car chase through the streets of London down alleys where there are crowds of children playing and all that. It's a success.A year later Yates directs Bullet starring Steve McCool I mean McQueen featuring another even more spectacular car chase up and down the San Francisco Hills with dumbfoundingly authentic engine sounds that seem to include double clutching full race cams no mufflers twelvecylinder engines under fortyfoot hoods supercharged superdupercharged and all fivethousand horsepower running at full tilt. Lots of shots of McQueen's gumchewing visage scowling with concentration as he tries to bump another car off the highway though a passenger in the other vehicle totes a shotgun. The chase is staged by Philip D'Antoni. Bill Hopkins drives the criminal vehicle.A year or two later sensing a good thing Bill Friedkin directs The French Connection featuring a chase between a commandeered cop carGene Hackman and an elevated train in New York City. Lots of shots of Hackman's cursing face as he wrestles the battered car through the streets. The chase is staged by Philip D'Antoni. Academy Awards follow.Sensing a good thing a year or two more brings us The Seven Ups featuring a chase between a car driven by Roy Scheider with lots of shots of Scheider's cursing face as he tries to bump the other car which is driven by Bill Hopkins off the road although the criminal car to be sure carries a shotguntoting passenger. No hills in New York City just bumps but they are still sharp enough to elevate the cars a few feet. The pursued car screeches around a corner and dashes down a street on which a dozen children are playing. Shots of the screaming kids as they scatter off the pavement and allows the car to zoom through. But once is not enough. The children immediately run back into the street and must repeat the retreat for the pursuing cop car carrying Scheider.I once witnessed a pursuit at high speed on the streets of Philadelphia. Both the criminal and the cops drove through the streets at about 25 miles an hour coming to rolling stops at each Stop sign and red light  very dull stuff compared to this movie.Speaking of this movie it's pretty good. Robbery and Bullet were cool. Everyone dressed neatly. But the New York movies are filthy. There's garbage all over the place and the subway cars are covered with graffiti. Shoot outs and beat ups take place in vacant lots surrounded by crumbling brick buildings or in disposal dumps for industrialsized freezers.The acting is pretty good too. Roy Scheider seems whippet sleek. The other actors have faces made for the camera especially Richard Welsh. And the story is engaging if not entirely unfamiliar. What's best about the film is the way it captures New York City in its almost total indifference to human depravity and nobility. At a funeral the limo drivers stand around with their collars up butts hanging out of their mouths kicking their cold feet together utterly bored at the ritual goings on. The film wants us to believe that The Seven Ups are an elite group of untouchable cops who stop at nothing to get the job done and here it's a bit of a sell out. They always seems to be threatening to do something unethical and illegal  beat hell out of a suspect or physically damage a hospitalized and helpless hood  but they always manage to avoid doing it. If they actually did it their characters would become lifelike and ambiguous and we'd rather have our heroes and villains of a more Biblical nature. Very enjoyable even if you've seen it before and you very well may have in one or another of its previous incarnations.".

The acting it must be admitted is routine but Roy Scheider and the rest portray an undercover squad of calm professionals to whom danger has become routine. The story manages to be interesting punctuated by one exciting Popeye Doyle style car chase through the Sunday streets judging by the light traffic and up the Taconic State Parkway and two nervewracking scenes in the belly of an automatic car wash.

	schema:reviewBody "The SevenUps is a followup of sorts to The French Connection based on a story by the legendary detective Sonny Grosso and uses some of the same talents from that other movie. Philip D'Antoni who'd produced The French Connection makes his first and to date only directorial effort creating an engrossing NYC tale that keeps its grip thanks to a very matter offact presentation. Unlike a lot of slick Hollywood productions this never gets bogged down in spectacle save for one major set piece which I'll get to in a moment or unnecessary melodrama.Grossos' gritty tale tells of tough undercover detective Buddy Roy Scheider part of an elite unit that goes after organized crime and resorts to some pretty unorthodox methods. What causes problems for Buddy and his men  played by Victor Arnold Jerry Leon and Ken Kercheval  is the interesting situation of a pair of rogue cops Bill Hickman and the great screen villain Richard Lynch in one of his earliest roles going around abducting underworld figures for ransom.The movie is highlighted by one absolutely incredible car chase occurring just past the halfway point and cranking up the films' energy level to a high degree. This is old school stunt driving and editing at its finest. As for the rest of the film it's done in a very low key gritty and realistic style. Some viewers may grow impatient and wish that most of the movie were like its car chase but others will appreciate the restraint that D'Antoni shows. He gets superb performances out of his cast with Scheider projecting a quiet authority in the lead role. Tony Lo Bianco also from The French Connection scores as amiable informant Vito. Larry Haines costars as mobster Max Kalish and familiar faces Joe Spinell Maniac and Rex Everhart Friday the 13th can be seen as well. About the only thing in The SevenUps that isn't too subtle is the intense music score by Don Ellis.Overall this is genuinely good stuff and well worth watching for any fan of crime pictures especially the great NYC films of the 1970s.Eight out of 10.".

They uncover a plot hatched by criminals to kidnap mobsters and hold them for ransom. Effectively what is happening is that criminals from one side of the pasture are abducting criminals from the other side of the pasture and keeping them until a hefty fee has been paid for their release.Quite often the police dialogue and the deliberately grimy photography echo the feel created in The French Connection but this is a tame retread of that film. The one thing that might pull in viewers is the film's ten minute car chase sequence which is not only the best bit of the film but one of the very best car chase scenes from any film ever made.

Things go pear shape when their own is killed in action and the men seek their own justice. While this urban cop formula might be overworked it's rather welldone for its type with exciting passages like the scorchingly intense high speed car chase. It's masterful in its execution and camera positional work. D'Antoni resourcefully keeps a fast pace where tension is sustained through good writing elaborate plotting where it does show its cards early vivid performances and welltimed thrills and spills with smooth editing. Really it's quite minimal on the action leaning towards the investigative digging but when it occurs it's explosive and raw. Just the way the 70s loved it. One thing that did catch my attention was Don Ellis' dangerously impulsive music score. Very unhinged but it did suit the film's dark relentless tone. The story is very much character based and the performances are assured across the board. Victor Arnold Jerry Leon and Ken Kercheval makeup the rest of The Sevenups. Tony Lo Bianco magnificently holds up alongside Scheider as his gotoman for information. Then there's Larry Haines as one the head mobsters. However in the bad guy roles it was Bill Hickman and especially the striking Richard Lynch who stood out. Lynch was terrifically menacing. Also in a minor part is genre actor Joe Spinell. Compelling lean and mean 70's cop drama.".

As one reviewer remarked This film very aptly captures the stark cold matteroffact feel of the NYC winter season while keenly exposing the underbelly of the region's infamous underworld of crime and policing.

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS Buried under a mountain of medical bills and his funeral business not being able to dig him out from under them undertaker Vito Lucia Tony Lo Bianco came up with a plan to make a load of cash with the help of his two crooked pals Moon  Bo Richard Lynch  Bill Hickman. Vito getting close with his boyhood friend Buddy Manucci Roy Scheider as a mob informer to win over Buddy's trust and have him tell Vito what's coming down on the streets of New York in regard to mob activities. Buddy is a cop who works in a sub rosa unite of the NYPD the Seven Ups that does things their way to clean up the streets of New York of criminals. Vito gets information from Buddy and makes it look to Buddy that he's really giving him tips about the mob and what it's up too and uses that information to tip off his hoodlum associates Moon  Bo to rip the mobsters off of their weekly take as well as kidnap top mob loan sharks and hold them for ransom.Everything is going well for Vito  Co. until the mob decides to retaliate and mistakenly grabs beats and kidnaps a member of the Seven Ups Ansel Ken Kerchevalwho was working undercover thinking he was one of the hoods who was kidnapping and ripping them off. Later Ansel was accidentally killed by Moon when he blasted out the trunk of the car that Ansel was locked in thinking that there was a suitcase full or cash ransom in it.Fast pace and exciting movie with that gritty and grimy photography of New York City that was so effective in the movie The French Connection which also stars both Roy Scheider  Tony Lo Bianco who are in this movie too. Incredible car chase that started in downtown Brooklyn and ended up in the wilds of New Jersey some 15 to 20 miles away with Buddy almost ending up decapitated for his heroic efforts. Roy Scheider who is not a big man is as tough and effective as any big action actor I can think off like Clint Eastwood would have been in the same movie. Scheider reminds me a lot of he even looks a bit like him former welterweight and middleweight champion Gene Fullmer who beat the great Sugar Ray Robinson for the middleweight championship back in 1957 and acts like him too in the movie  tough durable and destructive. Tony Lo Bianco is very good as Vito the undertaker the lowlife heel who plays off Buddy and the mob to the point that leads to Buddy's partner Ansel getting killed. Even though he's trash you can't in a way not help feeling sorry for Vito since he only wants the money he gets from the ripped offed mobsters to pay his sick wife's Rose's hospital and medical bills. Even the fact that Ansel was killed due to his actions Vito never wanted anybody to get hurt but like they say when you play with fire you end up getting burned. In the end Vito have a lot of explaining to do to the not so sympathetic and caring mobsters. The movie The Seven Ups has the late Bill Hickman doing the dangerous stunts with the car chases as well as act in the film. Hickman was also the stunt man in both great movies that had him doing the driving on the roads streets and highways of New York City and San Francisco The French Connection and Bullitt.".

Bill Hickman is great once again in his stunt driving this time along 10th Avenue and one of the parkways. Richard Lynch is his suitably scary accomplice Moon who gets his justice in the end. Tony LoBianco returns from the French Connection this time as Roy's longtime friend who pretends to be an informer for the police but is actually working against the police.

Roy Scheider does an excellent job playing his best type a tough courageous cop who works hard to get the job done in spite of the desk drivers and politicians who should be supporting him rather than hindering. He played a suburbanized version of this same role as the tourist town police chief in Jaws. Not nearly as gritty but the same get the job done despite the politicians and gutsy approach. If a man who can't swim and is terrified of everything in the water going out on an old boat with an Ahab wannabee and a nerd to confront a huge killer shark isn't gutsy then tell me what is....Tony Lo Bianco is good as a surprisingly complex villain most of the villains in fact have some depth and complexity. This is one of those movies that gets better with repeated viewings. Overall it captures the atmosphere of parts of NY City gritty unglamorous often dangerous but filled with energy. The story is spare tight and subtle it gets the job done without extraneous elements. It may not be one of the all time greats but it is an exceptionally good movie.Everyone has an opinion about car chases. Mine is that this one is right up there with the Mustang vs Dodge Charger chase in Bullitt. The Pontiac VenturaChevy Nova was similar to the Mustang in being a compact car chassis with beefed up suspension and a powerful small block V8 stuffed into an engine bay meant for an insipid 6. The VenturaNovas got little respect off the drag strip but with the proper suspension mods they made affordable performance cars that could handle on both the road and the track. The bawling of those GM V8's as they wind up is music to the enthusiast's ear. I've heard this chase criticized for imitating the Bullitt chase. The truth is that they are two works by the same master Bill Hickman who also choreographed and drove for the French Connection chase. Besides driving most of the car chase scenes he created a brooding malevolent presence and a good match with Richard Lynch as a pair of coldly evil killers.Yes the chase has realism errors often noted like the use of 3 different NY roads to represent the Palisades Parkway the ending of the chase in a crash with an 18 wheeler on a roadway for passenger vehicles only and the miraculous timing that allows all pedestrians to escape harm. That's beside the point. Let's face it movie car chases are unreal by nature. In Bullitt The French Connection and The Seven Ups however Bill Hickman and Phillip D'Antoni crafted chases far more realistic and therefore more exciting than the flying rolling exploding vehicle fantasy chases so common in recent films.".

Things come to a head and one has to keep watching to follow up on such a sequence. Quick moving and intense fresh for a thirty years.";

FC is a better movie but I prefer watching this one because 1 I think Scheider is great and this is his best movie and 2 this has the best car chase EVER one that makes Bullitt look like a cable production thanks again to Bill Hickman who actually plays the driver.  It doesn't hurt that Tony LoBianco stops by again to play a baddie.  Please enjoy.".

And while often even the most serious HK films tend to insert quite a bit of humor in between all the drama and action often spoiling the mood a bit here the jokes are kept subtle and woven into the plot even improving character relations. The music is also very well done and the two main themes are very beautiful. With the release of the HK special Edition they've even cleaned the picture first release was grainy and the subtitles even if the quality of the translation is still lacking nothing new there.

His cutting combined with the extraordinary music cues is exemplary. You are in the hands of a master cinematician.The two sequences in which Andy Lau hides from the cops on a bus by pretending to accompany a lithe beauty Ruby Wong are testament to To's unique directorial skills.Lau Ching Wan is strong and commanding as the harassed cop while Andy Lau is dynamic as a dying man avenging his father's death.This is superb moviemaking only mildly compromised by some bad English dubbing in one scene with criminal Waise Lee.".

	onyx:emotionText "Terrific deeply moving crime thriller starring Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan.From the dizzying opening sequence to the extremely satisfying conclusion this cat and mouser hardly misses a beat.Johnny To again working with ace composer Arthur Wong constructs another operatic actioner that grots in the face of its contemporaries.To's images are strong and moving. His cutting combined with the extraordinary music cues is exemplary. You are in the hands of a master cinematician.The two sequences in which Andy Lau hides from the cops on a bus by pretending to accompany a lithe beauty Ruby Wong are testament to To's unique directorial skills.Lau Ching Wan is strong and commanding as the harassed cop while Andy Lau is dynamic as a dying man avenging his father's death.This is superb moviemaking only mildly compromised by some bad English dubbing in one scene with criminal Waise Lee.";

I still found it quite enjoyable.The setup while not brilliant is carefully done with attention to details. No doubt the audience will find the total incompetence of the villiant Baudy quite unbelievable. But he only serves as something on which the duel between the two heroes is built.Here's is where this film differs from many others in this genre most notably John Woo's in which the two heroes usually start off in sharp confrontations although they may end up appreciating each other. Not here. Right from the beginning Lau Chingwan and Andy Lau give you the impression that they are engaged in no more than a friendly game of chess. I for one like this arrangement as a refreshing change.Lau Chingwan delivers his usual easy style that is well liked by his audience. He is the mouse in this catandmouse game a dignified mouse for that matter. Andy Lau is the cool cat actually too cool. Hong Kong movie stars who are also Canto pop stars and that accounts for some 90 of them often have to watch the role they play in movies to ensure that they wouldn't tarnish their image as a singer. Andy Lau however is so popular that I don't think he needs that caution. He just like to look cool in this movie. Didn't hurt either as it won him his first Hong Kong Oscar.Finally while this is a good movie from director Johnny To my top favorite of his is The Mission in which style is king.".

	schema:reviewBody "This viewer must admit that he's a relative newcomer to Hong Kong cinema but this interesting and gripping thriller from director Johnnie To has left him wanting to see more. It's stylish humorous even poignant at times. It's not wall to wall action but it doesn't need to be. It's also not particularly violent. The twisty script does keep one watching intrigued at finding out just how things will develop from scene to scene. Also the solid performances by the leads Andy Lau and Ching Wan Lau help a great deal.Andy Lau plays Peter Cheung a dying young man who learns that he has just weeks to live. So what he decides to do with his time left on Earth is play an elaborate game which ends up involving intrepid hostage negotiator Ho SheungSang Ching Wan Lau and the local mafia led by Baldy Waise Lee. What really gets the audience hooked is wondering just what the hell Peters' motivation is and what he hopes to gain from the whole experience.The action when it does take place is well orchestrated and director To does a good job at keeping a reasonable level of tension throughout his film. The pacing and editing are efficient enough at creating a story with a fairly brief running time of 93 minutes. In addition to the engaging lead performances those who leave an impression are Shiu Hung Hui as comedy relief character Chief Inspector Wong KaiFat who is believed by Ho to be inefficient and cowardly and lovely ladies YoYo Mung and Ruby Wong.The opening is pretty chilling and sobering and the ending is quite satisfactory.Overall this is good fun.Eight out of 10.".

This is expected from Johnnie To as once again he brings a certain finesse to the cinematography and character development which never cease to provoke intrigue. Andy Lau plays a dying man plagued with stage 3 cancer and in his last days wishes to seek revenge on on an old foe. Ching Wan Lau is a police negotiator who inadvertently becomes involved in Andy Lau's plot for revenge. Many twists and turns become evident as the audience is pulled alongside Ching Wan Lau in the fastpaced investigation to nab Andy Lau. The two bounce quips really well off of each other due to the dialogue being edgy and gratifying. There are a few silly moments along the way but when the ride's over you'll be glad you hopped on board.

	schema:reviewBody "Running Out of Time rests somewhere in the middle of Johnny To's cannon in the solid good category. As a crime thriller it's not terribly original or overwhelming and the action scenes will not blow you away but it has something else going for it. It's a Johnny To film after all it has to.Andy Lau has 72 hours to live. He decides to play a strange catandmouse game with a hostage negotiator of the HK police played by Lau Ching Wan. That's the plot in a nutshell. On top of that To piles layers of twists and turns that keep proceedings interesting throughout. It occasionally becomes too convoluted for its own sake but never lets it get the best of it. However just as Johnny To is about to hand over a slick and wellmade crime flick which let's face it are dimeadozen he slips in bits and pieces that bring Running Out of Time alive as a full emotional experience providing the soul and heart to the welloiled skeleton.The concepts of synchronism and minimalism staples in his work are explored in great effect here. Always subtle letting the images speak for themselves giving them time to develop with long takes and slow tracking shots exemplary cutting to the score it's all here. A small love story in a bus between Andy Lau and a girl is among the highlights of the film and part of the heart I'm talking about. So simple yet so powerful. Ditto for Lau's and Lau Ching Wan's car scenes and the bowlingroom showdown.However something stops me from claiming Running Out of Time is a masterpiece. To has all the ability and craftmanship down to a notch but he can also be too workmanlike or bland at times. When he's good he's REAL good. There are even isolated moment of pure brilliance that are just TOO good for their own sake leaving a bittersweet aftertaste for the rest of the movie. I'm convinced that if he puts his heart to it he can make a really great film. As it is this is another one of his films that is flawed but enjoyable. Underneath the slick HK style it's the black humour and heartfelt drama that makes this a compelling film. Worth watching definitely.".

The score by Raymond Wong was effective and fit every scene like a glove especially during the rather poetic ending which managed to surpass my expectations. Instead of ending with a generic shootout the movie goes for a more unique approach that benefits it in the long run. Andy Lau and Ching Wan Lau were quite frankly perfect in their roles charismatic subtle subdued and entertaining to watch. Although listed as an action movie this is really a drama of loyalty friendship and honor much like Woo's masterpiece being alluded to here. Unlike Woo's film however it never once steeps into melodrama or becomes overbearing with emotion. It's played mostly straight with some genuine laughs here and there and it deals with the issue of cancer in surprisingly good taste.

The film at first is really fast paced but slows down not enough to even notice which is also good we don't want to have a heart attacklol. In terms of plot their is enough of other things going on to keep you interested. Lau has some pretty good moments as he uses make up to impersonate people from the underworld. Also the movie has the best oriental supporting cast since house of Flying Daggers.The movie is great because its so unpredictable and leaves you wondering at every corner. Definitely a good rental with tons of comedy action and thrills pact in to one 8 out of 10".

Those scenes should have been deleted.I am otherwise definitely a great admirer of Johnnie To's films and I do not put the blame on him for this obnoxious element.However when I checked who the writers of the film were I found out that there were two French screenwriters and only one Chinese So I suddenly said to myself that it was definitely not surprising. So my suggestion would be that these two french bastards stop polluting Hong Kong cinema with filthy and disgusting Western clichs!!! As I said before without this disgusting subplot i would have given a 10 tho this film because both Ching Wan Lau's and Andy Lau's performances are perfect and the plot is otherwise almost flawless.I substance this is what drove me to give this film a 1 a thing I deeply regret but unfortunately there are however things I do not tolerate and think but this is a personal opinion should not be so easily overlooked.".

I'm not sure if he ever made a movie that really makes sense or at least wasn't hard to follow but he has so much directorial flair and talent for subtle comedy that the viewer is usually just glad to be along for the ride.He had to have his offdays and I'm afraid Running Out of Time may be one of them. It's still stylish and entertaining with amusing moments but in this case the plot is just incomprehensible. You can follow it at first but in the second half it just runs away from you in several different directions at once and I could not keep up.I'll try to tell you the plot as I remember it and then include the bits I had to read about online to learn about Ho played by To regular Lau Chingwan a skilled hostage negotiator is somehow noticed by Cheung Andy Lau a man who has a terminal illness and only days to live. He plays a game with Ho stringing him along through complicated and unrealistic means.Meanwhile a mysterious bald man is having a diamond appraised by an old man. He kills some American gangsters.The plot... thickens. It is a better descriptor to say that it shatters. I really lost the plot after this all I really remember is that Cheung disguises himself as the bald guy in one scene at least I think it was him and dresses up as a woman possibly in the same scene? I don't know. I really lost the plot at this point.I had to read online that Cheung's entire scheme was about taking revenge on the mafia and impersonating his dad. This doesn't really seem to dovetail with some of his other actions in the movie such as shooting randomly out the window of a moving car.And what was the point of his 'game' he played with Ho? Why not just level with him at the outset since the other man couldn't turn him down? Right?...I enjoyed this one but felt it was just too confusing to recommend.

The plot of course is the merest scrap of an idea horny college geeks set up a virtual reality business to cater to the sexual fantasies of other horny college geeks.   And the opening scenes are strictly R' with coy camera angles offering discrete glimpses of naked bodies.

We see a James Bond clone seduce a Bond girl in a brief and demure scene.  Ho hum.  We see one of our horny college geeks as a biker boy waiting for his biker girl .  More ho hum.And then like some memorable event high on the Richter scale the wickedly pneumatic Nikki Fritz shows up as the biker girl and the moment becomes molten.  The scene is long and intense spliced into this movie like one of those set pieces from Penthouse videos with names like Hot Wheels' or Leather Forever'. But don't misunderstand me.  This is a good thing.  In fact this is a very good thing. And unless the MPAA has pushed the envelope on R' I can only assume that some thoughtful programmer substituted an unrated version.And since we have been very good boys this year there's yet another present under the tree as the equally voluptuous Chrissey Styler joins Nikki in seducing some very lucky construction worker.  Hard hats fly clothes are torn off and soon the screen is filled with naked sweaty flesh.  One more long and ferocious set piece apparently spliced in from the same Penthouse videoAnd as I watch more and more latenight cable and learn the syntax here is a revision of one of the unwritten rules girlgirl scenes are allowed in erotic comedies' as long as the episode is fantasy or a dream.After a few less memorable moments pass Chrissey Styler is featured in her own scene as a coed client has a VR encounter with Chrissey as a private dancer.  The pretty coed even gets lured on stage undressed by Chrissey and the two entertain us with their dancing and exchange a few provocative glances.Without these three interludes VC2' would be a mildly entertaining trifle with scenes that wobble from modest R' to racy NC17'.  But the charms of Chrissey Styler and Nikki Fritz are impossible to resist their encounters vibrate like a sexual tuning fork and the rest simply surrenders to the fastforward button.".

Sixfoot tall Chrissy Styler is an amazing specimen and you will be dreaming about her for days if you ever have the good fortune to catch the unrated version. She wears just the right amount of body glitter in her multiple nude scenes and her giant cans appear to be real.

It's criminal the way this film was ignored by the academy. Nikki Fritz and that broad who gets tied up in the beginning as well as the brunette who gets a rubdown towards the end all deserved Best Supporting Actress nods.  Shame on you Hollywood!!!".

However the story and consequently the screenplay are very weak indeed a bad collection of clichs. The beginning is reasonable with a widow moving to a house in a remote location because the family spent all their resources with the illness of the patriarch. But when she arrives coincidently the little zombies attack people without any consequences for example families do not search the missing persons. Then the wicked Mr. Carlton comes to the place with the most disgusting attitudes a typical clichs that he will die in the end. There is no explanation why the children attacked innocent people and why they should stop after killing Mr. Carlton. When Sarah is running away with her mother and says that she is tired and cannot run anymore it is one the most stupid lines that I have ever seen in a horror movie. My vote is four.Title Brazil Zombies".

	schema:reviewBody "A young widow and her two daughters move to a new house in a Pennsylvanian mountain town. Soon her daughter's imaginary friend starts to let the family know she's just a little too real.This movie was enjoyable. I liked the characters especially the older daughter and the neighbor Hanks and the situations. The atmosphere was perfect and dark as one would expect from a movie about zombies roaming through the woods. And the pacing was decent revealing the story in a good speed.The gore was decent not overthetop but not ignored. Entrails are eaten and heads are smashed in. Sure it's not as cool as Necromantic or Anthropophagus but it's alright. Actually since most of the film was so blah and standard fare this Goldilocks level of gore should be no surprise. Some blood scenes were welcome and I could have used more.But this film is also riddled with countless clichs. An imaginary friend who might be real. Single mom with daughters moves to new town. Vehicles that won't start. Tripping in the middle of a running scene. I could probably go on.Some good can be said. Chloe Moretz is really blossoming into a supreme actress and this early work deserves to be seen. Scout TaylorCompton is another genre favorite. And the DVD has audio commentary with director J. S. Cardone and actress Lori Heuring though I haven't listened to it yet so that's an extra treat for those who do enjoy the film.I found the movie too polished the target seemed to be Hollywood and teenage girls rather than those who would go to see a film festival called 8 Films to Die For which is where I saw this. The dirty gritty scenes were just too clean. Sure the movie was dark... but dark in a very sanitary way. There are better ways to word this but I don't know what they are. If you don't see this film that's fine. More than likely it will fade into the background and within a few years won't even be found on video store shelves. You'll see it on Netflix and be like what is this? but don't bother ordering it... for all the film lacks it will probably lack even more in a few years as it becomes stale if it hasn't already.".

	schema:reviewBody "Even with the low standards of a dedicated horror fan I found this film to be beyond awful. It was a huge disappointment since it was featured as one of the eight Horrorfest films. I can only hope the other seven were better. I was actually embarrassed for the friends I was able to convince to see this and these are the same friends I made watch the remake of The Wicker Man. It has every clich in the book. In fact it went out of its way to include them. Let's start with the characters. Instead of one young damsel in distress we get three the single hot mom with two daughters a blossoming yet brainless teenager and a cute yet simultaneously creepy little girl that you just know is going to have 'special' skills including supernatural knowledge and the ability to communicate with the dead. The little girl is the same one that was in the remake of The Amityville Horror. She was a little annoying but not nearly as irritating Dakota Fanning.Overall these characters seemed like escapees from a LifeTime movie. I thought perhaps horror movies had moved on from scenes where the female characters go to bed in full makeup and run around in the dark announcing their presence to anyone with ears but not this one. I also find it inconceivable that none of them could be bothered to secure the front door from arbitrarily opening day and night. To give you an idea about how uninvolved I was with these characters I spent most of my time thinking about how cold it must have been on the set because everyone was in a coat even in their houses and how white their teeth were.Despite all the formulaic plot machinations the film does not build any suspense at all except to wonder when it will be over. There is more atmosphere at the local Giant in the middle of the most mundane of weekday afternoons. As for the dialogue I could have sampled quotes from ten other films and cobbled together better more believable discourse. The gore level the eye candy for a horror fan was minimal at best. Without their tiny weapons the 'zombies' were not menacing at all. You could probably drop kick a couple of them across the room.What really kills it is its banality. Horror films more than any other genre cannot survive uninspired mediocrity. Give me a horror movie that is comically inept or outrageously over the top with gore. I can even take the new ones with their cringe inducing torture. Every once in a while I'd appreciate a truly frightening one anything but this.".

Creeeepy! She doesn't believe them but her lil sis befriends some little ghost girl named Mary so maybe it's true after all? Hell yeah the legends are true which she finds out while necking with the buddy of some guy who sexually harassed her the day before. And boy these little tykes are PO'ed! The attack scenes are really gross and funny and the faces on the child actors are priceless. Apparently the kids are after one person in particular but kill other people too just for hahas. Who wouldn't? And Mary isn't a threat to the daughters because apparently she's their greataunt or something. Stupid movie but amusing enough to warrant a rental.

Wicked Little Things provides great entertainment and mostly did not have many major flaws at all other than like I said being mediocre because of production value. This is definitely worth a look because you will not be disappointed with the outcome regardless of what other comments may have you believe and if you know what you are looking for and getting into. Wicked Little Things is one of the best 1st Annual Afterdark Horrorfest films and compared to a lot of other films in the 8 Films to Die For series this is one of the best overall.

I went into this film with little to no expectations after learning that the director was responsible for the awful vampire flick The Forsaken. and I left pleasantly surprised. The film stars Lori heuring of In Crowd fame as a young mother whose husband has just passed. She moves into an old family home in the mountains with her two daughters next to a mine that is a gravesite to overworked children back in the day. Unlucky for them the children return with a vengeance killing and eating everyone in their path. The film works on many levels. It's well done suspenseful it has spots of good cinematography and capable performances by Compton especially. The atmosphere is spooky yet slightly underwhelming the score is decent and the makeup effects are gruesome and simplistic. The film keeps up a creepy and unsettling tone and the kids themselves with pale skin torn up lips and hollow eyes are pretty scary and unrelenting. The film is original and inventive without being to artsy or complicated. I can't see this film making it into a wide release without some trimming and slight fine tuning. But they definitely have a good product on there hands and should pursue some type of theatrical distribution. However the theatre in which i saw it in was horrible. The sound was dreadfully messed up which i felt took away from the film majorly and it stopped in the middle because they couldn't center it on the screen which killed the mood a bit. All in all though it was the most satisfying of horrorfests entries maybe because it had the least expectations but nonetheless was a welcome addition to genre films.".

A windows with her two girls goes to the house near the mine and you know the rest of it.Dialogues are weak actors are so so no fx at all poor characterization and just a little tension all along the movie none really scary moment and a dull ending.If you're looking for a light terror movies for watching in a lazy Wednesday night or with friends just for fun of watching a terror movie with your buddies this is the right choice.";

Great performances all around. Great score. Awesome photography. Story to die for. Touching family issues blended with shocking images. There hasn't been many horror films over the years where the killers are children and these kids are bloody killers. But they still make you feel for them while repulsing you at the same time. That's a very hard trick to pull off. I haven't seen a film like this in a long time. Sad that it probably won't be widely released in theaters but don't miss it on DVD.".

	schema:headline " Immensely boring garbage that will keep you asking Will it ever end?!";
	schema:reviewBody "All I could think while watching this movie was Will it ever end?! It was unbearably boring to watch. I was wishing I could just turn it off but I wanted to do this review justice so I fought the good fight and withstood the torture of watching this movie all the way through so that you the good reader need not bear that pain also.This movie sounds like it has a great premise if you read the premise on paper. However the actual movie does not deliver on this premise at all.The opening scene features a mineshaft in the early 1900's where they are forcing kids to carry dynamite into the tunnels that aren't big enough for the adults to fit into. This seems to be setting up the premise for an interesting movie. But after 4 minutes it becomes clear that is not the case. The adults who committed these crimes are never punished there is no consequences shown in the movie for their actions. The opening scene is way better than and completely irrelevant to the rest of the movie. The last time an opening scene misrepresented a movie so grievously was the opening scene of 28 Days Later which was the only good scene in that whole movie. Wicked Little ThingsZombies a movie so crappy they changed the title to try to disguise it's crappiness and sell it again is exactly the same in this regard. The opening scene is the only watchable scene in the whole movie.Instead the movie flashes forward to presentday. A single mother and her two bratty foulmouthed kids. Right here is when it would have been wise to press the STOP button and never go near the movie again.In the first hour the zombie kids are barely even seen. They get maybe 3 minutes of screentime total. All they do is kill a pig that's it. The rest of the hour is spent showing the dumb mother and her dumb kids buy things at the local store wander around the forest and have inane conversations with each other. The dumb teenage daughter goes and hangs out with some other idiot teenagers and smokes weed with them.There would be no reason to care at all if the zombie kids dispatched anyone in this movie. Every single character is both dumb  annoying with no redeeming qualities at all. Not to mention onedimensional and clichd.This movie would have been vastly improved if the mother and her dumb kids were dispatched in the first 10 minutes by the zombie kids as they were driving up to their new house then the end credits rolled. That right there would instantly change the score from 110 to 1010. Honestly! When the dumb mother takes her eyes off the road and almost crashes into a pedestrian on the road her daughter scolds her You almost killed us mom! Of course anyone with common sense knows that if the mom had hit the pedestrian it would be the pedestrian who would be dead  not the people safely encased inside the car. I guess this line was put into the movie to show firsthand that the utter stupidity of the main characters knows no bounds and runs in the family.Wicked Little ThingsZombies runs for 1 hour and 34 minutes but it definitely felt like 5 hours or more to me. Trying to not fall asleep was a tremendous challenge. It's not until over an hour has passed into the 1 hour and 34 minutes that the zombie children actually bother to kill any person. Then the scene shows the dumb teenagers drinking beer and making out in a car and saying lines like If you ever wanna get in my pants again you better start the car and get my ass out of here right now. Seriously that's verbatim from the movie. The teenagers are so clichd onedimensional badlyacted dumb  annoying that when the zombie kids finally get around to hacking 3 of them up 1 hour and 5 minutes into the movie it feels like a cause for celebration. Of course the Princess dumb weedsmoking foulmouthed beerdrinking loser daughter of the main mother character gets away scottfree. What a buzzkill that was! She was on the screen longer than the others and hence the most annoying of the 4 of them and most deserving of a pickaxe to the head. All the more reason why she should have been dispatched within the first 10 minutes as aforementioned. To still keep her around past 1 hour and 5 minutes though is totally inexcusable.The reason for this of course is that feature length movies need to be padded to at least 1 hour and 30 minutes. So by keeping her alive longpast when she should be they have an extra 27 minutes to pad the movie with her and her mother running through the woods. By 1 hour and 22 minutes in it's the second time in the movie where the annoying daughter is trapped in a vehicle where the engine won't start whilst the zombie kids are coming to get her.The zombie kids are completely generic. Never say anything. No character development at all for any of them.In the end all 3 of the annoying idiotic main characters live. Which in my opinion is the filmmakers' way of giving a final flipping the bird gesture to the viewing audience. In my opinion the filmmakers surely know that they have bamboozled anyone who has had the great misfortune to watch the whole movie. Why not rub their faces in it by not even giving them the satisfaction of seeing any of the 3 main characters who should have been dispatched within the first 10 minutes die.Avoid Wicked Little ThingsZombies like the Bubonic Plague.".

Slightly creepy freaky vibe to it so definitely a horror movie but not really scary as in keepyouupatnight scaryouforlife type scary. But I thought it was really good though some people might think the ending is sappy I thought it was fitting. Yeah so I definitely enjoyed it but other than the fact that it was kids killing and eating the people I didn't really understand why it was in Horrorfest I mean weren't the movies supposed to not have been released because they were too violent and scary? I didn't think that this movie was terribly disturbing I mean it is slightly graphic at the points when they show the halfeaten bodies and pig carcass and I guess the fact that these were like 10 year old kids and what not eating and mutilating people could make it so they wouldn't want to release it but I didn't understand why they would say it was unreleasable. In my opinion it is a good movie and definitely a horror movie but not terribly scary as I stated before and not amazingly graphic and disgusting which is one of the reasons I liked the movie because it was not excessively graphic and violent. I also really liked the forest scenes and the way the kids have no eyes I think that was cool. Also I really liked the fact the child miner zombie characters. They weren't corny looking they looked really really amazing in my opinion. I don't know why I thought that. But yeah my favorite part of the movie was actually was when the mother and here older daughter come out of the mine and look behind and see the one little girl and then the camera zooms out and you see that all of the kids are standing there. Anyways enough about how cool the kids looked right? I really liked the feel of the movie it was scary when you were watching it and not completely predictable but it wasn't excessively gory and it wasn't a total letdown when you see the zombies they actually look decent unlike some movies. Also the acting wasn't horrible like in some movies where no matter how cool you thought the story was the acting ends up being so bad that you can't stand to watch the movie. That seems to be the case in a lot of horror movies especially so kudos for that.That's about all I have to say sorry if anyone who reads this is bored to death by my rambling.".

It's really kind of sad. The film can't stand on it's own merits. I think too many people will view this film on the strength of the title and it does not come close to that level of comedy. Other than the title there is very little connecting the movie to the original 'Christmas Vacation' and even less of a connection to Christmas at all. The comedy is very simplistic and the plot poor. Children might find some humor here but most adults would only get a chuckle here and there. This movie is a flop. Don't waste your time with it.".

Randy Quaid is fine as Cousin Eddie but is better in a supporting role than the lead. Dana Barron sets history as the first actor to reprise her role as one of the Griswold kids. She is just as pretty but it doesn't help a thin script. Why was this movie even made? It was probably because NBC recently picked up another few years of presenting Xmas Vacation. There is nothing wrong with the acting. It's all in the script. It's just not that funny. People need to think before they write stuff like this. It is one Christmas movie I do not recommend.".

So it was her cousin eddie and his wife and the grandfather played by Ed Asner. All these characters were morally depraved and just disgusting all together. The story was rediculous and not the least bit funny but really sad.They did the same thing to such greats as Jaws Crocodile Dundee Superman and so many others.

There is not one redeeming quality in this movie...and I say that as a full fan of the Vacation Series of movies.  I LOVED the Cousin Eddie character from the other Vacation movies...but he only works well as a supporting character. Do I blame Randy Quaid for the failure of this movie?  Not at all.  I think he's a great actor...but this film lacks any cohesion...the pacing is off...it's just plain unfunny.  And the actor who plays the Third...Jake Thomas...was just  awful more than likely due to a real lack of direction.

There is not one redeeming quality in this movie...and I say that as a full fan of the Vacation Series of movies.  I LOVED the Cousin Eddie character from the other Vacation movies...but he only works well as a supporting character. Do I blame Randy Quaid for the failure of this movie?  Not at all.  I think he's a great actor...but this film lacks any cohesion...the pacing is off...it's just plain unfunny.  And the actor who plays the Third...Jake Thomas...was just  awful more than likely due to a real lack of direction.

	schema:reviewBody "Eddie has had about half a dozen jobs since the foreclosure of his farm. His latest in nuclear research is in jeopardy because Roy the Chimp seems to be smarter than he is and there is only enough funding for one of the two positions.  Christmas is looking pretty bleak. Already Eddie and his wife and only one of his four childrenClark Griswold III Johnson named for a favorite relativehave moved in with Cousin Audrey who has had yet another disastrous relationship.But on Eddie's last day at the workplace an unfortunate incident leads his company to offer him and his family a free vacation to a South Pacific island where the company has an officeso Eddie won't sue.  Eddie is not smart enough to realize he should sue and he won't listen to his son who is.  At the last minute Uncle Nick shows up wearing part of a Santa suit because his wife may be cheating on him so he joins the group.The trip leads to one laugh after another.  Once they arrive the family is greeted by Muka Kaka Miki a beautiful island woman who works for Eddie's former company.  She and the group are scheduled to take a tour of the islands but the skipper of the boat should I have said skipper? cannot make it.  Nick who has experience in the navy thinks he can run the boat... Anyone who enjoyed Gilligan's Island should appreciate what happens next. In fact one would have to have enjoyed Gilligan's Island in order to like this movie. The first half of the movie was enjoyable but not all that great.  Later the family realizes that the usual traditions of Christmas are not as important as being with loved ones and between that realization and the comic adventures the second half made the movie work.I liked Randy Quaid as Eddie but I wouldn't exactly call it good acting. Ed Asner was good as Nick but no Lou Grant.  The younger women looked good wearing next to nothing. Jake Thomas was good too as Clark III.  But Eric Idle was the standout performer as the poor passenger on the plane who has the bad luck of being the victim of Eddie's tendency to mess things up.  I was so disappointed we didn't get to see more of him. Also two performers we didn't see who may have been the same guy were also quite funny.  The first was the recorded voice on the very annoying answering machine at the plumber's office which announced various menu options that didn't help with the disaster the family was experiencing along with very enthusiastic holiday greetings.  The plumbing incident was a highlight early in the movie.  The second was an air traffic controller who started out very calm positive and reassuring but later became very nervous I won't say why.This was a pretty good movie overall.".

Feeling down about how hopeless he is Eddie is cheered up when the company offer his family and all expenses paid trip to Hawaii. So off they go uncle Nick and Audrey too for their dream Christmas Vacation. Obviously disaster is never too far away.This movie is basically pointless. The first was about Clark Griswald wishing to give his family the best Xmas ever. This 'un is just an excuse for a string of bad jokes with terrible comic timing. In this regard it's kinda similar to Vegas Vacation the wit and sentiment of John Hughes is sorely missed.Quaid does his best but there is a lot of not funniness to it. He deserves better material Matty Simmons may have produced all the other Vacation movies but he hasn't a clue how to write a good script. Christmas Vacation 2 is to the original what Home Alone 4 was to Home Alone.Plus I have a few questions which I am sure a lot of other people will be asking. Why does Audrey's plumbing go mental? Why do Eddie's clothes stay impossibly white for the entire film? Why is there an elephant on the island?Plus there isn't that much of an Xmas feel to it. Sure the scenes in Chicago and quaint and snowy but a Hawaiian Island is hardly the best setting for a festive movie. However Eddie does whistle and hum enough Xmas tunes to make up for it. But where the hell is the wonderful Christmas Vacation song?Buy if you're a fan of the first. Rent if you're only curious. It's nice to see a great character such as Cousin Eddie given the center spotlight but I just wish he was given funnier stuff to do.The DVD is in above average 1.851 anamorphic widescreen with okay Dolby 2.0 surround that is mainly used for general ambiance but still sounds fine whenever required. A handful of trailers a brief featurette and a commentary make up the extras.".

Eddie and family take a little boat trip and end up marooned ala Gilligan style on a deserted isle. The rest of the movie is 'Eddie the loser' transforming into 'Eddie the normal guy' and winning the respect of his family.Unless you're a hardcore Cousin Eddie fan give this one a pass and watch him in one of the Vacation movies.

His niche is that of the wacky relative who performs zany anticsalongside Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase was needed in this film for it to be a success and he definitely was not there. As far as I am concerned a movie is not a Vacation movie unless good ole' Clark Griswold is at the helm.".

Why do they bother at all? The first Christmas Vacation with Chevy Chase was brilliant and hilarious. This is not. They rely on jokes concerning a dog with flatulence and a character called Uncle Nick who is about 80 and keeps trying to get his way with beautiful women. When they approach the island on the boat the island in the background just looks so fake and Randy Quaid although funny in the previous film just overacts and seems like he's trying too hard to be funny.

How come Snots still looks the same after all those years and everyone else in the original looks 14 years older. After 15 minutes of watching this movie I don't believe I had even laughed yet. The island thing just didn't work. If it wasn't for the good looking South Pacific female guide on the island the movie would have been a total loss.

Then they came for the Catholics and I didn't speak up because I was a Protestant. Then they came for me and by that time there was no one left to speak up for me.Attributed to Rev. Martin Niemoller 1945When faced with intolerance or injustice the easiest thing to do is nothing  speak up and you risk becoming an object of scorn.  But when does enough become too much?  Global antiSemitic sentiments allowed Hitler's genocidal policies to thrive and equal doses of fearmongering and ignorance made it possible for the antiCommunist purges of McCarthyism to destroy thousands of peoples' lives.  Inaction makes one no less culpable.Lawrence Newman is a chameleon of a man quiet and nondescript he blends seamlessly with his surroundings.   Lawrence doesn't like to get involved  when he witnesses an attack on a young woman he tells no one and goes about his business.  His world spirals into chaos when he buys a pair of glasses and is mistaken for one of them. Lawrence's view of the world and its view of him is forever altered. While the subject matter of this film is not new its presentation is definitely unique.  It is much easier to understand the irrational nature of prejudice when placed within a certain context  Lawrence is more concerned with the assumptions that he is Jewish than he is with the views of his attackers.  He believes that if he corrects this oversight that everything will be all right not realizing that logic and prejudice never go hand in hand.  Whether playing a schemer the only thing I liked about Fargo or a down home nice guy sheriff William H. Macy's roles are linked by a common thread his characters share a subtle deliberate countenance that gives them substance.   Macy nails Lawrence down to the smallest detail and says more with a furtive glance or tremble in his voice than a page of dialogue.  By showing rather than telling Lawrence is able to share his fear and bewilderment with the viewer.  The supporting cast brings the story together.Laura Dern is compelling as Gerty Lawrence's bombshell wife with a past. Trailer park rough yet other worldly wise she has also felt the wrath of prejudice as the result of a mistake and unwittingly exacerbates Lawrence's situation.  Michael Lee Aday aka Meatloaf is frightening as Fred the prototypical redneck next door equal parts ignorance and venom rallying neighbours to his virulent cause.   In the midst of the chaos is Finklestein David Paymer the focus of the aggression and the voice of reason that raises the important questions.  Paymer's even handed portrayal keeps Finklestein from becoming a stereotype or someone whose sole purpose is to engender sympathy making his one of the strongest performances in the film.The tight editing and closecropped cinematography make for a clean picture with few distractions and mixes an air of claustrophobia in with the small town USA feel  it is simultaneously comforting and disturbing. The deliberate use of harsh twotone lighting to accentuate the malevolent aspects of the piece and the carefully scored soundtrack are powerful without being overwhelming.   Finally the set and costume designs recreate the feel of the era an essential component in the film's message.Focus' unconventional approach in dealing with prejudice is reason enough to recommend this film.  Just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.".

For me it is his Death of a Salesman for which I did a lengthy report as a college assignment in the mid60s. I had never heard of Focus and it is a movie that few have seen.

His Americanism is questioned his garbage is overturned is forced to quit his job he gets thrown out of a union rally when he fails to stand up and clap he and his wife get roughed up by thugs on the street at night. The film is an examination of our tolerance for prejudicial treatment of others then our own reaction towards such treatment.The critic Ebert has a fine and complete review. William Macy David Paymer Laura Dern and Meat Loaf Aday are all fine in their roles. A worthwhile 106 minutes of thoughtprovoking entertainment. The DVD which was a free loan from my local library has a sharp picture and good use of DD 5.1 sound. There is a very interesting extra which includes Arthur Miller discussing his book and the movie.".

	schema:headline " American AntiSemitism Confronted in Focus";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1947 two films Crossfire and Gentlemen's Agreement opened a queasy Hollywood's examination of antiSemitism in our society. Gentlemen's Agreement dealt with religious bigotry at the level of high or at least upper middleclass America while Crossfire exposed the brutal violence that always accompanies irrational hatred and bias. Both films made and continue to make an impression.Overall Hollywood has left antiSemitism in the U.S. pretty much alone. That many Jews have found success at both ends of the movie camera is wellknown. That some of those Jews many with Anglicized names particularly feared the sting of the anticommunist fervor of the HUAC and Mc Carthy era is a still disturbing and lasting legacy of a difficult time in our history. The controversy several years ago about the special Oscar for Elia Kazan brought the issue to the attention of millions ignorant of the heyday of Hollywood's involvement with the anticommunist campaign. Kazan incidentally directed Gentlemen's Agreement.Focus which is showing in remarkably few theaters only two in Manhattan and I wouldn't bet on a long run both exaggerates and encapsulates a strain of antiSemitism in New York City during the Second World War that even today few who recall it say much about its pervasiveness.The War Department was discomfited to learn through surveys that a surprising minority of servicemen thought the war was being fought for Jewish interests or that actually it had been caused by Jews. These beliefs possibly spawned by the virulent rhetoric of Father Coughlin the near treasonous utterances of Charles Lindbergh and the organized proNazi rallies of the Bund the U.S. arm of the Nazi Party were more widespread than most accounts of the war recognize let alone explore.Focus takes place in a Brooklyn neighborhood of seeming homogeneity marred only by the presence of Finkelstein the candy store proprietor on the corner. To insure that the audience understands the depth of the community's fear of Jews quick shots of his unmistakably frum Orthodox relatives from the Lower East Side are presented several times.The cohort of organized thugs who harass both the nerdywithglassesmistakenasaJew guy William H. Macy and his glamorousinafortiesway also mistaken as Jewish bride Laura Dern didn't exist in New York City. Antisemitic assaults occurred but they were sporadic and involved local youths not followers of a priest who in the film is the spitting image of Father Coughlin back from hell.What is so chilling is that the married couple's abhorrence of the growing and organized antiSemitic harassment is not matched by any introspection as to the baseness of their own feelings about Jews. Both Mr. Macy and Ms. Dern are extraordinary as actors in a small local drama that recasts their lives without perhaps causing them to reshape their own bigoted views. Or do they change?This is a moving drama that invites exploration of part of the reality of World War II on the Home Front not covered in the continuing outpouring of Greatest Generation memoirs. When available for rental or purchase it should secure the much wider audience it deserves.".

For me this is the crucial message  it doesn't matter what Lawrence and his wife do from this point onwards  they are marked and have chance to save themselves by using reason.  Animal aggression and anger have blinded Fred's Union thugs to reality.A friend of mine suggested I should see The Wave to study how irrational hatred and evil ideology can take over people without them realising it.  I once conducted an experiment in a roleplaying game and was shocked to see how normal and levelheaded people welcomed the creation of an oppressive police state  which would ultimate threaten them all  because it crept in in stages.Fred is the start his LA friends and preacher idol are the catalyst which pushes his neighbours over the edge into violence without stopping to think that what they are doing in wrong.The relationship between Lawrence and Finkelstein the Jewish shopkeeper is a fascinating one because Lawrence misses the point almost until the end if the bigots force Finkelstein out where is he to go?  If his family have fled the Nazis what an irony to be tormented again in the land of freedom.That big poster it's a fairly famous propaganda piece about American families enjoying the highest standard of living in the world is a very important detail.  When you see this film watch for the grafitti on the subway train and all the little posters.  The message lurks there too.This movie should be on the curriculum of every school especially in our time when baseless hatred is being promoted so widely by reasonable people who are just extremists in thin disguises.".

Macy does his best but as an earlier poster commented Miller's little parable asks us to suspend disbelief too often. Perhaps the novel gives us a bit more background on Newman so we can understand how someone who is obviously not without intelligence could be so dense in perceiving the attitudes of those around him. I agree with another reviewer that if one is unaware of how bigoted average citizens were in America during this time period then this movie might be an eyeopener. I grew up in the fifties and the good pastors of my Lutheran church found nothing wrong with having the church picnic at a commercial beach whose sign prominently indicated that no Jews or blacks would be admitted. It is difficult for young people today to understand that this was the norm and not just in the South. As late as 1964 when I graduated from a somewhat racially integrated but sexually segregated public high school in Baltimore my black classmates could not attend the traditional father and son banquet as it was held at a facility which did not admit blacks. Sadly it was an establishment owned by a Jewish family. The subject matter of Focus is important and we should never forget despite the lingering signs of racism in modern America how truly repulsive the attitudes of that previous generation were.The greatest generation indeed. So perhaps this film is somewhat valuable in countering the recent wave of sentimental crap about the forties from the likes of Steven Spielberg and Tom Brokow. But in the end as in Far From Heaven the filmmakers' good intentions are undermined by having a protagonist so ridiculously oblivious to the social conventions of their time.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first reviewer is right  In this movie we see ourselves snuggling up to the majority being agreeable trying to stay out of trouble just trying to live our lives and we see how easily these very human traits so fundamental to the functioning of society can lead us to become complicit in a great evil.The story is set during World War II with the radio newspapers and movies reminding us of Hitler's attacks on Jews to underscore the irony of the same kind of violent antisemitism taking place in America. At times that seemed a little heavyhanded to me.It feels more like a play than a movie but it's so thoughtprovoking that such quibbles mean little. Perhaps less trivial is the fact that the entire plot hinges one one little fact that struck me as rather implausible. Larry has lived an uneventful life until middle age yet all it takes is his beginning to wear a pair of spectacles for everyone  EVERYONE  to at the first glance take him for a Jew. I willingly suspended disbelief because the plot kept me moving forward but the implausibility did bother me throughout the film. And quite frankly I didn't understand why his wife was also taken for a Jew. Larry seemed to think so because her name was Hart. And later when he married her I don't know why his neighbours assumed she was Jewish. For the first part of the film I wondered if there were going to be elements of fantasy. Larry's unassumingness seemed exaggerated almost to the point of the grotesque. Why not call the police on seeing the rape even if the attacker was a neighbour? And I thought the lighting seemed to suggest something slightly unreal  the red of the houses seemed too red Gertrude's entrance seemed deliberately overlit generally the colours were almost crayonlike in their intensity.In the credits I see that it was filmed on Campbell Avenue and Wallace Avenue in Toronto so I plan to drive down there near Bloor  Dufferin today to check out the colours. Really  It was good to be reminded that the clergy at that time were often leading the evil of racism. Remember how the pope refused to speak out against Hitler seeking only to get protection for the Church?

	onyx:emotionText "The first reviewer is right  In this movie we see ourselves snuggling up to the majority being agreeable trying to stay out of trouble just trying to live our lives and we see how easily these very human traits so fundamental to the functioning of society can lead us to become complicit in a great evil.The story is set during World War II with the radio newspapers and movies reminding us of Hitler's attacks on Jews to underscore the irony of the same kind of violent antisemitism taking place in America. At times that seemed a little heavyhanded to me.It feels more like a play than a movie but it's so thoughtprovoking that such quibbles mean little. Perhaps less trivial is the fact that the entire plot hinges one one little fact that struck me as rather implausible. Larry has lived an uneventful life until middle age yet all it takes is his beginning to wear a pair of spectacles for everyone  EVERYONE  to at the first glance take him for a Jew. I willingly suspended disbelief because the plot kept me moving forward but the implausibility did bother me throughout the film. And quite frankly I didn't understand why his wife was also taken for a Jew. Larry seemed to think so because her name was Hart. And later when he married her I don't know why his neighbours assumed she was Jewish. For the first part of the film I wondered if there were going to be elements of fantasy. Larry's unassumingness seemed exaggerated almost to the point of the grotesque. Why not call the police on seeing the rape even if the attacker was a neighbour? And I thought the lighting seemed to suggest something slightly unreal  the red of the houses seemed too red Gertrude's entrance seemed deliberately overlit generally the colours were almost crayonlike in their intensity.In the credits I see that it was filmed on Campbell Avenue and Wallace Avenue in Toronto so I plan to drive down there near Bloor  Dufferin today to check out the colours. Really  It was good to be reminded that the clergy at that time were often leading the evil of racism. Remember how the pope refused to speak out against Hitler seeking only to get protection for the Church? It was the same pope by the way who when Rome was about to be liberated by American troops requested that the first soldiers to enter the city not be black. Check your history. I don't recall ever hearing of this movie before. That's a shame. It certainly is of great interest to every thinking person to everyone interested in American history or racism it's one of the clearest illustrations I've ever seen of Bertrand Russell's dictum Do not go with a crowd to do evil.";

It's by no means the message against prejudice and injustice alone that makes this movie worth watching it's particularly the way the movie shows Newmans reactions to them. At first he is furious he can't believe what's happening to him when he loses his job. Then he tries to ignore the signs acting oblivious to the way people react to his appearance. He even tries to join the same group of men that is harassing him in a desperate attempt to turn the tide. All this guy wants is to live an easy life he doesn't want to be a part of what's happening to him but eventually he realises he can't keep his eyes shut an he has to act.

	schema:reviewBody "Everyone I told about this show especially females was most skeptical of its quality to say the least but quality is one thing Cleopatra 2525 had in surplus.  After watching an episode or two however they began to see that this was much more than simple eye candy for men this show had depth. Women are shown to be intelligent powerful and excellent leaders in this show more than any SciFi series at the time. This show should be seen by all women for its pure selfesteem boosting qualities my wife loves Sarge girl power is in full force here apologies for the clich. Many people that thought the show was silly or degrading to women probably only saw the commercials for it or a few minutes of the actual show if even that and never gave it a chance. The show had a pure SciFi storyline which never drifted into the paranormal i.e. always had a science explanation without ghosts esp god etc. which was a breath of fresh air in the midst of the many idiotic shows of the time that turned to the Paranormal to explain their plot devices.  As an example when someone was out of phaseinvisible and could walk through walls the writers went to great lengths to explain why they didn't fall through the floor to the center of the earth ever hear another SciFi or Paranormal show even try to explain that.  All the villains had motives known or unknown and were never presented as simply evil'.  This show had great storylines characters with depth unique and creative set designs gadgets and special effects to die for.  The means of transportation was a blast to witness shaft travel as well.  The actresses were not just extremely attractive but extremely talented as well.  This was the ONLY show I made a point to record when I would be elsewhere and I can proudly say I never missed an episode.  My wife loves the show as well although she can't stand the theme song and tries to make me mute it. The series unfolded in a way I have not seen since Babylon 5 another great show but a bit on the Paranormal side of SciFi another of my favorites.

I can't help but wonder that if the PR for the show emphasized the SciFi qualities more than the attractive women and attractive though they are they might not have given so many the misguided ideas that probably led to the changes in time slots and ultimately cancellation.

	onyx:emotionText "Everyone I told about this show especially females was most skeptical of its quality to say the least but quality is one thing Cleopatra 2525 had in surplus.  After watching an episode or two however they began to see that this was much more than simple eye candy for men this show had depth. Women are shown to be intelligent powerful and excellent leaders in this show more than any SciFi series at the time. This show should be seen by all women for its pure selfesteem boosting qualities my wife loves Sarge girl power is in full force here apologies for the clich. Many people that thought the show was silly or degrading to women probably only saw the commercials for it or a few minutes of the actual show if even that and never gave it a chance. The show had a pure SciFi storyline which never drifted into the paranormal i.e. always had a science explanation without ghosts esp god etc. which was a breath of fresh air in the midst of the many idiotic shows of the time that turned to the Paranormal to explain their plot devices.  As an example when someone was out of phaseinvisible and could walk through walls the writers went to great lengths to explain why they didn't fall through the floor to the center of the earth ever hear another SciFi or Paranormal show even try to explain that.  All the villains had motives known or unknown and were never presented as simply evil'.  This show had great storylines characters with depth unique and creative set designs gadgets and special effects to die for.  The means of transportation was a blast to witness shaft travel as well.  The actresses were not just extremely attractive but extremely talented as well.  This was the ONLY show I made a point to record when I would be elsewhere and I can proudly say I never missed an episode.  My wife loves the show as well although she can't stand the theme song and tries to make me mute it. The series unfolded in a way I have not seen since Babylon 5 another great show but a bit on the Paranormal side of SciFi another of my favorites. The entire series was building up to a spectacular revelation but was cancelled for reasons unknown after constantly being moved to increasingly inconvenient time slots that is. I can't help but wonder that if the PR for the show emphasized the SciFi qualities more than the attractive women and attractive though they are they might not have given so many the misguided ideas that probably led to the changes in time slots and ultimately cancellation.

	schema:reviewBody "In 2000 with Hercules and Xena winding down two new shows were created in an attempt to fill the void. One was the Bruce Campbell vehicle Jack of all Trades the other was Cleopatra 2525. The shows didn't attract the viewers that their predecessors had and were cancelled after the first and second seasons respectively.  I had never paid much attention to syndicated television shows. To me they had always been dumb late night entertainment something to watch when there's nothing to do but you're not tired enough to go to bed yet. Then one day while flipping through one dull show after another I landed on Cleopatra 2525. I was hooked.  But why? I was above this mindless entertainment wasn't I? What led me enjoy a series by the same people who spawned Hercules and Xena?  First of all to be honest the fact that the show revolved around women in formfitting suits didn't hurt initially. Secondly the show was basically Science Fiction a genre I love as opposed to Fantasy which I'm less receptive to. In addition I found that the very reasons I had avoided such shows might have been one of their greatest qualities. The fact that they're not taken seriously allows them to slip many things in undertheradar' and most don't pick up on it because the figure it's just brain dead entertainment.However I didn't find it at brain dead all.  There were here and there some wonderful and surprisingly original SciFi elements and even believe it or not some good stories.  Many of Cleo's writers have impressive resumes and have worked shows such as Buffy' The Outer Limits' The Pretender' and Enterprise'. Remarkably well assembled for a syndicated show I believe it had underlying themes and allusions that many failed to recognise. This is largely because they as I had in the past looked at these shows only superficially not bothering to entertain the possibility that there was more going on.The basic premise of the show is very interesting. Consider the fact that all three of the leading characters are women.  Their unseen guide voice' is in fact that of a female. Mauser the one male in our group of heroes seldom leaves the base of operations and attends to many of the housekeeping' duties such as repairing equipment etc. Another interesting note on Mauser is that he was formerly a Betrayer a being who aids in the enslavement of the humans.  Hel's personal archnemesis Creegan is also a male.  There are some intriguing implications made here and one can draw their own conclusions upon watching the show.  Needless to say the show examines gender roles and stereotypes. All this serves as an example of the elements of the show that slip by unnoticed by those who fail to examine the show beyond its surface. Cleo. 25 is very much a typical syndicated show superficially.  Women in form fitting clothing incessant comedic relief and action strung along on a shoestring budget.  Deceptively under this lies some interesting concepts and enjoyable characters.  The show does have it's fans and you can running into them online is always a pleasure.   Perhaps by some strange twist of fate we'll encounter Cleopatra 2525 again one day.".

	onyx:emotionText "In 2000 with Hercules and Xena winding down two new shows were created in an attempt to fill the void. One was the Bruce Campbell vehicle Jack of all Trades the other was Cleopatra 2525. The shows didn't attract the viewers that their predecessors had and were cancelled after the first and second seasons respectively.  I had never paid much attention to syndicated television shows. To me they had always been dumb late night entertainment something to watch when there's nothing to do but you're not tired enough to go to bed yet. Then one day while flipping through one dull show after another I landed on Cleopatra 2525. I was hooked.  But why? I was above this mindless entertainment wasn't I? What led me enjoy a series by the same people who spawned Hercules and Xena?  First of all to be honest the fact that the show revolved around women in formfitting suits didn't hurt initially. Secondly the show was basically Science Fiction a genre I love as opposed to Fantasy which I'm less receptive to. In addition I found that the very reasons I had avoided such shows might have been one of their greatest qualities. The fact that they're not taken seriously allows them to slip many things in undertheradar' and most don't pick up on it because the figure it's just brain dead entertainment.However I didn't find it at brain dead all.  There were here and there some wonderful and surprisingly original SciFi elements and even believe it or not some good stories.

	schema:reviewBody "Most likely Cleopatra 2525 will be of little interest if you did not watch the series when it was broadcast and I don't think that many people did. But if you are still somewhat intrigued it is a Buck Rogers in the 25th Century premise without space ships and with no budget for wardrobe or production design. In this case the Buck Rogers part Cleopatra is played by Jennifer Sky. Which one might expect to be a good thing as Jennifer is very beautiful and quite talented and has a nice comedic touch. But a quick glance at the promotional material will show that she is somewhat the worse for having a bad haircut and a Salvation Army Thrift Store wardrobe. If you remember how fetching Jennifer was during her time on Xena her dowdy Cleopatra look will be a huge disappointment. With a target audience of teenage boys looking to burn their eyeballs looking at hot fetishattired girls it is not a good idea to skimp on the exploitation value of your heroine or her costume. And they wonder why some series don't attract much of an audience. Love it or hate it Buck Rogers had hotter costumes and much better looking guest stars. The other two exploitation elements are Cleopatra's two female associates Hel Gina Torres basically playing her stock Firefly character and Sarge Victoria Prattanother Xena connectionan extremely wooden version of Natasha Henstridge. Torres does a good job playing off the Cleopatra character providing most of the show's comic relief. Torres sings the theme song a somewhat lame parody of Rick Evans' In the Year 2525 Exordium and Terminus 1969. You remember the one that opens with the words In the year 2525 If man is still alive If woman can survive They may find...I suspect that they gave the series its title so that they could butcher this catchy little song although who knows perhaps the title is a homage to Buck Rogers and they thought of using the song later. So the premise of the show is that the Earth's surface has been taken over by aliens called Bailies not the WKRP one and the humans have been driven underground. Our three heroines fight against the Bailies under the direction of a disembodied presumably female voice appropriately referred to as Voice. Unlike Buck Rogers Cleopatra is kind of a wimpy third stooge still dazed and confused from her cryogenic sleep or maybe just disoriented from the creepy haircut. There are a lot of nice closeups of Sky wideeyed and bewildered. Like Buck Rogers the running gag is Cleopatra using a common 21st century expression and everyone finding it either totally profound or completely baffling. Unlike Firefly the action is more of that hyper edited Xena garbage which is neither realistic nor particularly entertaining. One good gimmick is that the girls travel around Spiderman fashion a sort of web slinging through tunnels and shafts in the labyrinth of their underground world. Strangely or maybe not considering the budget these are only half hour episodes and except for one twopart show there is not enough time for any subtlety and nuance. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

It dethroned VIP as the dumbest show on television.The show revolves around two women in skimpy outfits in the year 2525 who spend their time fighting evil robots. One day they come across a stripper who went in for a boob job and got cryogenicaly frozen instead. She gets woken up 500 years in the future so it's too late to file a malpractice lawsuit. So she's sort of adopted by these two women to aid in their fight against these evil robots.So what's wrong with this show? Let's see where should I begin? There's the bad acting from the three leading ladies. There's also the cheesy special effects. I could mention the scripts which seem like they were written by the scifi freak in junior high writing class. Despite being the title character Cleopatra does little more than scream and act frightened every time a group of bad guys attack. The show is mercifully short at 30 minutes yet it still seems as long as Barry Lyndon. It also as the dopiest theme song I've ever heard on a TV show. In the year 2525there are women with the will to survive. Yeah. Can you pick your son pick your daughter too from the bottom of a long glass tube?My advice read a book or do something constructive with your 30 minutes until Jack of All Trades comes on.".

It probably helped that I had no idea what to expect.SEA OF DUST starts out like a typical costume drama. We've got a young medical student going to help a doctor whose town is being destroyed by a crazy plague which somehow involves exploding heads. On the way he stops to visit his fianc and gets thrown off the property by her father. Traveling on he finds a girl lying on the road another plague victim and takes her along to the doctor's. Yawn I thought. It all seemed pretty predicable.And then everything went crazy and it suddenly turned into a completely different film. Tom Savini shows up looking like Dracula characters begin traveling to the other side of reality and the dialog gets increasingly humorous.And just when I thought it had settled into a groove the picture changes again becoming really dark and bizarre. I won't spoil it for first time viewers but there's an amazing sequence about hollow people lots of chat about the abuse of religion by society and some overthetop gore effects. And did I mention Stephen Malkmus? This isn't a perfect movie in case you haven't figured that out from its appearance at a BMovie festival but it's well worth the time for adventurous viewers. Great visuals cool soundtrack lots of interesting ideas. The acting is a little zany at times but I think that's the point.Funny I had to go to Breda to see find an American picture that looked like a British horror movie. You figure that one out...".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw SEA OF DUST as part of a NYC screening audience several years ago. I enjoyed the film at that time so I was a little confused by some of the amendments that had been made since. Perhaps it's my memory but there seemed to be chunks of exposition missing from the version that was shown at the Rhode Island Film Festival. I'm really not sure which version I prefer but I can honestly say that I found something to appreciate it both.Let me begin by warning everyone that this is not a popcorn movie. Although it's been promoted as a Hammer Films tribute people expecting a showdown between Van Helsing and Dracula are going to be sorely disappointed. There's some cleavage but no nudity a staple of the British production house's later movies. And while SEA OF DUST is filled with gorgeous eye candy it really is shot like a sixties film and features Hammer starlet Ingrid Pitt it's not like any of the company's pictures in tone or execution. This film is very dark very confusing and at times very funny. I don't remember the earlier version being quite as nutty as this one but that's not a bad thing especially the showdown in the Black Forest that plays like a Three Stooges short. And some of Ms Pitt's rantings are quite entertaining. It's like somebody wound her up and turned her loose.The uniqueness of this film doesn't lie with the borrowed details though. It's in the ideas. As an occasional Sci Fi Channel viewer I've regularly taken the network to task for its onenote variations on a theme CGI monster kills then gets destroyed. SEA OF DUST is so full of ideas that you start to trip over them after a while.But don't get me wrong. I'm not complaining. If anything I applaud these guys for making such an enterprising lowbudget picture and for having the courage to pack it with so many concepts. It's not going to be a picnic for people who hate to think at the movies you know who you are. But for the rest of us those of us who are tired of the formula of modern horror films the predictability the lack of respect for the audience this may just be your ticket.".

The current rating from ALL users is much more accurate.As others point out this is an homage to the Hammer films of fifty years ago. Unfortunately it is an homage only in the camerawork wardrobe settings and subject matter. It is very disappointing to see the majority of the film shot in broad daylight completely missing the beautiful lighting and cinematography that Hammer used to convey a sense of gloom and claustrophobia. I also think it would have been far more effective if shot in BW but then how would you show off Savini's FX? The acting and dialogue are both quite bad. There's no single character who I found to be even minimally authentic or believable. Savini as a weird Draculalike religious figure is waaay out ahead of everybody else in the bad acting department. Simply no contest. Fortunately he's onscreen only for a short time. Unfortunately nobody else is really much better than he is.As for the plot...wait what plot? This movie makes Primer look fairly simple. There are dream sequences or otherworldly sequences whichever you prefer within dream sequences and you never really know what the director's intentions are. The satirical elements are extremely heavyhanded and the entire script strikes me as something that a highschooler would write after he reads his first philosophy of religion book. You can tell because the script uses the word ideology instead of religious belief or faith or any of a number of more accurate and descriptive terms. In other words the characters are implementing an ideology and not just harebrained religious ideas. The whole thing just rings false.Finally let's get to the gore. There's lots of it but it's really pretty poor. Savini has done much better work. I guess he was just distracted. As far as the need for the gore there isn't any. The movie starts out as sort of an explanation of religious belief then devolves into a gorefest that's punctuated by weird ideas of what constitutes a myth.All in all a very poor showing and not worth your time. On top of everything else it is BORING!".

This is the movie he would have made if he'd had the chance.I wish I could tell you exactly what Sea of Dust was about. It pretends to be the story of a doctor who gets sucked into weird goings on in the Black Forest. He goes there to help but ends up being caught between two young women both of whom he seems to have a thing for. But that's just scratching the surface. This is the kind of movie where things just randomly happen...and not nice thing. People are constantly being whipped and stabbed. There's a pair of creepy little girls who appear to have walked out of The Shining. Tom Savini is some kind of imaginary religious figure who decides he doesn't want to be imaginary anymore. He's got a plan to take over the world by sharing Jesus suffering.On some level this is a movie about sex. It's one without nudity which was a disappointment but there's no mistaking the intent. On another whole level it's a stoner's paradise. Unexpected stuff happens so often that it stops being unexpected. By the time the doctor travels through his girlfriend's birth canal to be reborn you'll just chalk it up to the crazy nature of the flick.On the down side the film is pretty wordy. Some of the points are hammered home over and over. If you're watching it with a bunch of stoned friends this might prove an asset.".

Just because you use the framework of dreams or a mental fugue state doesn't make it Lynchian. You need the compelling visuals and creepy performances.Positive things Dr. Maitland had real comic timing and all the girls were very cute. Carla's Father Chalmers and Ingrid Pitt looked like they were having some fun. And Tom Savini at least looked like he had his lines memorized and we couldn't see if he was just reading cue cards.I get the Hammer references but it looks like the director realized the script was a snoozer and just added some shocks to try and get some laughs out of whatever footage he could put together. But they don't work because they're too few and far between and create an inconsistent tone. Condense this to 30 minutes of all the fun parts and you could have a surreal goofy short but at feature length skip it. It's not so bad it's good it's just so bad it's boring.".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched SEA OF DUST at the Rhode Island Horror Film Festival in Providence. It was the Festival's featured film and won Best Picture out of I think a couple hundred entries. The director and a few of the stars answered questions after the showing. One star Suzy Lorraine was even hotter in person than in the film and she was an eye catcher in the movie.This film is independent yet it has a lot of cinematic touches that give it a quality feel. It even has an original classical style musical score.I am a Savini fan and he's the star villain here in black cape he's more of an evil force than a real person I think. He is sucking the souls out of people and using them as soldiers in a twisted attempt to establish his version of the Kingdom of God on Earth. In his view Christ was all about suffering and Savini intends to make everyone suffer.The main story line that holds your interest is about a young doctor Stefan who is sent to investigate the strange events Savini is causing in an isolated town. He proposes to an aristocrat chick on the way but her SOB father tells him to get lost. Then he meets up with a strangely possessed but alluring country girl. I think she falls in love with him but she also tries to kill him as do a number of hot women in the film.I found the scenes shot in the woods to be the creepiest and most eye catching with strange people along the road the evil little twin girls scared the hell out of me.The film has a lot to it too much to list. There is a lot of blood torture and gore. Hot chicks licking blood off of guys' fingers. A terrified girl's head explodes. That was unexpected. Throats get slit. Some brutal stabbings.Then they play it for laughs sometimes poking a bit of fun at the whole evil black forest genre.If you're a fan of Hammer films and Ingrid Pitt it is fascinating to see her in this movie. She offs one of the leads by plunging a cross in his skull. Excellent. The guy who played Multiple Miggs in Silence of the Lambs is great in an axe fight.The movie is surreal and with the ending I'm not sure the events happened or if they were in Stefan's head because of his rejection by his wouldbe fiance. He returns in vengeance and that scene is brutal.The director also talked about the theme of religion being misused to back wars and killings. I can see that for sure Savini's view of religion was scary.This was a strangely exceptional movie with some stars like Savini and Pitt a lot of good supporting cast including hot babes great gore scenes action and all the time you're wondering what the hell is going on and what is going to happen next.This deserves ten stars because it's an excellent independent film effort I don't think it was low budget but it had to be way less than a big studio budget and yet they managed to make something really attractive unique and thought provoking.".

Many beautiful and talented supporting actors seamlessly held the story together and helped to effectively move it along to the climax.Dark Religion and over the top but fun and sometimes very original gore scenes play heavily in this Hammer tribute flick. This stylish movie goes back and forth between flashbacks surreal worlds dreams and the character's reality.Horror and Gore aside This is also a very Funny movie!

He felt it was like the second coming and I felt it was kind of offensive.Like a number of other movies at the Rhode Island Festival it looked like an older movie. Instead of being a black and white silent movie like THE CALL OF CTHULU it looked like a horror movie from the 1960s. It wass very colorful and as much as I hate to admit it it was really beautiful to look at. The music also added to the feel. You don't hear stuff like that anymore.There were some problems with it though. In case my headline didn't tell you it is terribly bloody. A girl's head blows off before you're a minute into the movie and that's just the start. The hero gets stuck in the throat with a hook people have their skulls stabbed with knives and pitchforks and I won't get into some of the other stuff that goes on. My jaw was hanging open for most of the time.The biggest source of our disagreement was that I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't. I couldn't tell if the hero was imagining everything including the people around him or if he was giving in to the evil forces. This was another time when my husband said That's the whole point. I still think it was kind of insane.I might have given this movie a lower score but the cast were so nice during the question and answer session that followed that I couldn't help but like them. They also helped explain some of the religious symbolism that was really bothering me.To be honest I'm not even sure this was a horror movie.

It did focus my attention on some of her recent films that I missed.Let me start by saying that I can understand why this would be an easy film to dislike. It's confusing and unfocused. As other reviewers have pointed out it's brutal in its assessment of organized religion. It's not much more flattering of America's current political circus. I can see how it would offend a lot of Conservatives which may account for the IMDb score in spite of its excellent web reviews.That's not the reason I signed up for IMDb to write this review. I wanted to respond to the insulting notion that the only value Ingrid Pitt could bring to a movie was her nudity. This idea not only insults Ingrid's memory it insults all women. The sad thing is that I've not only read this type of review on IMDb but in professional reviews. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places but I don't see reviewers making fun of Jack Nicholson for getting old and fat and complimenting him for not taking his clothing off. It's pathetic that this can be used as the justification for disliking Ingrid's performance let alone disliking a film she is in.In summary Ingrid was great and the film was much funnier than I was led to believe it would be.".

The sad thing is that I've not only read this type of review on IMDb but in professional reviews. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places but I don't see reviewers making fun of Jack Nicholson for getting old and fat and complimenting him for not taking his clothing off. It's pathetic that this can be used as the justification for disliking Ingrid's performance let alone disliking a film she is in.In summary Ingrid was great and the film was much funnier than I was led to believe it would be.";

Man was I wrong.First the writing apparently came from an eightgrader who barely knew anything about Ed's history and cranked out the script in about 20 minutes. The movie completely passes over the most interesting facets of Ed and his relationship with his mother not to mention what the real police found in his house and decides to focus primarily on the young deputy who looks like he just wandered onto the set. Likewise all of the male characters seem to be adlibbing their dialog throughout the entire movie. I'm not exaggerating.Don't even get me started with the historical goofs in this movie. Seriously who the hell directed this? This movie is supposed to take place around 1957 but the cops are carrying modern sidehandled batons some of the stuff in the hardware store look like they came from Lowes and when the cop gets to a payphone he dials 911 didn't exist back then. Also Ed was a small guy scary like Anthony Perkins' character in Psycho who was supposedly based on reallife Ed not this burly dude who ended up looking way too much like the bad guy in Men In Black.Another thing that really bugged me was the appearance that the makers of this film shot the whole thing in an abandoned 3 building set. Because of the clever camera angles you never see any actual town and the interior of the sets looked like old longabandoned shacks. Pop a cash register on a sawhorse and bam!instant hardware store.I'm usually pretty forgiving of lowbudget horror films but this one just begs for it. All you had to do was include most of the real events even embellish them! pay five good actors instead of 15 crappy ones and for Pete's sake take 5 minutes and think about the time period once in a while. My advice Google Ed Gein you'll be far more entertained.".

	schema:reviewBody "There are many reasons I'm not a fan of fact based films but more than any other is how the filmmakers give themselves creative license over the story. If they have such great imaginations then why not use that talent to make something original? Otherwise stick to the facts. This could have been an okay movie if only they had done just that. Ed Gein was an insanely frightening human being. It's been said if you were to take Michael Myers Jason Voorhees and Leatherface wrap them into one person Ed Gein would still be sickerscarier. So why can't someone make a movie about him that can convey this? When will they figure out that reality is ultimately scarier than fiction? I've read books and watched news programs about him and now I'm not a screenwriter or anything but I believe there's enough documentation on Gein that it shouldn't take a whole lot to write a story about all these atrocities he committed without creating murders that had never even been documented. I'm aware that he was only found guilty of 2 murders but with all the evidence found in his home and barn there should have been plenty of other ways to put this film together rather than using the deputy's relationship with his Mother and girlfriend as filler and far too much of it.I guess what I'm wondering is this... why at the end of the movie did I know more about the supporting characters than I did about Ed Gein? Why didn't we get to know his Mother Father and brother and the relationships between them... what made him the psychopath he was... what abuse he endured as a child that may have contributed to the man he became? Instead the only thing we got of his childhood were flashes of him as a little boy... running.In the end I give it 410 stars. Thats 2 for the gore and 2 for Kane Hodder. Even though it was kind of bad casting in my opinion considering Gein was a smallish man and possibly effeminate and Hodder is anything but small and nowhere near what I would consider feminine. Maybe I was just excited because he was Jason Voorhees.".

If they have such great imaginations then why not use that talent to make something original? Otherwise stick to the facts. This could have been an okay movie if only they had done just that. Ed Gein was an insanely frightening human being. It's been said if you were to take Michael Myers Jason Voorhees and Leatherface wrap them into one person Ed Gein would still be sickerscarier. So why can't someone make a movie about him that can convey this? When will they figure out that reality is ultimately scarier than fiction? I've read books and watched news programs about him and now I'm not a screenwriter or anything but I believe there's enough documentation on Gein that it shouldn't take a whole lot to write a story about all these atrocities he committed without creating murders that had never even been documented. I'm aware that he was only found guilty of 2 murders but with all the evidence found in his home and barn there should have been plenty of other ways to put this film together rather than using the deputy's relationship with his Mother and girlfriend as filler and far too much of it.I guess what I'm wondering is this... why at the end of the movie did I know more about the supporting characters than I did about Ed Gein? Why didn't we get to know his Mother Father and brother and the relationships between them... what made him the psychopath he was... what abuse he endured as a child that may have contributed to the man he became? Instead the only thing we got of his childhood were flashes of him as a little boy... running.In the end I give it 410 stars. Thats 2 for the gore and 2 for Kane Hodder. Even though it was kind of bad casting in my opinion considering Gein was a smallish man and possibly effeminate and Hodder is anything but small and nowhere near what I would consider feminine. Maybe I was just excited because he was Jason Voorhees.";

Ed Gein as portrayed by Kane Hodder is a cartoon sadist. The attempts to show the trauma inflicted on him by his mother are just weak exercises in recycled style. And this movie wanted to be stylish but it even screwed that up. Fortunately there is a better film of this story. 2001's Ed Gein told the story efficiently and offered a few real chills as we watched a sick man not in control of himself. Steve Railsback who played Ed Gein that time was already famous for memorably portraying another famous serial killer Charles Manson. His Ed had pathos. His film is the one to see.

Director Michael Feifer's camera always keeps the actors closed in tight perhaps a sign that he didn't have enough budget to fortify a realistic county. I felt a bit claustrophobic with this style hoping that we could see more of the rural trappings within where Gein moved freely creeping locals who were seemingly unaware that he could be some serial killer kidnapping folks. But the camera only gives you so much so you are forced to look at the faces of the characters up close so the cast had to be up for the challenge. Unlike other users who have commented rather badly about the cast I never found any of the actors unconvincing. I agree that the film's direction geared more towards the deputy's relationship with the sheriff's daughter and his beloved unflappable mother may be a mistake because the title is Ed Gein not Days of the Lives of Plainfield's Deputy out to find Ed Gein. The screenplay and film's execution clearly set up the fact that deputy Bobby Mason'sShawn Hoffmanmother and girlfriend would be targets of Gein. Priscilla Barnes easily has a handle on Bobby's mother Vera making her a concerned and proud parent of her boy. Adrienne Frantz is Erica Bobby's girlfriend a pretty little chick whose doomed to be the final girl who is badly hurt in a car crash when her man drives haphazardly down a dirt road after finding out Vera went missing. The film shows brief glimpses into Ed's psyche with his mother barking orders reaffirming to the viewer that his childhood was a difficult one that has warped this man. We also see Ed in his barn carrying out gruesome deeds on a trapped victim a kind waitress who is tied to a table kept sedated as he removes her limbs. He eventually creates a costume from her flesh. As an Ed Gein film it doesn't hold up I'm afraid. Researching the back story it seems the filmmakers took liberties to craft their own tale of a lurking psycho always seeking fresh victims. This interpretation unlike two previous filmsDeranged  Ed Geinstays away from elaborating what drove Ed to commit his deeds using only images of an angered mother and voices driving him over the edge into rage and sadness. Another major problem is that Ed Gein isn't supposed to look like a scary hulking menace and Hodder's character would be the first suspect in an investigation for missing and dead people. And I'm hardpressed to believe the real Ed Gein could suffocate a caretaker with his arm snap his neck after underpinning his head between two trees before smashing his skull with a log. I think though that Hodder judging from this film could be utilized in slasher films without wearing heavy makeup because he has a sinister presence that can be a real asset if you are wanting an effective psycho. Unlike other films on Ed Gein which infuse bits of twisted black humor this particular tale is completely dark. Ed Gein never seems anything but an imposing figure on the edge of snapping at a moment's notice.".

	schema:reviewBody "Did we really need another movieversion of the life and crimes of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein? No of course we didn't but clever producers realize there's always room for one more especially because all horror movie fans agree that Ed Gein simply is one of the most  perhaps THE most  fascinating sick individuals in history. And the producers of this movie were even extra clever as they managed to cast no less than Kane Hodder in the titular role. Hodder is already a bit of a horror legend on himself depicting Jason Vorhees multiple times in the Friday the 13th series and his name alone is guaranteed to attract even more viewers. I've lost count of how many movies  both fictional and non fictional  there already are closely inspired or loosely inspired by Ed Gein. There are the strictly factual and almost biographical ones like In the Light of the Moon and Deranged Confessions of a Serial Necrophile but of course the most commonly known horror classics simply used little morbid characteristics of Gein's utterly demented persona like Psycho The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Motel Hell House of 1.000 Corpses and The Silence of the Lambs. As you can probably derive from its juicy title as well as from the DVD cover art this particular isn't too concerned with accuracy and merely just sets out to shock and provoke its viewers with a whole lot of gruesome images and perverted insinuations. It feels as if director Michael Feifer wants to make us believe his film version is truthful but repeatedly forgets about the facts in favor of sheer horror movie excitement. Kane Hodder portrays Ed Gein like he was a muscularly shaped and relentlessly unstoppable killing machine whereas in reality he was a scrawny and miserably timid guy whose horrendous psychopathic tendencies only gradually come to the surface after his arrest. Although Gein only ever got charged with two murders he commits nearly a dozen of vile kills here so you know you don't have to check out this film for its informative value. Still I don't want to bash this straighttovideo production entirely because there really are a handful of positive things to say as well. The makeup effects are effectively nauseating and the Californian filming locations were aptly chosen in order to recreate the depressing 50's Wisconsin atmosphere. And in spite of his unfit posture Kane Hodder isn't such a bad choice to depict Ed Gein. He hardly has lines to speak but looks menacing throughout the entire playtime.".

Although Gein only ever got charged with two murders he commits nearly a dozen of vile kills here so you know you don't have to check out this film for its informative value. Still I don't want to bash this straighttovideo production entirely because there really are a handful of positive things to say as well. The makeup effects are effectively nauseating and the Californian filming locations were aptly chosen in order to recreate the depressing 50's Wisconsin atmosphere. And in spite of his unfit posture Kane Hodder isn't such a bad choice to depict Ed Gein. He hardly has lines to speak but looks menacing throughout the entire playtime.";

The rest of the movie is the purest junk although it is moody due to the almost constant lowlight shooting. The story line bears little resemblance to the actual Gein case but I didn't even mind that until the damselindistress finale. Gein was caught redhanded but I doubt he was making off with a pretty young thang very much alive when they finally caught up with him. Talk about beauty and the beast! Badly acted and written but it is nice to know Kane Hodder is still working. Bring back the real Jason Vorhees!".

He is also one of the most sick and disturbing killers of all time I watched a documentary on him so I know his story pretty well. When I saw this I was curious because I thought it was supposed to be like a documentary reenactment but I have to say that this was just a pathetic waste of time. First off the facts are completely wrong with a few minor exceptions and secondly this was just a stupid Hollywood story when these horrific murders really happened and they just made it into a cheap buck. Not to mention that if they were going to make it into a horror movie this was poorly acted! Ed Gein he lives in a small town in Wisconsin called Plainfield but he has a little secret that the whole town is being effected by he digs up dead bodies as well as brutally murdering people. Bobby a deputy is on the case to get Ed Gein only no one knows who the killer is at first just finding crime scene after crime scene. But things get personal when Ed starts messing with the policemen's family and friends.Of course this movie was just ridicules and completely insulting to the true story. I always thought that bad acting is a necessary tool to a horror flick but for this story it should have been a better acted film not to mention it should have been more of a documentary than a stupid clich'd horror film. Please stay away from this film it's completely pathetic and untrue to the story of Ed Gein.110".

You know the funny but oh so sad factor in this movie is Wisconsin isn't as hot as they made it look.This movie is not only an insult to Wisconsin people being a Wisconsite myself but it is a complete insult to a man that was proved to be an insane lonely man. He killed two people and the movie couldn't even get that right. Ed didn't get that close and personal and scare people he shot the two and only people he killed. So why do these movies lie and say BASED ON A TRUE STORY? This is not based on nothing but the lies the director came up with in his foul head.A joke and nothing more!OK I would like to add on to this. I did finish this oh so sad movie and I personal would like to laugh at the director. Do your homework when making a movie. I would like to inform you that there are no Mountains for those who have never been in Wisconsin and oh THERE IS NO DESERT! What the hell there was more pine trees and snow in Ravenous and that was suppose to be shot in Californa. OK for those who know nothing about Ed Gein I would like to give you your history lesson. Ed Gein was thought to have killed his family but it was never proved. He killed a bartender she was shot at bar close when no one was around. He took the DEAD bartender back to his house. 10 years later he SHOT and killed the store clerk he stoled the cash register and the store truck. He was caught because of this murder he came in the day before when her son was there and asked about antifreeze. The day he killed her he was in there buying the antifreeze and the reciept that only had antif..... was the only evidence they had to start a world wide man hunt. He robbed graves in fact in robbed 56 graves. He hate the people he dug up and he made furinture lamp shades couches chairs and other things. He had a family that he had dinner with once and awhile and they threw all the meat he ever gave them out when he was caught considering he was caught at their house. He was arrested and hid in the back of a cop car in fear of what may happen to him. How do I know all of this? I read the book the judge that tried him wrote. After this movie was over after watching the whole horrific thing not only am I offended by the directors horriable view on what Wisconsin women look like. I mean it was hard to tell who this guy had on the slab half the time you know cause Wisconsin women are all BLONDES. Please! I am overly offended by the lack of homework this guy did and the poor job he did making this movie. I have no idea who this Kane guy is and I think he may be OK in something else but he did a horrible job playing Ed Gein. After all of this I am so sad I wasted the 3.99 on the movie. Movie after finished was completely untrue this movie is like me saying that the world is flat and George Washington wasn't our first president. Come on people that is your history and this is Wisconsin's history. To end this rant how would all of you feel if I made a movie and George Washington looked like Brad Pitt some of you may think that is fine but it would be not true and he lived and wasn't the president and whatever.

	schema:reviewBody "I'd already read the reviews and board posts so I went into this movie knowing just two things it had a bad title and Kane Hodder was the main character.Let's do the latter first. Kane Hodder really can act right down to realistic crying with tears. I thought he was especially menacing when doing madwithfrustration. And maybe it's because I'm a Boomer but I do believe Hodder gets hotter by the year and I'm thrilled to see him in this role.Now about that title ... can a movie be renamed? It's a decent movie if you aren't in immediate need of fastaction cuts and headtotoe gore though there is plenty of that. I get that this is in the same universe as Ed Gein but that doesn't make it an Ed Gein movie. It should have been presented as an alternate universe and what if fiction.If you can keep yourself planted in a fiction frame of mind and you like slasher kinda movies then you might want to see this flick.Stars lost due to stupidity in title and false story presentation.".

Kane Hodder really can act right down to realistic crying with tears. I thought he was especially menacing when doing madwithfrustration. And maybe it's because I'm a Boomer but I do believe Hodder gets hotter by the year and I'm thrilled to see him in this role.Now about that title ... can a movie be renamed?

	schema:reviewBody "Inspired by a true story... my hind end. This farce resembled the true story of Ed Gein in only the most remote sense. He was not a hulking maniacal brute as portrayed by Kane Hodder in this film. Coincidentally Mr. Hodder is one of the actors credited with portraying Jason Voorheis in several of the Friday the 13th films. In reality Gein was a mousy little man who barely stood 5' 3 and didn't weigh 135 pounds sopping wet and with a brick in each pocket. This doesn't mean that he wasn't sick and that he didn't kill people but he didn't hold nubile young beauties hostage so that he could torture them. While he did possess a good number of ghastly trophies most of these were acquired by the robbing of graves and not by wanton wholesale butchery.This is a story that could have been told in a compelling fashion without radically transforming Gein into a Jason Voorheis clone. Actor Steve Railsback who also portrays Gein in another movie much more closely resembles the actual murderer.Ed Gein and the acts that he committed where gruesome and horrifying enough without this kind of cheesy flagrant embellishment. It's as if the film makers were saying that the atrocities committed by Gein weren't enough... that they could use with a bit of spicing up. If I could give this miserable excuse for celluloid excrement half a star I would and that would be generous.".

The guy in this movie got mad real easy and when he got mad he LUNGED at people. There was a scene where he went to the graveyard to dig up a body and the night watchman was there. All it took was a couple of lines and Ed got mad and killed him. That did NOT happen in real life. There are a lot of serial killer movies being made these days and quite frankly NONE of them are accurate. Either the makers of the movie are lazy and don't research the real story enough or they are calling themselves spicing up the movie for interest purposes. Whatever the reason they just kill the story by adding a bunch of made up stuff. I think the worst one i've seen to date was the BTK Killer by Uli Lommel. Man talk about a waste of celluloid. That movie was so bad i will deliberately AVOID any Uli Lommel movies in the future.".

Few shows have survived transition from radio to TV to stage show to film but The League of Gentlemen have achieved it with suitable aplomb.The talented writerperformers had initially envisioned a Monty Python style medieval adventure but as soon as writing began they soon realised that the characters they have lived with had become very real and deserved better. With that the Royston Vasey folk realise their very existence is under threat as the writers decide to disregard the fictitious town and work on a 17th Century romp instead.With the exception of Michael Sheen playing much unseen League member Jeremy Dyson The League play pretty unlikeable caricatures of their real life personae as well as the familiar faces of Tubbs I made a little brown fishy nightmare inducing sexual predator Herr Lipp butcher Hilary Briss and an unlikely hero  irate businessman Geoff Tibbs. New faces appear when the third reality appears it's here we are treated to charming and funny cameos from veteran actors and popular TV stars. For many this will be a really enjoyable 90 minutes.'Apocalpse is not going to please everyone though. Working on this level of post modernism has been done a few times before now and may seem all too familiar to audiences raised on irony drenched teen successes kickstarted by the likes of Wes Craven having a New Nightmare. It also takes a lot of confidence in an audience to keep up with a high concept story so there are moments of exposition and dialogue that serve only to confirm what most in the audience already know. Comedy as a genre is formulaic but it's now unheard of for a British film not to fall back on the huge back catalogue of TV stars to fill short amounts of screen time. It's also hard to believe the creators ever wanted their offspring killed off which is perhaps why some of the role reversal doesn't always quite hit the mark. Would Hilary Briss have wanted to try save Royston Vasey in the series?However while the show's deliciously dark vein has almost all but disappeared but is arguably more accessible for it. Much will be said about the character development and efforts to humanise the likes of previously one joke incarnations like Herr Lipp. It is here an impossible level of depth can be found along with a harsh streak of biting satire and throwaway put downs. Sentiment is there with a lump in the throat but not sugar coated thickly enough to intrude on the action. The music is good performances exemplary and the animation is wonderfully seamless a nice throwback to Terry Gilliam and Ray Harryhausen's work. In short there's a lot to like about the Apocalypse. Like so many TV to film transfers it was never going to be easy finding the line between preaching to the converted and introducing the uninitiated to the League's slick and distinct voice. But no matter what your preference is this last trip to the town which 'You'll Never Leave' is oddly lined with hope and ultimately very very touching.".

	schema:reviewBody "After three outstanding BBC television series' and a Christmas special the bizarre and grotesque yet perversely lovable characters of bleak fictional town Royston Vasey make the jump to celluloid along with their creators  The League of Gentlemen. Mark Gatiss Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith are the more familiar threequarters of the foursome with the central roles shared between the trio. In an added twist the final member of the team  Jeremy Dyson  is portrayed by actor Michael Sheen. Where to start? Dyson Sheen is in conversation with his writing cohorts when  horror of horrors  he is paid a visit by two of his grisliest characters.

	onyx:emotionText "After three outstanding BBC television series' and a Christmas special the bizarre and grotesque yet perversely lovable characters of bleak fictional town Royston Vasey make the jump to celluloid along with their creators  The League of Gentlemen. Mark Gatiss Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith are the more familiar threequarters of the foursome with the central roles shared between the trio. In an added twist the final member of the team  Jeremy Dyson  is portrayed by actor Michael Sheen. Where to start? Dyson Sheen is in conversation with his writing cohorts when  horror of horrors  he is paid a visit by two of his grisliest characters. Both Tubbs Pemberton and Edward Tattsyrup Shearsmith are unhappy at The League's decision to kill off the Vasey inhabitants. You're not real! screams Dyson in vain as the local shopkeepers from hell exact their revenge.

	schema:headline " In a League of it's own!";
	schema:reviewBody "I have to admit that when I first heard about the Apocalypse film it was a worry.I mean they have a lot to live up to don't they? When they first did a stage show they won the Perrier award and when they did radio they won a Sony award. When they ventured onto our telly's they won a Bafta award a Royal Television Society Award and the Golden Rose of Montreux.When the first series aired in January 1999 it was mindblowing! A real breath of fresh air in British Comedy and when the second series aired a year later it built on that foundation and sealed the shows cult status around the world our web stats show that we have received visitors from every single country on the planet! The 'Local show for Local People' showcased the Gents talent for live performance and opened doors for the gents to do more live performing such as 'Art' in the west end.The fans favourite has always been the Christmas Special less of a sketch show and more a tribute to classic horror films yet still wrapped up in the delicious League style.And then of course there was the 'difficult' third series still a hit with the loyal hardcore fans of course but maybe a little bit ahead of its time for a mainstream TV audience.As I say a lot to live up to.So now we have the film and...Well a film is different isn't it? It will be seen by much larger numbers than the radio or TV shows and with the third series in mind I was worried.Well as you know I was lucky enough to get to see the film yesterday at a press screening in London and all my doubts were blown away literally in the first few minutes! I am not going to give plot lines away as some reviewers have done nor am I going to tell you the catch phrases although there is really only one but I will try to tell you what they have managed to achieve with this film! Leaving the cinema on Monday night I could only imagine writing 'Oh my god it's brilliant its amazing its the best thing they have ever done better than the first second and specials all rolled into one!' Of course I owe my visitors a much better explanation than that! So why is it brilliant? This is a film for everyone the casual fan the obsessive fan the occasional fan and even for someone who is sat in the wrong cinema! You don't have to have watched the series to enjoy this film it works on so many levels.This film reminded me why I am a League of Gentlemen Fan! You can tell that filming was a true labour of love too the attention to detail is incredible. The sets for the TV show were always detailed but I am going to have to watch the film again just to look at the background! The story moves at a swift pace the action carrying us from Royston Vasey to the real world where we meet the 'Creators' who are of course the League themselves! Along the way we manage to bump into favourite characters from the show but always within the central story unlike the TV sketch show.I was glad that the film was dark in places a little scary and a little strange...only fitting for The League of Gentlemen. The Gents also managed to get their revenge on the BBC censors not as much slipping in the word 'Mongoloid' as screaming it from the roof tops! Some may think the Gents portrayal of themselves a little indulgent but that's the joke and with that comes my only worry the in jokes I mention below may puzzle some viewers and they might come over a little too clever...but I shouldn't worry there is always a poo joke waiting just around the corner and speaking of jokes they come thick and fast and in a mixture of clever references wig jokes bum jokes visual jokes and cock gags! I haven't laughed out loud in a cinema since...well I can't remember! The fans that have been 'with' the League since the beginning are rewarded with loads of 'in' jokes some that work on two levels a mainstream audience may laugh at a reference to a compact disc for one reason whilst fans of the Local show will laugh for another reason altogether! The cameos are genius! Peter Kay and Simon Pegg form the strangest double act you have ever seen Simon getting one of the films biggest laughs just by making a noise! I was a little worried about the 1690's aspect of the film when I first heard about it but as a story within a story I was just getting into it when...but that would be telling! All I need to say is that it fits wonderfully and adds to the overall feel of the film! I am not a professional reviewer of films so I am finding it difficult to put into words how much I enjoyed this film but for now I will just say that if the supposed benchmark for British Comedy films in recent years was the excellent 'Shaun of the Dead' then I am sorry but a new benchmark has just been set by the inventive hilarious and sometimes a little scary...The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse.Jason Kenny 2005".

	schema:reviewBody "Just saw 'The League of Gentlemen Apocalypse' at a special screening in Manchester with Mark Gatiss and Reece Shearsmith of the League in attendance.At the back was Peter Kay who has a brief cameo in the film affectionately heckling at the back during the Q  A session after the film.The film was complicated in a good way and very very funny. It follows Geoff Tipps Hilary Briss and Herr Lipp as they try and save fictional Rosyton Vasey from the disinterest of their creators.The League play a wide range of their characters and themselves or character based on themselves and are ably supported by the cream of British character and comedy actors such as Bernard Hill Victoria Wood and David Warner.Warner is a particular stand out reminding me of his smooth and cutting turn in 'Time Bandits'.The film swims in and out of various realities and allows some of the denizen's of Rosyton Vasey some space to grow beyond their usual limits of their comedy shtick.Steve Pemberton's Herr Lipp has a great Bretchian moment near the end of the movie and has to make a decision about his purpose and meaning in life which brings a lump to the throat at an unexpected moment and surprises you with its tender affection for the characters.This echoes something Mark and Reece said in the Q  A afterwards that the plot of the league being tired of their famous characters is spurious and that the whole film is really a love letter to them.For a format that started as a radio characterbased sketch show these guys have really evolved the idea so far as to sustain a movie which takes you on a journey through fiction 'reality' comedy tragedy and a pleasing journey for two of the less obvious characters to carry a long form story from their 70 odd existing creations.The fans of the show will love it. It pays off dedication and attention to detail in spades the uninitiated may be a little lost but the joy of the LoG was always the ability to almost instantly tune into their acutely observed characters and take the stylistic leap into farce and expressionistic movie homage.There are homages a plenty in this one including 'The Shining' and 'La Belle et la Bete' to name but two I spotted and they ably demonstrate their love for cinema and history with a segment in 1690's England that makes perfect sense when you're engaged with the movie.What can I say I marvelled boggled emoted and snickered throughout and they have definitely pulled off what many have failed at. A successful British TV comedy to cinema translation.If you've watched and enjoyed 'The League of Gentlemen' in the past go see it you will enjoy.If you haven't rentbuy a DVD and then go see it.Well done guys and thanks for the charming and humorous Q  A.".

The plot is basically two stories badly tacked together. There are some comic moments but not enough to make it necessary viewing. The audience I saw it with certainly didn't crack up laughing.

Some of the best characters such as Tubbs n' Edward Pauline n' Mickey n' the bizarre Papa Lazarou had about 10 minutes screen time between them instead a lot of the film is taken up with the real life creators aka the league of gentlemen and some rather poor characters from their new 17th century story. I think what made the TV series so great was all the characters of Royston Vasey this however did not feature that many in any great detail and wasn't even really filmed in Royston Vasey for the most part. The whole cinema sat in mostly silence throughout the film the only highlights in my opinion were the usual sexual innuendos from Herr Lipp the best being his one involving two scouts at the start and their 'purple skins'!.".

It was unfunny throughout half baked gags and poor slapstick humour.The real clincher was the plain ridiculous period drama  comedy and i will use the word comedy loosely. It distracted from the main storyline and felt awkward not to mention painfully unfunny. The direction of the movie is appalling and often feels that the lines were delivered by the characters within one take. Very rushed.Then  the three headed Plasticineesquire monster. What the hell was all that about? plain ridiculous it felt like the League of gentlemen tagged it on at the end.All in all I found myself looking at my watch and sighing with disappointment throughout my experience of the film. What was once an amazing Television series has been tainted by a terribly unfunny film. If i could give it 0 out of 10 i would. Do not waste your money seeing this.".

What the hell was all that about? plain ridiculous it felt like the League of gentlemen tagged it on at the end.All in all I found myself looking at my watch and sighing with disappointment throughout my experience of the film. What was once an amazing Television series has been tainted by a terribly unfunny film. If i could give it 0 out of 10 i would. Do not waste your money seeing this.";

Although much of the action is set away from the usual home turf of Royston Vasey and contains less characters than the TV series it is undeniably every bit as good as the TV series. The film follows three lesser known characters Hilary Briss Geoff Tipps and Herr Lipp as they attempt to save Royston Vasey from an apocalypse being rained down on them due to the writers stopping writing the show. The film also contains favourites Tubbs and Edward as well as Papa Lazarou and Pauline but in much smaller amounts. I felt this worked well because it meant the audience didn't overdose on the extremely grotesque characters. However of course there are still plenty of fantastically twisted moments scattered within the film.I would recommend this film to anyone whether they have seen the TV series or not.

It's a fun twist and there's plenty of great scenes in this idiotic adventure. I laughed out loud numerous times and applauded the brazen style of humour.

Opening with one of the worst jokes I've ever seen committed to celluloid on the big screen it did not take off with a bang. throughout the movie we got the feeling that the jokes were just trying too hard the writers thought about the setup so much that you could see the joke coming 2 minutes beforehand then when it came it was so lackluster that you couldn't even smile I cite the giraffe cumming as a prime example. The plot itself makes for some interesting thoughts in my mind which entertained me much more than what was going on on the screen. I think a lot more could have been done with that angle the two different worlds the fishoutofwater experience of the characters the confusion and surprise as people try to comprehend and distinguish the characters and writers from each other. But too much time is wasted with pushing this painful plot to the end with as much 'bizarre' and 'goof' as is humanly possible. And to say the 16th century characters show any extra talent from the writers is an insult to intelligent writers and editors who possibly could have made this film a worthy 40 minute afterthought but no its a full length torture film of unfunniness.

You never really knew what was coming next. And the girl responding yeah quite surprising. and that was it.

I could forgive the ridiculous plot if I had come out of the cinema having laughed more than twice. At one point I thought it might just me before I realised hardly any laughs were minting from the rest of audience.I wasn't expecting much of a plot very few TV comedies stand up to being stretched over 90 minutes but thought the odd bit of classic L.O.G dialogue or visual joke like at the start of each programme would carry a film. After 5 minutes of the 17th Century plot I was begging for it to end little did I know it would carry on for the rest of the film. It just wasn't funny.I was just massively disappointed and can't see history being too kind to it even if a few diehard fans write enthusiastic reviews.".

I can't help thinking they are written by the sort of L.O.G fan who would worship anything they ever do without questioning whether it is actually any good.I'm a massive fan of the programme but thought this film was a pointless project. I could forgive the ridiculous plot if I had come out of the cinema having laughed more than twice. At one point I thought it might just me before I realised hardly any laughs were minting from the rest of audience.I wasn't expecting much of a plot very few TV comedies stand up to being stretched over 90 minutes but thought the odd bit of classic L.O.G dialogue or visual joke like at the start of each programme would carry a film. After 5 minutes of the 17th Century plot I was begging for it to end little did I know it would carry on for the rest of the film. It just wasn't funny.I was just massively disappointed and can't see history being too kind to it even if a few diehard fans write enthusiastic reviews.";

	schema:reviewBody "Having only seen five episodes of the show before this I've been watching the repeats on BBC Two I haven't really had much experience of the League but as a fledgling fan as well as a massive fan of British comedy I can say this film is hilarious. Seeing Herr Lipp who I had not seen on screen before the film Briss and Geoff on the big screen was a great comedy experience. Being on screen is something that the League take full advantage of with heads blowing up it'll come as a surprise who it is and gruesome murders with random Middle Ages style battles all the way.Geoff is easily the funniest character of the three protagonists in this film because he has the best one liners and overall behaviour just like in the series. One of my only disappointments with the film was not hearing Geoff shout Well now I've got this gun even once even though there is a buildup to it in one part of the film. The film itself overall is to use the phrase everyone else does Pythonesque and it's very reminiscent of films like Life of Brian. Appearances from Tubbs and Edward were welcome but Papa Lazarou's line Hello Daves cracked me up more than anything said by them Lazarou's probably my favourite Vasey character after Tubbs and Edward. It's got quite a poignant ending with one of the main character being killed off and I can only hope this is not the League's last onscreen Vasey venture. With Gatiss mentioning the possibility of another series or film I'm now very excited. This is a film I will see again partly because the projector died towards the end leaving out 10 minutes or so of the film but mainly because it's inventive and hilarious. I'm not really bothered if it's not as good as the TV series because I loved it.One thing though if you've never seen the League you'll still love it but Dave knows what you'll think about the people who make this stuff up. As Tubbs or Edward might put it it's a local film for local people and a precious thing at that. out of  45".

	schema:reviewBody "Based on the weird wacky and at times wonderful sitcom League Of Gentlemen's Apocalypse is a fans delight. I was a fan of the first two series myself with the third still enjoyable but a little too out there for my liking. You could easily assume that with the Royston Vasey locals hitting the big screen and leaving behind TV boundaries of taste' that the movie would really push the darker aspects out. However the is nothing quite as disturbing as series three's sodomy scene. Of course many sitcoms don't translate all too well to the big screen but LOG was a sitcom with a real movie atmosphere from the style it was made to all the references it truly felt like a long movie split into six segments each series. Similarly Spaced's unique style worked superbly for it's translation to the big screen in Shaun Of The Dead. This movie is very filmic thankfully with possibly the most strange plot ever to grace the silver screen. The four writers add plenty of film reference with little nods from everything from The Shining Labyrinth to the old HarryHuasen films. This is in many ways a whacked out smacked up version of kids favourite The Neverending Story. With the imaginary colliding with the real world.The plot opens with the scenario that the inhabitants of Royston Vasey who are alive inside there own little world like Fantasia in The Neverending Story. When the town of Vasey begins showing signs of the apocalypse due to the fact that real life writers Mark Steve Reece and Jeremy are not doing any more LOG a group of the inhabitants must venture into the real world in order to make the writers continue with the LOG otherwise Royston Vasey and its inhabitants will die out. LOG has a great advantage in translating to film and that is the fact it is set in a small universe that is so demented you can do just about anything plotwise. This film works it doesn't feel like a half hour skit painfully stretched out. As an example a proposed Friends movie would probably end up being a run of the mill romcom far too thin.As far as being a good film this is. It's good fun plenty of gags while not trying to overload the film with gags. On another impressive note the film managers to successfully incorporate some softer moments too in the same way Shaun Of The Dead did. While this film isn't as good as Shaun it will undoubtedly become a cult classic even if the theatre I saw this in was shockingly sparse it was a midday showing though.As is the case with Brit films it is loaded with cameos including Bernard Hill Simon Pegg Peter Kay and Victoria Wood. The main cast of course are all good playing a host of their recognised characters themselves and some new creations. Also costarring in his Time Bandits villain style is David Warner who has already become a fans favourite amongst those who have seen it. Also the film looks very polished for a budget of only 4.2 million. They have got some great cinematography and sets as well as excellent effects and something I particularly enjoyed was the stop motion monsters very much a loving homage to the legendary Ray Harryhausen. I personally would love to see another Harryhausen movie. I'm fed up with all the CGI we have now as much as it is a good tool when used right but I would love to see a film go back to the basics again and I'm sure others would too.LOG's Apocalypse is great fun and very nuts. Fans will love this as will movie enthusiasts. 12".

Not only was it funny what you would expect from these guys but it was so clever the whole basis of the film being that the characters have left Royston Vasey and are pursuing their creators  the League of Gentlemen in reality. It was quite weird to see Edward Jeff and Papa Lazarou talking about Reece Shearsmith who plays all of them but it worked fantastically well. I had also read in a review that a large part of the film took place in the 1690s and was unsure of this but that also proved to be really wellwritten and very very funny  with cameos from Peter Kay Simon Pegg Victoria Wood Bernard Hill and David Warner. Ultimately this film demonstrates the massive writing talents and acting prowess of the group even if Michael Sheen did play Jeremy Dyson!.I can't praise this film highly enough although my favourite characters of Mickey and Pauline weren't in it quite as much as i would have liked but then again I'm sure everyone has different favourite characters and you can't please everyone. The choice of Jeff as one of the main characters was truly inspired and the domestication of Herr Lipp proved to be humorous and poignant  a lovely transformation for a character that speaks only in innuendos. All i want to know is whats next for the League of Gentlemen????????".

So when I learnt they had made a film in which the show's lovable creators met their own characters I couldn't order the DVD fast enough and near on tore it from my postman's hands when he delivered it.

He's perfectly capable as viewers of the infamous Highgate House of Horrors know! to Bernice berating yet another one of her flock to Geoff Herr Lipp and Hilary discovering that THEY are characters which is a great scene. The scenes set in 1690 are very enjoyable with the Gents turning their hands to yet more characters and an all new plot. David Warner's turn as Doctor Pea is fantastic slightly camp and very funny.The League have always been brilliant at blending humour with sadness and emotion  and the climax of this film where Herr Lipp is struggling with the idea that he and the other Vasey residents are just fictional people who will never be able to change who they are or their purpose  and to witness how it's breaking him down is really sad and beautiful to watch at the same time and that really shows the Gents' talent  something for which they are terribly overlooked for to this day.And then you have that rather clever ending  where you sit in wonder  with Joby Talbot's beautiful theme music playing.

Candle wax dripping on a table a fraying rope a facial blemish ... everything merited hours of analysis. I wondered then and still do if maybe at least some of the time candle wax old rope and acne were just that and nothing more. Unfortunately the French seem to revel in bludgeoning everyone with the insistent significance of the apparently insignificant. Crafting subtlety with a sledge hammer seldom produces an attractive result and is quite often counterproductive although it does tend to attract the praise of gushing selfstyled intellectuals.At any rate in the midst of all the passion I became increasingly alarmed by the lead character's apparent disdain for bathing. At one point he even goes into the bathroom splashes a bit of water about so that his mother with hear it and then pulls the bath plug without ever even disrobing or wiping a face cloth over bits  pieces of his person. That coupled with the way he frequently balled up clothing tossed it about and even dragged it across dirty floors began to become something of an obsessed focus for me made all the worse when he swapped his clothes for something worn by the older man and spent much of the rest of the movie in an exceeding dirty tee shirt  jacket.

It reminded me of the exaggerated affectations employed by actors in the days of silent films or a less than graceful imitation of a ballet dancer. I enjoyed the film although enjoyed is undoubtedly the wrong word just as appreciated or understood would be wrong. It's hardly your typical coming out or rites of passage tale. The more I think about it and attempt to write about it the more I feel more comfortable in saying it was a moving portrayal of the turmoil a young man experiences as he simultaneously wants to escape from his drab normal and socially acceptable family life while feeling disturbed and offended by the alternative world to which his emotions are driving him.Certainly not a particularly uplifting film for someone facing such unresolved turmoil in his own life but probably an unwarranted confirmation of the costs of this life choice for anyone who believes being queer is an optional perverted life style. Yes... I use the expression life choice facetiously. Who would intentionally choose this nightmare for himself?".

Of course Iron Eagle's plot was ridiculous. But I believe its target audience was kids and I sure remember finding this cool when I was little. Now I just find it amusing as a guilty pleasure kinda like Road House. This movie is part of the great pantheon of 80's kidstakingonthestodgyadultpowerstructure movies. You must remember D.A.R.Y.L Real Genius E.T. etc. If you ask me just watching Doug and Knotcher Ride the Snake in the beginning is worth the cost of the DVD. That whole sequence was so STUPID! But at the same time it was hilarious funny totally 80's all that good stuff. So bottom line Iron Eagle is a great 80's guilty pleasure. The hairstyles the dancing the music the dialogue its all funny as hell. I have Iron Eagle on DVD and to me it was totally worth 9.99 at Best Buy. If you love laughing at dated unrealistic action movies this one is a mustsee. Oh yeah and I think its plot was only marginally stupider than 1986's other fighter pilot action pic Top Gun.".

	schema:reviewBody "Okay here's the deal. There's this American pilot who's flying along minding his own business when suddenly he's outnumbered by evil cowardly nonAmerican fighter planes they're Middle Eastern types but suffice to say they don't like apple pie or Elvis Presley who proceed to shoot him down. Now this American pilot was doing nothing wrong but those evil nonAmericans didn't care and before you know it he's banged up in a foreign jail and sentenced to death!!Now what would normally happen here is that the US Military would carpet bomb a couple of nearby towns until the pilot was released but not this time. Those evil peace lovin' types probably got involved and managed to stop any kind of retaliatory massacre. As you can imagine this doesn't please the pilot's family and the evil foreign dictator has this smug contented look about him. He'll make those Americans pay oh yes indeed!But He didn't reckon on Doug Masters the captured pilots 16yearold son. You see Doug has been able to fly a plane longer than he can drive a car which can't be that long and decides to fly into that evil foreign country and get his Dad back. So with the help of his friends Doug and his wingman retired pilot Chappy' Sinclair Doug launches a two man air raid on the foreigners. Now you'd think that this plan would be bound to fail but you'd be wrong. Sure those Middle Eastern types might be all veteran pilots but Doug's got an ace up his sleeve he listens to rock music when he flies! After shooting down a dozen or so enemy planes and blowing up an oil refinery Doug lands at an airport and gets his now wounded dad onboard the plane. Understandably the evil not quite so smug anymore dictator gets quite annoyed at these antics and takes to the skies himself in bid to shoot down Doug. But the young lad listens to some more rock music and blows the villain out of the sky. HURRAH!After Doug and Chappy have shot down 90 of their air force the foreigners send up their last few planes in a rather poor attempt to shoot Doug down but in the nick of time a flight of US F16s turn up and scare them away.I cannot recommend this film enough. It was the first ever videocassette movie that I brought and until I was twenty I kept hoping that my dad would get shot down over a foreign country so that I could rescue him. But he's doesn't like flying so it didn't happen.".

	onyx:emotionText "Okay here's the deal. There's this American pilot who's flying along minding his own business when suddenly he's outnumbered by evil cowardly nonAmerican fighter planes they're Middle Eastern types but suffice to say they don't like apple pie or Elvis Presley who proceed to shoot him down. Now this American pilot was doing nothing wrong but those evil nonAmericans didn't care and before you know it he's banged up in a foreign jail and sentenced to death!!Now what would normally happen here is that the US Military would carpet bomb a couple of nearby towns until the pilot was released but not this time. Those evil peace lovin' types probably got involved and managed to stop any kind of retaliatory massacre. As you can imagine this doesn't please the pilot's family and the evil foreign dictator has this smug contented look about him. He'll make those Americans pay oh yes indeed!But He didn't reckon on Doug Masters the captured pilots 16yearold son. You see Doug has been able to fly a plane longer than he can drive a car which can't be that long and decides to fly into that evil foreign country and get his Dad back. So with the help of his friends Doug and his wingman retired pilot Chappy' Sinclair Doug launches a two man air raid on the foreigners. Now you'd think that this plan would be bound to fail but you'd be wrong. Sure those Middle Eastern types might be all veteran pilots but Doug's got an ace up his sleeve he listens to rock music when he flies! After shooting down a dozen or so enemy planes and blowing up an oil refinery Doug lands at an airport and gets his now wounded dad onboard the plane. Understandably the evil not quite so smug anymore dictator gets quite annoyed at these antics and takes to the skies himself in bid to shoot down Doug. But the young lad listens to some more rock music and blows the villain out of the sky. HURRAH!After Doug and Chappy have shot down 90 of their air force the foreigners send up their last few planes in a rather poor attempt to shoot Doug down but in the nick of time a flight of US F16s turn up and scare them away.I cannot recommend this film enough.

	schema:reviewBody "The film focuses a boy about eighteenyearsold Jason Gedrick  when his father Tim Thomerson is taken prisoner by a dictator David Suchet from Middle East  he steals a F 16 fighter jet to rescue his daddy . He's helped by the brave Colonel Chappy Sinclair Louis Gosset Jr.  though Morgan Freeman auditioned for the part . The movie contains a plethora of action scenes  explosion  blasts  aircraft battles with various jetplanes flying to soundvelocity and blown up . The picture is a blend of typical films from the 80s  as Top Gunand Rambo but starred by a teenager .The story provides entertainment and action with no sense but being sometimes a little bit boring and dull . All of the fighter aircraft used F16 fighters  plus  F21 fighters depicting enemy MiGs are actually Israeli Air Force aircraft  repainted with the USAF symbol and a fictitious enemy symbol . Jason Gedrick is the valiant heman  he causes wreck havoc to nasties commanded by the villain David Suchet . Our hero Chappy is well personified by Louis Gosset Jr  usual to all theIron Eagle saga . Spectacular cinematography by Adam Greenberg with excellent skyshots . However  the score is awful  but is based in discomusic and synthesizer  in spite of being composed by Basil Poledouris Conan music's author . The motion picture was regularly directed by Sidney J.Furie . It's followed by three sequels all directed by Furie with exception the second directed by John Glen  thus  Iron Eagle 2 1988 with Mark Humphrey  Aces  Iron Eagle III 1992 with Rachel McLish and Horst Buchhold  and Iron Eagle IV with Rachel Blanchard .".

	schema:reviewBody "I remember seeing this movie in the theater when it first came out. I think I saw it three or four times. It was the best air combat movie I had seen at the time.     I hear this movie compared to Top Gun a lot. In my opinion there is no contest. Iron Eagle is far better than Top Gun. Here's why. Top Gun had very good aerial combat sequences. Some of the best I've still ever seen. However the plot of Top Gun was AWOL. All I remember of Top Gun is they practiced he got the girl his pal died and he was the hero at the end. Iron Eagle had a good plot. However the aerial combat scenes are pretty fake and tame. Sure it was unbelievable that they could pull it off but there was a plot and a good one.      Iron Eagle's fun lies in it's youthful angst and comedy. Louis Gossett Jr. shows his veteran acting skill in this movie as the veteran pilot. Jason Gedrick was good as the young upstart pilot with too much testosterone. They chemistry between the actors was good. There is one scene where they young pilot asks for Chappy's help and he turns him down and Louis Gossett's acting skills become quite evident. One of the best scenes in the movie is the race between the motorcycle and the Cessna with a pounding rock song in the background. It is one of the best done flight sequences I've seen in a move and is not fake like the combat scenes. Another scene is when the kids use their dupe their parents and other military personnel into getting them what ever they want from the base including two F16s. But more than these scenes it's really the soundtrack that makes the movie. There are songs by QueenOne Vision DioHide in the Rainbow and The Spencer Davis GroupGimmie Some Lovin what a combo! Not only does the music sound good to our young pilot it also makes him fly and fight better! While I can't say that Iron Eagle is a masterpiece it is one of my favorite movies of all time.     Iron Eagle is out on DVD! Now I finally have and excuse to buy a DVD player!Rayvyn".

	schema:headline " 1986 The year of the jet fighter movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "Most of us remember Top Gun as being the biggest hit of 1986. Iron Eagle despite the numerous sequels it produced has been all but forgotten. However it also made its mark in the same year just not as big of a mark. Iron Eagle is the story of a teenager Jason Gedrick who with the help of an experienced jet pilot Louis Gossett Jr. borrows a couple F16 fighters to rescue his father who is being held prisoner in a hostile Arabic country. The film is absolutely ludicrous but definitely a sign of the times back then.I do not recall if the hostile nation in this film is ever named but it is obviously based on Lybia who was public enemy 1 for the USA back then. At least as far as noncommunist bloc nations were concerned. The main bad guy who seems to be running the show is obviously based on Muammar Gadaffi too. After a kangaroo court trial Gedrick's father is sentenced to be hanged for simply being shot down in disputed air space near the enemy coast. recall Gadaffi's line of death The US government seems to be planning no action to rescue the dad. It appears Gedrick and Gossett Jr. are his only hope!!!! In a series of ridiculous scenes perhaps even less probable than the actual air combat scenes Gedrick and his teenage friends are able to steal all the necessary reconnaissance needed to set up the mission. Gedrick is able to gather enough information to convince Gossett to fly in there with him in his own plane. But can two F16s really penetrate the hostile country's air space and pull off the rescue?????? Sure they can! This was the 1980s!!! Ronald Reagan was president!! Americans could accomplish anything back then!!!! Whether or not this kind of plot seems interesting quickly becomes irrelevant once the film gets going. It is technically inept full of impossible scenes and lacking in logic from the getgo. This film was obviously rushed no doubt to get it released before Top Gun which was a much better film in all areas. There are an embarrassing number of continuity goofs involving the weaponry carried on the wings of the planes. In some shots the planes appear fully loaded for battle. Then the next shot will show only a couple missiles left. Then the planes will do some kind of loop da loop and there will be no weapons visible at all. The editing department was either out with the flu or just didn't have time to get things right. The acting isn't bad. Gedrick is likable and Gossett Jr. is terrific as ever. He basically plays the same kind of hardass he played in An Officer and a Gentleman. He likes the kid and his father but he knows the kid will have to be toughened up drastically if they have any chance of pulling it off. Keep a close lookout for Robbie Rist who played Cousin Oliver on The Brady Bunch.On the plus side the soundtrack is pretty good. One Vision by Queen is a great rock song. There are also good songs by Twisted Sister King Kobra and Dio. And also its a joy to behold someone bombing the heck out of this worthless dictator and his stupid country. Blowing up his oil refinery may have been a bad decision though. Something like that could theoretically hike up the price of gas world wide!! Just ask our current president or his father. When bombing a Middle Eastern country the LAST thing you want to hit are its oil resources! Prices are high enough as it is these days! 5 of 10 stars. Mostly for the soundtrack.The Hound.".

As I watched the film I could see flaws in detail flaws in the special effects and a corny script and plot line. Now don't get me wrong it's still a good film if you are like stuck in the 80's! The only true thing I could get into with this film was the pretty good soundtrack. I am a big fan of the rock group Queen they made parts of this film good enough to at least sit tight and watch. Good film back in the days good film now just a whole lot of corny! Thank you for your time Aaron Grace".

	schema:reviewBody "It's hard to believe that a movie this bad wasn't produced once but four times! Most movies require a certain suspension of reality' to enjoy but this one takes it just too far. The basic scenario is an Air Force pilot who is shot down over a Middle Eastern' country. The US government drags its feet in recovering him leading the Pilot's son Doug Masters to attempt a rescue mission.The problem I have with the movie is that it depicts the US Air Force as one colossal joke. In the movie you'll find that Doug and his friends on the air base manage to secure two F16's all the munitions the fuel the Intel for the mission and so on. Security on this base seems to be a joke. Nobody seems to have a problem that a sixteenyearold kid is fully qualified to pilot an F16!If that wasn't enough you would think the producers would at least attempt to get the munitions right since people like to see things blow up'. Not so! Several times in the movie Doug fires off AIM9 Missiles on ground targets. AIM stands for Air Intercept Missile' meaning a weapon used to strike targets in the AIR. He also fires off 1520 missiles where the maximum an F16 can hold is 6 AIM9's.  The movie also lacks continuity. You'll see the aircraft configured with one set of munitions and in the next scene it has a totally different munitions package. Also 20MM doesn't just completely destroy anything it touches! An F16 will hold 500 rounds of 20MM and it's mostly used for selfdefense.I could go on forever with plot holes flaws and outright wrong information from the movie but I won't bore you. If you're in the mood to see a good Air Force movie your choices are rather slim. Most military movies deal either with the Army Navy or Marines. Until Hollywood can come up with an Air Force movie on the lines of Saving Private Ryan' or A Few Good Men' we'll be forced to watch movies like the Iron Eagle' series.".

The Iranian Air Force is lucky to filtch a couple parts for an ageing F14 and this kid wrangles not 1 but 2 fully loaded and fueled F16s? Gimme a break.";

	schema:reviewBody "After a young man's father is captured by an unidentified Middle Eastern country the youth must suit up and save his father from a brutal execution.This film fails in almost every possible way. No decent music a weak and unbelievable plot and actors you will never see again although a young Shawnee Smith  Amanda from Saw  appears. Louis Gossett is not a star regardless of what you think.The unidentified country is an interesting plot device. One would suspect it is Iraq or Iran but no name is ever given. All we know is that now that the peanut farmer is out of the White House and the Raygun is in power America won't take any crap from anyone. This is an assertion I strongly deny. The film's proReagan bias is astounding. I also enjoyed the first third of the film but only because it reached that so bad it's good status. We have a very onedimensional teen villain and an epic race between a plane Cessna and a Honda motorcycle. We have black man who is the token black man playing a 1980s black man with signature dance moves. And we have the commentary on the great music which was like something I'd expect to hear on a Pat Benetar album that was too poor to release.I could say the flight scenes were interesting. They were alright. But this film was released in 1986 the same year as Top Gun. So if you want to watch the Air Force shoot down MiGs you're going to want the better soundtrack and the Cruise Kilmer Edwards combo. Do you want Louis Gossett as your wingman? I certainly don't.This film would be great to get really stinking drunk to if you want a few laughs at three in the morning. But don't expect a memorable 80s film or anything remotely resembling quality acting.".

	schema:reviewBody "On Sunday my friend Patty and I went to see the first viewing of After Sex. Because it was being shown as part of the SXSW Film Festival here in Austin our chances of getting in were risky because we hadn't bought 55 passes for the festival. We had been watching the schedules for weeks because we thought The Weekend would be showing. But two weeks ago After Sex showed up on the schedule with no warning or advertisement. Because it looked like they were quietly sneaking it in for feedback we thought we'd take a chance. We arrived an hour early and sure enough not many festivalgoers knew it was playing so they opened up the movie to general admission. We got in for 4! By the time the movie started though it was a full house.So how was it? Not what I expected which is a good thing. The movie is a fastpaced comedy about a group of friends two married couples one engaged couple and a divorced woman. The film explores the relationships between men and women through these friends. The script is very fastpaced and the camera angles are quirky. The soundtrack is excellent and we found ourselves wanting to buy it as soon as the movie was over. Was it perfect? No. When the movie stuck to comedy it was very good sometimes hysterically funny. But when it delved into the serious side of relationships it was uneven. Not because of the writing but because of the acting. All of the actors had great comedic timing but a couple of them just didn't have the range to play serious. Notably Brooke Shields and Dan Cortese But thankfully their crying jags were brief and didn't detract from the movie too much.And what about D.B. Sweeney? Terrific! He plays a husband opposite Virginia Madsen and the two show the best acting of the movie. His character is this sweet lug who reads selfhelp books to make sure his marriage stays strong and God bless him he has no idea what to do with the information! He has some of the funniest lines in the movie and honestly I missed some of them because the audience was laughing so hard. When this movie comes out be sure and catch the first scene with him and Virginia Madsen. I call it the watch scene and maybe it was so funny because I'm married but I was laughing about it even after the movie ended. These two also did a great job when the mood got heavier. The last scene with them is beautifully done and it doesn't dawn on you until later that the two never speak a word.I think the movie will be a sleeper. The audience gave it a round of applause and I'd love to see it again when it's released. There have been so few movies lately that are just enjoyable and fun to watch but this is definitely one of them.".

This film lacks good direction has lame acting a terrible script and starts to be become laughable and in poor taste. It also shows that the actors and actresses really have chosen a project that will bring a quick end to their careers. I am talking of people such as Brooke Shields Suddenly Susan Virginia Madison from the great romantic comedy Electric Dreams' and D.B. Sweeney so on and so on. So my rating for the film? CMRS gives About Sex' 0.5    Bad Film Why?

The other quarter goes to the best parts of the movie that of the two men talking in what looks like a psychologist's office. I have plenty of experience in such a place and a lot of what these guys say makes plenty of sense. It is a shame the other parts of the film did not add up. Enough has been said already. Please beware. This is a film that you will most likely hate with a vengeance because I know I do.".

This film lacks good direction has lame acting a terrible script and starts to be become laughable and in poor taste. It also shows that the actors and actresses really have chosen a project that will bring a quick end to their careers. I am talking of people such as Brooke Shields Suddenly Susan Virginia Madison from the great romantic comedy Electric Dreams' and D.B. Sweeney so on and so on. So my rating for the film? CMRS gives About Sex' 0.5    Bad Film Why?

Deep Blood on that other hand is utterly boring and even too cheap to feature cheesy special effects. The only sharks that we get to see previously featured in National Graphic documentaries of which Joe d'Amato bought the stock footage! The wraparound story is also completely retarded. A bunch of young idiots living in a small and insignificant beach community take an oath to remain best friends for life and look after each other. Aw how cute. Their buddy pact is immediately put to a severe test when one of them gets eaten by a shark. At least that's what you have to assume happened because the actor simply vanishes in the water and the next shot just shows a puddle of red liquid instead. Either way the rest of the losers decide to go shark hunting themselves obviously against the will of local authorities. Deep Blood is a dreadfully tedious and overlong snoozer without any sort of memorable highlight Except maybe if you count the boys' inability to estimate what quantity of dynamite is required to blow up a shark. There isn't even any gratuitous nudity or sleaze in this garbage. I'm really disappointed Mr. d'Amato!".

I can only recall three movies I have had the misfortune to see that I have repeatedly used the fastforward button for large chunks of the story.  Those movies are The Mighty Gorga Night of the Seagulls and this little crap Deep Blood.In the world of Jaws ripoffs this falls off the scale.  Deep Blood doesn't have the realistic storyline of the original Crocodile nor the incredible effects of The Sea Serpent nor the commentary of Tintorera.  No instead we are treated to a handful of teens from any random failed '80s public access sitcom battling bullies and the local sheriff.Shark attacks are realized by quick cuts of documentary footage with actors thrashing about in the water occasionally with a bit of what appears to be orangeish paint thrown into the water.  Not a minute of original shark footage exists in this celluloid waste dump.Normally I or somebody like me would read a dismal review like this one and say cool I gotta find a copy of this!

I can only recall three movies I have had the misfortune to see that I have repeatedly used the fastforward button for large chunks of the story.  Those movies are The Mighty Gorga Night of the Seagulls and this little crap Deep Blood.In the world of Jaws ripoffs this falls off the scale.  Deep Blood doesn't have the realistic storyline of the original Crocodile nor the incredible effects of The Sea Serpent nor the commentary of Tintorera.  No instead we are treated to a handful of teens from any random failed '80s public access sitcom battling bullies and the local sheriff.Shark attacks are realized by quick cuts of documentary footage with actors thrashing about in the water occasionally with a bit of what appears to be orangeish paint thrown into the water.  Not a minute of original shark footage exists in this celluloid waste dump.Normally I or somebody like me would read a dismal review like this one and say cool I gotta find a copy of this!

In Jaws and all the other shark films we all have seen or herd about they all use fake made sharks well in Joe D'Amato's film he takes a new approach by using all stock footage for his shark scenes. This is one of the many reasons I like Deep Blood so much is because it didn't use stock footage.In Deep Blood an ancient Indian spirit terrorizes a beach town in the form of a bloodthirsty shark in Joe D'Amato's Shark classic Deep Blood.It seems that a Native American elder once warned a group of youngsters about this great evil in the sea and years later the friends are forced to face their fears when one of them is killed by a shark in a series of attacks along their coastline. Now it's up to the remaining few to make sure that this monster is killed even if it means heading out to sea to do it.Joe D'Amato Directed and Produced this film under his company the Filmirage. Released in 1989 and was later used in Bruno Mattei's Cruel Jaws Jaws 5 along with many other shark films. Joe D'Amato's shark entry is a great film and any Joe D'Amato fan of shark movie watcher should give it a try.".

The story is purest crap actors are bad effects very cheap no creativity whatsoever. It looks like some really debilitated children took Jaws script and arranged it randomly then its parents took their 8 mm camera and shot the movie with their neighbors. The music is really inappropriate just some elevator music bland and overly optimistic when nothing happens then slightly less optimistic when shark is around or when children gets depressed again listens to VERY LOUD elevator music. Carlo Maria the author should be so ashamed he should ask for his name to be erased from the titles!! The movie acts as perfect demonstration how crappy music will destroy ANY scene which is supposed to be thrilling. There is one major difference to Jaws though In the beginning of Jaws there are comments about stupid people who try to kill shark with dynamite. Well there is an attempt to kill a shark with dynamite. When this does not work guys take an BIG LOAD of dynamite and spent like 14 of movie by placing explosives in some sunken ship. This IS really original way to catch the fish I have to admit! They use so much dynamite like they would try to kill a battleship I would guess Bismarck class of battleship or to dig another Panama channel. This is just incredible. I'm glad they did not try to use napalmflamethrower or tactical nuclear strike to eliminate this bad bad approximately 2 m shark. Well there is mystic disappearing native Indian who looks like German pensioner too in this mess. This is not a movie this is a warning example how bad the movies may be! As a warning it is useful. But the public should be protected from this crap. Most of Italian movies is bad but this... this is really exceptional in the worst sense of the word.".

	schema:reviewBody "What shocked me about the COMANCHE MOON DVD other than getting it for just five dollars at WalMart was just how enjoyable and poignant it really was. As a serious reader who has read and reread all the classic LONESOME DOVE novels I knew a lot was going to be left out and oversimplified yet I wasn't prepared for how moved I was at the end.First the bad news. The Comanche side of the story is watered down and much of the impact is lost. In the book the fatherson conflict between Buffalo Hump and his son Blue Duck is literally Shakespearean with enormous intensity and passion. As the son of a Mexican woman Buffalo Hump brutally raped Blue Duck is a symbol of tragic retribution and the destruction he brings on Buffalo Hump is chilling and inevitable. The gods are just and of our pleasant vices make means to plague us. In the movie it just seems pointless and random. Also in the book Blue Duck is a symbol of change. He fights better with pistols and rifles than with the bow or the lance and he leads an army of white drifters rather than native warriors. But in the movie these changes are glossed over so the deeper meaning is lost.On the other hand the story of the Texans is told well and there are some amazing performances. Captain Scull and his sexy wife Inez are both annoying cartoon characters in the book but Val Kilmer and Rachel Griffiths really succeed in making them not only charismatic and funny but strangely likable as well. It's interesting to note that in the book Inez Scull takes no part in any action outside of the bedroom but in the movie she is far braver. During the Great Raid she actually joins the Rangers in fighting off the Comanches with a rifle! Normally I hate when these changes happen but here I felt it was right for the character and added a dimension of courage along with her cruelty.Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are both terrific as Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call but what really surprised me was how much Elizabeth Banks did as Maggie Tilton the mother of Call's son Newt. In the books I always visualized Maggie as sort of drab and hopeless but in the movie she's practically radiant full of courage and good cheer no matter what the circumstances. Whether a real prostitute on the frontier would glow like Elizabeth Banks is another question. But it was nice to see that Maggie was more than just a victim. And some of the final scenes with Newt leaving his mother's home and saying goodbye to a young Jake Spoon were incredibly heartbreaking. These were not characters I cared about when I read the book I was much more interested in the Comanches but in the movie the brilliant performances really made me care.All in all I think COMANCHE MOON the movie is really a very successful film  if you take it on its own terms and don't compare it to the book.".

Captain Scull and his sexy wife Inez are both annoying cartoon characters in the book but Val Kilmer and Rachel Griffiths really succeed in making them not only charismatic and funny but strangely likable as well. It's interesting to note that in the book Inez Scull takes no part in any action outside of the bedroom but in the movie she is far braver. During the Great Raid she actually joins the Rangers in fighting off the Comanches with a rifle! Normally I hate when these changes happen but here I felt it was right for the character and added a dimension of courage along with her cruelty.Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are both terrific as Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call but what really surprised me was how much Elizabeth Banks did as Maggie Tilton the mother of Call's son Newt. In the books I always visualized Maggie as sort of drab and hopeless but in the movie she's practically radiant full of courage and good cheer no matter what the circumstances. Whether a real prostitute on the frontier would glow like Elizabeth Banks is another question. But it was nice to see that Maggie was more than just a victim. And some of the final scenes with Newt leaving his mother's home and saying goodbye to a young Jake Spoon were incredibly heartbreaking. These were not characters I cared about when I read the book I was much more interested in the Comanches but in the movie the brilliant performances really made me care.All in all I think COMANCHE MOON the movie is really a very successful film  if you take it on its own terms and don't compare it to the book.";

	schema:headline " Agreed It's No 'Lonesome Dove'' But It Still Has Merit";
	schema:reviewBody "I think the consensus is pretty unanimous about this recent TV miniseries it's okay but it's a far cry from Lonesome Dove. It gets compared to the latter simply because this a prequel to that famous story. Commanche Moon is definitely worth a watch for any fan of westerns. Just don't expect it to be as intense as Lonesome Dove. Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are not Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones and the characters they play aren't as strong as how Duvall and Jones portrayed the same two guys. Some say it's unfair to criticize this movie because of the comparison but you have to compare it  it's the story of the same two leading Texas Ranger characters Woodrow Call and Gus McCrae.The main difference I found was that this prequel is a lot of slower and more relational the two Rangers and their women at times. Yet I didn't mind that because the two main women were pretty ladies and generally likable and agreeable people. They were played nicely by Linda Cardelini Clara Forsythe and Elizabeth Banks Maggie... They helped make this long movie palatable. If you've seen pictures of women in the Old West none of them looked half as pretty as Cardelini and Banks though. They were a joy for these male eyes to ogle. Maggie's son Newt was a wonderful kid too  the kind of boy every parent would want..The most interesting character I thought turned out to be Inish Scull played by Val Kilmer. As in the western film Tombstone Kilmer almost steals the show from the leads. Scull is really an original if I ever saw one a strange dude indeed. Actually all of the supporting actors in here did a fine job from Keith Robinson's Deets to Wes Studi as Buffalo Hump. I always find Studi to be fascinating no matter what role he plays. I wish he had had a bigger role in this miniseries.One thing this film has in common with Lonesome Dove and other good westerns the scenery and photography. It's just beautiful at times and is a joy to watch. We also have an excellent director of this film Simon Wincer who directed Lonesome Dove and an another outstanding TV western Crossfire Trail. He also did two of my other favorite feature films both based in his home country of Australia Phar Lap and Quigley Down Under.Unfortunately although I enjoyed this Commanche Moon is nothing as good as the abovementioned films.Yet I still watched all of it and was sorry it ended if that makes any sense. It made me want to watch Woodrow and Gus again this time with Tommy Lee and Robert.Note The title page says this is 360 minutes. That must have included the TV commercials. The twodisc DVD version I saw was about 4 hours and 40 minutes.".

	schema:reviewBody "I'm not sure this review contains spoilers but I'm playing it safe by indicating there might be. Regardless it's unlikely anyone will watch this film who isn't familiar with the book.There's an old wisecrack about laboring mightily and bringing forth a mouse. Comanche Moon is such a mouse.The novel focuses more on the Indians than the Americans. In adapting it for TV McMurtry and Osanna rightly reasoned that the audience would be more interested in the whites than the reds. Unfortunately there's little in the novel that we don't already know about Gus Woodrow and their friends. So the movie gives us mostly a portentous prehash of what will occur in Lonesome Dove. The Indians  who have their own story to tell  are largely relegated to the background  so much so that someone who hasn't read the novel will rightly wonder why it's titled Comanche Moon.The novel has no overall story line or much of a point. This could have been fixed in the movie by more strongly drawing the contrast between the Indians losing their lands and way of life to the encroaching Americans who bring civilization. This opportunity was missed.Unlike Lonesome Dove Comanche Moon has few extended scenes that develop character or relationships  at least among the Americans. The extended scenes with the Indians have been largely removed or shortened. And for a net fourhour film it is remarkably episodic and choppy. One gets the feeling the script was originally longer and cut to reduce production costs.The screenplay comprises mostly clichd dialog aphorisms and platitudes. Coming from the author of The Last Picture Show it's a startlingly bad script. McMurtry and Osanna had the opportunity to fix problems with the story and characterizations but did not.Some of the best dialog from the novel is missing or altered for no obvious reason. For example Clara Cassie shows her intense hatred of Woodrow Jack by condemning Gus Ennis for always running off to be with his pard. That tart little revelation of Clara's sexual jealously is gone. Then there's the scene where the urdense Woodrow warns Maggie not to let Jake Spoon compromise her. The exchange in the novel is shorter and harsher the film tones it down and doesn't portray Woodrow as quite the socially stupid emotionally frozen stone he is. When I read that scene in the novel I wanted to punch Woodrow in the stomach  or worse.There are other changes some of them understandable. Inish Scull's eyelids are not cut off to do so would like have required expensive CGI. But Buffalo Hump has no hump! Perhaps it was felt unreasonable to ask Wes Studi to schlep around such a huge prosthesis. And Buffalo Hump's character is kindler and gentler. He is nowhere nearly as grotesquely violent as he was in the novels.The only good thing about this nearturkey is Steve Zahn's remarkable performance  not so much as Gus McCrae but as Robert Duvall playing Gus McCrae. It is uncanny. He perfectly duplicates Duvall's mannerisms and manner of speech without ever appearing deliberate or selfconscious. As was Duvall he is wholly within the character. And he actually shows us Gus becoming more Gus in the third part of the film.The best thing about Comanche Moon is that it won't spoil your affection for Lonesome Dove not just a great Western but a great American film.PS For those who think Rachel Griffiths was over the top  that's the way she was in the book.".

One gets the feeling the script was originally longer and cut to reduce production costs.The screenplay comprises mostly clichd dialog aphorisms and platitudes. Coming from the author of The Last Picture Show it's a startlingly bad script. McMurtry and Osanna had the opportunity to fix problems with the story and characterizations but did not.Some of the best dialog from the novel is missing or altered for no obvious reason. For example Clara Cassie shows her intense hatred of Woodrow Jack by condemning Gus Ennis for always running off to be with his pard. That tart little revelation of Clara's sexual jealously is gone. Then there's the scene where the urdense Woodrow warns Maggie not to let Jake Spoon compromise her. The exchange in the novel is shorter and harsher the film tones it down and doesn't portray Woodrow as quite the socially stupid emotionally frozen stone he is. When I read that scene in the novel I wanted to punch Woodrow in the stomach  or worse.There are other changes some of them understandable. Inish Scull's eyelids are not cut off to do so would like have required expensive CGI. But Buffalo Hump has no hump! Perhaps it was felt unreasonable to ask Wes Studi to schlep around such a huge prosthesis. And Buffalo Hump's character is kindler and gentler. He is nowhere nearly as grotesquely violent as he was in the novels.The only good thing about this nearturkey is Steve Zahn's remarkable performance  not so much as Gus McCrae but as Robert Duvall playing Gus McCrae. It is uncanny. He perfectly duplicates Duvall's mannerisms and manner of speech without ever appearing deliberate or selfconscious. As was Duvall he is wholly within the character. And he actually shows us Gus becoming more Gus in the third part of the film.The best thing about Comanche Moon is that it won't spoil your affection for Lonesome Dove not just a great Western but a great American film.PS For those who think Rachel Griffiths was over the top  that's the way she was in the book.";

My impression is that the overwhelming vote of those who chose to write was less than a 4.0.This got me to wondering about the process that yields a 9 rating. If the people giving the 10s and 9s do not take the time to justify their vote is the ballot box being stuffed by people with a monetary motivation? I have long used IMDb as one tool to screen movies and thought it the best available. Now I am not so sure.".

	schema:headline " Comanche Moon is informative if you watch out for historical inaccuracies";
	schema:reviewBody "First of all I did not read the book but I am now planning to. I would praise this miniseries most for the inclusion of the Comanche language and I hope it is authentic. Any comments out there on that? The custom of torturing captives spread northward from the Aztecs who conquered other tribes in central Mexico and butchered thousands of people on their hideous sun god altars. The custom of scalping was introduced by the whites in Canada and New England and it spread westward. Prolonged and viciously cruel executions were the rule throughout civilized Europe and only in the late 19th and 20th centuries has humanity made a concerted effort to be rid of them despite the appalling atrocities of the Holocaust... enough said the things to watch out for in Comanche moon are first the alleged cooperation of the Texas Rangers with the occupying Yankee troops during Reconstruction. The Rangers were regarded as an armed Confederate force and were officially disbanded during this period. Documentations of their activities as an outlawed organization are extremely scarce. Many of them hired out as gunmen for the cattle barons against rustlers who were running cattle across the Rio Grande. Mexican hacienda owners and ranchers in Nuevo Leon had had their livestock decimated by a series of wars and they bought cattle no questions asked. Other rustlers stole cattle in Mexico and sold them to the Texas barons. The Mexican government complained in 1878. The Texas Rangers who fought the Mexican rustlers were unrestrained by any court system and they were brutal to the Texas Mexican population. They chased suspected rustlers into Mexico and shot them for resisting arrest. They often behaved as badly as the Mexican War's notorious rackensackers who were Rangers and their imitators who invaded with General Taylor in the north. They were so abusive of civilians that Taylor almost sent them home in disgrace but rescinded the order when his forces were vastly outnumbered by General Santa Anna's army. Another thing to watch out for in Comanche Moon is the depiction of Cynthia Parker. When she is recovered by the Texans a little inaccuracy is excusable but it shows her with long hair and later her husband the warrior Peta Nocoma is shown as still alive. Peta Nocoma died from an infected wound before Cynthia Ann was recoveredand she had cut her hair very short a sign of mourning. Personally I think this production is yet another gringo view of Texas history with hardly any presence of Mexican Texans in it but for a typically stereotypical Mexican bandit El Ahumado... and those cages on pulley masts hanging over the side of a cliff are ridiculous. Was this guy supposed to be an engineer? And where would he get those tall trees to make into masts in that part of the country? However I praise the author's desire to include authentic wildlife of the period which have mostly vanished today. Yes the jaguar did range that far north but it was nocturnal.

	onyx:emotionText "First of all I did not read the book but I am now planning to. I would praise this miniseries most for the inclusion of the Comanche language and I hope it is authentic. Any comments out there on that? The custom of torturing captives spread northward from the Aztecs who conquered other tribes in central Mexico and butchered thousands of people on their hideous sun god altars. The custom of scalping was introduced by the whites in Canada and New England and it spread westward. Prolonged and viciously cruel executions were the rule throughout civilized Europe and only in the late 19th and 20th centuries has humanity made a concerted effort to be rid of them despite the appalling atrocities of the Holocaust... enough said the things to watch out for in Comanche moon are first the alleged cooperation of the Texas Rangers with the occupying Yankee troops during Reconstruction. The Rangers were regarded as an armed Confederate force and were officially disbanded during this period. Documentations of their activities as an outlawed organization are extremely scarce. Many of them hired out as gunmen for the cattle barons against rustlers who were running cattle across the Rio Grande. Mexican hacienda owners and ranchers in Nuevo Leon had had their livestock decimated by a series of wars and they bought cattle no questions asked. Other rustlers stole cattle in Mexico and sold them to the Texas barons. The Mexican government complained in 1878. The Texas Rangers who fought the Mexican rustlers were unrestrained by any court system and they were brutal to the Texas Mexican population. They chased suspected rustlers into Mexico and shot them for resisting arrest. They often behaved as badly as the Mexican War's notorious rackensackers who were Rangers and their imitators who invaded with General Taylor in the north. They were so abusive of civilians that Taylor almost sent them home in disgrace but rescinded the order when his forces were vastly outnumbered by General Santa Anna's army. Another thing to watch out for in Comanche Moon is the depiction of Cynthia Parker. When she is recovered by the Texans a little inaccuracy is excusable but it shows her with long hair and later her husband the warrior Peta Nocoma is shown as still alive. Peta Nocoma died from an infected wound before Cynthia Ann was recoveredand she had cut her hair very short a sign of mourning. Personally I think this production is yet another gringo view of Texas history with hardly any presence of Mexican Texans in it but for a typically stereotypical Mexican bandit El Ahumado... and those cages on pulley masts hanging over the side of a cliff are ridiculous. Was this guy supposed to be an engineer? And where would he get those tall trees to make into masts in that part of the country? However I praise the author's desire to include authentic wildlife of the period which have mostly vanished today. Yes the jaguar did range that far north but it was nocturnal. A daytime attack by a big cat would have more likely been a puma. And there was a parrot that lived in canyons and dive bombed any creature or person that got too close to its nest. It is now gone too. There is a scene in an Indian village with the Indians dying of cholera. SMALLPOX!

It was a disjointed rambling incoherent story. Plot lines were not developed action scenes were almost laughable and the big ending disappointment was a fitting ending to this miniseries. Val Kilmer who I have thought as a reputable actor played one of the strangest roles that I have ever seen him in. His final scene in the show had to have been a filler by the director.

Don't know if McMurtry did the screen play but the dialog was terrible. Really like Val Kilmer's portrayal of Doc Holiday in Wyatt Earp but what in heck was he doing with this character in Comanche Moon??? I have no idea. Even looked like it was shot on a sound stage using the old Bonanza sets. How can the director of the original Lonesome Dove gone so wrong with this? Where was his head.............. Can't say much for the acting either. It's a shame to have messed up such a beautiful western that could have been but more like they rushed this one just to get it in the can. Have read other reviews and see that others felt the same way. Not even curious to watch the next few nights cause it would be just a waste of time like the first night was.2nd post..................OK since nothing else was on TV I must be honest and admit that I watched the last 2 nights of Comanche Moon. And I will be honest to tell you that I didn't make it to the end of either of the last 2 episodes because I fell asleep! I can only admit that I was watching the two main characters very closely and I could pick out some mannerisms that Steve Zahn did while portraying the character that Duval did such an excellent job with. So I must give Zahn credit for that. As for Karl Urban's portrayal....simple dead meat. Can only say again that I was very disappointed only because I cared so much for the original LD and like others .......have defended my feelings for a truly great western.".

Karl Urban is easily one of the best Woodrow Call's ever portrayed his performance stands up to Tommy Lee Jones portrayal and maybe actually even betters it. What makes this movie so outstanding is the level of respect that comes across it's well down and is respectful to the book from which it is based on.

And realizing that most sequels in this case a prequel are certain to disappoint my expectations were low. Comanche Moon met that expectation with its marginal directing and acting poor casting and frankly a lousy script. Lonesome Dove created western heroes of Captains McCrae and Call due to incredibly strong performances by Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones. Prior to living in Lonesome Dove we believed they bravely fought to rid Texas of bandits and savage Indians during their rangering years. If I had only seen Comanche Moon I would think these two boneheads were a couple of incompetent cowardly idiots. In Lonesome Dove Call and McCrae supposedly chased Blue Duck all over Texas and never managed to capture or kill him. In Comanche Moon a shot to Call's boot heel convinced him to settle down and raise cattle. There wasn't a decent fistfight or gun fight in the entire miniseries. The best punch was McCrea sucker punching Inez Scull a funny scene but out of character for McCrae.Where was McCrae's wit and charm? Clara's love for McCrae a drunken unshaven slob and philanderer was completely implausible. And Maggie's love for Call a dispassionate and sullen loner defies logic. The cinematography was excellent superior to the original. Credit goes not only to HD technology but the cinematographer. The Comanche Moon miniseries was better than anything else on TV for three nights but sadly that's not saying much.".

In summary this show is funnier in 25 minutes than SNL in an hour so lets hope Talk Show gets the attention it deserves such as an extra half hour more money and a band.".

He is quickminded and each segment and section rolls into one another smoothly. It also doesn't hurt that he's kinda sexy in a nerdy type of way so he's not hard on the eyes like Leno or Letterman.

Though it's too early to say that this show seems to be devoid of any intellectual pretension most talk shows try so hard to project and I hope that that is what would make this show different from all the rest. I hope that this show will last long!Returning back after months I still love this show and I love his selfdeprecating humor For example his affirmation that only pothead loners would be home to watch his show at Saturday midnight and thus the jokes are funny only to the stoned guys which however does not involve the usual monkeying of Conan O'Brien for example I know it's a cardinal sin to be repelled by O'Brien's antics but I do really dislike his style and repetitiveness. I again watched it the other night with Tom Arnold in it. Ferensen's spoof of Trading Spouses and Nanny 911 in an earlier episode are hilarious. Idiot paparazzi are fun especially when a security guard cautions them against taking people's pictures and if I am not mistaken they start taking his pictures shouting Gary Coleman.Added on 16th April 2007 Coming back once again I am left confused by the neighbor and her dog. I cannot decide if it is a joke or a real thing. Either way it was funny as hell.I do not expect Spike Feresten to read these pages but maybe he does. He is crazier than a bunch of monkeys and so I would better write down my suggestion here for him I would like him to do a full 30 minute show with Crazy Gideon the star of late night TV commercial. I would like Crazy Gideon to have an interview in Spike's talk show sing a song and play guitar do a skit in the line of SNL and also to answer questions from the audience regarding his potential mayorship of Los Angeles I know Crazy Gideon may not be aware of this but there are websites detailing why he would be the perfect candidate for the post of the mayor of LA.God willing!Returning back on 14th July 2007 Someone wrote here that the people who praised Spike's talkshow must be bribed by Spike. I confess that Spike really bribed me but I must also confess that Rockefeller named me in his will and last night I had sex with Cindy Crowford.".

As Stu Michael Imperioli delivers an engaging and credible performance capturing the essence of a life spiraling out of control from the craving of highstakes gambling. The cast surrounding Imperioli is excellent especially veteran actor Pat Morita who plays a Las Vegas gambling impresario. The film's production values fall somewhere between a competent madefortelevision movie and a workmanlike lowbudget feature film attempting valiantly to convey the period styles of the final four decades of the twentieth century. There is one revealing scene with documentary footage of the classic Las Vegas Sands Hotel being imploded and crashing to the ground. That moment vividly sums up of the sad life of Stu Ungar.".

	schema:reviewBody "You would have thought that this biographical film about Stu Unger one of the greatest card players ever had great dramatic potential but this movie turns out to be a most undramatic undertaking. The plot device is to have Unger sit on a bed in some fleabag motel room and tell his story to a mysterious stranger. The story is told in linear flashbacks intercut with much talk in the motel room. I always get suspicious when a screenwriter has a character talk about himself rather than being able to formulate a scene to more effectively make the point or at least have the character talking within the context of a scene rather than talking about a scene.This is a movie about a person and his profession. We get a lot of stuff about the person  teased kid difficult father marriage child divorce drugs  but not much about the profession. As presented this is the life's arc of a not atypical contemporary American and it is not all that interesting. The focus should not be on why this guy was ordinary but rather why he was extraordinary. This is like offering a biography of Einstein but never drawing us in with an understanding of his professional accomplishments and his genius. Many opportunities are missed to provide some excitement tension and interest. At least some intense buildup should have been given to Unger's winning his first World Series of Poker climaxed with his going headtohead with poker legend Doyle Brunson. That scene was disappointingly uninspired. My god how could they flub that so badly?A political party will play to its base and why this movie failed so miserably to play to its base of poker players is a mystery. Maybe it did not want to glorify gambling and it does not but using Unger as a poster boy for the evils of gambling is misguided  he was such an unusual person that drawing any general conclusions is questionable. In any case most drug addicts will not fare well at the tables and the fact that Unger could come back to win the WSOP in 1997 is an amazing feat. It has always puzzled me why passionate professional gamblers are considered addicts and cast in a negative light but those who pursue other professions to the exclusion of most all else are accorded esteem.Some have honored this film for not sugarcoating Ungar's slide toward addiction and death. But from reading about Ungar's life it sounds like his womanizing surly behavior and drug use were much worse than portrayed. In fact I got more from reading the wikipedia entry on Ungar than I did from this film so go there if you want to save yourself some time.Never having seen The Sopranos I had never seen any of these actors before and my reaction was not bad but not great.If you want to see a much more perceptive character study of a gambler see Philip Seymore Hoffman in the underappreciated Owning Mahoney.".

What a major letdown!All of the intriguing things about Stu Ungar were skimmed over quickly and instead I was left with a biopic that could have been about anybody. Ungar may have been a burntout jerk but he was also a brilliant thinker that could read people instinctively. That is what made him so fascinating. Why not focus on that?And talk about watering down the real truth. This guy was excessive about absolutely everything drugs women gambling starvation sleepdeprivation. He gambled on sporting events from dusk to dawn he would go missing for days while hanging out in crack dens his body was perpetually emaciated and yet if he ever needed money he could always beat just about anyone at will playing cards. Now that's a story!Too much time spent on his childhood and personal relationships although his ties with Vincent and his daughter were hardly touched on and hardly anything about his drugs use which was exorbitant his insane gambling and his incredible cardplaying abilities.Probably too late now but I hope someone remakes this film properly. I had no problem with Imperioli. He is excellent. The script just left him with nothing interesting to say.".

The talents of Imperioli Renee Faia and some of the supporting cast Steve Schirripa natch are the only things that keep this from a 1 rating. All of their good work is nearly offset though by the atrocious job of portraying the boy Stuey.

I am a poker player and a fan of poker in general and was extremely excited to hear that a movie about arguably the greatest player ever had been made. All this movie does is gloss over his life. The poker scenes never last more than 1 or 2 hands so there is no depiction of the flow or struggle experienced in large tournaments like the WSOP. His well known struggle with drugs is barely even touched. In real life the guy had to have surgery done on his nose because he snorted so much coke that he ate through the cartilage and then he started smoking crack to avoid damaging it further. In the movie there is only one scene of him snorting coke. Not a thing is mentioned about his step son who killed himself which sent Stuey further into self destructive behaviors why would such a crucial life moment be left out? Also towards the end the movie gives the impression that Stu is recovering. There are multiple scenes of him being rehabilitated by his Vegas friend who tries to show him how to live a normal life and it seems to be working. Then it jumps to Stuey dying in his hotel room to end the movie. What the hell? Show the downswing! As far as I am concerned a legit Stuey Ungar movie has yet to be made. I blame the writing even with quality actors like Micheal Imperioli this script fails to tell an accurate story. I realize things need to be changed a bit for a Hollywood movie but this falls so short that it gives a false interpretation of Stuey's life and I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about Stu Ungar.".

The film never tries to break the mold or do anything original. It simply sleep walks its way through the script. The ending is disappointing and never really looks deep into Ungar's mind. Instead it focuses on what was already obvious. He was a drugged out card player with an average life not unlike any other average joe in vegas. The movie focuses on the aspects of his life that were UN extraordinary rather than the Extraordinary. The poker scenes in the entire film add up to about 4 minutes of footage. Ungar's achievements of winning the WSOP 3 times seem life after thoughts. A 10 year old could do a better job directing this movie.. or maybe it was the script being a piece of crap from the beginning that doomed this joke of a movie.If you want to see a film about gambling watch Rounders.

Ungar's achievements of winning the WSOP 3 times seem life after thoughts. A 10 year old could do a better job directing this movie.. or maybe it was the script being a piece of crap from the beginning that doomed this joke of a movie.If you want to see a film about gambling watch Rounders. It at least has style.";

	schema:reviewBody "It has been quite some time since I last saw this film. However the amazingly low IMDB score has prompted me to jot down a few thoughts and memories I have regarding this underappreciated masterpiece.I find it appalling that this film would score so poorly in this arena. It is a wonderful life affirming story with a positive message. Perhaps this is what we have come to. The comedy is not gross enough the message too sentimental and the meaning too simple for modern sophisticated audiences. Well I for one absolutely loved every minute of it. It is easily Andie MacDowell's best performance. William Hurt is fantastic as the cynic who comes around in the end and the whole supporting cast does a wonderful job. Of course John Travolta is superb. This is one of my favorite roles Travolta has played and it is simply resplendent. I would have to say this is in my top twenty of comedydramas ever. I just happen to love the way the film unapologetically illustrates how wonderful life is. How even the little things that we take for granted like pie are fantastic and how we should enjoy every minute like it was our last.For a much more detailed and well written review see the fine work of jhclues who echoes my feelings about the movie so much that I feel it would be redundant of me to restate probably poorly all that they have already committed to page.It is also interesting that so many people really hated it. I wonder if they weren't just put off by the less than traditional view of a religious subject.".

However the amazingly low IMDB score has prompted me to jot down a few thoughts and memories I have regarding this underappreciated masterpiece.I find it appalling that this film would score so poorly in this arena. It is a wonderful life affirming story with a positive message. Perhaps this is what we have come to. The comedy is not gross enough the message too sentimental and the meaning too simple for modern sophisticated audiences. Well I for one absolutely loved every minute of it. It is easily Andie MacDowell's best performance. William Hurt is fantastic as the cynic who comes around in the end and the whole supporting cast does a wonderful job.

	schema:headline " He's Not That Kind Of Angel";
	schema:reviewBody "Director Nora Ephron whose forte is romantic comedy takes a slightly different tack with this comedydrama which is certainly romantic but with a bit of a twist because this one relies somewhat on divine intervention as the means by which some people who have seemingly lost their way are finally steered in the right direction.  Or a' direction at least for when it comes to life and love who really knows?  And the real question is does it make a difference if you believe in angels?  A possible answer lies in Ephron's entertaining and ultimately touching film Michael' in which she asks you to be a believer and if you can it'll loose the magic upon the screen and you'll be treated to a satisfying cinematic experience courtesy of Ephron's insights into human nature and a guy who just may or may not be one of those most ecclesiastical of creatures an angel.When Frank Quinlan William Hurt a reporter for a national tabloid based in Chicago gets a letter from a woman in Iowa named Pansy Milbank Jean Stapleton who claims that an angel has been living with her for the past six months Frank's editor Vartan Malt Bob Hoskins dispatches him forthwith to the woman's residence the Milk Bottle Inn which she owns to check it out.  Accompanying him is fellow reporter Huey Driscoll Robert Pastorelli and a newcomer to the team Dorothy Winters Andie MacDowell who is supposedly an expert' on angels.  What they expect to find when they get there is anybody's guess but if it's someone with a halo and the proverbial inner light' they are about to be sorely disappointed because when they finally meet Michael John Travolta complete with wings but are they real? he's well as Michael tells them right off himself I'm not that kind of angel'  And for Frank Dorothy and Huey it's the beginning of a journey of sorts as they endeavor to take Michael back to Chicago with them hoping to learn all they can about him along the way.  But more importantly learning some things about themselves and each other at the same time.By due process and by citing previous works of excellence like Sleepless In Seattle' and You've Got Mail' Ephron can stake a claim to the territorial rights of MattersoftheHeart stories and win hands down.  Wry and subtle observations on love and relationships are her trademark she knows how to make her characters and situations credible and moreover how to present it all in such a way that it makes a real connection with her audience.  She makes it look easy but make no mistake there's a fine art to what she does.  The fact that she can not only entertain but touch her audiences in film after film clearly demonstrates that she's got what it takes to create and deliver a movie with some real substance coated as it may be with some lighthearted sentiment just call it the icing on the cake if you will.  And a big part of her success comes from knowing what makes her characters tick and making them people with whom the audience can identify and relate.  Even when the story is a little bit quirky and just slightly offcenter as is the case with this film.John Travolta as an angel?  Well make that an Arch'angel and not just any old Archangel this is Michael the very same angel who fought Beelzebub and cast him so he claims from Heaven.  And as embodied by Travolta this is Michael the warrior who exists to do battle with any enemy and put matters to right and Travolta makes it work by creating an angel' like none you've ever seen before.  His Michael is rather unkempt and slovenly he smokes and has a penchant for sugar.  He also likes to laugh and dance and he appreciates the wonders and the beauty of the earth.  Whoever he is there's a depth of humanity there which Travolta manages to bring to the fore of what turns out to be a rather complex and challenging character. It's a solid performance by the charismatic Travolta who makes Michael a truly memorable character and in turn a memorable film.Hurt does a good job as well as the jaded Frank Quinlan a guy obviously looking for something but unaware of what it is or even that he is in fact searching.  Hurt successfully captures the laconic essence at the heart of his character but tempers him with just enough spirit to keep him interesting and a person who though not necessarily likable is one you come to feel is at least salvageable as a human being.

In the end whether or not this film makes you believe in angels is a moot point because Michael' is an engaging film that reaffirms the indomitability of the human spirit.  And if not angels that is something everyone can believe in or at least hope for.  It's Nora Ephron's way of saying that this old world is going to be around for awhile.  And it's good. It is in fact the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 810.".

	onyx:emotionText "Director Nora Ephron whose forte is romantic comedy takes a slightly different tack with this comedydrama which is certainly romantic but with a bit of a twist because this one relies somewhat on divine intervention as the means by which some people who have seemingly lost their way are finally steered in the right direction.  Or a' direction at least for when it comes to life and love who really knows?  And the real question is does it make a difference if you believe in angels?  A possible answer lies in Ephron's entertaining and ultimately touching film Michael' in which she asks you to be a believer and if you can it'll loose the magic upon the screen and you'll be treated to a satisfying cinematic experience courtesy of Ephron's insights into human nature and a guy who just may or may not be one of those most ecclesiastical of creatures an angel.When Frank Quinlan William Hurt a reporter for a national tabloid based in Chicago gets a letter from a woman in Iowa named Pansy Milbank Jean Stapleton who claims that an angel has been living with her for the past six months Frank's editor Vartan Malt Bob Hoskins dispatches him forthwith to the woman's residence the Milk Bottle Inn which she owns to check it out.  Accompanying him is fellow reporter Huey Driscoll Robert Pastorelli and a newcomer to the team Dorothy Winters Andie MacDowell who is supposedly an expert' on angels.  What they expect to find when they get there is anybody's guess but if it's someone with a halo and the proverbial inner light' they are about to be sorely disappointed because when they finally meet Michael John Travolta complete with wings but are they real? he's well as Michael tells them right off himself I'm not that kind of angel'  And for Frank Dorothy and Huey it's the beginning of a journey of sorts as they endeavor to take Michael back to Chicago with them hoping to learn all they can about him along the way.  But more importantly learning some things about themselves and each other at the same time.By due process and by citing previous works of excellence like Sleepless In Seattle' and You've Got Mail' Ephron can stake a claim to the territorial rights of MattersoftheHeart stories and win hands down.  Wry and subtle observations on love and relationships are her trademark she knows how to make her characters and situations credible and moreover how to present it all in such a way that it makes a real connection with her audience.  She makes it look easy but make no mistake there's a fine art to what she does.  The fact that she can not only entertain but touch her audiences in film after film clearly demonstrates that she's got what it takes to create and deliver a movie with some real substance coated as it may be with some lighthearted sentiment just call it the icing on the cake if you will.  And a big part of her success comes from knowing what makes her characters tick and making them people with whom the audience can identify and relate.  Even when the story is a little bit quirky and just slightly offcenter as is the case with this film.John Travolta as an angel?  Well make that an Arch'angel and not just any old Archangel this is Michael the very same angel who fought Beelzebub and cast him so he claims from Heaven.  And as embodied by Travolta this is Michael the warrior who exists to do battle with any enemy and put matters to right and Travolta makes it work by creating an angel' like none you've ever seen before.  His Michael is rather unkempt and slovenly he smokes and has a penchant for sugar.  He also likes to laugh and dance and he appreciates the wonders and the beauty of the earth.  Whoever he is there's a depth of humanity there which Travolta manages to bring to the fore of what turns out to be a rather complex and challenging character. It's a solid performance by the charismatic Travolta who makes Michael a truly memorable character and in turn a memorable film.Hurt does a good job as well as the jaded Frank Quinlan a guy obviously looking for something but unaware of what it is or even that he is in fact searching.  Hurt successfully captures the laconic essence at the heart of his character but tempers him with just enough spirit to keep him interesting and a person who though not necessarily likable is one you come to feel is at least salvageable as a human being.  In the end he actually becomes someone you can root for though initially Frank is rather offputting.  The important thing is Hurt presents Frank in a way that touches a nerve and it demonstrates that connection Ephron makes with the audience through her characters.MacDowell gives a strong performance too though rather retiring and less than spirited but then again that's who her character is and she plays it quite well.

John Hurt is very low keyed in his role as chief reporter for Chicago Tabloid owner Bob Hoskins.  Angie MacDowell plays role much as she did her role in Four Weddings and a Funeral.  Maureen Stapleton is neat in a cameo.  Her comment Michael doesn't suffer fools is just one of many memorable moments.  Bob Hoskins is the only one of the lead performers who fails to connect a little to off the wall. Mainly you're there to see Michael take on a bull mesmerize the waitresses and lady dancers at a western style restaurant and fully demonstrate that he is complete free soul.  It is a memorable comedy that is worth more than one viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frank Quinlan and Huey Driscoll are reporters for a trashy tabloid paper who are on a bad run of bad stories. When their editor lays down an ultimatum to them they bring him a potentially great story  a real life angel. They are accompanied by a supposed angel expert Dorothy Winters who has really been sent to keep an eye on the reporters for editor Vartan Malt. When they arrive they find the 'angel' to appear to be genuine but to be a lot less well angelic than they expected him to be  smoking drinking and womanising. Michael agrees to go back to Chicago and be in the papers but only if they can travel back by road and make stops along the way. As Michael gets his traveling companions in and out of trouble it begins to seem that he may actually have a bigger aim to achieve than just getting into the papers.In the UK it is not the 'done thing' to cheer clap or deride films or trailers in a very public way in the same manner as US audiences will do as the norm my first time in a US cinema was a surprise when the audience applauded but it is the reason I will always remember this film. When the trailer was shown in the UK the audience I was with actually jeered and booed it myself included because it just looked so damn lame and stupid. So I skipped it in the cinema as many did but then caught it on TV a few years later. Although it is far from a perfect film and its mood and tone are poorly matched it is actually nowhere near as bad as it looked. The story is the usual earthbound angel stuff that Hollywood seems to quite like and it meanders along rather aimlessly turning into a very vague road movie of sorts. The romance is obvious and uninspiring but generally the film is fun when it manages to have it's tongue in its cheek.The problem is that it can't decide if it wants to be sappy and romantic or daffy fun. When it tries to be more of a traditional Hollywood romance it doesn't really work that well and indeed is rather laboured. However when it just gets silly and focuses on a really tongue in cheek Michael then it is much more enjoyable as long as you can buy into the sense of humour that it is selling. These two styles don't really come together and they give the film a rather fragmented feel that takes away from the fun if silly aspect that stood a good chance of really working if given a little bit more dominance in the film. Sadly the film falls back too much on sentimentality and it sours the mix because it is manufactured processed unengaging and quite forced.For the same reason the performances are mixed. For the most part Travolta is quite funny and just appears to be taking the pss and enjoying himself  the way he doesn't seem to take it seriously helped me enjoy the film a lot more. He is silly of course but I found this to be enjoyable in light of the more ponderous 'worthy' roles he has played in the years since his Pulp Fiction comeback. Lumbered with the promise of romance Hurt is not that good but is nicely cynical for the majority of the movie MacDowell is painfully lame at times and her character is pretty poor she is a big part of the reason why it is hard to really care about the romance in the story. Both Pastorelli and Hoskins seem to have fun and share a handful of good lines throughout the movie while little roles for other well known faces vary between the effective Joey Lauren Adams and the simply pointless did Richard Schiff really need work this badly?.Anyway the film is not great but it is not awful either. It's mix of the sappy and the silly is pretty badly done and I was left wanting a more engaging romance and a lot more of Travolta's mockingly silly performance. All told it is maybe worth a watch once but it is far from being a good film and if you don't like John Travolta's performance then there isn't a great deal else to watch it for.".

He is fantastic in this when he waltzes to the 'sound of the Earth'  and his dance scene at Joe's diner.

But Michael does things that an angel not fallen would never do and that completely blows any credibility the movie might have had. The other characters in the movie don't have much appeal either. Michael brings a dog back to life and we're supposed to be in awe of that. The people make up corny country songs. In the end Stapleton dances with Travolta. Big deal.

Well I guess the things that entertain some movie fans will turn off others. Some of the reviews here feel the picture denigrated the whole idea of 'angelic' angels but then again who wrote that rule book? I found it kind of cool that Michael Travolta remained true to a personal if I may be allowed to use the word personal referring to a heavenly host code of honor and sense of duty while accompanying Frank William Hurt Huey Robert Pastorelli and Dorothy Andie MacDowell on their quixotic journey. If one didn't know better you'd really believe there's such a thing as the world's biggest ball of twine and largest nonstick frying pan.I guess you can tell I liked this picture even if it's not in the same ballpark as say Casablanca or any other Top 100 film out there.

It is however uplifting to think that he had the chance to be a part of such a moving script and to be the catalyst of this ode to joyful old age that has not even started to make the waves it is about to create in North American repertoire cinema.After the international success of Jan Hrebejk's Divided We Fall 2000 it is starting to be clear that Czech cinema has indeed something to offer to the world.

From there you see Fanda's relationships with his wife best friend and son develop. It finally leads up to one of the best movie endings I have ever seen.The characters in this movie are rich and deep. They develop well through the course of the film. The movie has quite a range of moods. It goes from light and funny to grim and dark. Any slow parts for you in this film will be made up for in the end.Autumn Spring carries a similar message like a lot of other European movies do  don't lose sight of the small pleasures in life.

He lives in a very nice apartment with his wife of fortyfour years Emilie.  His son Jara covets the spacious apartment as a problemsolver as he needs to house one of his exwives and several of their children.  The son isn't a vicious schemer just a guy with one past spouse too many and a blind eye to the attachment his dad has for the flat which he moved into after relinquishing a previous residence to the son.Hana and his also elderly close friend Ed spend there more than ample free time doing small con jobs not for money but for the pleasure of putting one over on easily duped folks like estate agents.  A favorite ploy is for Hana to act the part of a retired divo of New York's Metropolitan Opera returning home in need of a sprawling mansion.  Ed is his companion as gullible realtors fall all over themselves proffering chauffeured limousines and fine French restaurant meals in hope of a lucrative sale.When not engaged in wellplanned scams the duo engage in quick ploys such as pretending to be railroad security agents so as to snatch kisses from breathless and ticketless teens trying to sneak onto trains.  Chaste kisses that is there's no lechery here.Hana's longsuffering wife is obsessed with saving enough money to insure that the couple individually and jointly have a grand funeral an event the lifeloving Frantisek is in no hurry to experience.Disagreements about money and Frantisek's promiscuous disposition of marital funds lead to a crisis whose resolution rings both real and endearing. Michalek fishes for the viewer's emotions but he does it openly honestly and effectively.Autumn Spring subtitled of course is a product of an increasingly vibrant Czech cinema.  It wasn't shown widely in the U.S. but its availability on DVD will hopefully bring this affecting flick to a wide audience.  Sadly Brodsky recently succumbed to cancer so this movie is a valedictory to a fine actor who imbued his character with a passion for life's pleasures that must have reflected the actor's own values.910.".

	schema:headline " Live don't merely exist";
	schema:reviewBody "The title of the film seems quite appropriate given the persona of the lead character Fanda. He's an older man living in the late autumn of his life yet frolics about as a jubilant school boy who's just entered a spring meadow. The frailties of old age and the warning signs of death are all illusions to him. His wife supports this idea when she observes Fanda laughs at funerals and death. In other words death is not something Fanda takes too seriously he has more important things to do than worry about what already is inevitable. Life however and the pursuit of living life to its fullest is the philosophy that governs Fanda's existence. He is not one to merely exist but must live for each day and each passing moment for tomorrow is not guaranteed. The film seems to make a strong commentary about living as though there is no tomorrow let alone death. Too many people take life much too seriously and consequently miss out on the actual living part of life. Fanda's wife for example she's so worried about preparing for death not in some religiously connotative way but in a far too practical even lifeless way that she forgets how to smile laugh and just have a good time. Her humanity seems to have transformed into zombie autopilot mode. Fanda to the contrary is perhaps too blithe and absentminded for his own good. He needs a person like his wife Emilie to help balance him. It's as though Fanda possesses the invincible spirit of a child like a kid trapped in an older man's body. He is introduced as the adventurous type he pretends to be people he's not in order to get gain squanders money factiously lies and is always up for a good laugh. Deepdown though he is a kindhearted and gentle old man who wishes to be submissive to his overly pragmatic wife. The two offset each other quite nicely though neither one of them truly appreciates the binary quality of their relationship until they metaphorically chance upon death meaning their divorce. It is during this courtroom scene that Fanda realizes the reality of death and what it means if he is separated from his only love. His wife emotionally recalls all of his flaws yet is tenderly drawn to continue to love him despite his crazy behavior. In this moment of her forgiving him Fanda realizes his selfish behavior of driving his wife bonkers and makes an internal commitment to make her happy. Ironically though after making this commitment he becomes what his wife later calls a living corpse. The lifeblood within him drains away as he becomes more like hera zombie going through daytoday motions. He doesn't seem to live anymore but exist. For example he gives up his zany pranks doesn't squander money quits smoking on account of his wife not his health and overall just acquiesces to whatever she wants of him. Succinctly put he changes on account of wanting to make her happy. Thus the binary quality of their relationship begins to slowly vanish. Realizing that her husband is not who he used to be there is a part of Emilie that misses the old Fanda. She misses her husband's aloofness and the fights they used to have because it was in those moments that they were truly living not just simply existing. I believe the filmmakers were trying to get across a specific message here that true and loving relationships will not always be easy or convenient but often times will take sacrifice and endurance to wade through the seemingly bad times. The possibility of death at any moment is what reminds people to live for every moment. Life is often taken for granted but when threatened with deathbe it literal or figurativepeople awake from their ungrateful slumbers and are aroused to start living life to its fullest. It's as though they are scared that they'll never live again so they better make the most of it while they have it. Fanda and Emilie had been married 44 years with fights along the way but it wasn't till they were both threatened with the possibility of deathlikeseparation that they began to show their true colors. As the old maxim goes Love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation. They both begin to see what matters most in life and that is the people they meet along the way. More importantly the intimate relationships they make with their significant others.".

His wife emotionally recalls all of his flaws yet is tenderly drawn to continue to love him despite his crazy behavior. In this moment of her forgiving him Fanda realizes his selfish behavior of driving his wife bonkers and makes an internal commitment to make her happy. Ironically though after making this commitment he becomes what his wife later calls a living corpse. The lifeblood within him drains away as he becomes more like hera zombie going through daytoday motions. He doesn't seem to live anymore but exist. For example he gives up his zany pranks doesn't squander money quits smoking on account of his wife not his health and overall just acquiesces to whatever she wants of him. Succinctly put he changes on account of wanting to make her happy. Thus the binary quality of their relationship begins to slowly vanish. Realizing that her husband is not who he used to be there is a part of Emilie that misses the old Fanda. She misses her husband's aloofness and the fights they used to have because it was in those moments that they were truly living not just simply existing. I believe the filmmakers were trying to get across a specific message here that true and loving relationships will not always be easy or convenient but often times will take sacrifice and endurance to wade through the seemingly bad times. The possibility of death at any moment is what reminds people to live for every moment. Life is often taken for granted but when threatened with deathbe it literal or figurativepeople awake from their ungrateful slumbers and are aroused to start living life to its fullest. It's as though they are scared that they'll never live again so they better make the most of it while they have it. Fanda and Emilie had been married 44 years with fights along the way but it wasn't till they were both threatened with the possibility of deathlikeseparation that they began to show their true colors. As the old maxim goes Love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation. They both begin to see what matters most in life and that is the people they meet along the way. More importantly the intimate relationships they make with their significant others.";

Neither Pepi Luci... nor Laberinto de pasiones tell any story in particular at least none that's interesting. They're rather a collection of gags and sketches that are meant to scandalize and to drive up the wall all that rightwinged people. Almodovar uses topics such as incest gay power Islamic terrorism drugs abuse... 100 punk attitude basically. And though Spain is much more liberal nowadays some of the passages of Almodovar's first movies couldn't be accepted by the society. How come? Well because of the political correction stuff isn't it some kind of censorship too?? I mean selfcensorship.Anyway this movies have to be understood in the right context just like John Water's first films.

Neither Pepi Luci... nor Laberinto de pasiones tell any story in particular at least none that's interesting. They're rather a collection of gags and sketches that are meant to scandalize and to drive up the wall all that rightwinged people. Almodovar uses topics such as incest gay power Islamic terrorism drugs abuse... 100 punk attitude basically. And though Spain is much more liberal nowadays some of the passages of Almodovar's first movies couldn't be accepted by the society. How come? Well because of the political correction stuff isn't it some kind of censorship too?? I mean selfcensorship.Anyway this movies have to be understood in the right context just like John Water's first films. If you don't take that into account you'd better go and watch any other thing.5.510";

We especially enjoyed the scene in which the transvestite is shooting a photo novel and while supposedly being menaced by a killer with an electric drill is told to answer the phone and say I can't talk to you right now I'm being attacked by a sadistic serial killer. If I survive I will call you back. That would make a great answering machine message come to think of it. We also loved the lady telling her new found beloved I went to an orgy after the concert but I couldn't stop thinking of you. I'm waiting to use that line on Twitter. Labyrinth of Passion is a rollicking farce with plenty of high jinks hilarious dialog and eye candy for everyone. The film has aged well the 1980s costumes and hairdos add to the wackiness. I would give it a 10 out of 10 rating but I am giving it a 8 for two reasons. The first is the scene which involves laxatives which includes a shot of a lady soiling herself totally unnecessary and it brings down the tone of the film to Hollywood grossout comedy for a moment. The second is the suggestion that Queti is sleeping with her father shocking yes but again it ruins the tone of the film. Still I would recommend the film to anyone who wants a sophisticated spicy and fun time.".

A couple of months ago I had seen 'Do You Remember Dolly Bell?' made one year earlier than the film of the Spaniard the first film of Kusturica now this one and beyond the similarities of the game of identifying in early works the spark of genius of the later great movies there is also an abyssal difference between the two. While Kustirica's movie show the restrains of the censorship his work was subjected to in the stillCommunist Yugoslavia Almodovar's film shouts FREEDOM.Indeed 'Laberinto de pasiones' is a film that could have been only in 1982 and in Spain. The young director seems to be drunken by the light and colors of a world that just woke up after several decades of dictatorship. His characters live in a Madrid that has become the heaven of all kinds of experiments  in music in love in the way people live. There is absolutely nothing that reminds the films of Carlos Saura or Bunuel the film is made by a young director whose career started with the liberation of Spain and who celebrates his freedom in making movies and experiments with characters and a social medium on the fringe.Did I already say that watching this film is fun? Just saying that one of the characters is the son of the Shah of TIran who happens to be gay but then is 'cured' by a nymphomaniac named Sexilia  you already got a feeling of the material Almodovar plays with. He also crosses the line to play a gay punk singer in travesty in one of the several delicacies of the film. Sure there is a lot of trash around and not all of it is that original but then you have Banderas playing a gay terrorist who falls for his target before knowing whom he gets in bed with. All the story is told with a kind of detachment that makes you feel the protective smile of the director when looking at his characters and actors.No this film is not a masterpiece and if I had seen it by or close to the time it was made I am not sure whether I would have liked it or identified the huge director Almodovar will become starting a few films later. If there is anything close in genre it is rather the low cost comedies that by that time I would have seen in Romania later the boorekas movies in Israel. There is however in this film enough craziness and bluntness to break away from the crowd and a hidden tear behind the laughs that I am pretty sure that could not have escaped me completely.".

	schema:reviewBody "Reviewing a film is also reviewing the period that a movie was made. And besides that it also said something about the reviewer himself. Laberinto de Pasiones was made in 1982. All kind of taboos were already broken in the late sixties and seventies by directors like Pasolini Verhoeven en Peckinpah to name just a few. In Spain the situation was different. Until 1975 the country was a dictatorship under General Franco a strict Roman Catholic. Censorship was common and Spain missed the cultural changes the rest of Western Europe made completely. So when Spain turned into a democracy after the death of Franco the new freedom people enjoyed led to a period in culture where all boundaries were explored. In Laberinto de Pasiones a lot of things are shown which wouldn't be possible under the regime of Franco. Homosexuality nymphomania and incest are just a few of the practices shown in this film.Of course I was aware of the films by Aldomovar I have seen Todo Sobre Mi Madre and Hable Con Ella which are excellent movies made by a mature director who understands human nature and is possible to combine drama with humor. I have also seen Atame! which shows the exploration of the sexual behavior of humans more than his later works. But I wasn't really prepared for the overflow of sexual perversions which is Laberinto. Aldomovar provokes here and he is exaggerating. Victims are the plot and the acting. As a viewer you're completely lost in about thirty story lines about people whose only purpose in life seems to be to fulfill their sexual obsessions. The mood of the film has most in common with the kind of movies that are not shown on IMDb seventies porn flicks and that is not a compliment to this film. It all looks very amateurish to me. On the contrary the movie is not without humor. The scene in the music venue were Aldomovar himself sings a song in drag is really hilarious and probably the highpoint of the film. And it is special to see a young Antonio Banderas as a gay special agent a role he wouldn't consider these days.So Laberinto de Pasiones is probably an important film to free Spain from some boundaries in their cultural mindset but that doesn't make it a good film. Mediocre acting a ramshackle plot and the mood of a porn movie prevents this from being an early hint of greatness of this director.".

You are in your thirties you have a wife a little boy and another baby on the way. One thing even though you have a green card you are still Egyptian. On transit you are asked to come with 2 security guards next thing you know you are overpowered hooded and chained and after a brief  but still reasonably civil interrogation you are to be rendered! This is what happens to Anwar el Ibrahimi at the beginning of the movie. His is a story of pain and  literally torture. It's one of several story lines. One follows his wife's attempts to get more information. One follows the cold bureaucrats behind the rendition. Another story deals with the family of the man who leads the interrogation of Anwar el Ibrahimi. There are some other stories too and by the end they all neatly come together. Though the more famous actors like Reese Witherspoon  as the distraught pregnant wife  Jake Gyllenhaal  as the CIA rookie forced to watch the interrogation in Northern Africa and Meryl Streep  as CIA hotshot Corine Whitman it is really the more unknown actors that carry the story and give it it's heart. For me the actor playing the unfortunate Mr El Ibrahimi  Omar Metwally  was the heart and soul of this movie. His portrayal of a man in distress was shockingly well done. It's almost as if he was being tortured for real! Also Israeli actor Yigal Naor was very impressive as the part worried familyman and part extremely cruel chief of torture. Hard to watch and not exactly fun but still very worthwhile.".

This Shakespearean line from The Merchant of Venice is echoed again in the new film Rendition which introduces the viewer to the enhanced methods of interrogation renditions which began in the Clinton Administration and have become more commonplace since the terror attacks of September 11 2001.The film features an allstar cast with Oscar winners Meryl Streep Alan Arkin and Reese Witherspoon as well as Peter Sarsgaard Jake Gyllenhaal and Omar Metwally. Supporting roles filled by unfamiliar actors deliver as well sucking the audience into the plot and showing how many people can be affected by overseas terror attacks and our means of investigating them.Rendition follows an Egyptian born terrorism suspect Metwally who is taken by U.S. officials following his flight from South Africa to Washington DC to an undisclosed prison overseas. His pregnant wife Witherspoon ventures to Washington DC to find out about his disappearance through a family friend and Senator's employee Sarsgaard. Gyllenhaal plays a young CIA analyst at the overseas detention facility who monitors the violent interrogation.This film follows the emotional plights of the torture victim Metwally and those involved in obtaining the supposed information from him. Some like the CIA analyst Gyllenhaal are visibly shaken and horrified by the methods exercised while others the stern Senator Streep and foreign interrogator Yigal Naor see it as necessary and effective.The film may be described by some as a political piece but is ultimately an emotional one. Metwally's performance as the tortured prisoner is Oscarworthy. The film does not intend to preach but rather to question and inform the audience on a topic that does not often have a human face put on it. Renditions have been known to work but have also been known to produce false information from innocent prisoners. The film simply depicts the emotional struggles of those involved in such grave business and does so in a way that will affect every viewer differently. The film will keep your interest and have you engaged in each of the character's plights.".

Are we saying it is right to torture someone who is not an American Citizen? Are we saying that it is right to torture someone who may hate us and want us dead?

Torture is always wrong and if we are willing to do it even in the name of justice and National Security or freedom and democracy then we are wrong and we are evil we are doing exactly what we are accusing our enemies of doing and we are calling them wrong in the same breath.

The story of an Egyptian married to an American picked up on the suspicion of links to terrorist organizations and shipped to a friendly with US Arab country for enhanced interrogation as Meryl Streep's character states in the film we have no torture in the US seems to be from the front page of todays news. There is a very neat link between the various characters which appear in the movie and the pace of the film never drops. The movies'message seems to be as stated by Jake Gyllenhal's character in the film that by abducting and torturing suspects you create many more terrorists. The acting is uniformly excellent with Streep and Reese Witherspoon the stand outs. Not to be missed.".

	schema:reviewBody "In this day and age in which just about every other news story involves discussions of waterboarding images of Abu Ghraib or tales of forced detentions at Guantanamo Bay Gavin Hood's Rendition is about as uptotheminute and timely a movie as is ever likely to come out of the entertainment mills of mainstream Hollywood. It's not by any stretch of the imagination a perfect film but neither does it merit the caterwauling opprobrium it has received at the hands of critics from all across the ideological and political spectrum.The term rendition refers to the ability of the CIA to arrest any individuals it suspects of terrorist dealings then to whisk them away in secret to a foreign country to interrogate and torture them for an indefinite period of time all without due process of law. Anwar ElIbrahimi is an Egyptian man who has been living for twenty years in the United States. He has an American wife a young son and a new baby on the way. He seems a very unlikely candidate for a terrorist yet one day without warning or explanation Anwar is seized and taken to an undisclosed location where he is subjected to brutal torture until he admits his involvement with a terrorist organization that Anwar claims to know nothing about.On the negative side Rendition falters occasionally in its storytelling abilities often biting off a little more than it can chew in terms of both plot and character. The ostensible focal point is Douglas Freeman a rookie CIA agent who is brought in to observe Anwar's interrogation at the hands of Egyptian officials. The problem is that as conceived by writer Kelley Sane and enacted by Jake Gyllenhaal Freeman seems too much of a nave boy scout to make for a very plausible agent and he isn't given the screen time he needs to develop fully as a character. We know little about him at the beginning and even less it seems at the end. He goes through the motions but we learn precious little about the man within. Thus without a strong center of gravity to hold it all together the film occasionally feels as if it is coming apart at the seams with story elements flying off in all directions. A similar problem occurs with Anwar's distraught wife played by Reese Witherspoon a woman we never get to know much about apart from what we can see on the surface. Gyllenhaal and Witherspoon have both proved themselves to be fine actors under other circumstances but here they are hemmed in by a restrictive screenplay that rarely lets them go beyond a single recurring note in their performances.What makes Rendition an ultimately powerful film however is the extreme seriousness of the subject matter and the way in which two concurrently running plot lines elegantly dovetail into one another in the movie's closing stretches. It may make for a slightly more contrived story than perhaps we might have liked on this subject but hey this is Hollywood after all and the film has to pay SOME deference to mass audience expectations if it is to get itself green lighted let alone see the light of day as a completed project.Two of the supporting performances are particularly compelling in the film Omar Metwally who makes palpable the terror of a man caught in a real life Kafkaesque nightmare from which he cannot awaken and Yigal Naor who makes a surprisingly complex character out of the chief interrogatortorturer. Meryl Streep Alan Arkin and Peter Sarsgaard also make their marks in smaller roles. Special mention should also be made of the warm and richly hued cinematography of Dion Beebe.Does the movie oversimplify the issues? Probably. Does it stack the deck in favor of the torture victim and against the evil government forces? Most definitely. One wonders how the movie would have played if Anwar really WERE a terrorist. Yet the movie has the guts to tread on controversial ground. It isn't afraid to raise dicey questions or risk the disapproval of some for the political stances it takes. It openly ponders the issue of just how DOES a nation hold fast to its hardwon principle of civil liberties for all in the face of terrorism and fear. And just how much courage does it take for people of good will to finally stand up and say enough is enough even at the risk of being branded terroristappeasing and unpatriotic by those in power? The movie also does not in any way deny the reality of extreme Islamic terrorism.Thus to reject Rendition out of hand would be to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. Rendition may not be perfect but it IS good and it has something of importance to say about the world in which we now live. And that alone makes it very much worth seeing.".

I was picked up in Munich airport by a German officer as soon as I got off the Madrid plane. He was waiting for me. He was about to start interrogating me until I simply told him I have no business in Germany I'm just passing through. He had let me go with the utmost disappointment. That was nothing compared to what happened at Washington Dulles airport Which was not nearly as bad as what happened to Ibrahimi in the movie. The customs officer asked me a couple of questions about the length and purpose of my trip. He then wrote a letter C on my custom declaration form and let me go. After I picked up my checked bag I was stopped at the last exit point Some Homeland Security crap. I sat there for 3 hours along with many different people of many different nationalities. I was not told the reason for my detainment. I was not allowed to use my phone or ANY other phone. I was feisty at first asking to be told of the reason or let me go but decided to suck it up and just wait and see. I asked if I can call my wife to tell her that I'm going to be late but was told no. When I tried to use my phone and as soon as my wife said hello an officer yanked the phone out of hand and threatened me to confiscate it. When I asked about needing to call home because my family is waiting they said Three hours is nothing we will make contact after 5 hours. When I asked to use the bathroom an officer accompanied me there. It toilet was funny I guess it was a prison style toilet that is all metal with no toilet seat. Finally they called my name and gave me my passportgreen card and said you can go. I asked what the problem was they said nothing!! I know it was only 3 hours but I was dead tired and wanted to go home to see my wife and kids.As for the movie it was very well made. Unlike most movies that involve Arabs and use nonArab actors who just speak gibberish this movie the Arabic was 100 correct. I assume the country is Morocco North Africa.".

Noone gets off lightly because we see the blindness of the players as they carve out their own slice of the worldwide game piling hatred and misery on their enemies and themselves in equal measure.The interplay between the sympathetic Senator's Aide played in scintillating style by Peter Sarsgaard and the real Washington powermongers is electrifying. Meanwhile out in the field new CIA man Jake Gyllenhaal goes through a sea change in his attitude to the USA's new found cosiness with torture. Sudden though his rejection of what he initially tacitly condoned is one has to ask why on earth would anyone who calls him or herself civilized stand and watch anyone be humiliated and abused in this way? The film has few heroes  perhaps Gyllenhaal's flawed and vacillating CIA man is the exception and a necessary indulgence to make the film offer a sliver of hope.The sad fact of course is that this film isn't fiction at all but a wake up call to those with a shred of decency left in them. The awful truth is that we in the UK and USA have lost the moral plot and this film shows how low we are prepared to go. All this in the name of freedom! There's a wonderful line in the script that says that torture is a sure way to swell the numbers of our enemies. This is already happening in real life and we should listen to the message that this film delivers and start using our might and money much more intelligently!! The message seems to be that any of us who claim that rendition torture and the abuse of basic human rights are necessary to protect our way of life are as wrongheaded and stultifyingly stupid as the Jihadists and suicide bombers.All praise to the sensibilities of a talented South African director with a eye on the gross unfairness of how power is exercised and a cast of principled mainstream actors from the US and beyond. Oh and by the way the film has a sting in its tail with the ending a clever and thought provoking surprise which I won't give away.I saw the film in an early London preview so it has not yet been widely written up but I'm glad to say that the tide of less than glowing reviews seems to be turning. The BBC review has been very strongly in support and they and I suspect that much of the negative comments come from those who see the world through the simple specs of Hollywood  where the good guys and the bad guys are cardboard cutouts.

	schema:reviewBody "Think of it as an extreme form of detention without trial. Without commenting and taking a side on the US Foreign Policy the process of Extraordinary Rendition involves taking persons suspected of terrorist activities to a foreign country an opposite to an extradition if you wish to a place where torture is not a crime but a means to illicit information. Instead of staining your soil with blood of potentially innocent parties you do so on foreign land where such tactics are accepted interrogation techniques.Naturally given the severity of the tactics and attempts at breaking down a person sometimes you would get what you want once you pass the resistance or get nothing or worst of all get a confession just because the mind has been broken to the point that the subject will agree to whatever you say. It's an ugly process and what better way to do it when you're the champion human rights giving the nod to use whatever means necessary in the name of protecting more lives in an age where information is key to the battle against terror and doing so in a country where probably the rights record is questionable.Rendition is this year's Syriana though in the run up to the new year we do have a number of political thriller contenders to take that crown with Rendition first of all followed by the Robert Redford movie Lions for Lambs starring Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep again though now on the other side of the fence and The Kingdom with Jamie Foxx and Jennifer Garner though this one would probably turn out to be more action driven. Directed by Gavin Hood who did Tsotsi and will be helming the new Wolverine spin off Rendition is a decent thriller with a top notch cast in a narrative that has been proved quite popular these days  the split which provides for some ample differential perspectives to be presented through an ensemble cast.Anwar ElIbrahimi Omar Metwally a chemical engineer gets renditioned en route to going home under the orders of CIA top brass Corrine Whitman Meryl Streep. At a detention facility outside the US Jake Gyllenhaal's CIA analyst Douglas Freeman oh so prophetic embarks on his very first interrogation session no doubt being thrust into a position that he didn't sign up for. Back home a very pregnant Reese Whitherspoon searches frantically for answers to her husband's disappearance and sought after an exflame Alan Smith's Peter Sarsgaard assistance since he's working for Senator Hawkins Alan Arkin. Throw in J.K. Sinmmons a terrorist plot investigation and a budding forbidden love story between Fatima Zineb Oukach and Khalid Moa Khouas you have quite a bit going on in a busy picture.Given a number of casts locations timelines and the likes Rendition wasn't confusing at all and it plays out with deft handling of the material never quick to judge presenting ideas and thoughts from both sides of the equation. Every character has their own agenda and the unveiling of this agenda engages enough not to bore nor to confuse you. And the best part of it all is how very truly they bow down to selfpreservation in different forms and ultimately in various loselose situations unfortunately. It kept you guessing as well  did he or didn't he and constantly played with your mind as to whether Anwar deserved what he's getting. It utilized one extremely smart sleight of hand which I didn't see coming until it's too late so there goes the credit though it did succumb to the usual stereotyping of terrorist militants and without spending much time in depth to explore their motivations. Perhaps it didn't find a need to given so many movies out there already touching base on this issue Paradise Now Day Night Day Night Syriana even. While it turned out to be rather onedimensional personal tragedy to strapping of bombs to become a suicide bomber I felt Rendition did right in not providing any saccharine sweet ending that this fight against negative destructive ideology isn't something that can be addressed in a two hour movie and I'm glad it steered clear such fairy tale implausibilities. What we have instead is a well crafted tale that sets its gun sights on the issue of Rendition and probably capable enough to spark discussion once the lights come on on which camp you belong to  do you support inflicting severe pain in interrogation? Yes or No? This is the quintessential question of our time. Yes or No? OK I'm already geared for Lions for Lambs!".

Jake Gyllenhaal guested on Conan O'Brien to promote the movie and explained that 'Rendition' was a euphemism for obtaining information via torture. Since 911 'extraordinary rendition' allowed the government's intelligence agency to extricate people unquestioningly without due process and use any means necessary in exchange for information.Gyllenhaal plays rookie CIA analyst Douglas Freeman note the irony who is torn about his assignment which renders him as a mere observer to unorthodox interrogation proceedings at an underground detention facility outside the US. Omar Metwally plays the suspected terrorist Anwar ElIbrahimi Egyptian national and green cardcarrying hubby of American Isabella Fields ElIbrahimi Reese Witherspoon. Isabella and her son wait for Anwar to come home from a scientific conference when he suddenly disappears from the plane's passenger manifest. She seeks help from her college friend who works in government and learns that the Head of Intelligence Corrine Whitman Meryl Streep is behind it all. Rendition is directed by Hollywood newbie Gavin Hood who is set to do XMen Origins Wolverine and begs the question of whether such 'extraordinary rendition' is exercised in real life. The movie was released locally in the wake of the Glorietta explosion bombingmishap? and a pivotal scene in the movie is when a bomb explodes in a public plaza so that must have sent chills up every moviegoer's spine. Seeing the exploding tableau with a lone red and yellow sign Aajala Ayala? on the upper right hand of the screen plus the effect of silence and slowmoving images magnified the impact of the scene's reallife coincidence. There are lessons to learn from this movie and it all boils down to personal decisions we make daily. We all have choices we can exercise at will and we often do not always want to see how these affect others who may end up as hapless victims of circumstance. What 'the greater good' is should not have to be a forced choice our leaders have to take if we each already decide correctly at the source. Now that's a utopia worth building.".

You're not with any of the characters long enough to identify with them much and when it all gets tied up together in the end a bit too neatly you're just left feeling disappointed and cheated.Early reviews seem to be mostly praising this but the friend whom I saw it with and another veteran TIFF goer that we see in various lineups had the same sense of disappointment.The film just seems too desperate to make it all relevant as it tries to inspire our shock at the wrongs being perpetrated in the name of the antiterror wars but it mostly comes across as clichd rather than natural. When the Gyllenhaal character finally builds up the will to act on his moral outrage you're just not convinced about how he's made this character arc as he has spent the first 34's of the film either stunned by the effects of a suicide bombing that takes place before his very eyes and then drinking himself into a stupor while occasionally taking time out for an illicit office romance or to bark an order to underlings. It seems Gyllenhaal is the protagonist we are meant to identify with but he is too weakwilled to inspire much audience sympathy. Witherspoon as the distraught expectant mother has more of an immediate draw on our heartstrings but doesn't kick off the expose on the U.S. side of the things which we are pulling for her to do by soliciting help from exboyfriend Sarsgaard who works for Arkin's senator character after her EgyptianAmerican husband goes mysteriously missing after a transAtlantic flight. There are at least a few moments of fireworks when Witherspoon at least briefly gets to confront the CIA exec played by Streep who is pulling the forced extradition strings behind the scenes but a few seconds of confrontation doesn't make up for the 90 minutes of gradually increasing tedium that it takes to get there and we still have about 30 minutes to go in the plot after that highpoint. The subplot built around the head police torturer and his family in an unnamed North African country is more engrossing and a neat twist is pulled off in that storyline but that wasn't enough to save the picture for us.I had really been looking forward to this film but something just seemed to be missing in the way it pays off the different plot lines.".

	schema:headline " A Boring Rendition of a Film";
	schema:reviewBody "Rendition is a thriller released in 2007 to mixed reviews. It centres on a CIA analyst who begins to question his assignment after witnessing an unorthodox interrogation at a secret detention facility outside the US. The film is based on the true story of Khalid ElMasri who was mistaken for Khalid AlMasri.It features a cast of many big names Jake Gyllenhaal Reese Witherspoon Peter Sarsgaard who spends most of the film looking incredibly similar to Ewan McGregor Meryl Streep and J.K. Simmons and is directed by Gavin Hood who is also responsible for ruining a fan favourite Marvel character's origins in XMen Origins Wolverine. The performances of the above are not that bad and that is the highest compliment I can pay them however the performance of Omar Metwally who plays the man mistaken for a terrorist is absolutely fantastic he completely steals the show.Jake Gyllenhaal's character is very two dimensional. I like Gyllenhaal as an actor and when he turns it on he really does turn it on but here in Rendition something is lacking. His character is poor and nothing can really bring him to life. Witherspoon's character is just irritating from start to finish while Sarsgaard's character seems useless. The heavyweights Simmons and Streep aren't used nearly enough. The character development and characters in general need to be better written and are not well rounded or even that likable.Some of the torture scenes in which Anwar ElIbrahimi is treated horrifically by the American government are when this film comes into its own. They are very well filmed and recreated and clearly a lot of research went into making those scenes authentic and they do at times become very hard to watch because we as the audience know that the victim is innocent.My biggest problem with Rendition though is its genre. Thriller. Here's a little piece of advice you can't call a film a thriller when it isn't even thrilling in the slightest! A thriller in my opinion needs to have a mystery it needs to have shocks and keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Rendition fails to do this majorly. There are parts of the film where it seems as though the director is trying to build up sympathy or the characters or try and give a subtle shock to the audience but it only plants the seeds for a plot twist and the seeds never really come to fruition.When I sat down to watch the film I had read what it was about and was anticipating something very entertaining as I was impressed with the storyline and the cast but as the film grew on from what was a very boring first half into a mediocre second I soon came to realise that I was not watching the film I had hoped. Rendition was a let down an antiwar film that never really takes off.Having read around the film I know that it has its fans but I just can't imagine myself wanting to watch it again.".

	schema:headline " You need to be provoked!";
	schema:reviewBody "Some films are designed to just entertain you others to make you laugh or cry or uplift others like this aim to provoke to make you think and to make you angry. I was angry during this film not at the film but at the fact that it was true that America the free does torture in the illogical view that it is doing it for the greater good. The torture scenes in this movie were harrowing the indifference of people was shattering the film was compelling in its argument and showed just how wrong it is to torture people. Of course now that makes me a bleeding liberal labels shoved on people by others who shut their minds to the facts that this does happen and should not. People who don't realise that as the movie said for every person torturedyou get ten or one hundred people rise up to perform acts of vengeance. You get an ever increasing cycle of violence. This film did not make me hate America although I can see how it could do but it made me hate the way that America has reacted in its post 911 world. There is a significant quote in the film just after we have learned that 19 people have died and seventy five were injured in the bomb scene the quote is one American is dead  that makes the difference. You cannot kill an American America can kill thousands but you cannot kill a single American or they will do whatever it takes including torture to enact justice. This is the American way apparently. Call me a liberal call me naive although I think the people who think torture is fine are naive call me deluded call me anything you like but this film is a brilliant example of what is wrong in America and the west today. I wish this film would be shown to all school students at a minimum. This film will stay with me a long time part of me wishes I could forget it because I wish this type of thing never happened but I know it does the other part of me wishes I would never forget because we need to remember these shameful events to prevent them from happening again. Whatever happens to me this film will be with me for a long time and I will be telling everyone I know to watch it not to be entertained but to be provoked because sometimes we all need to be provoked.".

I was angry during this film not at the film but at the fact that it was true that America the free does torture in the illogical view that it is doing it for the greater good. The torture scenes in this movie were harrowing the indifference of people was shattering the film was compelling in its argument and showed just how wrong it is to torture people. Of course now that makes me a bleeding liberal labels shoved on people by others who shut their minds to the facts that this does happen and should not. People who don't realise that as the movie said for every person torturedyou get ten or one hundred people rise up to perform acts of vengeance. You get an ever increasing cycle of violence.

	schema:reviewBody "Making the movie Rendition was a very good idea and addresses an important problem that is occurring today. This movie though does fall short. It did not have the juice that Lions for Lambs or the shocking portrayals of a documentary.The acting was for me below average. Reese Witherspoon looked her part and played the way she needed to as a pregnant mother who's husband has been kidnapped. I cannot say the same for the others though. Merryl Streep just annoyed me in this movie. She played as a top employee of the CIA I think who gives out the order of torturing someone but the way she played her role was just so clich and unoriginal she did not bring anything special that she usually does in other movies. She actually ruined this movie. Then there was Alan Arkin he played very well but there is just one problem he was in the movie for about as long he is in the advertisements. He did show you what a senator does do but not enough. Peter Sarsgaard did have a very good chance to shine in here but he did not get enough screen time. He was the key to this movie and he just did not have the chance to inspire or perform the way he could have. Jake Gyllenhall who did was just there. I'm not really sure what he was supposed to do in this movie but just stand there. I think he is an overrated an actor and showed that in here. Yigal Noar who played the father looking for his daughter could as well have really had an impact on this movie but just did not. The two actors who played lovers really did not bring enough of an emphasis to there characters at all and it just fell short like the rest of this movie. Omar Metwally who played the man being tortured gave the best performance out of all of these actors.The directing and writing was poor in Rendition. Gavin Hood and the writer are the main reason why this movie fell short in every aspect. They did not give too much meaning in this movie and did not develop the character in a efficient way. Probably the lack of development of the characters ruined this movie the most. That is why the acting was not too great. How could you write a story like this and not explain who these characters are and why they do the things they do. That is how you explain why people are terrorists CIA agents etc. Without that this is a horrible political movie and political statement. This movie does not even tell you the job positions of the Merrly Streep and Yigal Noar who are very important here. This movie needed to be much longer in order to truly push the message of the story forward but it just turned out to be a battle for screen time between the stars of Hollywood. Not enough clarity. Not enough development of characters not enough reasoning and just too short.".

That is to say arguably so...Discussing the story and even the premise of the movie the whole thing falls apart from scratch. Are we honestly to believe that a major player in the terrorism business would walk around calling people across the globe with a traceable mobile phone? Are we seriously to believe that a 22 or so annalist after a bombing that made a coworker of his die in his lap would scratch his head utter a 'What a day folks' and then take up the job of an observer to a professionally carried out torture even lending a hand? I didn't...Stupidities aside the movie was slow sluggish even with people staring at each other waiting sometimes several minutes to mutter a response to the initial bit of script. Acting never convinced me not even by veteran Meryll Streep or Jake Gyllenhaal who made me weepy in Donny Darko who had exactly one scene in which he was actually acting and not sleepwalking around the faxmachine that he used to 'deliver' his lines.The music score did nothing to provide gravitas to the movie and it consisted of maybe 1 or 2 themes which were rewinded time after time or reshuffled and then put on again providing even more release to even the worst insomniac alive today.I honestly fail to see why people are impressed with such a hackneyed screenplay and story which was as straight forward as they come and yet make some people feel they saw something thought provoking which is becoming an increasingly annoying term here on IMDb for you will find it even in the reviews of the latest Rambo entry.I wasted what felt like 5 hours with this movie don't say you weren't warned.510".

	schema:reviewBody "RENDITION accomplishes a lot in presenting a story that is tough to watch tougher to believe and for all that is a tremendously involving and electrifying movie. It is definitely a message film but that message is delivered by a smart script a compassionate director and a dream cast.But first the word rendition according to the dictionary In law rendition is a surrender or handing over of persons or property particularly from one jurisdiction to another. For criminal suspects extradition is the most common type of rendition. Rendition can also be seen as the act of handing over after the request for extradition has taken place. For many this may not be news but for those who are not privy to our Intelligence games the concept is a terrifying one. For this film Kelley Sane has provided director Gavin Hood with a script that examines the horrors of rendition and in doing so the two have created a story we simply cannot ignore.Anwar ElIbrahimi Omar Metwally is an Egyptianborn American working in South Africa as the film begins his very pregnant wife Isabella Reese Witherspoon awaits his return home but when Anwar doesn't appear at the airport the enigma begins. Anwar has been taken prisoner in Egypt where he is tortured and interrogated for information by the cruel Abasi Fawal Yigal Naor while a reluctant CIA investigator Douglas Freeman Jake Gyllenhaal stands by the two attempting to extract secrets to be provided to the USA behind the scenes in Washington DC the extraordinary rendition is piloted by Intelligence expert Corrine Whitman Meryl Streep. Isabella attempts to uncover the truth of her missing husband's whereabouts and involves an old friend Peter Sarsgaard to help her. Nothing goes well not in the US or in Egypt where the interrogator Abasi discovers the evil that is brewing within his own family. It is Isabella's persistence Anwar's endurance and the ultimate heroism of Douglas Freeman that allow the resolution to the nightmare.The cast is uniformly strong the grim realities of the torture chambers are almost unbearable to watch and the inourface discovery of how our Intelligence system works especially since 911 is terrifying. Added to the DVD is a short film about two men who talk about personal experiences with 'rendition'. It is a kick in the gut and demands action from the viewer to become an activist in preventing the continuation of these tactics. Grady Harp".

	schema:reviewBody "For starters I think this show was great fun and had great storylines but not many people seem to like it.I guess whether you like it depends on your age. If you're a young kid who's been brought up on a diet of CGI and all those amazing special effects then it probably doesn't appeal to you. But I think it was fun.The stories were great. In one two part episode SpiderMan battles an evil villain by the name of Mr White who has stolen an atomic bomb which he plans to detonate. There's plenty of fun as Spidey battles dangerous henchmen and performs some unbelievable stunts. Another great episode featured Spidey in Hong Kong but my favourite episode was where Spidey investigated a bogus haunting.Nicholas Hammond was good as Peter ParkerSpiderMan and he played the part of man with huge responsibilities on his shoulders very well. The late Robert F. Simon played the grumpy but good hearted Jonah Jameson and did a good job.There were no super villains in the shows which I think was a good thing. The Incredible Hulk series of the 1970's didn't feature super villains either. Spidey got involved in real situations with believable people and in a superhero TV series I think that is much better than having a super powered villain every week.All in all highly recommended. There's some good stunts in the series too. Whilst I am quite sure this series will pale in comparison to the new Spidey film due to hit UK cinemas in June 2002 I would have no problem in recommending it to superhero fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though short lived The Amazing SpiderMan was one of the best made for TV versions of a famed comic book hero. Only Wonder Woman Lynda Carter the best of the genre and The Incredible Hulk Bill Bixby Lou Ferrigno were better.The Amazing SpiderMan outclasses the 19661968 Batman because the high camp elements of the latter often ruin the adventure. SpiderMan outclasses all three television interpretations of Superman Lois and Clark Smallville and of course the George Reeves Superman which brings up the rear.The Amazing SpiderMan was an action drama during the late 1970's the preCGI era when stunts had to be performed by stunt men not in the database of a computer. SpiderMan had its own very talented stuntman to perform the death defying daredevil acrobatics. His name was Fred Waugh who donned the spidy suit for the action sequences. Nicholas Hammond better known as one of Julie Andrew's children on the alltime movie classic The Sound of Music was SpiderMan during the dialogue scenes. Hammond's SpiderMan also had his own secret identity as Peter Parker similar to Christopher Reeve Superman Clark Kent Adam WestBatmanBruce Wayne and of course Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman Diana Prince.It's unfortunate that the series only had thirteen episodes. Because when the first episode hit the airwaves in November of 1977 the entire country was watching it on CBS that Wednesday night. In all fairness CBS should release this pilot episode as well as The Deadly Dust the Captive Tower etc. on DVD shortly. SpiderMan was short lived but did have a cult following and in my opinion was a heck of a lot better than the movie interpretation of the famed comic book hero starring Toby McGuire.CBS might be hesitant to release these episodes for two reasons. A There might not be a broad market for them based on the lack of longevity of the series and a generation of children and young people who weren't born when the series originally aired in the 1970's. B One of the early SpiderMan episodes dealt with a terrorist with designs on the World Trade Center which was attacked twice many years after this show went off the air in 1993 and of course the devastating attack against this country on 91101 in which the towers were destroyed and many innocent lives were lost.However I don't think that it would be in bad taste to release this SpiderMan episode even if the show was adventure derived from a comic book and camp in nature. The live action Amazing SpiderMan doesn't have a large following but it has a cult following. If and when CBS releases it out on DVD this cult following could be explained along with the episode in which Spiderman saved the towers in 1978 but how in September of 2001 real life proved to be different from the movies. I like to follow the news but I also like Science FictionFantasy. Therefore I am eagerly awaiting the release of The Amazing SpiderMan on DVD.".

Also you have to remember that this TVSeries was made in the 70's. You honestly can't expect to be wowed by special effects. And hey I'm a 90's kid and yet I still love it. Nicholas Hammond actually fits the role of Peter Parker rather perfectly he even looks like him from the 90's animated series. Granted he lacks Spidey's witty humour that we all love but I think in this show's case that's a good thing. This show can be a lot of fun and has a very catchy theme song.I hope that someday this show will get an official DVD release but until that day comes I'll just have to make do with my VHS copy.".

Nicholas Hammond actually fits the role of Peter Parker rather perfectly he even looks like him from the 90's animated series. Granted he lacks Spidey's witty humour that we all love but I think in this show's case that's a good thing. This show can be a lot of fun and has a very catchy theme song.I hope that someday this show will get an official DVD release but until that day comes I'll just have to make do with my VHS copy.";

This was a favorite of mine as a kid and I always watched it when it came on no matter how many times I saw the episode. Sure the effects were not great but they were also not horrible either. They did a fairly good job with the costume and it had the nice 70's vibe to it that is always enjoyable to see and hear as the music was also very 70's. It did not really have any villains from the comics but then most comic book live show adaptations had none to very few actual super villains from the comics. Spidey's powers were a bit different here too he had his Spidey sense and he could climb walls but he was not nearly as strong as the Spiderman of the comics. He was super strong though as I do remember an episode where he broke into a room by breaking the door knob off he just was not the car hurler that the one from the comic book can be. The show was set in Los Angelos so there were not as many buildings to swing from but they did okay with the web. It is nice that this show actually has the web shooters and not organic shooters of the movie. I love the movies but part of me wishes they would start over and do the more smarty pants Spidey that has the mechanical web shooters. This show had a good star as Peter Parker and he was okay as Spiderman it is nice to see a Spidey who does not basically live in the slums like he does in the movies. Neither this show nor the movie though has a Spiderman that is quick with the insult like the one in the comic. Still this show was fun without being as corny as the Batman show.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's easy to look at 1977's The Amazing Spiderman series and laugh our asses off. We've already had three live action Spiderman films that were able to perfectly capture Spidey's grace and agility through the use of cutting edge CGI. But even before Sam Raimi's films the original live action Spiderman series was ridiculed on a regular basis. Even going as far back as the mid 80's it looked so craptastically cheesy it rivaled Adam West's and Burt Ward's Batman in preposterousness. But hindsight being 2020 I realize we all may have been wrong. It may very well be the single best interpretation of this characterEVER.I know this sounds insane. However there were a lot of things this show had that really worked. One for instance is the lead. When this show was still airing on CBS the comics saw Peter Parker as a college student somewhere in his early to mid twenties. He was depicted as being tall and having a lean athletic build. Well Nicholas Hammond matched those qualities to a tee. He stacked up to Peter Parker the same way Christopher Reeves did to Superman. I won't lie his portrayal lost some strength when he was in costume. However out of costume he did a damn fine job playing Parker as a highly intellectual dude with great power and great responsibility.Besides Hammond's physical performance I've got to bring up the special effects. Silly string that stood in for webbing webs that had to wrap around flagpoles to stick wallcrawling that looked like a man being lowered from an off camera rig web swinging that definitely looked like a stuntman being hurled through the air at the end of a rope Spidey leaping from rooftop to rooftop by overlaying video onto background footage. Yeah they all look more like student film territory by today's standardsworse even. Nonetheless when this originally aired these visuals were bleeding edge stuff. CGI was all but science fiction. Green screen tech was too cost prohibitive for television. This was the best that could be done and in 1977 it glued asses to seats. So while the first ten minutes of 2002's Spiderman blow this out of the water ASM was quite revolutionary and outright jawdropping for its time.Spiderman looked cheesy but realistic. The truth of the matter is that spandex only makes for dynamic attire in comics cartoons and videogames. In real life even if you were built like Hugh Jackman or the Rock it would make you look like a chump with an overly pronounced feminine side. So Hammond looking less than impressive when in costume is pretty much what Spiderman would look like in real lifedeal with it. The costumes worn by Tobey Maguire and the one to be worn by Andrew Garfield are more dynamic and eye catching. But between style and reality I always choose the latter.Over its brief thirteen episode run none of the villains from the comics were featured. This is a point of contention for most and an understandable one. But this was a TV show in the 70's. There was simply no money to include characters like the Green Goblin Doc Ock Sandman or any other classic foe of Spidey in a compelling manner. Even so ASM did feature a take on the 1970's clone storyline when it was still a fresh in the comics. It wasn't much but it was the best they could do and was quite remarkable for the time.Given the era in which this aired ASM was nothing short of miraculous. 1977 was over twenty years before comics were finally allowed to enter the mainstream without being frowned upon. It was an extremely hostile period where comic books were treated with all the dignity of a dirty Kleenex. It was so hostile CBS gave ASM the runaround for two years before pulling the plug. When they did it wasn't due to low ratings because the show was doing well. They cancelled it simply because after Wonder Woman and the Incredible Hulk they were afraid CBS would come to be known as the Comic Book Station. Seriously. That's it. Hell Stan Lee saw fit to bash this show even though he was a script consultant. But I'm willing to bet that could've been over him not being given a cameosomething he's apparently quite fond of.In the over 20 years between the cancellation of ASM and the 2002 film which rewrote the rulebook on blockbuster premieres and opened the floodgates for Marvel in Hollywood ASM was ridiculed by any and everyone. I too occasionally took shots at it. But now in my thirties I can honestly look back and see what ASM really was. It was a program that had a lot of ambition took a lot of creativity did everything it could to succeed and still came up shortall because it was two decades ahead of its time. Had the public attitude towards comics been more positive back then this would've been on the air for years and been a smash hit. It would've been the best live action Spiderman probably to this day.If you're a fan of Spiderman or of comic related media that's seen fit to ridicule this effort stop. 1977's The Amazing Spiderman deserves your respect. It deserves all of our respect. And I just want to add Stu Phillips' theme is one of the most infectious pieces of music I've ever heard. It gets in your head and just sticks therelike a spiderman.".

Yeah they all look more like student film territory by today's standardsworse even. Nonetheless when this originally aired these visuals were bleeding edge stuff. CGI was all but science fiction. Green screen tech was too cost prohibitive for television. This was the best that could be done and in 1977 it glued asses to seats. So while the first ten minutes of 2002's Spiderman blow this out of the water ASM was quite revolutionary and outright jawdropping for its time.Spiderman looked cheesy but realistic. The truth of the matter is that spandex only makes for dynamic attire in comics cartoons and videogames. In real life even if you were built like Hugh Jackman or the Rock it would make you look like a chump with an overly pronounced feminine side. So Hammond looking less than impressive when in costume is pretty much what Spiderman would look like in real lifedeal with it. The costumes worn by Tobey Maguire and the one to be worn by Andrew Garfield are more dynamic and eye catching. But between style and reality I always choose the latter.Over its brief thirteen episode run none of the villains from the comics were featured. This is a point of contention for most and an understandable one. But this was a TV show in the 70's. There was simply no money to include characters like the Green Goblin Doc Ock Sandman or any other classic foe of Spidey in a compelling manner. Even so ASM did feature a take on the 1970's clone storyline when it was still a fresh in the comics. It wasn't much but it was the best they could do and was quite remarkable for the time.Given the era in which this aired ASM was nothing short of miraculous. 1977 was over twenty years before comics were finally allowed to enter the mainstream without being frowned upon. It was an extremely hostile period where comic books were treated with all the dignity of a dirty Kleenex. It was so hostile CBS gave ASM the runaround for two years before pulling the plug. When they did it wasn't due to low ratings because the show was doing well. They cancelled it simply because after Wonder Woman and the Incredible Hulk they were afraid CBS would come to be known as the Comic Book Station. Seriously. That's it. Hell Stan Lee saw fit to bash this show even though he was a script consultant. But I'm willing to bet that could've been over him not being given a cameosomething he's apparently quite fond of.In the over 20 years between the cancellation of ASM and the 2002 film which rewrote the rulebook on blockbuster premieres and opened the floodgates for Marvel in Hollywood ASM was ridiculed by any and everyone. I too occasionally took shots at it. But now in my thirties I can honestly look back and see what ASM really was. It was a program that had a lot of ambition took a lot of creativity did everything it could to succeed and still came up shortall because it was two decades ahead of its time. Had the public attitude towards comics been more positive back then this would've been on the air for years and been a smash hit. It would've been the best live action Spiderman probably to this day.If you're a fan of Spiderman or of comic related media that's seen fit to ridicule this effort stop. 1977's The Amazing Spiderman deserves your respect. It deserves all of our respect. And I just want to add Stu Phillips' theme is one of the most infectious pieces of music I've ever heard. It gets in your head and just sticks therelike a spiderman.";

	schema:reviewBody "I absolutely love The Amazing SpiderMan! It holds a very special place in my heart as it was through this very series I was first introduced to one of the most famous and beloved comic book characters of alltime SpiderMan.Nicholas Hammond who played Friedrich von Trapp in The Sound of Music portrays Peter ParkerSpiderMan to absolute perfection. Hammond is smart funny and everything the character of Peter Parker should be and that Tobey Maguire wasn't. Unlike Maguire Hammond actually has charisma and charm.Fred Waugh the stunt coordinator also took on the role of SpiderMan when some of the more dangerous stunts were performed. His work is still aweinspiring. Some highlights include Waugh's scaling of the Empire State Building hanging from a helicopter high above the city streets web slinging from one building to another etc. I enjoy watching real stunts performed by real people not CGI. CGI is too easy to spot and it really takes away from the enjoyment of an action sequence. Give me a real guy in a real SpiderMan suit any day! The supporting cast is strong with Robert F. Simon Chip Fields Michael Pataki and Ellen Bry all wellsuited for their roles. Simon's take on J. Jonah Jameson the publisher of the Daily Bugle finds that perfect balance between Jameson's trademark grumpiness and enough likability to explain why anyone would keep working for him. Chip Fields is a delight as Peter's occasional sidekick the toughtalking but sensitive Rita Conway. Rita is Jameson's assistant and while not in the original comics her sassiness and playful personality make for a welcome addition to the SpiderMan mythos. Michael Pataki the late great character actor played the irascible Captain Barbera a New York City cop who was often suspicious of both Peter Parker and SpiderMan. His character appeared only in the first season. Ellen Bry played Julie Masters an attractive young woman who was both a friendlove interest and rival of Peter Parker. She too worked as a newspaper photographer but not for the Bugle. Julie's desire to always get her story led her to get in over her head on more than one occasion. Her character appeared only in the second season.While the series changed the origin story of SpiderMan most notably with its removal of the murder of Uncle Ben a satisfying alternative that was more friendly for 1970s television and for any children who would be watching was filmed in its stead. Aside from that the series was quite faithful to the source material. Spidey's powers were generally the same he had superhuman strength the ability to cling to walls leap high in the air a super sense of a balance and a spidersense to warn him of danger. Spidey's gadgets including his webshooters utility belt and spidertracers also played an important role in the show. To date The Amazing SpiderMan provides the only liveaction depiction of the aforementioned spidertracer tracking devices and are featured prominently in several episodes of the series.I can't say enough good things about this show I absolutely love it! I give it a ten out of ten! I definitely recommend checking it out. The series hasn't been officially released on DVD yet but nearly all episodes have been released on VHS. You can find homemade DVDs on many online auction websites you just have to look around for 'em.It has been recently announced that unknown actor Andrew Garfield will be taking on the role of Peter ParkerSpiderMan in a new reboot of the SpiderMan franchise scheduled for release in 2012. All I can say about that is there's no way he'll be able to top what Nicholas Hammond's already done. Hammond was is and always will be the best Peter Parker in my book. Thank you Mr. Hammond for introducing me to SpiderMan and for providing me with many fond memories of watching your show while dressed up in my own SpiderMan costume pretending to fight crime while on my own makebelieve adventures.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a strange piece a tale of latemedieval English history made at a German studio entirely produced and acted by Germans plus one Swiss and one Norwegian. While we in the UK are quite used to Hollywood rewriting our history for us Braveheart etc. we don't expect it so much from our fellow Europeans. But back in the early 1920s the UFA studio in Berlin really was the Hollywood of Europe and for a few years they had the cinematic prowess to tell whatever stories they liked.The director here is Ernst Lubitsch who later became wellknown in the US for his sophisticated comedies and back then he was primarily a comedy director too. Anna Boleyn sees him turning his many comical tricks to more dramatic effect. A favourite comedy technique of his was the pullbackandreveal as used for example in the opening shot of The Oyster Princess 1919 to show the bloated Oyster King surrounded by his lackeys. That shot is duplicated here with the introduction to Henry VIII the look slightly more realistic but just as revelatory of the character. And although Lubitsch's pictures are in a very different category to those of his fellow UFA luminaries Fritz Lang and FW Murnau he shares with those directors a fascination with dcor and architecture. He constantly composes shots in depth looking down corridors or through into larger rooms from the early moments at the harbour where a set of doors are opened onto a bustling street to the haunting final view of the scaffold. This was a common way of emphasising a large space before the days of widescreen but it also gives the whole thing a sense of dread and inevitability as characters advance upon us from the distance or spy on each other into a room beyond.Lubitsch also reveals himself to be a master of pacing within a sequence. For example after a handful of busy shots at the spring festival the scene everything becomes slow simple and a shade darker as Anna encounters Norris on the outskirts of the merrymaking. Throughout the picture the director encourages steady measured performances making some scenes move at a glacial pace but endowing them with atmosphere and fascinating detail such as the eerie depiction of Anna and Henry's wedding night. Playing the king the talented Emil Jannings is uncharacteristically restrained giving us a menacing moody king very different to Charles Laughton's flamboyant 1933 portrayal. Henny Porten is not quite as good in the title role her performance consisting mostly of looking extremely disturbed. However she is able to make a good account of herself in the final few minutes when it really matters. An honourable mention must also go to Paul Biensfeldt as the jester who makes the most of his closeups and gives us a sincere and dignified portrayal of this deceptively simple character.Anna Boleyn is all in all a rather stunning feature and actually somewhat better than most of the historical dramas coming out of Hollywood at the time. It seems that during this crucial period when the fulllength motion picture was beginning to grow up and things like screen acting and set design were becoming serious professions the Germans had the edge with their strong theatrical operatic and artistic traditions upon which their cinematic industry was built. Lubitsch Jannings and almost every other member of the crew and cast had a background on the stage as oppose to the technicians and entrepreneurs who were running Hollywood. In Germany they knew very well how to tell stories visually how to merge production design and performance into a complete form of expression and they had a large pool of people with the necessary experience. The supremacy of UFA would continue until the Americans gained the technological edge in the late 20s not to mention poaching much of Germany's creative talent but during this short period it was the most competent moviemaking factory in the world. Anna Boleyn is not even the finest output of its time and place and yet is still made with that powerful blend of storytelling knowledge and cinematic inventiveness and is a drama of considerable stature and elegance.".

	schema:reviewBody "Henny Porten is far too old for the role of Anne Boleyn who the script tells us is such a superattractive wench that the king severs with Rome when the Pope refuses him a divorce so that he can marry her. Porten is a very hammy actress too with as much simpering and eyerolling as you wouldn't believe. On the other hand Emil Jannings really looks the part of Henry VIII In fact he seems to have stepped straight out of Holberg's famous portrait. Admittedly his acting is a bit exaggerated but tolerable. And the same applies to most of the players as well. Visually the movie is spectacular enough and the plot though familiar moves along with sufficient pace to retain our interest. On the other hand Lubitsch's direction is rather disappointing. It's very straightforward with virtually no camera movement at all and little evidence of the fabled Lubitsch touch. In fact the only stylish quality evident in the direction here is the occasional use of framing devices. Disappointingly the 1983 print under review does not use Reisenfeld's music score but a just passably appropriate melange of string orchestra harpsichord and choir rendering vaguely Elizabethan airs. Despite the very washedout print currently on offer Sparkuhl's photography still manages to shine in certain scenes  the tournament e.g. Available on a Kino Video DVD.".

It was only in the mid to late 1920s that the American films became the bestknown and best made. You just can't find a film from 1920 or so that looks better.Unfortunately looks alone do NOT make a great film. For someone who wants the truth behind the second marriage of Henry VIII this is NOT a great filmas many of the facts were clearly wrong. Despite what the movie shows Anne was Henry's mistress for some time before he got around to marrying her AND the process by which the English separated from the authority of the Pope was NOT the quick process you see in the filmit took years. As a history teacher this film isn't terrible historicallybut it still should have been a lot better. And if you are going to play fast and loose with the facts then why not at least make the film more interesting? Overall the film lumbers during its two hour air time and more recent films NOT The Other Bolyne Girlwhich was also a mess historicallyspeaking such as Anne of the Thousand Days and The Six Wives of Henry the Eighth are more accurate and interesting.Decent but far from as good as it could have been its sumptuous treatment. Plus while a Lubitsch film there's little trace of his famed Lubitsch touch here in this pretty but rather dull film.".

The film depicts the terrible story of the Queen consort of the British King Henry VIII. She was executed by her husband  well not exactly the King ordered the executioners to do his dirty work not to mention that this marriage caused an important political and religious historical event the English Reformation.The film stars Dame Henny Porten Germany's first screen superstar during those early years and Herr Emil Jannings Germany's fattest actor in that silent era. Both play their characters in a suitable way Dame Porten as an innocent aristocrat who becomes progressively interested in the power that the court offers her and Herr Jannings as the unscrupulous whimsical and womanizing British monarch a character very suitable for this German actor who overacts appropriately given the extravagance and excessive personality of the character himself.In the early film period Herr Lubitsch was known for his outstanding costume films colossal productions with big budgets  Anna Boleyn cost about 8 million marks a fortune even for this German count  taking great care in magnificent decors as can be seen during the coronation procession in Westminster Abbey scene which employed 4.000 extras  idle Germans of that time were used causing revolutionary workers to create a fuss when German President Friedrich Ebert visited the set during filming.Besides the spectacle one of the most important aspect of this and every film of Herr Lubitsch even during his epic period is the complex relationship between the main characters. We experience a game of different interests double meanings and the complicated art of flirting but what is treated lightly at first ends in tragedy. The importance of those historical facts is brought to bear in an effective way but Lubitsch is really more interested in the changing relationship between Henry VIII and Anna Boleyn.And now if you'll allow me I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must take care that one of his fat and rich heiress doesn't lose her head for this Teutonic aristocrat.Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien httpferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I must admit that I fell asleep while watching this movie. It is simply too long. People who are interested in Ernst Lubitsch's work before he went to Hollywood might find it interesting though. As a matter of fact it is a well directed movie. Maybe there are no classical Lubitsch touches to be found. Nonetheless I found the way the story was presented original and engrossing. There are many superbly choreographed mass scenes on stage sets as well as in outdoor settings.There can be no doubt that the makers of Anna Boleyn wanted to accomplish an artistic achievement. The set design and especially the wardrobe are fantastic. The people responsible for that must have made a thorough study of period paintings. I had the impression that many poses of the actors were also derived from Renaissance painting. Lubitsch's task might have been to lighten the whole thing up and I could not say he did a bad job. My favorite scene is a kind of a summer entertainment for the king. On a large meadow a group of people play something like badminton but they are evenly distributed over the whole area and the balls fly in all directions. It happens what must happen Anne Boleyn's ball lands at the feet of the king who already had an eye on her and seizes a racket to challenge her. The next ball lands in a grotesquely artificial copse with high weeds into which both the king and Anna plunge together with the court jester.An interesting detail the movie has on several occasions shots of people with different aspect ratios from the other shots. The aim seems to be to highlight certain bodies or poses by framing them. This intensifies the reference to classical artwork but also irritates when there are quick cuts between a special focus and a more general aspects.".

	schema:reviewBody "A filmmaker's early work can be fascinating if not always among his or her best efforts. Lubitsch's signature touch may not have been fully developed by 1920 but he had still made charming romantic comedies like The Oyster Princess up to that point. However one thing fans of his 1930s and 1940s work may not expect is that Lubitsch also made big historical epics during the silent era. The most famous might be The Loves of Pharaoh starring Emil Jannings as a lecherous pharaoh who tears apart two young lovers. The film is beautifully produced with lavish sets and costumes crowds rushing through the frames. Unfortunately the pace is leaden and the story is barely engaging.Lubitsch's treatment of the rise and fall of sixteenth century queen Anne Boleyn here named Anna follows the same basic premise Emil Janning's lusty Henry VIII separates young lovers Henry Norris and Anne Boleyn when he tires of his aging queen Katherine of Aragon. Unfortunately much of the same flaws of Pharaoh can be seen here as well what we have is a lack of engagement or an interesting heroine.Lubitsch's Anne may be the most passive portrayal of the woman put to film and her characterization is probably the biggest reason why it's such a slog to get through. Anne Boleyn was known for being charismatic despite not fitting the blondehaired fairskinned beauty standards of the day with her olive complexion and dark possibly red hair. So of course this Anne is fair skinned blonde and charismaless. Anne always looks like she is on the verge of tears or fainting. She is repulsed by Henry from the start and never possesses any ambition to become queen. We see nothing of her social skills her religious zeal her bravery in the face of death. About the most you get of the historical Anne is her love for her daughter Elizabeth and occasional flashes of temper which in this movie seem to come out of nowhere.All the other characters are painted with broad strokes too the mild Jane Seymour is suddenly a calculating temptress ?! Henry Norris is the suffering lover boy Mark Smeaton is basically a cackling frat boy out to get Anne when she won't sleep with him the Duke of Norfolk is completely amoral and lacking humanity. About the closest we get to a bonafide performance is Emil Janning's Henry VIII but even he is limited to leering glowering and guzzling beer from tankards.The script also lumbers from historical event to historical event with things happening laughably fast. The divorce of Katherine of Aragon took years in real life but here it's cleared up in all of five minutes! Yes yes this is entertainment not a documentary but considering this movie is hardly entertaining I'm going to pick at the rushed treatment of the story much more. But as I said before it's not a total waste the production looks great and Lubitsch sometimes uses creative framing and mise en scene to liven things up. But when it' all at the service of a dull script it does not help make the viewing experience any better.What really kills me is that we're dealing with a fascinating piece of history and a fascinating woman. Making Anne Boleyn a saint is about as erroneous as making her a harpy see the terrible TERRIBLE Other Boleyn Girl for how Anne Boleyn's character gets assassinated these days. She was capable of kindness she gave much to charities serving the poor and cruelty her treatment of her stepdaughter devolved once Mary refused to accept her as queen she was known for boasting quite a temper. Few movies about AB have portrayed her as a woman she is the seductress the harpy the suffering saint almost never a woman.Anyway only Lubitsch or Jannings fans will get much out of Anna Boleyn 1920. If you want early Lubitsch I highly recommend The Oyster Princess a movie more suited to his style and talents.".

	onyx:emotionText "A filmmaker's early work can be fascinating if not always among his or her best efforts. Lubitsch's signature touch may not have been fully developed by 1920 but he had still made charming romantic comedies like The Oyster Princess up to that point. However one thing fans of his 1930s and 1940s work may not expect is that Lubitsch also made big historical epics during the silent era.

This is a silent blackandwhite film and was made before Lubitsch's and Krly's breakthrough in Hollywood. Unfortunately I was not too impressed watching this one. In the current DVD version it runs for a couple seconds under 2 hours which is really long and painful to watch almost especially for a silent film. Apart from that the film needed definitely a lot more intertitles. I personally thought from a visual perspective this was a decent film but the lack of color of course hurts in the way we perceive the pompous sets art direction and costumes. All in all I personally definitely enjoy Lubitsch's comedies when it comes to his earlier works and not even the presence of Emil Jannings could make this one worth watching for me. I do not recommend it. Thumbs down".

So in the process our rubber faced nit wit gets to spend some time in the slammer. Jim Varney once again does an excellent job as the bumbling fool Ernest P.

If people were tired of him much earlier on why I ask you did Varney make 4000 commercials? Yes 4000. I didn't add an extra 0 here. That's unheard of with any one else. Varney was the only one to reach cult status with 30 second ads. I don't even like commercials and I found his thoroughly entertaining. I loved them so muchI bought them on DVD. With that said Ernest Goes to Jail is hilarious. And we get to see him play badguy Mr. Felix Nashquite a difference from Ernest's goofball slap stick. Nash is far from Ernest being organized clever and mean. In this installment from the Ernest line Varney shows off his God given rare talents. Looking in the mirror in jail he tries to come off as Nash by using different voices and facial contortions. It never fails to make me laugh. The ink pen scene is classic. It's so funny watching him try to clean off the ink only to smear it worse all over his face. Plus he gets electrocuted 4 times in this movie. HeyVern! No one gets electrocuted like Varney KnoWhutImean? The beginning of the movie has Ernest trying to start the floor polisher only to have it take on a mind of its own by dragging Ernest all over the floor and up the wall. Ernest's screams are just adorable. Especially 4 minutes and 34 seconds into the movie. Any other jail movie would be loaded with violence and bad language and the fact is I wouldn't care to watch them. This is probably the only jail movie that was free of vulgarity and was still a treat to watch. Varney made his Ernest movies kid friendlyfor all ages to enjoy. C'mon we all know that Ernest was Jim's true calling because mostly everyone refers to him as Ernest. And no one will ever be able to replace him. I know that Vern missed Ernest. He even left a note for Ernest at www.vernssuicidenote.blogspot.com. I've read it. It's quite humorous as well. When I first saw Ernest Goes to Jail at 14 when it first came out I wanted a house like Ernest's right down to that cool washer and dryer. The 'electric toothbrushes' would be pretty nice to have too. Brush all your teeth at the same time in half the time. We all know that Jim paved the way for people like Jim Carrey and Larry the Cable Guy but Varney kept it clean. Though Jim Varney is still my number 1. Of course with any Ernest movie it will receive the highest rating possible.".

Ernest was actually quoting Shakespeare and his arrogant soliloquies were classic. Varney shines in this moviedoing all the different voices faces and characters we have grown to love. What I really like about this film is his portrayal of Mr. Nashthe villain. Jim Varney does a complete 180 turn from his bumbling idiotic Ernest P. Worrell. The look the voice and the attitude are very different from the other character which is a what a good actor should do if playing 2 roles. Varney pulls them both off remarkably well. Also Chuck and Bobby provide great slapstick humor as always and this film is a comedy classic that can be viewed by all ages.

Soon he's assigned jury duty and finds himself in jail when switched with a dangerous lookalike criminal Nash Also played by Varney. Ernest tries to act like Nash to avoid suspicion with help from felon Lyle Cobb and eventually escapes after gaining an electromagnetic ability. He tries to stop Nash from robbing the Bank and taking over his life. Tyson plays Charlotte a bank secretary who likes Ernest and Sartain plays Ernest's pal Chuck who works as the bank's security guard. This is my favorite of the Ernest films and Varney was great in both roles. I recommend this.".

Basically it's an alright film. I wouldn't go as far as to recommend it but i will way the pros and cons for you to decide. The movie is not really funny it's humorous. Nothing you would laugh out loud at except for maybe the infamous Ink Pen scene in the courtroom. Personally I love Jim Varney and I enjoy the Ernest character enough that i can sympathize out of a certain nostalgia. Varney is surprisingly convincing as the Nash character of a meanstreaked jail bird. But thats as far as i'll go with the critique. Here are the main elements that make this film watchable and even enjoyable. Because of the recent death of Jim Varney and the speculation i've heard that he was actually a pretty cool and very intelligent guy in real life there is some sort of fascination you can have with him. If you watch this movie not as a comedy but as a bmovie it works pretty well for the following reasons 1. a small role for Charles Napier of Russ Meyer fame. 2. the inclusion of Tex Cobb of various bmovie fame also that killer performance in Raising Arizona. 3. Cobb has some sort of a reverseafromullet going on. 4. Ernest shares the screen with his other self Nash and they ensue in an on screen fight which is of course varney vs. varney sort of like ash vs. evil ash. 5. Ernest's house is wildly eccentric. 6. Ernest gets electrocuted about 6 or 7 times 7. Prison guards that wear bright pink uniforms 8. And lastly a bit of dark humor particularly in one scene in the last 20 mins of the movie where Ernest is taken to the electric chair to be executed. A guard asks Ernest if he would like a cigarette before he goes and Ernest replys with something to the note of No thank you cigarettes will kill you. Now you may be wondering how that is funny aside from the obvious paradox. Well here's why Jim Varney died at the fairly young age of 50. He died from lung cancer. He was a heavy smoker. So cigarettes did kill Ernest. When I heard him riddle off that line about cigarettes killing you it turned my stomach in a morbid way. So theres your dark humor.".

There are also people who dislike or even outright hate the films and find the character annoying.For me while they are not great films the 'Ernest' films are mostly silly harmless fun that don't try to be any more than they need to be. They're mostly uneven but entertaining in a guilty pleasure sort of way and Ernest is the sort of the character one can relate to easily. The sort of character that is a wellintended serial bungler with a strong heart but always finding himself messing up. 'Ernest Goes to Jail' is the third of the series after 'Goes to Camp' and 'Saves Christmas' both uneven but fun too and is one of the better ones too.'Ernest Goes to Jail' may not be great. It does look cheap and does betray lowbudget. Some of the slapstick once again gets a bit childish and overdone. It's not hard to figure what goes on next in the story such is its predictability. Lastly the ending is overblown and insultingly dumb Ernest films are not known for their logic but this ending throws it out the window and urinates on it.Varney however is immensely likable and a lot of fun as Ernest while also excelling surprisingly well on villain duty and as Auntie Nelda. The supporting cast are much better than the one in 'Ernest Goes to Camp' though not on the same page as Douglas Seale in 'Saves Christmas' with a scene stealing Gailard Sartain and Randall Tex Cobb charming in a good guy role.The music is an energetic nostalgic delight and most of the gags and dialogue while admittedly silly are a range of making one amused to having one in hysterics all done harmlessly and with no signs of distaste. Good too that the sentimentality was quite a bit less here. Despite being predictable the story in 'Goes to Jail' feels like there actually is one at least and it goes at a zippy pace the best paced of the series so far at this point.In summary guilty pleasure fun. 710 Bethany Cox".

Cherry III  Cast Jim Varney Gailard Sartain Barbara Bush Randall Tex Cobb Bill Byrge Average comedy that treats its prison theme with contempt. The next film should be called Ernest Goes to Therapy which he should seek if he finds the slightest joy in jury duty. Ernest is a janitor at a bank where a jury duty opportunity has him knocked unconscious and replaced by a criminal lookalike who happens to be on death row. Formula follows his many escape attempts as well as the criminal's inability to fill his shoes. In Escape From Alcatrez Clint Eastwood doesn't have quite as much fun in the pen. The ending is a complete freeforall where all logic goes out the window. Director John R. Cherry's third Ernest film with fine special effects but not quite up to Ernest Saves Christmas. Jim Varney should be given credit for playing off two very different roles successfully. Gailard Sartain steals moments as a buffoon security guard whose security ideas are a constant bust and Bill Byrge plays his silence yet agreeable sidekick. Barbara Bush plays the standard damsel whom Ernest is smitten by. Randall Tex Cobb plays a prison inmate who is to teach Ernest how to be his lookalike while becoming fond of his good natured qualities. While not the worst of its kind its reality of prison is treated like fun fair instead of the dread it is. Score 3   10".

	schema:reviewBody "Though long believed to be Jim Varney's creation the character Ernest is steeped in literary lore. This stock character was created by the expatriates in Paris during the early twenties. Several scholars have attributed it to Gertrude Stein herself citing evidence that Earnst  the name taken from Dadist Max Ernst  was her nickname for specific ubiquitous prostitutes she more frequently solicited. This is debatable though since there are three specific short stories by expatriate writers using the stock Earnst character Fitzgerald's Earnst Isn't Rich Joyce's Day in the Life of the Janitor and Hemingway's Dead Whore on a Mountain. All of these stories and an accumulated history on this character that was passed by some of the great writers of the twentieth century can be found in the forthcoming The Importance of Being Earnst edited by Joyce Carol Oates.It was this literary tradition that led director former ad executive and cocreator John Cherry to take the dare and approach one of the days finest writers Philip Roth to tackle a tale of Ernest. Roth was apparently a fan of the early stories and he took the opportunity to graft Ernest into a tale he was already writing as an expose on prisons  a muckraking masterpiece he was concocting in the tradition of Upton Sinclair. But when Roth turned in his first draft Cherry was surprised to find an allprose script that involved Ernest being trapped in an Israeli prison with an sadomasochistic literary fan and Roth himself. Cherry rejected the script citing a lack of Knowhatimean's though Roth would later tell confidants that Cherry was simply antiSemitic.Cherry then gave the script to his pet arragutang to rewrite. The simean grafted the script onto the other Ernest movies including a several references to the everpresent antiholidayconsumerism themes of Ernest Saves Christmas. Unfortunately the arragutang Benny died before he could finish and his trainer Charlie Cohen ending up getting final credit.But the tale doesn't end there. Roth and Cherry later reconciled and this led to Roth contributing to the unfinished Ernest the Pirate supposedly these scenes involve the rescue of a nubile greatgranddaughter of a Holocaust survivor who was attending Columbia University before being trapped on the high seas. He also worked in thinly veiled criticisms of the Ernest movies in between Goes to Jail and Pirate including a line that went I've been scared stupid I've rode again I've slam dunked I've even been in the army but I've never been a pirate before. Now suck my  while I read Dosteyeksky.".

The story was a good one and knowing it was based on reallife events made it that much more enjoyable. Luke Wilson was a hoot pun intended to watch as was Tim Blake Nelson. And seeing Neil Flynn play something other than the mean janitor from Scrubs was nice. The kids in movie did well and I'm sure they will all appeal to a certain demographic on the heartthrob level.

The story was a good one and knowing it was based on reallife events made it that much more enjoyable. Luke Wilson was a hoot pun intended to watch as was Tim Blake Nelson. And seeing Neil Flynn play something other than the mean janitor from Scrubs was nice. The kids in movie did well and I'm sure they will all appeal to a certain demographic on the heartthrob level.

And this movie sends a message to kids that maybe they can make a difference that maybe their voices can be heard. Filmed in South Florida the scenery is beautiful and natural and REAL. Who cares if its predictable and a little corny. So was FREE WILLY and look how well that did. This is a good family movie..........a rare breed.".

The production values are good especially sweeping shots of Montana and Florida. The soundtrack by Jimmy Buffet is a perfect fit. The young actors are spirited and refreshing.The plot about a trio of kids who work together to save some burrowing owls from death at the hands of an unscrupulous pancake house empire builder will engage kids. So many films make children appear powerless it is nice to see a movie that shows children working hard to make a difference. And even though parents are absent or temporarily distracted it was pleasant to see kids who want to follow in their parents footsteps and try to right injustices.If you are tired of all of the selfindulgent story lines about children that fill the cinema give Hoot a shot. Then take some time to talk to your kids about the adventure of serving others and caring about the world they live in. A positive message from a positive film.".

It also shows how they think and maneuver in junior high school. You had to love how well Jimmy Buffet did as the cool teacher. He kept us adults awake. The level of kids questioning authority was kept reasonable. Their motives were specific and not like some A.D.D. rebel. The setting and music were beautiful.

	schema:reviewBody "If you read the book by Carl Hiaasen the movie follows pretty much true to form with a few minor changes for Hollywood. In my opinion this is a great family movie. Luke Wilson Officer Delinkopretty well steals the show from an allstar cast that includes Robert Wagner and Jimmy Buffet. The kids in the movie do a great job led by Logan Lerman Brie Larson and Cody Linley.Brie Larson is maybe a little too petite to play Beatrice. I pictured a bigger girl maybe 6 foot 175 lbs in the role of Beatrice. This might have made her more believable in her role of beating up Dana. They should have developed her tough girl character more and had her bite through a tire or kick a soccer ball through a person. She is very pretty and I understand why she was cast she is a box office attraction.This is about as PG as a movie gets these days no sex and very little violence. This movie is a parents'dream come true a movie with a strong environmental message with kids that have deep appreciation for the beauty of Florida and its wildlife. It shows how adults have fallen short in the stewardship of our planet and that our children can demand better. One of my favorite lines in the movie is when Mullet Fingers says Florida could use some mountains like Montana. Florida is so flat there is nothing to stop developers from clearing it coast to coast. Also the photography of Florida wildlife spoke volumes without dialog. As a family movie with kids ages 515 this is a great movie! As a bonus parents' will be entertained especially if they're parrotheads.".

	schema:reviewBody "Synopsis Roy Eberhardt Logan Lerman is a teenager who loves living in the wide open spaces and mountains of Montana. Unfortunately for him his father's job is forcing him to move once again this time to a small town in Florida. As the new kid in school Roy has the usual encounter with the school bully on the bus. While riding on the bus Roy is also intrigued by a teenage boy who was running like the wind and passed the bus in his bare feet. The next day Roy gets off the bus and tries to catch him but loses him at the golf course. Roy eventually meets the boy known as Mullet Fingers Cody Linley. Mullet Fingers is a runaway living on an abandoned boat near the golf course and a vacant lot that is about to have a pancake house built on it. All by himself Mullet Fingers has taken up the cause of protecting the burrow owls that are nesting on the vacant lot. If a pancake house is built on the lot it will destroy the habitat of the burrow owls. Roy joins forces with Mullet Fingers and his sister Beatrice Brie Larson to save the owls.My Comment This is one movie the whole family can see. The story is entertaining and heartwarming for all ages. You will love the music of Jimmy Buffett that was played throughout the movie. Jimmy Buffett produced and played a small part as the marine science teacher. This is a proenvironmental film that shows what can be accomplished by three teenagers using the act of civil disobedience. The film has lots of humor and a message of saving the environment and some beautiful cinematography of Montana and Florida. And of course don't forget the owls. New Line Cinema Run time 130 Rated PG610".

It is a film for the young crowd perhaps 5 to 11 years of age. I thought it was a nice change of pace from the adult films that pervade the screen these days. There is no realism here or accuracy about life in general for adults or kids. It's just a bunch of fun with a constant message about saving the beautiful places in this country from becoming over developed. If you can remember back to the day when you weren't fight for a buck you may remember that money isn't everything.

	schema:reviewBody "Poor Roy Eberhardt teenager his parents' jobs require them to move often so he never gets any stability in one location. The movie begins with them in the beautiful mountainous country of Montana. What would be the exact opposite? How about Florida?? Yep they move to Florida the Gulf Coast area not too far from Tampa. As Roy gets to know his new environment he meets the big bully kid on the bus and has to break his nose to get away. Out the bus window he sees a kid about his age running very fast with no shoes. And he somehow befriends a nononsense girl named Beatrice.Luke Wilson plays a hapless local cop Officer David Delinko but Wilson plays it with enough sympathy that we actually learn to like him. His heart is in the right place. Underrated actor Tim Blake Nelson is Curly Branitt hired to guard a near future construction site for a new pancake house the 100th in its chain. Manager Chuck Muckle is determined to get that feather in his cap the 100th one.The problem is the land set aside is also habitat for a ground dwelling owl I don't even know if those exist but no matter... and building the new pancake house would be the death of them. So much of the movie is Roy Beatrice and Mullet Fingers doing things on the sly to prevent the dozers from beginning construction.Robert Wagner has a token appearance as Mayor Grandy. Jimmy Buffett who was a producer wrote some of the songs also has a good part as teacher Mr. Ryan. I don't know Buffett and didn't realize at first it was him but was impressed with his natural acting manner.SPOILERS. As the teenagers begin to learn more about the construction project they follow the paper trail. Specifically they wonder how the environmental impact was overlooked. They found it wasn't and the company was hiding the fact that owls were threatened. Straightening that out just in time the location was spared and 3 teens were new best friends.".

Florida is full of so many fun characters and the film does a great job of bringing that to the screen. My kids particularly loved all the different animals from snakes to owls to alligators. It's really a simple story but also one that they need to hear at this age. When kids are young that's when they really develop their sense of values and yes one of those must be caring for our environment and all the creatures that live in it. I think it was great that the film even sparked a conversation with them on the ride home about animals and how to help them. It was just truly sweet and enduring to hear my little girl talk about how she wanted to save the baby birds. Anyway overall it was really a great time and I'd recommend the movie to anyone looking for something entertaining AND meaningful.".

So he immediately thinks the barefoot kid is somehow connected to the vandalism that's taking place at the construction site. He immediately becomes friends with the girl who had threatened him.

The message it conveys is that IT IS OK TO BREAK THE LAW IF YOU ARE TRYING TO SAVE SOME WILDLIFE!!! The main characters in the move break more laws than I care to mention in order to save some endangered owls on a piece of property. The thing that ultimately saves the owls is a environmental report that was ON THE PROPERTY IN QUESTION!which in itself was the biggest plot hole of the film in my opinion Now don't get me wrong I know it was a movie but if they were going to show these kids as ecoheroes than why didn't they show them doing their sleuthing by going down to city hall and digging through the records in a proper fashion INSTEAD OF KIDNAPPING AND TYING UP THE FORMAN OF THE SITE AFTER BREAKING AN ENTERING ON THE PROPERTY!

The picture is a series of bad ideas misconceived sequences and hopeless attempts at comedy while offering us a plastic kind of youthful conviction which was already molding over as far back as the 1950s.

	schema:reviewBody "The Swedish filmmaker Roy Andersson's latest film You the Living is not easy to review. One of the reasons is that in his own words he has broken with the AngloSaxon tradition of storytelling in all essence the template of most Western film productions. Another reason might be that although Roy Andersson is somewhat heavy on symbolisms his unlike those of say Andrei Tarkovsky are of a more elusive nature. It took him 3 years to complete this 86 minute long film and it wasn't because he was forced to have long breaks between shootings due to financial troubles or problems with the actors. The film consists of 57 vignettes shot mostly by a still camera and it was the careful design of each of these scenes which required much time. The imagery of this film which is closely related to the director's previous film Songs from the Second Floor is of utmost importance to the story thus this story is told to a great degree by the surroundings and the environment in which the characters of Andersson's universe dwell and interact. Before each scene was finally shot there would have been no less than 10 different test shootings with different actors colors dialog etc. The result is a dreamlike version of the surrounding world which most of us would recognize and if the setting is like a dream why not dream a little? Just like in Bunuel's The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie when somebody says Last night I had a dream you get to watch it. But then again what is perceived as reality here is not very much different from the dreams.Despite the fact that the film lacks a plot in the traditional sense of the word and there are no main characters as such the different characters who appear and reappear in different scenes still meet each other and their stories are inevitably intertwined. What most of these characters have in common is their apparent loneliness despite being surrounded by other people. The trailer trash chain smoking and binge drinking woman who dreams of having a motorbike so that she can get away from all this crap her corpulent and mostly silent boyfriend and his frail and seemingly gentle but rather absentminded mother members of a brass band whose skill improving efforts at home aren't getting a favorable reception neither from their families nor their neighbors the depressed Middle Eastern hairdresser and his arrogant customer on his way to a very important business meeting an elderly man having a nightmare about bombers in the skies a young girl dreaming about marrying the young rock star that she is so madly in love with. It's all about dreams and nightmares versus reality but it works as much as a statement in support of the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein's claims that all human communication is miscommunication. People speak to each other but it is as if they speak past each other. They try to reach out to the others but shut the others out when those try to reach them.You the Living is a poetic film set physically in Stockholm but yet universally applicable. The society it portrays is Sweden its artistic language and the people displayed are generally unmistakably Nordic. Yet the subject it deals with namely the misery of the humankind in a selfish world reaches far beyond this hemisphere. Despite the seriousness of its theme the film itself seems a lot more cheerful and laden with humor than one might have expected. But in the words of the director himself living is so complicated to each one of us that the only thing that saves us is our sense of humor. Hence this film is a tragic comedy or a comic tragedy depending on your sensitivities and not a depressing black reality tour of the human nature. It is unusual in its language and structure but if you can think outside the box and enjoy it you will certainly find this film both entertaining and meaningful at the same time. It was shown at this year's Cannes festival as part of the Un Certain Regard program which offers original and different works outside the competition. After the film was shown in the Salle Debussy the 1000 strong audience gave it a standing ovation for several minutes. Do I need to say more?".

	schema:headline " This is a wonderful human film.";
	schema:reviewBody "Roy Anderson's film 'You The Living' comprises a series of fiftyodd sketches snapshots and vignettes set in a Swedish city. Some characters are on screen for just a few second whilst others appear in numerous scenes and are sometimes seen loitering in the background while another story unfolds. Many scenes are drawn from the dreams nightmares and fantasies of the strange but believable characters inhabiting this world. It is a fascinating approach each of the scenes could be enjoyed in isolation but together they contain a powerful portrait of what it is to be human.For the first half hour or so 'You The Living' is gloriously funny. Much of the humour centres on the members of a brass band whose music practice infuriates the neighbours in their apartment block. The comic highlight however is provided by a dinnerparty track gone horribly awry. After this hilarious introduction however the mood of the film darkens considerably. The dinnerparty dream turns grim when the hapless protagonist is put on trial for his life setting a mixed tone of absurdity and despair for the rest of the film.In the subsequent scenes the unhappiness of the cast of characters becomes increasingly apparent. Theirs is a world where people are unable to connect with one another where talk of dreams nightmares and fantasies is widespread but where no person can be comforted even when others reach out to help them. The despondent woman with the 'nobody loves me' refrain and the young girl with unrequited love for the rock guitarist Micke are archetypal characters.The world of 'You The Living' is also blighted by selfishness. An elderly professor is called away the warmth of a vast banquet to answer a phone call from his impetuous moneygrubbing son a thief steals the wallet of a ruthless executive an arrogant and impatient businessman insults a Muslim barber and receives his comeuppance. In the film's bleakest moment a woman in church recounts the long list of human sins as her fellow parishioners shuffle out at closing time.And yet for all dark moments in this film the shared refrain of 'tomorrow is another day' points to the ability of people to go on living in spite of many miseries. The soundtrack provided by Benny Anderson of ABBA fame seems inappropriately jovial at first but makes more and more sense as the film realises this human capacity to persevere.'You The Living' has an extraordinary visual style. The same washedout palegreen colours recur throughout and there is nary a shadow in sight this makes the characters appear exceptionally pallid and creates the sensation that human life is being laid bare for examination. Almost every scene is captured in a static camera frame as if these are photographs being brought to life. The few occasions where the camera does move are all the more extraordinary the contrast between the life and movement of the great banquet form a startling contrast with the deadness of the cloakroom scene. In the most intense moments of longing and despair the characters transfix the viewer by directly facing the camera  they know that they are being examined and have a few moments to pour out their hearts to us the viewers.This is a wonderful human film.".

Many scenes are drawn from the dreams nightmares and fantasies of the strange but believable characters inhabiting this world. It is a fascinating approach each of the scenes could be enjoyed in isolation but together they contain a powerful portrait of what it is to be human.For the first half hour or so 'You The Living' is gloriously funny. Much of the humour centres on the members of a brass band whose music practice infuriates the neighbours in their apartment block. The comic highlight however is provided by a dinnerparty track gone horribly awry. After this hilarious introduction however the mood of the film darkens considerably. The dinnerparty dream turns grim when the hapless protagonist is put on trial for his life setting a mixed tone of absurdity and despair for the rest of the film.In the subsequent scenes the unhappiness of the cast of characters becomes increasingly apparent. Theirs is a world where people are unable to connect with one another where talk of dreams nightmares and fantasies is widespread but where no person can be comforted even when others reach out to help them. The despondent woman with the 'nobody loves me' refrain and the young girl with unrequited love for the rock guitarist Micke are archetypal characters.The world of 'You The Living' is also blighted by selfishness. An elderly professor is called away the warmth of a vast banquet to answer a phone call from his impetuous moneygrubbing son a thief steals the wallet of a ruthless executive an arrogant and impatient businessman insults a Muslim barber and receives his comeuppance. In the film's bleakest moment a woman in church recounts the long list of human sins as her fellow parishioners shuffle out at closing time.And yet for all dark moments in this film the shared refrain of 'tomorrow is another day' points to the ability of people to go on living in spite of many miseries. The soundtrack provided by Benny Anderson of ABBA fame seems inappropriately jovial at first but makes more and more sense as the film realises this human capacity to persevere.'You The Living' has an extraordinary visual style. The same washedout palegreen colours recur throughout and there is nary a shadow in sight this makes the characters appear exceptionally pallid and creates the sensation that human life is being laid bare for examination. Almost every scene is captured in a static camera frame as if these are photographs being brought to life. The few occasions where the camera does move are all the more extraordinary the contrast between the life and movement of the great banquet form a startling contrast with the deadness of the cloakroom scene. In the most intense moments of longing and despair the characters transfix the viewer by directly facing the camera  they know that they are being examined and have a few moments to pour out their hearts to us the viewers.This is a wonderful human film.";

There's an endless fascination about where writerdirector Roy Andersson wants to take us in his fourth feature You The Living. With fifty or so semirelated vignettes strung together by a penchant for tragicomic hyperreality its wistful interpretations and symbolic instances of life that bind us all in this great big cosmic Sisyphean struggle. The sheer simplicity of these vignettes act to dramatise the tenuity and immense preciousness of being apart of the symbiotic relationships we have with one another.

	schema:reviewBody "I really didn't see this one coming. Roy Andersson had me pegged out I am the perfect sucker for a static camera long live King Borowczyk! and I was laughing hysterically for the first fifteen minutes of the film he hit me straight between the eyes. You have to be a brilliant man to make selfpity hilarious. Andersson reminds me of the third mate on the Pequod in Moby Dick Flask a man who took the whole of life to be a practical joke that the good lord Himself is playing on us. And the web of egotism in this movie is truly hilarious.The level of satire is at fever pitch you have one deluded selfpitying dreamer harp on about the cruelty of the world and then totally ignore a spiritual selfreflection crying out in agony. The very depths of egotism are plumbed. I really never thought it possible to go further than Bergman's The Silence in this respect. However the grotesqueness of the selflove and selfregard by every single character in this film is staggering. We are shown an existence where the talentless and the idle rail against a world they believe has been unjust towards them they truly are legends in their own living rooms. The human beings in this film make selfdeception and selfdelusion a great artform! Only one woman in the film appears to have any sort of understanding of what is going on. An old woman who refuses to leave a chapel knelt down praying for the forgiveness of all mankind her speech is the most electrifying condemnation of the modern world I have ever heard. She reveals through her prayers that what is wrong with the world is not to be fixed by mere tinkering there are not a just a few faults there is an abyss of corruption that can only be mended by immolation and judgement day. Watching this movie puts me in the mind of a naked monk stood waist deep in a cold river at midnight screaming out a thousand Kyrie eleisons for the sins of humanity. Another grand jape is that it is clear that her prayers are futile and in fact she is stopping everyone going home at closing time.This is not a film for the smug noone is spared no idols are left on the altar no one group of humans is harangued to the glory of another group. Never has there been a greater more transcendent more astonishingly beautiful summation of our sins. It is a film for the end of the world it is the grand jest the great hideous practical joke of human life! From the catalogue of images it is too difficult to pick a favourite I slapped my thigh and almost fell off my chair in the cinema screaming with laughter as a man attempted to pull the tablecloth from under a set service. I won't spoil what happens but the suspense builds up and something truly unexpected occurs. It is probably the funniest thing I have ever seen in a cinema. I am quite reserved and I just couldn't control myself that is the measure of the greatness of this film.The shooting of You the Living is impeccably formalist. We are shown the palette of an artist dingy browns yellows greys and sky blues set alive by the shock of luminous brass textures. There is never a tone out of place it's like an hour and a half of symphonic Whistlerian colourmeld. The obsession that must have gone into putting that colour scheme in place is extraordinary. And no shot is wasted as with all great movies there is not a spare inch of celluloid.Perhaps the best film I've ever seen.".

You The Living is composed by some 50 vignettes filmed with a static camera. I will not give away the content of the scenes here because I hate when people spoil even the smallest details. But yes most of the scenes made the 1000 people in the Claude Debussy theatre absolutely baffled and amazed. When the film was over we applauded for several minutes we had no other choice.So what's the score with You The Living. Hm Andersson isn't afraid to take on the heavy questions History guilt gand The Holocaust during WW2 are big subjects and these themes work very well together.The images created are brilliant the depth sometimes surpasses Songs from the Second Floor. Well sorry for this ranting praising review. Look out for the Flying House in the beginning folks!1010 stars  A Masterpiece I never throw this grade out.".

	schema:reviewBody "No film has captured the essence and opulence of existence like You the Living a 2007 Swedish film written and directed by Roy Andersson. You the Living cuts to the core of what it means to be human and the existential dread that plagues society. The characters portrayed are everyday people each with their own caricatured personality trait that makes them identifiable as plagued by some facet of the human condition. The composition of the film is masterfully accomplished with a finesse and style that exemplifies the brilliance of Roy Andersson as a director. Arguably the most prominently apparent theme is that of existentialism. The opening sequence immediately sets the tone of the film with the lamentations of a middleaged woman who tearfully proclaims that nobody loves her to the dismay of her boyfriend. She rejects his condolences and even shuns the love of her dog. Despite her boyfriend's attempts to console her and assure her that things are not as bad as she believes them to be she is determined to be miserable. As her boyfriend stalks off she sings a song about how a motorcycle would make her happy to the tune of a swinging jazz band. Her requirement for material possessions in order to be happy is a fundamental flaw that pervades modern society. As the film progresses it introduces a carpenter who is executed for botching a magic trick a pickpocket who robs a pompous wealthy man a psychiatrist who has given up on counselling people and now just prescribes pills a girl who dreams of marrying her rock star idol and a couple dwelling on an argument throughout the day. The profound discontent of the portrayed people is framed by the juxtaposition of the psychiatrist's monologue. The immense unhappiness exhibited by each of the characters is clearly selfinflicted they fail to recognize and appreciate everything they have going for them.The sets in the film are bleak and minimalist almost devoid of colour in order to draw attention to the lives of the characters. The vast emptiness and geometric simplicity of the scenes is a visualization of the way the discontented characters view their world. Andersson's consideration and removal of all distractions from the core of the piece make the message of the film that much more clear. Furthermore the stationary camera shots and complete lack of any sort of change in perspective during a scene is nigh unique amongst mainstream films. Consequently every aspect of every scenes is focused on the characters. The camera work combined with the washed out colours gives the audience the perspective of a third party observer with the exact same outlook on life as the characters portrayed. When combining the cinematographic styling and the lack of any sort of plot to speak of the film takes on a sort of breadth of humanity discourse. Roy Andersson goes a step further than just a discursive portrayal of selfinflicted human suffering. In a brilliant series of cuts Andersson shows each character stop their daily routine of feeling sorry for themselves as they look to the sky. What is a common sign for a search for redemption in American film becomes a dark and poignant scene when the film cuts to a shot from above the wing of a bomber flying over the city. The miserable lives of the characters is symbolically brought to an end illustrating Andersson's resentment of the pitiful and selfabsorbed lifestyle that was rampant throughout the film.You the Living is a masterfully rendered machination of Roy Andersson. His control of the creative process engenders a complete and unified work that at its core thrusts at a single point and never wavers. You the Living is a film that forces viewers to think about the manner in which they live their lives. The lifestyles portrayed in the film are rejected as unfulfilling and proposes that instead we enjoy and appreciate as the title card suggests Therefore rejoice you the living in your lovely warm bed until Lethe's cold wave wets your fleeing foot.".

	schema:reviewBody "I enjoyed You the LivingDu levande 2007 90minute long collection of 50 short vignettes so much that I've rewatched the whole movie as soon as I finished it and I keep coming back to some of my favorite sketches over again. I highly recommend the film to the fans of truly original defying classification and definitions independent movies that mix in perfect proportion tragedy and comedy while explore the different aspects of modern human existence. In his less than 90 minutes long movie Swedish directorwriter Roy Andersson attempted to look closely at all humankind while not leaving for a moment a rather gloomy rainy Stockholm and its unremarkable often miserable and complaining depressed and misunderstood inhabitants. Their lives can be described as disharmony in the faded gray green and beige the palette that Andersson has chosen for the film which creates the atmosphere of quiet desperation and misery. The dreams and reality of the characters substitute each other effortlessly. It seems that three of the greatest filmmakers from the past Luis Bunuel Ingmar Bergman and Krzysztof Kieslowski might have inspired Anderson to make this extraordinary film because their impact is difficult to deny. With all the existential subjects and nonsentimental outlook You the Living manages to be very funny finding humor poignancy and tenderness in the absurd situations beneath the minimalistic style and remoteness. As always in a movie with great deal of intertwined short stories some were more memorable than the others. For me the funniest was the sex scene it has to be seen to believe. The best most memorable gentlest the most optimistic in the pessimistic world perfectly constructed with the best cinematic surprise and the most beautiful music was a dream sequence told by Anna the young girl desperately in love with a rock musician Micke Larsson Eric Bckman Cat Casino a guitarist for Deathstars. This miniature has become one of my favorite film scenes ever. The choice of music in You the Living is fascinating and adds so much to the film appeal. The best scenes or are they just my favorite? are filled with music Louisiana Brass Band playing Mozart Lullaby which sounded like a marching tune and made me smile. The woman in a bathtub singing beautifully the old Russian folk song Odnozvuchno gremit kolokol'chik Monotonously Rings the Bell that was popular in many European countries by the different titles. Actually this short less than one minute long scene seems one of very few depicting happy people a singing woman in the bathtub and a man who dresses in the room and sings along with her. When people are happy they often sing just for themselves. When they are not happy they also sing and there is a hilarious motorcycle song in the beginning of the film performed by one of the funniest characters a middle aged lady wannabe biker and the embodiment of annoyance and nagging. I already mentioned the Anna's dream sequence that I watch every day and can't get enough of. Comparing to faded and for the lack of the better word muted colors the music is lively expressive and catchy. This contrast works very well for the film. You The Living is the second film in the reflection on existence trilogy that consists of Songs from the Second Floor which is on the top of my Netflix queue right now and A Pigeon Sat on a Branch Reflecting on Existence which Roy Andersson still works on and hopefully it will be released in 2013. I am very happy to have discovered and experienced You the Living truly unique work of the great modern film creator and eagerly look forward to seeing the rest of the trilogy.".

	schema:headline " A worthy and occasionally very funny continuation of Andersson's typical cinematic approach";
	schema:reviewBody "Advancing on the characteristic approach and satirical thematic concerns of director Roy Andersson's previous film the excellent Songs from the Second Floor 2000 You The Living 2007 presents to us yet another vaguely tortured darklycomic look into the failures of human existence with an ironic juxtaposition between the presentation of both content and form that is disarming to say the least. Unlike his previous film the themes of You The Living are much less enigmatic and oblique. There is also a greater sense of structure here and although the whole thing can be interpreted as a prolonged nightmare or a dream of social dissatisfaction the ultimate realisation of that final scene  which stresses subtly and a cruel sense of humour  makes the sociopolitical message of the film much clearer and more relevant than any of Andersson's work since the AIDs related shortfeature Something Has Happened 1987. Again it can be seen as an extension of the director's background in commercial advertising with any awareness of even a handful of his often fantastic TV commercials establishing his trademark use of deliberately static tableau filled with an impeccably rich attention to miseenscene and a genuinely impressive use of bold comictiming.This of course shouldn't really come as a surprise throughout his career  stretching as far back as even his second feature film the critical and financial failure Giliap 1975  Andersson has used elements of cruel socialsatire to draw on the notion of human fragility and often in the attempt to mine an almost absurd comedy of errors motif that seemingly grows from routine everydaylike misadventures into fullblown comictragedies. At its most simplistic his work could be interpreted as a series of sketches that attempt to parody the seeming futility of everyday existence in such a way as to find humour and hope in even the most despairing of situations. The aesthetic then is to document the harshrealities of the world in the form of an ironic stylisation  once again capturing despair loneliness and alienation with all of the designer gloss of an IKEA commercial  with the sly implication that modern consumer society wants us to aspire to the level of middleaged suicide alcoholism and tragic desperation being close to genius in its presentation. Nonetheless there is much more to the film than such a glib description might suggest with Andersson structuring these scenes in order to show the escalating sense of desperation selfishness worthlessness and selfpity of these bemused and befuddled characters as their shallow hopes and dreams are exposed against a literal lastminute offering of swift apocalyptic despair.As ever with Andersson the design of the film is rich and exquisite from one scene to the next with the director and his crew going to great lengths to create these locations including all but one of the exterior shots on the soundstages of Andersson's Studio 24. Even though the world of the film is plausible to the point that we forgot the film was even shot in a studio there still remains a continual offkilter quality of wily exaggeration that becomes more and more notable as the film progresses. This sense of creative abstraction finally achieves its full potential during an apparent dreamsequence in which a house moves through the countryside on a railroad track before finally pulling into a local train station to the cheers of the supporting cast. It perfectly captures the bleakly beautiful spirit of the film and the depth of Andersson's imagination as a filmmaker here at the height of his creative abilities. Once again we can argue the merits and the meaning of the film as we did with the more obviously downbeat Songs from the Second Floor seeing it as either a stark Godardian satire on the nature of consumerism and a comment on how the wheels of everyday existence conspire to grind us into place or as a work of highconcept design intended to parody the slow grind of everyday existence  and the even greater weaknesses and despair  hidden beneath the already drab facade of day to day life.Unfortunately many will no doubt see the film as plot less or formless even and to an extent it is. However there is a real meaning here that is expressed through images that  even in spite of Andersson's ironic detachment and occasional mocking of his own characters and the directions they follow  offer us a number of moments that are emotionally affecting and indeed entirely memorable. Regardless of such interpretations  which are ultimately there for the individual to discover and interpret by themselves  the film works as a result of its keen sense of humour  which is continually dark and again reminiscent of the work of Aki Kaurismki in particular films like Hamlet Goes Business 1987 and The Man Without a Past 2002  and of course Andersson's uniquely defiant and immediately iconic style. As with Songs and indeed all of Andersson's work over the course of the last twentyyears the episodic nature of the film can be a strain at first however it is worth sticking with as the more obvious characters soon become apparent and their individual strands of the narrative become compelling in an oddly affecting way.".

	schema:reviewBody "You the Living 2007Mordant. I've never written that word before but it comes to mind here. Let me look it up. Well it's part of itcorrosive but also funny as heck. So corrosively funny. This is a dour film for sure with so much dry dry dry wit and quirky humor it's impossible not to like it on some level. Filmed in a very spare style often with a static camera and really balanced stable compositions like theater stages we see a short enactment occur.But that makes it seem ordinarywhich it is not. Ordinary life is shown to be frumpy ironic delightful coy and depressing. And impossible. We the living must live and since we're alive we may as well take note. Something like that. I think it was Ebert who said you find yourself laughing and don't know why. Exactly.

So corrosively funny. This is a dour film for sure with so much dry dry dry wit and quirky humor it's impossible not to like it on some level. Filmed in a very spare style often with a static camera and really balanced stable compositions like theater stages we see a short enactment occur.But that makes it seem ordinarywhich it is not. Ordinary life is shown to be frumpy ironic delightful coy and depressing. And impossible. We the living must live and since we're alive we may as well take note. Something like that. I think it was Ebert who said you find yourself laughing and don't know why. Exactly.

A raging storm outside the window of many scenes violent rain people out in it thunder so loud it sounds like a battle raging across the land. This also unifies the tone and gives the impression various scenes are happening on the same dauntingly tempestuous day.Andersson is a master of visual composition and the static middledistance shot and the film has a foggy graygreen look engineered by DP Gustav Danielsson that's perfect because it evokes the gloom of a Swedish winter but also twinkles with the subtle colors of the director's wit which ends every scene with a smile.

One may feel impatient with the succession of barely related scenes which read too much sometimes like the work of a Saturday Night Live writer in need of Prozac.

	schema:reviewBody "I've been wracking my brain to figure out a good comparison in popular media to Roy Andersson's dark comedy You the Living or Du Levande 2007. The best parallel I can draw is to Tom Wilson's comic strip Ziggy. If you are familiar with the comic it revolves around a rather mundane little man Ziggy who always winds up being the butt of his own jokes. Luckily Wilson's comic only appears once a week and is four short newspaper frames at most. You the Living sadly perseveres for an hour and a half.The film is made up of dozens of vignettes. Some are very brief glimpses while others last uncomfortably too long. Almost every scene is taken in a single shot with a wide angle with the camera positioned in one spot. Occasionally there are slow zooms or pans that shift so slowly that the viewer is unsure whether the camera is actually moving or if they are just becoming drowsy from staring so long at an unchanging scene. I have never seen anything filmed like this before with so few shots and perspectives. Most filmmakers try to engage the audience with diverse composition this felt more like I was watching a play because of the static angle. It also had a theatrical quality because of the set. I found the set to be very pleasing to the eye. It reminded me a lot of Wes Anderson's films because everything in it seemed very deliberate like it was in exactly the right place. This contrasted with the subject matter the majority of characters were disheveled and were going through existential crises. They seemed not to belong to the pristine world of this elaborately constructed set. Many of the vignettes began with a character breaking the fourth wall and addressing the viewer Last night I had a dream and the set successfully created the dreamy quality that many of the characters described. Andersson used colors that were very bright vibrant shades and vibrant but they were all washed out shades and seemed to be watered down. The fact that this film took place in contemporary time in an urban setting an imitation of Stockholm but all of the scenery was designed also added to the dreamy quality in which you know that you are in a specific place but it is different for some reason than the way you know it in reality.Though it was aesthetically well put together when it comes down to it I think this is a film that you'll either love or hate. I happened to hate it. It had aspects of the absurd in which there were scenes that could certainly happen but they never actually would because they are far out. All of the characters were caricatures whose actions were disgruntling. They found themselves in awkward situations which were laughable and pathetic. It was like Family Guy because it was so stupid that I felt bad laughing though that is not the strongest comparison because that humor is slapstick whereas Andersson makes you cringe and chuckle at other people's misery. Usually what began as humorous lasted half a minute too long leaving me as a viewer anticipating the next bizarre event tapping feet hoping to escape the current misery. Andersson admits that he has an expressionist influence which I saw come through in this piece. The film was not so much plot driven as theme driven. It never focused on one character for too long but would switch between characters whose lives vaguely intersected. If any take away from You the Living it would be when something is bad it can only get worse. In one of the early scenes a man is practicing the tuba in his apartment. It cuts to the man in the apartment below frustrated with the noise bleeding through the ceiling. He bangs a broom against the ceiling to signal the tuba player to stop but his broom banging ends up knocking down his chandelier. This pretty much sums up the heads you win tails I lose motif. You don't get to really learn any intricacies of the characters. Instead they are all seen as one dimensional and are defined by a certain type of action rather than as multifaceted. There is no passion for any of them and ultimately you don't really care that they are in miserable predicaments because none of them have depth. This is ultimately a very bleak film and even if you find it more amusing than I did it will likely still leave you disheartened.".

	schema:reviewBody "You the Living Sweden 2007 captures every day life's sorrows joys and regrets through the world's best medicine humor. Roy Anderrsson the director and writer of You the Living uses off beat sarcasm similar to that of Monty Python to portray short clips of unglamorous people from all different walks of life. Although many of the characters appear to be in the dumps the whimsical comments and random actions in the background make for a somewhat lighthearted film.Within You the Living there is no clear plot line nor do all of the characters have an actual name but they all a story to tell. The film opens with a frumpy middleaged man snoring and fast asleep on a sofa. In the background you can see that there is a fake skyline out the window which added a humorous touch on the set. The man suddenly awakes and states I just had a nightmare. This first scene set the anticipation for odd and out of place interactions.In addition to the snoring man on the sofa there are several other absurd and rather interesting characters. For example there's the tuba player that announces he lost his retirement money while having unexciting sex with his wife the teacher that cries in front her class because her husband called her a hag the man that gets invited to a dinner party and sent to an electric chair shortly after etc. Collected together these characters create a theme of the common man's life and how dismal yet silly it can be.A way that these strange characters escape their dismal lives and find deeper meaning is through music. Some of the characters are members of a Louisiana music band that plays at rather strange venues. Each individual member of the band is given their own independent life snapshot showing them practicing their music while having rather boring lives. Though their lives are unexciting they're band is a offbeat and quirky. For example the band plays upbeat New Orleans music at a funeral which at first appears inappropriate. That is until a woman accompanying the band sings a song about living in a land without tears or sorrow. The song combined with the place and circumstance added to the nature of the film as I found it comedic touching and somber.Intertwined with music there is a theme of desiring to be loved and feeling unloved. Anna a hopeless purple bootwearing romantic desires to be with Micke Larsson the lead singer and guitarist of a punk rock band. Anxious to see him she practices telling him that she thinks he sounded great at the show she wishes he called her and ultimately that she loves him. None of these words are actually spoken to him which reveals her desperate nature and desire to be loved by him. Towards the end of the film Anna describes a dream in which she marries Micke. The dream has Micke and Anna post wedding relaxing in a moving house. The house comes to a standstill in front of a crowd of random people that congratulate them on their marriage. The scene was rather bittersweet because the dream was whimsical and charming but the reality is that Anna will always long for his love.Though all the characters faced quite different hardships one consistency was having random people with blank stares scattered throughout the majority of scenes. Literally almost every scene had a random nurse or bystander in the background that would stare directly at the camera as someone talked. At first I thought the stares were just to add comedic effect but it also brought attention to those in the background. This effect made me wonder who the main subject was of each scene. Additionally it showed that extras could have an impact on the scene greatly when in a position to stick out.The director Roy Andersson used many camera techniques to make the scene comical yet bleak. For example he used dark colored lens to show the baseness of the plain character's lives. In contrast with these colors he had fake painted skylines that made it hard to take the scene seriously. The majority of Andersson's scenes were used with a tripod and showed the entirety of the scene. This made me feel as though I was an additional bystander observing these people's lives whether it was from across a street through a door or against a wall.Overall the film was quite absurd and mildly entertaining in some scenes. I would recommend this film to anyone that like's Monty Python's humor and doesn't need an in depth story line to be entertained.".

	onyx:emotionText "You the Living Sweden 2007 captures every day life's sorrows joys and regrets through the world's best medicine humor. Roy Anderrsson the director and writer of You the Living uses off beat sarcasm similar to that of Monty Python to portray short clips of unglamorous people from all different walks of life. Although many of the characters appear to be in the dumps the whimsical comments and random actions in the background make for a somewhat lighthearted film.Within You the Living there is no clear plot line nor do all of the characters have an actual name but they all a story to tell. The film opens with a frumpy middleaged man snoring and fast asleep on a sofa. In the background you can see that there is a fake skyline out the window which added a humorous touch on the set. The man suddenly awakes and states I just had a nightmare. This first scene set the anticipation for odd and out of place interactions.In addition to the snoring man on the sofa there are several other absurd and rather interesting characters. For example there's the tuba player that announces he lost his retirement money while having unexciting sex with his wife the teacher that cries in front her class because her husband called her a hag the man that gets invited to a dinner party and sent to an electric chair shortly after etc. Collected together these characters create a theme of the common man's life and how dismal yet silly it can be.A way that these strange characters escape their dismal lives and find deeper meaning is through music. Some of the characters are members of a Louisiana music band that plays at rather strange venues. Each individual member of the band is given their own independent life snapshot showing them practicing their music while having rather boring lives.

	schema:reviewBody "Roy Andersson has become known for his deadpan surrealist and oftendark humor. You the living is a great example of that. It deals with the lives of ordinary strange people with no real connections until you look closer and notice the details. For me that is what makes this movie funny sad and artistically impressive. Andersson is known for tending to use unprofessional actors in his film which add to both the realness of the reality he has created and the offsetting surrealist feel of the film. Thought You the Living Andersson has the actors monologue about their lives often breaking the fourth wall with whatever grievance or happiness is afflicting them. One woman in a very famous scene reflects on a dream she had in which she married her crush. Another woman cries as her class watches because her husband called her a name. The acting is atrocious but the sets are absolutely incredible so that there is a strange disconnect between the actors and their surroundings. At the same time their slightly off looks pale deadlike faces match the sad dreary sterile feeling of the environment they are placed. The humor in this film tends to be completely oblivious to the characters which is a sad commentary on the reality we find ourselves in. A great example from the film is the very sweet looking man who is practicing his drums. He is alone in a very simple room listening to music while keeping beat with his drum which has been muffed. Partway through the scene the door shuts behind him in a seemingly angry way while the man notices does not seem bothered and continues to play. Another example is when a man is recalling a dream he had while slowly passing the camera in his car he is stuck in traffic The entire dream is emotionless for him until the very end when he has the realization that the electric chair is a terrible invention.Andersson uses steady long shots to capture this humor. Because of this he has created a style that is entirely his own with no imitators or followers. This is partly because the shots and construction of the set are so detailed that other directors cannot possibly think of doing it in this way because it is so time and money consuming. When the woman talks about marring the guitarist. Andersson built that large set on a functional rail so it could be moved around and leave at the end of the scene. While digitally altering the film may have been more feasible knowing how much work went into that one scene is incredible and makes watching it again that much more impressive. In this sense I can really see the artistry in this film even if I did not particularly enjoy watching it I can appreciate the effort time and thought that went into each scene.For all its humor and incredible artistry the overall message of the film is rather sad and depressing. Andersson tears about the way we think we fit into this world with his mockery of our feeble attempts to be something special. He even troughs the title in our face with a bit of sarcasm and perhaps contempt You the Living. With the sad monotonous way we live our life and pointing out the humiliation of our existence. Though Andersson has been critiqued for his seemingly blaming stance of society he says he does it with a sad heart and that his films are not meant to anger but are done with understanding and sadness.You the Living is supposed to be the second in a trilogy of films the first being Songs from the Second Floor. His next and third film for this series is anticipated to come out soon. What I find interesting is with his great success of his first movie A Swedish Love Story he was depressed about being pegged for a certain type of style and refused to make a sequel. After years of work not with feature films he has finally been pegged down to a style but it entirely his own and of his own making. In today's world even with a relatively new industry like film that originality and creativity is what I find most impressive especially with his work in You the Living.".

But it can't be bad because none of the stories were taken from the original series or any other shows. All of the stories are original. The show started in November and they already started showing second season shows in June. In fact Nickelodeon has ordered 22 new episodes along with Jimmy Neutron Fairly Oddparents and ChalkZone. More people can relate to the All Grown Up characters so kids have more interest in it. Plus now Dil serves a purpose and they can now communicate with their parents. Nothing is wrong with this show.".

Lil has become more of a girl and more independent from Phil. Phil is still gross but in a more mature way. Dil now talks and is always watching out for Tommy. Angelica isn't as mean as she was in Rugrats. Chuckie is always looking out for Kimi and giving good advice to Tommy. Kimi is always helping the others. And Susie is still a great friend to all of them especially Angelica. I also love the theme song it is very catchy.All Grown Up has many good episodes. My favorites are Coup DeVille Brother Can You Spare the Time? Saving Cynthia and Truth or Consequences. My favorite characters are still Angelica Phil and Lil.

	schema:reviewBody "It is almost inevitable that when something good and entertaining is made in the entertainment biz there's something that is made after it that serves some relation to it but is a piece of garbage. Sadly a great and entertaining show like Rugrats has suffered from this. I'm pretty old for Rugrats but regardless of age the show was still Nickelodeon's best animated show and is definitely one of TV's greatest animated achievements. What has disgraced Rugrats? The spinoff piece of garbage that is All Grown Up.'    All Grown Up has the same characters from the original Rugrats but they are all grown up now and in school. That right there already ruins the entire main idea of Rugrats. Rugrats was such a significant show because it depicted life through the eyes of toddlers and every week would show the adventures' they go on. That's what made it so original the fact that they were babies but now that they're all older it isn't original anymore. It's just like all those other ridiculously awful shows on Nickelodeon.What's even worse about the show is that all the characters now have all these problems involving popularity and all that other garbage and again that is something that furthers this travesty from the original Rugrats.    The animation in this isn't distinct like the original Rugrats. Instead the backgrounds buildings houses all look too generic and plain. The color and look of everything from characters to exteriors is too light and worst of all the drawings look too perfect and really have no significance whatsoever. The original show's animation wasn't the best but that was the beauty of it. The animation wasn't the best ever and it looks like it was done that way on purpose. Back then the characters and backgrounds look like they were actually hand drawn by people and they weren't so plain.    I simply cant stand this vile. The fact that it's predecessor was RUGRATS a great show is ridiculous. If you want to make an animated show that displays problems in the lives of kids in school call it something else just don't relate it to Rugrats. Sitting through this to put it best is a rigorous task. It'll most likely last a looong time seeing as how kids probably watch it.Overall score  out of 10.".

Otherwise the show makes me comfortable.I recommend that everyone watch this show.

I will give credit it is not as bad as ChalkZoneNickelodean's worst or Rocket Power but it is very lacking in I think originality and charm.The good things are that the animation is nice and colourful and the voice acting is very solid.However I cannot stand the theme song it is so uninspired while the writing is often unfunny and the story lines predictable and alltoofamiliar. I don't like the characters as much either Tommy and Chuckie are fine but I personally found Dil cuter when he was a babyand to be honest that was when Rugrats jumped the shark I think and Anjelica has lost her charm and is bratty to the point I cannot tolerate her.Overall disappointing. Not the worst show on Nickelodean but it is far from the best. 410 Bethany Cox".

Chuckie is still as insecure as he ever was which goes well with the awkward geek stereotype he turns out to be.

One of the few pleasant surprises is Dil who turned out to be even weirder than we use to give him credit for. While Phil continues to be a goofoff Lil is in the process of finding her own identity apart from being the female counterpart to Phil.The parents haven't seemed to change a bit they still have that ambience of cluelessness around them which would make for some funny moments when the more sophisticated kids confront them.All of this won't matter however to those that have been living under a rock for the past dozen years or so and don't know who the Rugrats are.The main rule of making sequels is to not just redo  reinvent.Unfortunately I don't see much creative investment in this Rugrats spinoff other than making the characters ten years older. out of  stars.".

To me he's more relatable than all of the other characters put together. My stomach my butt in a unitard?! I can feel it. It starts in my feet and... I've always said the key to happiness is... lowered expectations. I can't fight the man. I can't even get my jacket closed. Those are only a few relatable quotes by Chuckie alone but I'm sure those are enough to prove my point.My favorite episodes have to be Project Chuckie Wouldn't It Be Nice? and The Finster Who Stole Christmas. The first one shows that popularity isn't everything and Chuckie decides to stay a dork. Plus it briefly showed him as a Rugrat! X3 The second one shows that homosexual pairings are perfectly normal even though the marriages weren't real. Plus it shows that there can be too much of a good thing what with Harold and Harriet. Also it shows to not judge a book by its cover with Chuckie and Fridge. The third one has the classic lesson Appreciate the small things in life. Also who doesn't love an episode centered on their favorite character?So overall I feel like All Grown Up is a wonderful yet underrated cartoon and I wish reruns were on again in the mornings when people are actually awake.".

	schema:headline " An awesome show";
	schema:reviewBody "This show was released in 2003 so it was near the era when Nickelodeon rocked and still aired good shows All Grown Up! is definitely one of them.The show focuses on the main characters from the original Rugrats series 10 years older and this was a pretty interesting idea seeing them out of the pen and into the world where they tackle tougher problems.The characters are pretty much the same as they were in Rugrats except older. Tommy who's the leader of the group and still looks out for the others Chuckie who's a risk taker and does look out for Kimi being a responsible stepbrother plus he does give Tommy good advice Phil and Lil who are more independent from each other but are still caring siblings Susie who pursues a career in singing and focuses on her future in college but still a great friend Angelica is much nicer in this series where at 3 years of age she was hell spawn but now she's a lot more tolerable in this series Kimi who likes to help others and of course Dil Tommy's younger brother who's definitely my favorite character from the show. He has a much bigger role in this series which I'm really glad to see. He is weird but nice smart caring isn't afraid of trying new things and doesn't care about what other people think of him.The episodes themselves are pretty compelling I really liked Coup DeVille Lucky 13 O Bro Where Art Thou? All Broke Up and especially the longer episodes like R.V. Having Fun Yet? and Dude Where's My Horse? which almost felt like full length movies than regular episodes. In some of the episodes themselves I like the fact that they discuss more grown up and tougher hardships like going through a breakup or being framed by a con artist. This show was presumably for the people that grew up with Rugrats so they would be able to tackle these kinds of problems at a certain age.The animation is very good the voice acting is solid the episodes are enjoyable and some of the lines are pretty funny. Overall a great spinoff to a great show and I would recommend it to anyone whether you're a Rugrats fan or not.".

	schema:reviewBody "As good as The Rugrats were in their heyday 19914 it's almost painful for me to contemplate how terrible they've become since the first movie in '98.  I absolutely reviled the original All Growed Up special for it sucked.  Though the idea of seeing the 'Rats as teenagers for one episode might be kinda neat to seem people I think that making them tweeners for a whole series and one that seems to have at least some base of popularity since it has yet to be cancelled is REALLY stretching it.  It's bad enough that this show took a lame idea and stretched it out beyond all reason but that could be overcome if this show was written with some degree of wit and originality.  But it isn't.  This is the usual KlaskyCsupo unfunny lowestcommonsixyearolddenominator garbage at best a fifthrate rip off of As Told By Ginger which I dislike but isn't completely terrible contrary to my review of that show.  The plotlines have been recycled from the cliche bin of virtually every kid's television show ever made.  There are plotlines about a career aptitude test everyone from The Simpsons to Hey Arnold! have done that one to Kimmi hanging out with a bad boy name one kid's show that doesn't involve a similar plotline to Susie being ripped off by a supposed talent agent the most recent show to do that was Everybody Loves Raymond but I seem to recall it occurring in a number of other shows as well.  So obviously this show wreaks of originality.The characterization is even worse with the usual cliche teenage characters mixed in with some truly out there characterizations.  Angelica is really the only survivor she's as bossy and egotistical as she's ever been but at age 1213 she somehow seems less entertaining than when she was 3 years old.  Susie's pretty close to what she once was too but she was never more than a marginal character so that's kinda irrelevant.  Tommy is now a dumba wouldbe avantgarde filmmaker remember his brilliant movies about sneezing and dirty laundry? without much other characterization.  Chuckie's very geeky though he's somewhat more rebellious as to be expected but thanks to the ingenious casting of Nancy Cartwright to replace Christine Cavanaugh Chuckie sounds more than ever like Bart Simpson with a head cold.  Kimmi isn't exactly a particularly enlightening character either.  Dil is a weirdo who believes in UFOs or some garbage like that and Phil and Lil are pretty much typical popular kids. And the parents now are virtually nonexistent caricatures of their former selves.So is All Grown Up a ppoor spinoff of an increasingly turgid franchise or simply an average teen show with familiar characters? Actually it's both.  I've watched three eps of this show and they've made me not want to watch any more.  And the theme music is absolutely gutwrenching as well.No stars. I'd rather watch postDil even postKimmi Rugrats shudder than this filth.".

Angelica is definitely nicer than she was in Rugrats and I honestly like her better that way she's much more tolerable and it's a breath of fresh air to see her do more nice things. Phil and Lil are also pretty entertaining and have some good episodes centered on them. Dil of course is my favorite character and I think we can all agree that he's the best character from the show! He's weird yes but that's what makes him so unique from the rest of the characters he's the most entertaining of the lot but most importantly He actually has a purpose in the show! Where in the original show as a baby he didn't really participate much and that's one of the reasons why I like this show as he's actually involved in the episodes. The episodes themselves are pretty compelling they're more teenager oriented which is suitable for the target audience and it does have some good morals.

The movie was terrificly written each line added a new twist to the film. Don't even get me started on the special effects...alright i will get started. The only word that comes to mind is astounding. I've seen a lot of family movies in my life but this one just takes the cake. I also really appreciated the underlying biblical references although i thought they could have been more subtle. The ending was also great and I definitely hope they will do the right thing and make at least one sequel. This is up there not only as one of my favorite Gary Busey movies Along with Point Break Rookie of the Year and of course The Gingerdead Man but one of my favorite movies ever. This movie touched my heart and I know if you watch it it will change your life like it did mind. After watching this i will never look at the world the same way again.".

	schema:reviewBody "Archie Gary Busey is a ruthless businessman who gets what he wants hook or by crook. Having no personal life he concentrates on getting way ahead of the competition. Curiously he also has a strong dislike for dogs. One day as he is driving he spots a dog in the road and swerves to miss the canine. Both of them however end up dead. Now Archie appears before the pearly gates where the angels see no reason whatsoever to let Archie in. But Sweeney Oz Perkins suggests a possible route to redemption. If they send Archie back to earth as the little dog and he can make two huge gestures of goodwill he can enter heaven. It's agreed. Archie returns to earth as a beautiful white Pomeranian named Quigley with Sweeney along as a guide. The former businessman is ordered to set things right for employees at his firm and to make amends with his longforgotten brother Woodward Christopher Atkins and his family a wife and two kids. But how can he do this all as a tiny dog? We'll see! Actually this familyfriendly film has some very nice messages and a truly great cast. Busey is too funny as the canine for we see him talking to Sweeney as himself only in a begging pose. Cute. Atkins Perkins and all of the rest are very very fine as well. The production has also been made with great care for it has lovely camera work costumes sets and scenery. The main thing it lacks is a surefire script and good directionediting. For example most kids will be lost in the first half of the film for Archie's trip back to his former firm is a bit fuzzy. Why is he looking for a disc and how can he make amends with his former employees. Once however the story goes in the direction of the family the pace picks up and children will be entertained. Therefore it is too bad that there can't be a few teaser scenes in the beginning about the family and have the corporate scenes worked into the middle. Nevertheless if you love dogs family films and movies with good morality lessons pick up Quigley. In truth few folks will not adore this darling little dog's abundant talents and tricks.".

Seems like most big budget movies that come out nowadays are either all about the special effects aka weak storyline low brow humor or it's yet another twisted horror movie.So this movie was nice in the sense that it wasn't the usual one of the above.".

It's close to the real life where you mostly never know someone well enough to understand them completely and this turns us around and puts in front of our own feelings and choices.What's most important for me is that this simple almost flat story leaves you pondering afterwards about your own life about your own dreams and achievements are there any or are we caught up in the routine and pleasures leaving at 100 or only dreaming about it could we do more and move somewhere we'd rather like to be than just leaving feed ourselves and others the tales like I'll do this one day not moving one finger to make this actually happen or I'm fine where I am because it's easier to go by the habits than to actually make a change?

FtH told us the story in voiceover and while I love Joe Flanigan's really odd voice the technique took away from the story rather than adding to it. The closest cousin I can think of is A River Runs Through It but in that movie the V.O. didn't take over the storytelling but added perspective to it. I think the problem is that the voice over is a filmnoir technique and the cinematography while occasionally brilliant was generally flat and in a naturalistic style which left me confused by the fusion of the two.Harry wasn't as likable to me as Nick saw him and Nick wasn't as interesting as we were meant to see him. The characters were relegated to second status under the narration and never really allowed to become real. For all of its disparate parts the movie wasn't great but in a way it is memorable if only because it had potential that wasn't realized.The absolute best part of the movie was the awesome original scoremusic by Mark Nichols.".

I think the problem is that the voice over is a filmnoir technique and the cinematography while occasionally brilliant was generally flat and in a naturalistic style which left me confused by the fusion of the two.Harry wasn't as likable to me as Nick saw him and Nick wasn't as interesting as we were meant to see him. The characters were relegated to second status under the narration and never really allowed to become real. For all of its disparate parts the movie wasn't great but in a way it is memorable if only because it had potential that wasn't realized.The absolute best part of the movie was the awesome original scoremusic by Mark Nichols.";

Mercedes has hooked up with a married and washedup actor Harry Harrelson Harvey Keitel who at one time had performed in a television Western series during the 1970s and seldom since accepting him as her lover in part from loneliness and as well from a hope that film parts will be coming her way because of his contacts but these latter are of small consequence as Harry is simply selfdelusional in his attempts at recovering what he perceives as past cinematic renown. In order to adequately support herself financially Mercedes toils as a taxi dancer in a downtown Los Angeles Skid Row dance hallbar while she continues carrying on her efforts to succeed at the motion picture business and it is while there at the dance palace that a young immigrant from Mexico Ernesto Michael DeLorenzo falls in love with her and the largest portion of the narrative depicts his efforts to please the object of his affections even if they may mean losing her altogether. This essentially tradition rooted melodrama is given only a moderate budget despite the presence of a goodly number of wellknown players including Steve Buscemi Anthony Quinn and Stanley Tucci and was kept in the can for about a year before its rather desultory distribution and leaden marketing efforts on its behalf more's the pity as its solid production characteristics are firmly complemented by Alexandre Rockwell's admirably controlled direction a consistent virtue of his work and on display in this film from its very opening scene frames that form a montage behind the credits featuring Perez at Skid Row's Fifth and Main Streets. Rockwell has often demonstrated that he operates very closely indeed with his cast and this holds true in this instance as he allows his actors to create their roles while any ad libbing is neatened nicely via the editing process resulting in an artistic success for the director despite negative comments from some mainstream evaluators. The film's scoring is aesthetically spot on with a good deal of it contributed by Tito Larriva who also plays as band boss for the taxi dancers. Acting honours here must go to the ever vital Perez although nary a subpar performance is turned in. A fair test for any film's quality is given when a viewer will watch it twice within a brief period. Sitting through this undervalued work will be considered a keen pleasure for many.".

It's been done and said before the language and dialog sounds like it was written by a street pimp. The ending is...well I don't want to spoil it. Let's just say it feels unsatisfying. I'd be more upset if the story was any good to begin with. The directing is average with nothing truly wonderful but nothing that is really painful to watch either. To reiterate the acting the only one that does anything worth watching is Keitel. Though I could have lived on without seeing him in tiger print bikini underwear.Oh yeah Eddie Bunker shows up. As random as that mention is that's how random it is in the film. And Tarantino does his director buddy a favor by showing up for about 20 seconds.".

	schema:headline " Mildly entertaining but ultimately complete RUBBISH";
	schema:reviewBody "A really wonderful cast and very talented technical crew wasted their valuable career time and our equally valuable leisure time by bothering to support this utterly predictable and plainly formulaic piece of commercial junk. The movie is based upon a really good and very topical idea but both the producers and the director simply applied the standard Hollywood 'disaster movie' formula and thereby ruined any potential value from the production.An unusually high tide and very strong gale conditions combine to produce a record high storm surge that overwhelms London and floods most of the Thames Valley. The plot centers around a heroic scientist Tom Courtenay who alerts the authorities of the danger and ultimately saves the day a glamorous female police chief who runs the entire show and an embattled Deputy Prime Minister David Suchet who tries to look important.But it's all so unreal that one feels like an extended tea break after just 30 minutes. The young glamorous female Police Commissioner demands complete authority over the army during a declared State of Emergency and gets it as if!. The experienced General is just pushed aside like a complete moron who has to lick her boots because of her obviously superior capacity. The trouble is that our female supremo whilst now responsible for millions of lives spends most of her time worrying over the fate of her two daughters who have taken a trip to South West London and haven't telephoned to say they were alright. So our mighty woman sets her staff to look for them and decides that the sole priority for all the army and the rescue services must be South West London and not any other quarter of the city. Of course the Minister the Army and the entire entourage accept her prioritization without question. One can only assume they all had property there. When her children are eventually found after endless reports and efforts by her staff she is told by our male hero 'Thank God they're safe that's the main thing'. Never mind about the millions of others or all the other responsibilities she was supposed to control as long as her own kids were safe everything was alright. This film is just another excuse to push the same old female chauvinist sexist clap trap that women are the clever mindful caring and clearly able leaders whilst men are good for nothing except physical bravery mindless strength and very specialist knowledge. And yet the one simple instruction that she could have given the populace namely to go to the nearest tall building and calmly go up to the 4th floor or above and await instructions when the waters recede was never given by this female super hero  or indeed anyone else. The whole problem was so simple to solve and yet millions of people apparently didn't think of simply going upstairs! Pathetic rubbish.".

	onyx:emotionText "A really wonderful cast and very talented technical crew wasted their valuable career time and our equally valuable leisure time by bothering to support this utterly predictable and plainly formulaic piece of commercial junk. The movie is based upon a really good and very topical idea but both the producers and the director simply applied the standard Hollywood 'disaster movie' formula and thereby ruined any potential value from the production.An unusually high tide and very strong gale conditions combine to produce a record high storm surge that overwhelms London and floods most of the Thames Valley. The plot centers around a heroic scientist Tom Courtenay who alerts the authorities of the danger and ultimately saves the day a glamorous female police chief who runs the entire show and an embattled Deputy Prime Minister David Suchet who tries to look important.But it's all so unreal that one feels like an extended tea break after just 30 minutes. The young glamorous female Police Commissioner demands complete authority over the army during a declared State of Emergency and gets it as if!.

Or rather a theatre.A few weeks after the film's press coverage has ebbed from public memory. Devoid of any marketing presence and unscreened for critics Flood has appeared at the Apollo Cinema in Piccadily Circus.Perhaps it was a conscious effort not to appear exploitative. Or perhaps the distributor Lionsgate were not particularly confident in the product to give it a wide release. This one print release has all the hallmarks of a token outing. Just a contractual obligation to ensure the film does not get straighttoDVD status.Independently made Flood is as bland as it sounds. An ambitious but wholly routine production which suffers from feeling rather too much like recent TV dramas such as Supervolcano and less like the Hollywood blockbusters it wants to be held in the same regard as.While the disaster film is hardly the most critically popular genre the special effects vehicles do generally have a little more to offer the viewer than this film does. Generally something we haven't seen before.The special effects are impressive but clearly copy scenes we've already seen. There is nothing creative in exchanging one set of landmarks for another.Opening with a sequence styled directly from the Michael Bay playbook Flood's narrative progresses exactly as one would expect. There are no surprises.Powers that be struggle to come to terms with the situation and suffer ethical crises. The military attempt to seize power. And the heart of the film lies in a heavyhanded fatherson rift that must be healed.Tom Courtney is miscast as the scientist whom no one believes ala Dennis Quaid in Day After Tomorrow while Robert Carlyse is the film's male lead. One can't really describe him as a hero. Both actors deserve better than a routine film which shares it's name with an old Irwin Allen film and a recent TV movie.In fact Carlyse is wholly ineffectual as a star presence in this film since he serves only to consistently remind those who've seen it of the excellent 28 Weeks Later. A novel stylish and better made tale of a London apocalypse.Almost the entire cast seem ill suited to their roles and the film as a whole. Only Joanne Whalley walks away with dignity. An oft overlook actress she plays her role as well as it demands and shows up the unknown US TV star who is the female lead. Elsewhere Tom Hardy is wasted and Nigel Planer is an unusual face to see on the big screen. But aside from Carlyse it's the casting of David Suchet that's most notable.The ministerial role he plays demands a high profile Brit. It's an attempt to lend the film an air of respectability. In Transformers Jon Voight was there amid the visual effects to serve a similar function. But as good as Suchet is the casting ploy fails. Just as it did in Executive Decision. Suchet and films have never quite gelled. He's no Rickman or McKellan.Flood is worth a watch on a wet Sunday afternoon it's certainly not a bad film. Just an unimaginative and forgettable one.".

Granted most disaster movies tend to explore familiar territory instead but I can usually live with that.Unfortunately Flood probably marks the low point in the history of this subgenre. Robert Carlyle is undoubtedly the star of the movie even though screen time is split between different locations and characters. He gives a barely decent performance. As well Joanne Whalley is very uneven. Veteran actor Tom Courtenay he played in Doctor Zhivago for heaven's sake is particularly bad. I mean his timing is completely off most of the time and his characterization is extremely poor. What an embarrassing performance for that man. The rest of the cast ranges from decent to really bad with one exception Jessalyn Gilsig whom I thought might be there as a plot deviceeye candy gives by far the most convincing performance. Doesn't mean much considering how bad everybody else is but still nice to see that she cared.The script is really bad confusing and clich. Some of the worse lines I have heard in quite some time are delivered by the actors one after the other.You've seen this story a thousand times. It employs every dramatic hook and tearjerkers you've seen in Outbreak Armageddon the Poseidon movies original and remake and many others.The direction is awful. No sense of timing nothing inspired. The shots are bland dialog and action both fail to flow. Editing is bad but how do you edit such a mess? Without a doubt this movie tried to rely way too much on rather poor CGI. The human factor the drama and struggles of the characters are glossed over. Scenes where the characters must actually face the flood are rare and poorly done. The madeforTV feel gives nausea. Some guy is supposed to go down a rope from an helicopter? No problem let's show him inside a helicopter and make a really poor cutediting job and have the next frame with him safely on the ground in the most obvious way possible.The movie score is rather poor. All over the place no timing.The ending is probably the worse I have seen in quite some time. Very much like they ran out of ideas. Scrap that you can't run out of something if you never had it in the first place. Must have ran out of budget.This is a really amateur job. I give it a 2 for using London as a location which is a nice change for Gilsig being actually decent in a key support role and for the few CGI shots that were decent those of the water closing in on London and the gates.Do yourself a favor and check out Day After Tomorrow or just about any disaster movie before this one. This includes older classics like The Towering Inferno.".

This includes older classics like The Towering Inferno.";

	schema:headline " Everybody gets wet  spoilers";
	schema:reviewBody "Admittedly I switched the TV on a bit late so I missed the beginning of the movie. In fact as I will relay a little further below I also missed the movie's second half approximately. You therefore have to take my critique with a grain of salt as I may have missed a number of absolutely brilliant moments. The scene that greeted my upon switching on consisted of a bunch of people congregating around a suitably large screen in some sort of central command type headquarters which are often found in movies of this type. They stare at an oncoming tsunami wave which is frighteningly high. One woman says 'oh my God!' which certainly struck me as an appropriate remark. Then they let the camera pan around a bit to see what else of interest may be happening nearby. And lo! they discover a man in the water paddling frantically. Apparently he is known to them as the aforementioned woman shouts 'We need this man immediately!'. But why would they need him? Does he have a giant sponge that could be used to remove the excess water? No! In fact since he is evidently dripping wet it's a good bet he would ruin the carpet if invited in. The wetness which is ubiquitous in this movie would penetrate into one of the few sets that are still dry. We can only surmise that the people at the HQ weren't thinking that far due to being in shock. Upon closer inspection it turns out that the wet man is Robert Carlyle so maybe they wanted an autograph? In the meantime the tsunami wave proceeds to flood a faintly familiar looking town. Curiously though the whole process seems not particularly threatening compared to the real life tidal waves we have seen in recent years. For instance this wave for some reason totally refuses to carry any debris along. Also the water bedecking the town is basically ankle deep so it seems more a nuisance than a genuine threat. As you might imagine though nearly everybody in this movie gets thoroughly wet. Not even in 'Waterworld' are there that many wet people. A number of people including the aforementioned Robert Carlyle then walk about below ground sitting around in subway stations which for to me unknown reasons they cannot leave by the normal exits. Naturally walking around there is a bad idea since the water can be expected to flood the area. Why they went there in the first place was slightly baffling to me. However the water turns out to be extremely considerate. Instead of flooding everything at once it decides to wait a bit whenever the group decides to rest a little while for a chat. At one point they actually look almost dry. They then climb up a shaft containing a fire escape type ladder which struck me as a reasonably good idea in view of the lack of normal exits. At that point I fell asleep in spite of the fact that I was actually not tired prior to watching the movie. So I cannot tell you much more unfortunately except that it seems likely that the movie is a healthy natural means of battling insomnia and thus can be recommended as an alternative to taking sleeping pills. At one point I was woken up again by sad choral music and briefly glimpsed dead people floating in the ankledeep water. To call them bad swimmers is probably an understatement. For those who managed to stay awake I sincerely hope that the suspense coefficient went up a little in the second half of the movie. Of course given what can only be called a cursory acquaintance with the movie I can also not be sure whether it addressed any deep philosophical questions. That is a distinct possibility given the serious expressions several of the actors occasionally wore. Obviously things of grave import were held to be transpiring. Keep in mind that my slightly below average 2 out of 10 rating concerns only the part I actually saw.".

	onyx:emotionText "Admittedly I switched the TV on a bit late so I missed the beginning of the movie. In fact as I will relay a little further below I also missed the movie's second half approximately. You therefore have to take my critique with a grain of salt as I may have missed a number of absolutely brilliant moments. The scene that greeted my upon switching on consisted of a bunch of people congregating around a suitably large screen in some sort of central command type headquarters which are often found in movies of this type. They stare at an oncoming tsunami wave which is frighteningly high. One woman says 'oh my God!' which certainly struck me as an appropriate remark. Then they let the camera pan around a bit to see what else of interest may be happening nearby. And lo! they discover a man in the water paddling frantically. Apparently he is known to them as the aforementioned woman shouts 'We need this man immediately!'. But why would they need him? Does he have a giant sponge that could be used to remove the excess water? No! In fact since he is evidently dripping wet it's a good bet he would ruin the carpet if invited in. The wetness which is ubiquitous in this movie would penetrate into one of the few sets that are still dry. We can only surmise that the people at the HQ weren't thinking that far due to being in shock. Upon closer inspection it turns out that the wet man is Robert Carlyle so maybe they wanted an autograph? In the meantime the tsunami wave proceeds to flood a faintly familiar looking town. Curiously though the whole process seems not particularly threatening compared to the real life tidal waves we have seen in recent years. For instance this wave for some reason totally refuses to carry any debris along. Also the water bedecking the town is basically ankle deep so it seems more a nuisance than a genuine threat. As you might imagine though nearly everybody in this movie gets thoroughly wet. Not even in 'Waterworld' are there that many wet people. A number of people including the aforementioned Robert Carlyle then walk about below ground sitting around in subway stations which for to me unknown reasons they cannot leave by the normal exits.

Sorry for this to sound like a rant but it really grinds my gears and has affected me. Most acting was poor and the story tried to copy nearly every clich to each disaster movie ever but just failed in that sense. CGI was poor i could do a better job using ms paint directing poor too and at the end i didn't care about 1 character at all!!! don't waste your time people no wonder it was released straight to DVD.

	schema:reviewBody "I can believe this movie will be a serious disappointment for a person who is used to and likes to watch Hollywood war movies. Four reasons 1. It's made in a world where movie makers tries to have some personality. If you think 'When We Were Soldiers'... well there are hundreds of directors who you can imagine making a similar war movie with personality and values of a hamburger.2. Screenplay has a different structure. There's no shocking opening scene like in 'Saving Private Ryan'. This movie starts slowly in a very nice place and ends slowly in a very bad place without hope or feeling that the characters have achieved something by their heroic actions.3. It is first a movie about lost causes in the world of war and only secondly a war movie which takes place in Stalingrad.4. War scenes portray the horror insecurity and confusion of a battle instead of how cool heroic and exciting fighting looks like. In this sense this movie is closer to reality than most of the war movies you will ever see. 'Thin Red Line' also had similar I would probably crap in my pants in that situationfeeling.Stalingrad whether you think it as a movie or a war movie has so many good things in it... like honesty. Even the ordinary German soldiers were dreaming about farms in Russia when they were advancing. What a disappointment they must have had in Stalingrad! If you like to watch war movies meaning also other war movies than When We Were Soldiers or Saving Private Ryan you should see this one. 910".

	schema:reviewBody "This film affected me on many emotional levels. I saw the results of the war in East and West Berlin in 1957. While in Berlin I lived with a girl my age who lost her father in the battle for Stalingrad. Her tales made my hair stand on end as he was one of the many young Germans send there to fight as a punishment for errorsread that as failure to win in other battle zones.It isn't well understood but the Eastern Front was used as a threat and as a punishment by Hitler. Even Schindler in the film Schindler's List used that threat on the train station in order to get his bookkeeper released from the death train.There are two scenes that will haunt be for the rest of my lifeThe scene where Lt. Hans von Witzland played by a very young and splendid Thomas Kretschmann and the Russian actress Dana Vavrova who plays Irina.That scene is so emotionally charged that it left both actors physically shaking. I can't imagine having to repeat that scene more than once. To have to hold that raw totally exposed feelingexpression and body language while lights are adjusted and a different angle is used must have been physically and mentally exhausting for these two brilliant actors. They perform a brutal Dance Macabre that is both horrific and fascinating. This scene is no longer about an enemy and the one who has been conquered. It is about a young man desperate to find one moment of humanity on an endless nightmare and a young woman who hates him and herself and yet can not resolve her situation. That he is a German and she is Russian is not as important as that they are both souls in torment with no way out.The human agony of that scene is superior to anything I have seen in over 60 years of watching movies.The other is the final scene between Dominique Horwitz and Kretschmann as Fritz and Hans clinging to each other overwhelmed and miniaturized by the vast Russian winter.That final scene reminds me of Napoleon's death march from Moscow in 1812. The results were to same. No enemy can come marching into Russia and live to march out again.I began watching this film firmly committed to cheering the Russians and hating the Germans.By the end I was crying for them all.That is the message of this fine film. War is a waste...a waste of human lives of property and of moral and religious focus.This is a classic antiwar film not unlike All Quiet on the Western Front or What Price Glory.".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw Stalingrad about 7 years ago and to this day it still hits me as hard as the first time I watched it. It is the story of Leutnant von Witzland Unteroffizier Rohleder Obergefreiter Reiser and Oberschtze Mller and their desperate fight for survival in the deadliest battle in the history of war STALINGRAD. The film starts off in Italy in the summer of 1942 where their platoon is resting following heavy combat in North Africa. Soon they are on a train heading for the Eastern Front. The men of 1st Platoon laugh and joke play games write letters home and enjoy the view of western Russia as they head for the Ukraine. This is as lighthearted as the film gets. What follows is a very accurate and graphic portrayal of the infamous battle. It pulls no punches. It's main antagonist is Hauptmann Haller a field police officer who thinks nothing of allowing his men to abuse and murder Russian and Ukrainian prisoners. At one point he lines up a group of civilians and has them shot saying they were partisans.The combat scenes themselves are even more horrific. In one scene a German soldier hits a Russian over the head with a shovel as the Russian is trying to kill Ltn. von Witzland. In another scene a German soldier is cut in half by a Russian tank shell. There are many other gruesome scenes in the film but they are necessary. The world has to see what happened in the Battle of Stalingrad. To see its brutality. To have its heart broken at the horrendous waste of the soldiers' lives. Over 2 million people lost there lives. Only 6000 of Field Marshal Paulus' 250000man 6th Army survived the battle. As with the battle the film itself does not have a happy ending. And that's the way it should be. And as you watch this film remember one thing not every German soldier who fought in the war was a criminal. They were mostly decent people caught up in events well beyond their control.".

Furthermore from what I can see the experiences documented in the film are by and large 'true'  if you read A. Beevor's book 'Stalingrad' you will know what I mean. The film is also successful in the sense that it doesn't allow character or plot to dominate it  it is simply a tale of survival that attempts to depict the battle mainly from the ordinary German soldier's point of view. I've read somewhere that the original screenplay had to be toned down which doesn't surprise me at all  if they tried to really show what the battle was like it would have been almost impossible to make I'm sure. Even so there are still some moments that are difficult to watch  this was made before Private Ryan but is possibly even harderhitting in places. Just one word of caution  don't buy the dubbed 'English' version it's pretty awful and spoils the film  try to get a copy in the original German version with English subtitles it's far more powerful. You may need to buy a Region 1 DVD of the film in this case as I did.".

You may need to buy a Region 1 DVD of the film in this case as I did.";

Saving Private Ryan though  a great film just doesn't bring the horror of war down to the common  foot solider as accurately as Stalingrad. Enemy At The Gates is simply  an awful movie.  Of course with such a movie will come a lot of political overtones.  I'll make just a few comments here. One I am very thankful the allies  won World War II. Secondly when I think of 'Nazis' I think of Hitler  and all of his cronies and all the evil villains who executed the  millions of innocent Jews in the concentration camps. I believe a  majority of Americans believe this way. The German soldiers fighting on  the fronts were simply following orders and bravely fought in this  War as did the American Russians and British soldiers and to each was  their own personal Hell. The sad fact about Stalingrad in watching  this movie is that all of this really happened. Men froze and starve  to death millions of people were killed and generations were lost.  Basically this is a good War movie that ends with no heroism and  accurately portrays the horror of war for the common man regardless of  witch uniform they are wearing.

	schema:reviewBody "Stalingrad should be ranked right up there among the top World War II movies ever made. I can't say it's the best but it certainly is a great film and is under rated in its importance. What the movie is about is simple. It shows the German soldiers war on the Russian front in Stalingrad from the point of view of a few German soldiers. It should not be viewed with the intentions of seeing the battle of Stalingrad or any strategic view of the Russian Front. This is from the eyes of a select few. You won't see the broad picture. Just like the average soldier doesn't see it. He knows and sees the part of the war that is directly around him. That is his world and that is how you will see it. It's often very graphic and brutally honest in its depictions. The cold and the feeling of hopelessness were excellently portrayed. You could just feel it. I did have one major problem with the German English barrier. I watched this on DVD. It was dubbed in English and I chose to also play it with English subtitles. I started to see that frequently the subtitles and the dubbing were different. That was annoying hearing one thing and reading different words for the same lines. I soon shut off the subtitles and started watching it over again from the beginning without the subtitles. I have no idea if the subtitles or the dubbing was the more accurate translation. I'm very glad I viewed this film and I'm sure that I will watch it a second time. Highly recommended. A must see for the historian and war movie fan.".

	schema:reviewBody "The people of my generation and those who are older know about the WW II or as it is called in Russia  the Great Patriotic War not only from the school textbooks but from the witnesses and participants of the event. My granddad was a soldier at Stalingrad and when I was a small girl I used to listen to his stories of how he defeated the Germans. He also told me some anecdotes not all he told me was gloomy. But it was long ago and no when I have a conscious interest for what happened there in the battle of Stalingrad I have to turn to books and movies for information. Somehow most films I saw were made in the Soviet Union only a few in present day Russia. And Stalingrad is an exception. In the movie the war is described from the opposite side and the fact in itself is interesting. All that is shown in the film is quite different from what Im used to.The film reminds me a great deal of Remarques Zeit zu leben und Zeit zu sterben because the war is shown through an ordinary German soldier perception. And this soldier or lieutenant is rather obsessed by repeating he is by no means a fascist. The movie heroes right from neat and enthusiastic Europe from the Italian coast arrive in the snowcovered hungry Soviet Union. They are doomed to die it is clear from the very beginning.After the elite detachment had taken part in their first fight at Stalingrad one of the soldiers said the phrase which reflected the whole idea for me he said If you start thinking you will go mad. And to my mind it is true for spectators as well. From the one hand one may think OK Ill just watch this movie and it wont dissipate me I neednt feel sorry for the people on the screen as it were they who attacked my country and not vice versa. However sooner or later but inevitably one starts sympathizing with the characters. Probably when the lieutenant chokes back his tears at seeing Kolyas execution.Stalingrad is hard to watch all these frostbitten legs dirt executions snow famine destroyed illusions.As far as I know Lt. Hans von Witzland is one of the few films where Thomas Kretschmann played his star roles. I watched quite many Hollywood movies where he was given unimportant parts of small fries such as Next or Transsiberian why did he do it?!. And after I had watched Stalingrad I cannot make out the European actors desire to appear in American movies even secondrated at any cost. The fact puzzles me deeply. I believe Thomas Kretschmann deserves better parts and much better screenplays than those he is given in Hollywood. And out of what I saw with him Stalingrad is the best beyond the doubt.In my opinion the worst Stalingrad drawback is the way they speak Russian in the movie. I mean of course those who are supposed to be Russian. Say the boy who spent some time with the Germans or the girl with whom they planned to escape. Was it really so difficult to find actors able to pronounce a couple of phrases without that horrible accent? Initially I set down to watch Stalingrad just to listen to native Germanspeakers because Im studying the language. I did not expect anything extraordinary of the film. But it impressed me made me cry when I wasnt going to at all. I know Im 15 years late to watch it but Stalingrad is not a runofthemill movie and after 15 years it is still watchable and shocking.".

The same thing happened with soldiers and the Russian boy. It added a feminine touch but come on look at American movies...no where close to love story. There was no storyline does war have a storyline? I think that is a silly criticism. The storyline is this. They start with 400 men and the movie narrowed down to show the lives of about 10 men and how each did their part and died. Death is the ultimate end to any story. Just because there was no happy ending doesn't mean it has no storyline. There was a horrid truth in this movie. I wouldn't necessarily call it antiwar. It had a political statement of course but the movie wasn't all about the politics. In fact except for a few occurrences when the Captain? showed up there was never a stifling air of Nazi Germany. They were far enough out of the reach of the main Nazi party. The fat cats weren't gonna go into Russia!Maybe not completely accurate and not a Hollywood hit but it exhibits a fine knowledge of the common soldier I'd say exactly of almost any nationality and warand what they must go through. It was a losing battle of course the movie is going to be depressing. And to the person who said that it was gutsy and silly to even portray Germans as victims there are victims on all sides in every war any real soldier will tell you that.This movie is a fine balance between movie and documentary. A few problems with it when arguing for just one but it instills the best of both worlds. Watch it as such. Beware however because it is a hard movie to watch if not graphically emotionally.I'm waiting til they make a movie about Iraq. It will probably have many of the same themes and will be very controversial I want to see who has the guts to do it first. Jarhead doesn't count".

	schema:reviewBody "There can be no real victors in war if we value human life at all.  That so many German and Russian boys should die in the snowbound wilderness around Stalingrad is a tragedy beyond comprehension.  The camera crew did a great job in bringing to the screen the vastness of Russia with soldiers camouflaged in white struggling on the point of death across frozen landscapes.  Far from home and missing their loved ones the German soldiers are depicted as rough diamonds with kind hearts sharing their last crust of bread with starving Russian children.  The overall German plan is to take certain cities important in the flow of oil and supply of food to the Russian enemy but their plans are thwarted when the Russian armies encircle them.  The close fighting is well filmed with lots of explosions flames and shattered bodies among fallen masonry.  I liked particularly the contrast of the opening scenes in sunny Porto Cervo where the Germans are celebrating their recent victories with the tragic scenes which followed when calamity overtakes them.I thought too that the three struggling figures exhausted in defeat symbolised the horrific loss of human life and the futility of war. While none of the actors shone above the others their characterisations were adequate enough though I got somewhat confused with such a large cast and all the same uniforms.  The lasting impression is not with individual performances but with the overall mood of this tragic event captured superbly under expert direction.  One soldier says to anotherThis will give us the Iron Cross The replyYes...it will look good on your coffin!".

Compare this if you have ever the opportunity to what 6 German exsoldiers tell about their experiences at the Russian front in the documentary Mein Krieg by Harriet Eder and Thomas Kufus q.v.. I certainly do not want to suggest that Vilsmaier excuses the war or worse but he does not succeed in incorporating the sociopolitical situation if he had ever the intention to do so..There are surely impressive scenes short truce in the plant attack of Russian tanks shooting of Russian civilians e.g. and the battle scenes ar extremely well choreographed the cinematography is sometimes stunning. But on the minus side the cast is never more than average and the music is heavy handed.In short despite elementary shortcomings certainly worth a view.".

Unlike most American films the Germans are not seen as blood thirsty murderers but what the average German foot soldier was a person.The film revolves around four soldiers fighting in Stalingrad. They were transferred there to try and take the city. The film follows these men from August of 1942 to early 1943. During this time they learn about the horrors of war and try to find a way out of the battle.Through the entire film one feels the desperation of the entire battle. Unlike Enemy at the Gates the film makers didn't try to put some sappy love story or dress up factual occurrences of the battle.

The characters do not fight the Soviets out of any ideological hatred between National Socialism and Soviet Communism not for any grand dream of Grossdeutschland or racial superiority. They fight only because if they do not the enemy will kill them and if the enemy does not then their own officers certainly will for refusing to fight. This portrayal adds another layer to the suffocating envelope of trapped hopelessness that pervades the film.A sort of ground based companion to Das Boot Stalingrad frames the epic struggle of World War Two in a personal light and from the unexpected perspective of the ordinary German soldier as a sort of hero made tragic by circumstance and a brutal government that would pervert his sacrifice.".

	schema:headline " '...62 men left out of 400' Realities from the German Stance";
	schema:reviewBody "STALINGRAD  released in 1993 remains one of the most brutally honest depictions of war on film. A brief history of the facts behind this film have been well stated 'The Battle of Stalingrad was a major battle of World War II in which Nazi Germany and its allies fought the Soviet Union for control of the city of Stalingrad now Volgograd in southwestern Russia. It took place between 17 July 1942 and 2 February 1943 and is often cited as the turning point of the war in Europe. The German offensive to take Stalingrad the battle inside the city and the Soviet counteroffensivewhich eventually trapped and destroyed the German 6th Army and other Axis forces around the citywas the first substantial German land defeat of the war. The battle involved more participants than any other on the Eastern Front and was marked by its brutality and disregard for military and civilian casualties by both sides. It was amongst the bloodiest in the history of warfare with the upper estimates of combined casualties coming to nearly two million.' The horror of this battle as written by Jrgen Bscher Christoph Fromm Johannes Heide and director Joseph Vilsmaier manages to allow us to see the 'other side' of the German forces those not committed to the Nazi hunger for world domination but instead were simply men serving their required time in the army hoping to return to their families. The film opens with a prelude German troops of the 6th Army are languishing in Italy after their successful mission in North Africa. They are soon assigned to attack a port in Russia  a place called Stalingrad  and off they go to what is perceived to be another quick victory. The unit is directed by Lt. Hans von Witzland Thomas Kretschmann in a role that should have won him every award possible so fine is his performance he is a man who appears more human than soldier and indeed when his troop arrives in Russian territory he is appalled by the treatment of Russian POWs by German officers a response that places him in a negative light with the Nazis. But Witzland is assigned to take a Russian strong hold with the close help of his group of fellow soldiers played with extraordinary humanity by Dominique Horwitz Sebastian Rudolph Oliver Broumis et al. For a moment in time they are successful heroes but their commitment to the war is rapidly and fully eroded by the slaughter around them and the orders from the heinous Nazi officers to treat the Russians with less than dignity. They are threatened with death by firing squad for their humanity in attempting to give aid to the Russians being constantly attacked and only released form their prisoner status when the war appears to be aimed toward loss. There are many very tender moments between the 6th army and the Russians trapped by the siege of Stalingrad and as the bitter winter sets in the battleweary soldiers are dying committing suicide or attempting to escape and find their way back home. The over two hour study of the cruelty of war ends with a solemn statement both emotionally and visually and the Battle of Stalingrad a victory of the Russians shows the defeat of the minds and lives of the Germans. The film is brave in its commitment to address the fact that the universal 'German image' of World War II is a negative one. This film focuses on individual ideals and the scarring that war on both sides leaves on the soldiers and people who survive it. Highly recommended. Grady Harp".

The German offensive to take Stalingrad the battle inside the city and the Soviet counteroffensivewhich eventually trapped and destroyed the German 6th Army and other Axis forces around the citywas the first substantial German land defeat of the war. The battle involved more participants than any other on the Eastern Front and was marked by its brutality and disregard for military and civilian casualties by both sides. It was amongst the bloodiest in the history of warfare with the upper estimates of combined casualties coming to nearly two million.' The horror of this battle as written by Jrgen Bscher Christoph Fromm Johannes Heide and director Joseph Vilsmaier manages to allow us to see the 'other side' of the German forces those not committed to the Nazi hunger for world domination but instead were simply men serving their required time in the army hoping to return to their families. The film opens with a prelude German troops of the 6th Army are languishing in Italy after their successful mission in North Africa. They are soon assigned to attack a port in Russia  a place called Stalingrad  and off they go to what is perceived to be another quick victory. The unit is directed by Lt. Hans von Witzland Thomas Kretschmann in a role that should have won him every award possible so fine is his performance he is a man who appears more human than soldier and indeed when his troop arrives in Russian territory he is appalled by the treatment of Russian POWs by German officers a response that places him in a negative light with the Nazis. But Witzland is assigned to take a Russian strong hold with the close help of his group of fellow soldiers played with extraordinary humanity by Dominique Horwitz Sebastian Rudolph Oliver Broumis et al. For a moment in time they are successful heroes but their commitment to the war is rapidly and fully eroded by the slaughter around them and the orders from the heinous Nazi officers to treat the Russians with less than dignity. They are threatened with death by firing squad for their humanity in attempting to give aid to the Russians being constantly attacked and only released form their prisoner status when the war appears to be aimed toward loss. There are many very tender moments between the 6th army and the Russians trapped by the siege of Stalingrad and as the bitter winter sets in the battleweary soldiers are dying committing suicide or attempting to escape and find their way back home. The over two hour study of the cruelty of war ends with a solemn statement both emotionally and visually and the Battle of Stalingrad a victory of the Russians shows the defeat of the minds and lives of the Germans. The film is brave in its commitment to address the fact that the universal 'German image' of World War II is a negative one. This film focuses on individual ideals and the scarring that war on both sides leaves on the soldiers and people who survive it. Highly recommended. Grady Harp";

But unlike shown in weekly propaganda news films the German soldiers are neither depicted as heroes nor as Nazis but simply as fathers abandoned husbands and football fans which share one common will to somehow survive and return home.This movie may not be taken light hearted as there is a lot of fighting and dieing and the effects of weapons and ammunition are presented in a rather impressive and authentic way. Yet Stalingrad is not about the battle action but about feeling the madness of war and having empathy for the protagonists' small hopes of escaping the horrors of winter hell. A movies that goes deep under your skin moving gripping thoughtful and making you angry.

	schema:reviewBody "I just recently saw this movie in hopes of seeing an accurate portrayal of the bloodiest battle of the 20th Century. I got what I had expected and so much more. Just to think I came across this movie by luck before I had never even heard of it. It's a German film made in 1993 so I suppose I can't be surprised that it's almost completely unknown to the modern American audience. It's a shame cause this really is a remarkable film I dare say that its as good if not better then Platoon Full metal jacket Apocalypse now and All quiet on the western front all of which are iconic war movies.1942 World War II is in full swing. Nazi Germany has over run Mainland Europe and parts of North Africa then Adolf Hitler orders the full scale invasion of the Soviet Union. A fateful move that ultimately dooms Nazi Germany to defeat. In the early stages the invasion goes well and the German Armies conquer large sections of Soviet territory but a critical battle ensues at Stalingrad A city that hold great symbolic  strategic value. The battle soon turns into a blood bath of epic proportions a nightmare for both the German  Russian soldiers fighting. On the verge of taking the city the Germans are suddenly counter attacked by the Russians who end up cutting off the entire German 6th Army inside Stalingrad. To make matters worse the Russian winter arrives causing incredible suffering for the Germans. This entire battle is seen through the eyes of a few young German soldiers fighting for survival not only against the Russians and the harsh winter conditions but also against their own Sadistic officers who care only about medals  glory and the generals who have little regard for the average foot soldier.This film is going to haunt me for a while. The German Soldiers the film concentrates on are so young and naive then their humanity  sanity are stripped from them and you really do feel sorry for them cause their not the demonic Nazi's often portrayed in film. Everything they were fighting for is no longer important and everything they believed in was shattered and after fighting a gruesome battle against the Russians inside Stalingrad we see them further deteriorate with the onset of Winter causing many to freeze to death. The Battle  Winter scenes were like a horrible nightmare but it also felt so real. It's amazing in the beginning we see strapping young men in the prime of their life and at the end they a shells of their former selves stripped of everything. After witnessing so much carnage these men just loose their will to live on it was really sad. When there is finally a moment of hope they are betrayed by Hitler who ultimately abandons these men to a horrible death which is just another one of Hitler's crimes abandoning the men who fought for him to be slaughtered by the Russians. A good AntiWar film depicts the horrors of war and that's what this movie does. The battle for the tractor factory sequence Is the closest thing that comes to hell on earth but that's really what The Battle for Stalingrad was like. The German  Russian soldiers were depicted with humanity it was only the bad apples specifically on the German side that doomed the men. Bottom line is this film is amazing cause we see how men breakdown physically  emotionally during war. We all have our limits and these men were pushed far beyond their limits in the most deadly battle of our time. What the average foot soldier endured at Stalingrad was beyond imagination. Even if they had survived everything they had seen  done would have scarred them for life.Stalingrad shows us why War is Hell and what exactly hell looks like.".

	schema:reviewBody "Well I fell for it. I saw the box for this at the video store and mistook it for Girlfight which I'd heard was great. In my own defense the titles are similar and they redid the cover art for the box so it looked almost identical. Anyway to sum it up they obviously redid the whole cover packagingpromo to capitalize on the buzzsuccess of Girlfight. I popped it in and got a bad feeling when they started showing trailers for low budget straighttovideo flicks and even worse when a music video of the main song for the movie which sounded like elevator music and featured corny slomo clips from the movie preceded the main feature. When I saw the first few minutes and Maria Conchita Alonso showed up I knew I'd fallen for it. don't get me wrong she's a talented actress but I knew she wasn't in Girlfight the movie I'd been under the false impression I was renting.So apart from me feeling sort of cheated and mad at myself for not looking closer the movie was OK. The plot involves Belle a young Latino woman who is the daughter of an exchampion boxer. One of her close friends is a female boxer whoand I could see all this coming sooo far ahead of time it was really a draggets seriously injured during a match with a mean champ named The Terminator who resembles a female version of a bigger more pumped up Ike Turner. Of course Belle decides that the only thing to do is to become a boxer herself and avenge her friend. She lives with her caring supportive yet protective Dad her mother died of cancer when she was younger who just happens to be a cop. Her love interest also caring and supportive yet protective is also a cop who works with her dad. Hmmm they both have jobs that put their lives in danger in the line of duty...wonder what's gonna happen? She starts training and meets a sleazy manager who of course pretends to care about her but just wants to exploit her. The actor they hired looks like a very lowrent Cary Eweles and is so young he barely manages to have a mustache. His acting was also really really bad. I'm not even going to go into the plot any further because anyone who has seen Rocky or almost anyone knows exactly where this movie is going and how it will end.This was not a completely terrible movie. Most of the acting was OK and the lead actress was very good. There were good strong female Latino role models. The final fight scene did get me sort of interested even though I knew everything that was going to happen long before it did. The actress that played The Terminator did a great job of being unlikeable enough that I really did want Belle to kick her a and rooted for Belleagain although there were absolutely no surprises. My favorite moment maybe the only moment where I wasn't mad at myself for renting the movie by mistake was when Belle slaps her sleazy manager after he's shown his true colors yells at him and then turns away only to suddenly fake a punch and watch him cringe back in fear showing that she is really the one in charge.The dialogue was really really bad my main complaint.  One of their attempts to be witty was someone discussing boxing saying size doesn't matter and the female replying wryly now where have I heard that before? Other lines that are supposed to have dramatic impact are The doctors told me I may never walk again! Come on you know you can trust me! and Your mother would have been so proud of you. I could go on and on. Nothing you haven't heard a million times before in bad soap operas or moviesoftheweek. Maybe I'm being too meanthe filmmakers did make an effort and I did sit through the whole thing voluntarily...but only because there was nothing else to watch while I worked out. You could do worse especially if you are looking for a movie with strong female characters but you could also do much much better.".

	onyx:emotionText "Well I fell for it. I saw the box for this at the video store and mistook it for Girlfight which I'd heard was great. In my own defense the titles are similar and they redid the cover art for the box so it looked almost identical. Anyway to sum it up they obviously redid the whole cover packagingpromo to capitalize on the buzzsuccess of Girlfight. I popped it in and got a bad feeling when they started showing trailers for low budget straighttovideo flicks and even worse when a music video of the main song for the movie which sounded like elevator music and featured corny slomo clips from the movie preceded the main feature. When I saw the first few minutes and Maria Conchita Alonso showed up I knew I'd fallen for it. don't get me wrong she's a talented actress but I knew she wasn't in Girlfight the movie I'd been under the false impression I was renting.So apart from me feeling sort of cheated and mad at myself for not looking closer the movie was OK. The plot involves Belle a young Latino woman who is the daughter of an exchampion boxer. One of her close friends is a female boxer whoand I could see all this coming sooo far ahead of time it was really a draggets seriously injured during a match with a mean champ named The Terminator who resembles a female version of a bigger more pumped up Ike Turner. Of course Belle decides that the only thing to do is to become a boxer herself and avenge her friend. She lives with her caring supportive yet protective Dad her mother died of cancer when she was younger who just happens to be a cop. Her love interest also caring and supportive yet protective is also a cop who works with her dad. Hmmm they both have jobs that put their lives in danger in the line of duty...wonder what's gonna happen? She starts training and meets a sleazy manager who of course pretends to care about her but just wants to exploit her. The actor they hired looks like a very lowrent Cary Eweles and is so young he barely manages to have a mustache. His acting was also really really bad. I'm not even going to go into the plot any further because anyone who has seen Rocky or almost anyone knows exactly where this movie is going and how it will end.This was not a completely terrible movie. Most of the acting was OK and the lead actress was very good. There were good strong female Latino role models. The final fight scene did get me sort of interested even though I knew everything that was going to happen long before it did. The actress that played The Terminator did a great job of being unlikeable enough that I really did want Belle to kick her a and rooted for Belleagain although there were absolutely no surprises.

The only original thing in Knockout is that The Kid is here a girl rather than a boy... but basically precious little is made of that. This could serve as an example of how not to make a movie about female boxers. I suppose in technical filmmaking terms and in acting it's a reasonably competent riff on the old tunes... but lawdy they are old tunes.
