The other standout moment is when he meets the arsonist at the porno theater. The arsonist has been there and back 100 times and knows his business. He knows the right way to destroy a man's dreams for profit. To say the scene is frightening is an understatement. But it's a testament to the brilliant and Oscar winning screenplay by Steve Shagan.This is one of those rare films for adults. Frightening powerfully thought provoking.

	schema:reviewBody "Save the Tiger is about lost illusions of youth and the things some of us have to do to merely keep treading water. Jack Lemmon is the head of a garment factory which has suffered some losses over the past few years and he and partner Jack Gilford see few options that will save them from bankruptcy or worse.The best of these options is to start an arson fire in their factory and hope the insurance payoff will cancel their debts and afford a fresh start. Gilford is against it on moral principles but Lemmon is a guy who can't afford morals at this stage as George Bernard Shaw once put it.Still he looks back on his youth and the things and people that moved him back in the day and wonders how he got in the mess he's in. It's not supposed to be like this for people like him who've had ideals and tried to play by the rules.In his facial expressions his vocal intonations in every move of his body and soul Lemmon becomes Harry Stoner the latest convert to cynicism. It's what got Jack Lemmon his Second Academy Award this time for Best Actor. Interesting that this very cynical film came out the year that a whole lot of Americans became very cynical as Watergate was unfolding before them. Arson fire is a tricky business and Lemmon puts himself in the hands of Thayer David who I think gives his best screen portrayal here as the professional arsonist. Listening to him as creepy as he sounds he comes off as a man who knows his business. He even at one point offers to return the down payment given him when he explains that insurance will never pay off with all the fire regulation violations Lemmon and Gilford have in their place. It's a business with him and no fatalities must occur otherwise it's a Law and Order episode.Jack Lemmon was one of the best around could do all kinds of comedy and drama with equal skill. Building on the characters he created for Billy Wilder he's an older man now who's in no position to start from scratch again. Lemmon plays a character that all of us over 40 can definitely relate to.Save the Tiger is a serious and thought provoking drama about choices each and every one of us could face some time in our lives. It's universality of theme will make it an enduring classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is a wellcrafted movie directed in 1973 by John G Avildsen in a conventional theatrical manner harking back to social dramas of 10 or 20 years before but reflecting the more uncertain '70s in  its unresolved ending. Jack Lemmon delivers a brilliant Oscarwinning performance as Harry Stoner a middleaged man at the end of his tether who confuses his personal midlife crisis and the failure of his fashion business with what he sees as the USA's moral decline in the postwar years. Obsessed with the lost cameraderie of his active service in the war with the baseball and jazz giants of yesteryear and with the slain and fallen idols of the 60s Kennedy King Monroe etc he sleepwalks into his own moral abyss of an arson plot comforting himself that he is no worse than the times in which he lives.  Lemmon's character is countered by those of Phil Greene his business partner convincingly played by Jack Gilford and Meyer William Hansen the firm's veteran expert cutter and refugee from Nazism. Phil does not suffer Harry's sense of disillusion because he is too downto earth to have experienced the illusion in the first place Meyer also despite superficial discontent with the changing times gains strength from his skill and family life.For me the main theme here is the familiar one of the lost American Dream and the film brings to mind the final lines of the seminal exploration of that theme the Great Gatsby  So we beat on boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past. Harry's American Dream is not of a golden future but of a golden past it isn't lost it simply never existed. But that said in this movie thematic analysis definitely takes second place to appreciation of Lemmon's bravura performance.".

	schema:headline " A Movie You Can Watch Many Times and Always Enjoy";
	schema:reviewBody "Save the Tiger is a great movie perhaps because its strongest moments come in rather conventional situations where the believable characters are realistically profane but never gratuitously vulgar which is a common failing in today's films. Some might call this unpretentious realism slow pacing but I don't think there's anything slow about it unless your attention wavers with anything less engaging than several gruesome deaths or graphic sex scenes per hour. On the contrary I find this interesting flick to be sophisticated and entertaining. Having seen it at a theater when it first came out and then having watched a heavily censored TV version on numerous occasions since that time I rented the new DVD and was once again blown away by the original uncensored script. The often biting interplay between pragmatic businessman Harry Stoner played by Jack Lemmon and his more idealistic partner Phil Greene played by Jack Gilford supplies among the film's most dramatic moments as they wrestle with a rather drastic solution designed to keep Capri Casuals afloat for another season. Equally effective is the gritty exchange between Stoner and a kinky Midwestern buyer who becomes adamant that he be supplied with a favored prostitute as a precondition for placing his usual generous order. Stoner's attempts to discourage him prove fruitless and only make him more determined to get what he wants. Facing this unexpected resistance the client pleads I need these little diversions explaining that his wife is a sick woman all scarred up from all those damn operations. But the callgirl is all booked up for the day. That's a very popular lady Stoner explains. Why didn't you call me from Cleveland? Harry the client responds beginning to lose his cool I don't make calls like that from Cleveland. When Stoner makes one last attempt to weasel out of pimp duty by bringing up the expense involved the client finally blows his stack. You rotten son of a bitch he cries. The whole goddamn thing is a write off! I throw my heart across your desk and you're giving me cost! Suddenly Phil pops into the office and things cool down immediately. This is good stuff. As well the tension boiling over between the old Jewish cutter and the pompous gay designer provide grist for some brief fireworks. Another high point is Stoner's interaction with a naive young hippie girl named Myra who hitches a ride with him down Sunset Blvd. She at first comes off as rather superficially and stereotypically drawn but in time becomes more appealing offering Harry nonjudgmental affection with no strings attached and a temporary refuge from the pressures and stresses that are edging him ever closer to a nervous breakdown. In contrast while he's obviously cracking up the only attention he gets from his concerned yet emotionally distant wife is Go see Dr. Frankfurter. A guy in a white coat named hotdog is supposed to fix him right up? Gee I don't think so. Why doesn't she try putting out a little more? The scenes in the porno theater with the cool and efficient arsonist are also good as is the one in which Stoner's bitter memories from WWII surface rather inconveniently while he's onstage attempting to address the assembled buyers at the allimportant fashion show. There he suffers a disturbing hallucination in which audience members are suddenly replaced by his fallen comrades in Charlie Company who died at Anzio. His grip on reality takes a serious nosedive right in front of his potential clients. I suspect that scene is considered the best one by professional critics and members of the Academy but ironically it is my least favorite moment. In any case Jack Lemmon has so many good scenes in this movie that it is difficult to single out any one of them as the best. In my most recent viewing I got the biggest kick out of one of the early scenes in which Lemmon imitates the windup and delivery of a great pitcher from the good old days his fond memories of baseball and jazz being all that inspire him anymore. When you want to see a good movie from the past cue this one up. It never gets old.".

Having seen it at a theater when it first came out and then having watched a heavily censored TV version on numerous occasions since that time I rented the new DVD and was once again blown away by the original uncensored script. The often biting interplay between pragmatic businessman Harry Stoner played by Jack Lemmon and his more idealistic partner Phil Greene played by Jack Gilford supplies among the film's most dramatic moments as they wrestle with a rather drastic solution designed to keep Capri Casuals afloat for another season. Equally effective is the gritty exchange between Stoner and a kinky Midwestern buyer who becomes adamant that he be supplied with a favored prostitute as a precondition for placing his usual generous order. Stoner's attempts to discourage him prove fruitless and only make him more determined to get what he wants. Facing this unexpected resistance the client pleads I need these little diversions explaining that his wife is a sick woman all scarred up from all those damn operations. But the callgirl is all booked up for the day. That's a very popular lady Stoner explains. Why didn't you call me from Cleveland? Harry the client responds beginning to lose his cool I don't make calls like that from Cleveland. When Stoner makes one last attempt to weasel out of pimp duty by bringing up the expense involved the client finally blows his stack. You rotten son of a bitch he cries. The whole goddamn thing is a write off! I throw my heart across your desk and you're giving me cost! Suddenly Phil pops into the office and things cool down immediately. This is good stuff. As well the tension boiling over between the old Jewish cutter and the pompous gay designer provide grist for some brief fireworks. Another high point is Stoner's interaction with a naive young hippie girl named Myra who hitches a ride with him down Sunset Blvd. She at first comes off as rather superficially and stereotypically drawn but in time becomes more appealing offering Harry nonjudgmental affection with no strings attached and a temporary refuge from the pressures and stresses that are edging him ever closer to a nervous breakdown. In contrast while he's obviously cracking up the only attention he gets from his concerned yet emotionally distant wife is Go see Dr. Frankfurter. A guy in a white coat named hotdog is supposed to fix him right up? Gee I don't think so. Why doesn't she try putting out a little more? The scenes in the porno theater with the cool and efficient arsonist are also good as is the one in which Stoner's bitter memories from WWII surface rather inconveniently while he's onstage attempting to address the assembled buyers at the allimportant fashion show. There he suffers a disturbing hallucination in which audience members are suddenly replaced by his fallen comrades in Charlie Company who died at Anzio. His grip on reality takes a serious nosedive right in front of his potential clients. I suspect that scene is considered the best one by professional critics and members of the Academy but ironically it is my least favorite moment. In any case Jack Lemmon has so many good scenes in this movie that it is difficult to single out any one of them as the best. In my most recent viewing I got the biggest kick out of one of the early scenes in which Lemmon imitates the windup and delivery of a great pitcher from the good old days his fond memories of baseball and jazz being all that inspire him anymore. When you want to see a good movie from the past cue this one up. It never gets old.";

His life is still influenced by all three but only in quick  flashes of fond memories or flashbacks of a beach in Italy.  Lemmon gives us a character that does what he has to do in order to maintain what he has worked for and that rationalizes that which may or may not be quite on the upandup.Jack Gilford is excellent as his partner in Capri Casuals representing a voice of conscience that is not quite as blind to circumstance as Jack's character and there are several other good performances in the film.

At times pea green the Los Angeles air chokes the life out of all things living It's the pollution Harry. It makes everybody crazy. So says Harry's business partner Jack Gilford. He's the moral compass. Stoner lives a complicated life. His home life is mired in an open abyss of emotional torment. He attempts to close it by suggesting to his wife some ways in which they can spice up their love life. He is rejected. He looks somewhere else for solace. The highlight of the film is the onenight stand Harry has with a hippie chick. It's everything his life with his wife isn't loving caring exciting and different. She's a good listener. The picture moves into darker territory when Gilford and Lemmon take in an xrated flick a Swedish affair at the local art house. The picture leaves them less than compelled. But they are there to hire a professional arsonist to torch their establishment. Watch the screen Harry the arsonist says in hushed tones. Director Avildsen has a deft eye for the material. Marvin Hamelish's score works well. I love the movie's poster of Harry Stoner gazing out toward the horizon. It's an understated gem. And the baseball metaphor hits a home run Hey mister you can't play with us!. Good game.".

His friend and business partner is played by an extraordinarily effective Jack Gilford a rubberfaced actor with the saddest eyes you'll ever see best known to a generation as the Cracker Jack man.Like Lancaster's Neddy in The Swimmer Lemmon's Stoner in Tiger is undergoing more than an evolution but a breakdown not only emotionally but spiritually as well. Each story is a type of firstperson morality play as seen through the eyes of these central characters.Lemmon won the best actor Oscar for his performance beating out among others Redford for his turn in The Sting and the film was voted best drama by the Writers Guild of America.Both films seem to have evaporated into the mists of time little remembered or considered by generations that came after. But they've stayed with me I like to think because they were both beautifully rendered and had something worthwhile to say expressing it uniquely and well. If you're in the mood for thoughtprovoking character studies that will stay with you long after viewing and for all the right reasons I recommend giving them a look.".

	schema:headline " Lemmon Pours Himself Into This Great Act of Filmmaking.";
	schema:reviewBody "Save the Tiger is the account of a day and a half in Harry Stoner's life. John G. Avildsen sets the tone with a deliberately paced opening scene In a frigid dawn the heated swimming pool steams grimly outside his Tudor manse. The film thoughtfully unfolds and we spend what feels like real time in a good way comfortably easing into Harry's routine. We learn he sends his daughter to a Swiss finishing school drives a limousine equipped with a telephone and has a wife who suggests that he see a Dr. Frankfurter to cure his nightmares. He manages a huge amount of people he helps fuel the economy he pays his . . . well last year he didn't actually pay his taxes. He and his partner did a nice dance with the IRS who hopefully won't figure that out. It opens when Harry wakes up from a nightmare and it closes with some kids who don't need him as a utility infielder in their baseball game. Harry is a partner in a dressmanufacturing firm and this is his big day as it's the day when he presents his new line to the outoftown buyers. Countless things happen to Harry during the day. A buyer almost dies of a heart attack on him he has a couple of deeply reflective conversations one with an ancient European tailor one with the last of the beatniks and he plots to have one of his warehouses set on fire.And still the entire time his mind is on other things. He is plagued by his recollection of how simple life was in the 1940s. The title comes from a campaign to save tigers from extinction to which Stoner contributes. Then later on beatnik tells him that she read in the National Geographic about how tigers and other wild animals return to places of remembered beauty to die. Harry's place of remembered beauty is a professional baseball lineup the Brooklyn team in the 1940s the boys of summer. Harry was not such a bad ball player himself at one time. Now he deceives pimps steals designs from his rivals and finds himself negotiating with an arsonist. He wrestles with the guilt of surviving the war and yet losing touch with the ideals for which his friends died. He can't entirely grasp what went awry. His dream was to meet a budget not being on one.Save the Tiger is indeed invigorating in its offering of apprehensions and dismay brought out into the open the handling of notions and intimate answers to the perceived moral dilemmas of modern times and the puncturing of stereotypes that have clenched many into angles where they cannot comprehend the people with whom they share the world and cannot truly grasp the intricacies and dichotomies that make up the layers of daily life. But Save the Tiger is primarily a monolithic piece of movie acting. Jack Lemmon carries this great movie which he was determined to get made by the very impact of his performance as Harry. He makes this character so persuasive that we're mesmerized. Gilford's eye and ear in his altercations with Lemmon bring a sort of contrast. They persuade us they've been having this same fight for 20 years. There are countless other good performances in the movie too particularly Thayer David's professional arsonist and Laurie Heineman's hippie girl.There's barely a topical subject that isn't referred to occasionally two or three times. Save the Tiger is an implosion of writer Steven Shagan's philosophical stockpile over the late 1960s and early '70s as well as by far director Avildsen's most triumphant attempt to interpret the mold of 1930s and '40s characters spirit and narrative into a misanthropic and progressively autonomous 1970s. Yet the movie's scrutiny of topical subjects isn't crucial to what makes it exhilarating. When Jack Lemmon and his partner Jack Gilford are feuding over the ethics of committing fraud we aren't listening to the substance of the altercation quite as much as we're relishing the smoothness of its fabric. Lemmon and Gilford pack such vitality such agility and banter into their carriage of the dialogue that their scenes together have a life alternately apart from the movie's indications.No the movie's not philosophically right as rain. Nothing is! Naturally there are disfigurements in Harry Stoner's character and we shouldn't let him go scot free feeling so idealistic and nostalgic. Yet my whole analysis is askew it feels like. The exhilaration to be had at this movie comes from the way the performers and John G. Avildsen distill a sequence of scenes that are human temperamental crimson. We have spent the day with Harry and owing to Lemmon's performance he won't be consigned to oblivion not like Lou Gehrig Joe Penner or Henry Wallace.".

The film combines a realworld plot with colorful yet believable characters. I saw it in a theater the year it was released and have viewed it many times since. Each time I see something new in it. It was released four years after I left a job that brought me into contact with a number of reallife Harry Stoners struggling to get by in their small closelyheld businesses. There are so many great scenes and lines. One of my favorites is Harry Stoner's afterhours talk with his elderly veteran cutter and Harry's reply when the cutter asks what Harry really wants. The emotion and symbolism in this film surpass any I've seen in other flicks. That it did not rate in the top 400 films of all time clearly indicates the ratings committee never viewed or understood it. Or maybe they snobbishly dismissed it for Lemmon's noname supporting cast.".

Much much much respect to Jack Lemmon as Harry Stoner. There are no less than halfadozen scenes of considerable tonalemotional difference in which he is palpably fabulous so moving and edgy. He truly is throughout though. His Oscar is well deserved for this film much less an awesome career that by then was 20 years full of terrific work.

His performance is equally compassionate true and grounded. The relationship between themEastwood  Morgan Freeman in Million Dollar Baby comes to mindas old friends partners and confidants is beautiful. It costs me 200 just getting out of bed a paraphrase Stoner says to his wife while preparing for the day this after waking up after another nightmare. And through the day his life and mind become intermingled with the dread and uncertainty of getting by. No answer is clear or convenient. In a fickle yet brutal world there is no rest for the weary. Save the Tiger is not a direct indictment of business or success in America. Nor is it morally weighted. Like so many other films of the time it is a unflinchingrawhonest character study of an everyman in the mix troubled by bills taxes the past and the future. It is also a rendering of what posttraumaticstresswar can do irrespective of time to the mind and heart of a person. The touch of WWII adds a gravity and understanding to the film. I highly recommend Save the Tiger. Not too long interesting and full of great acting especially from Jack Lemmon.".

In fact just as something substantial was about to happen the film abruptly ended. But I cannot put this into perspective as I did not see the whole film. Of course the it was worth watching just for Lemmon's performance alone who was as superb as always. A rare gritty quality American drama.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jack Lemmon was the finest American motionpicture actor of the late twentieth century. He is often written off as a comedy star and certainly some of his efforts in that realm of Hollywood entertainment are forgettable though more than a few are still very human and very funny. But it is always exciting to see Lemmon unlimber his acting chops and portray the middleclass schlub trying to thrive and then just trying to survive modern life. His portrayal of Harry Stoner in SAVE THE TIGER ranks with his Joe Clay in THE DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES Ed Horman in MISSING and Shelley Levene in GLENGARY GLEN ROSS to mention only his most notable dramatic roles. I'd like to think the Best Actor Oscar that Lemmon received for SAVE THE TIGER he had been awarded Best Supporting Actor for playing Ensign Frank Thurlowe Pulver in 1955's MISTER ROBERTS was the film community's overdue recognition that he could play for sighs and tears as well as for laughs.Seeing this film recently on TCM through the filter of 35 years I was still moved by the commitment of Jack Lemmon to Harry Stoner. Unfortunately SAVE THE TIGER remains an awkward and extremely selfconscious movie as much so as when I first saw it in a theater in 1973. Steve Shagan's script contains no references to the Watergate scandal that had started the year before but in the aftermath of the Vietnam War American popular culture was becoming increasingly obsessed with moral decay. Many novels and films of the 1970s suggested that political corruption and official deceptions had blurred the boundaries of conventional goodbad blackandwhite morality with which most Americans had supposedly been comfortable. That was the standard they usually saw in the movies after all. Viewed from the perspective of the early 21st century the suggestion that government and corporate wrongdoing could somehow make personal immorality understandable or even commendable seems rather quaint  a sop perhaps to a moviegoing Baby Boomer generation that was coming of age and groping for its own moral grounding.There are many problems with this clunky script not so much in terms of plot as in terms of texture. Harry Stoner's obsession with the joys of his youth  baseball and big bands  quickly turns into a heavyhanded exercise in nostalgia as though Shagan is showing off his knowledge of 1940s popular culture Shagan was born in 1927. Harry's apparent readiness to hire an arsonist to save his troubled business makes his moral agonizing less involving though perhaps Shagan meant to enhance the difference between Harry's seeming confidence and the severe misgivings of his partner Phil Jack Gilford. The big dramatic setpiece of the film  Harry's speech to the buyers at his firm's fashion show  is extremely suspicious. Harry strikes me as too much of a professional to start losing it at such a vital moment. Why THAT event for a PTSD flashback? There's another scene toward the end of the film  Harry standing alone on a beach replaying the soundtrack of Anzio in his head  that's more subtle and more effective. And then there's Myra the happygolucky hippie chick with whom Shagan apparently thought the kids could identify. With a smile she offers to have sex with Harry about 47 seconds after they meet. Yeah I could identify with that. Myra's seeming innocence and optimism have so little to do with Harry Stoner that she seems not a contrast but an irrelevance.Shagan's script benefits from the direction of John G. Avildsen. The opening shot of Harry's swimming pool is haunting and industrial Los Angeles looks appropriately unglamorous. All of the actors including Laurie Heinemann as Myra are credible. But the real reason to see SAVE THE TIGER is Jack Lemmon portraying Harry Stoner. If his performance can't rescue the film it is still compelling  an exploration of a human heart that will break your own.".

All the elements were in place a fine story written by Talbot Jennings  Frank Cavett which is worked from Bernard DeVoto's historical study of the American fur trade in the 1830s. Wellman The Call Of The WildBeau GesteBattleground at the helm Hollywood's golden boy Clark Gable in the lead and a sumptuous location shoot around the San Juan Mountains to be photographed by William Mellor. With all the talk coming out of MGM that they wanted to make an epic picture hopes were high for the early 1950s to have a Western classic on its hands. Enter studio boss Dore Schary who promptly cut the piece to ribbons. So much so that the film where once it was epic is now a choppy and episodic 78 minute experience. With a narration by Howard Keel tacked on by Schary just so we can try to make sense of what is has gone on. Wellman was rightly miffed and tried to get his name taken off the credits.Amazingly what remains is still a recommended piece of film for the discerning Western fan. The locations are just breath taking expertly shot in Technicolor by Mellor at times rugged and biting at others simply looking like God's garden. This part of the world is the perfect back drop for the story as the white man's greed brings them into conflict with the Native Americans. The film also boasts an array of interesting characters we got the Scots and the French represented alongside the usual suspects while the tracking and fighting sequences are expertly filmed by the astute Wellman. It was a tough shoot all told as well. Ricardo Montalban Blackfoot Indian Ironshirt was involved in a horse riding accident the consequence of which would severely affect him later in his life while stunt man Fred Kennedy suffered a broken neck when his intentional fall from a horse did not go as planned. The horses too you can see really earned their oats trekking up hill across sharp jagged rocks and ploughing through snow drifts magnificent beasts they be. Joining Gable and Montalban in the cast are John Hodiak James Whitmore Mara Elena Marqus Adolphe Menjou and Alan Napier. David Raskin provides a suitably at one with the atmosphere score. With Gable on form mixing with the high points that Schary left alone Across The Wide Missouri is more than just a time filler.

	schema:reviewBody "This film does a good job of portraying the story of the mountain men who trapped beaver in the Rocky Mountains and played a significant role in winning the West.  Clark Gable is the star of this film.  He plays a trapper who falls in love with a Blackfoot maiden Maria Elena Marquez.  He buys her from a Nez Perce chief hoping to use her to get into the good graces of her grandfather a Blackfoot leader.  Ultimately he falls in love with her.The romance between Gable and Marquez is the real story of this film.  It is much more believable than the relationship between James Stewart and Debra Paget in Broken Arrow.  In the first place the two of them can't talk to each other.  Gable needs an interpreter to talk to his wife.  The relationship compares to the forced marriage between Robert Redford and a Flathead girl in Jeremiah Johnson.  Gable's affection for his Blackfoot wife is obvious throughout the film.The film paints a much kinder picture of Native American life than many Westerns.  Like Dewey Martin's character in The Big Sky Gable returns in the end to the Blackfeet.  He has learned to value Indian life and wants to raise his son with her mother's people.The film portrays the real life capture of fur trapper John Colter by the Blackfeet.  Captured by a young chief named Iron Shirt Gable must run for his life.  The film should have taken more time with this exciting scene. It is far too short and not nearly as exciting as it should have been.  I enjoyed Henry Fonda's run for his life in Drums Along the Mohawk but it was very poorly done here.  Colter's successful escape from his Blackfeet captors deserves a better rendering.This film is worth watching for the beautiful high mountain scenery and the romance between Gable and Marques.  The soundtrack is not particularly original giving us constant variation on the old standard Shenandoah but it is pleasant listening.  Enjoy it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Across the Wide Missouri was planned as a sprawling saga of early 19th Century Americana so there are questions as to how and why it ended up in its present truncated 78 minute form not much longer than a B picture. There shouldn't be any argument that director William A. 'Wild Bill' Wellman's original vision was grander in scope even epic. Evidence of the cutting can be clearly seen in the cover of the DVD which duplicates the original one sheet poster. Actor James Whitmore a big favorite of Wellman's is given costar billing and is listed fourth overall in the cast behind MGM leading men Clark Gable Ricardo Montalban and John Hodiak and ahead of such venerable character actors as Adolphe Menjou J. Carrol Naish and Jack Holt.Whitmore had starred in the director's previous film The Next Voice You Hear in 1951 and had earned an Oscar nomination for his scenestealing performance in Wellman's iconic 1949 WWII actioner Battleground. In the released version Whitmore is not billed in the opening credits and does not appear in the 78 minute film until some 33 minutes into the movie. He cannot be spotted with the mountain men in the sizable Rendezvous sequence early in the picture and is not seen on the trek over the Rockies until they're halfway there when he suddenly appears out of nowhere on top of a snowcovered mountain. For the remainder of the film he has only a handful of unimportant lines which makes one wonder why one of Hollywood's most respected character actors would be squandered in what is essentially a bit role. Among the many ironies associated with this film is that according to studio records his character's name is Bit.Wellman's MGM contract had concluded with the completion of The Next Voice You Hear but when Metro found themselves without a director for their scheduled epic they asked Wellman to helm the film. 'Wild Bill' agreed on the condition that he be allowed to bring his family along with him on location  at the studio's expense an offer he couldn't refuse when MGM agreed to his request. With three Alist stars an exceptional supporting class of character actors and breathtakingly beautiful locations it should have been a blockbuster. It wasn't. The blame if any can be laid at the feet of studio boss Dore Schary who undoubtedly panicked after attending a preview when he found that the audience that had cheered the opening credits lost interest about halfway through. Producer Sam Zimbalist who wasn't involved with the picture suggested drastic cuts to be bridged by an afterthought narration by Howard Keel. Although scripted by Talbot Jennings one of the film's cowriters the narration is leadenly heavyhanded and overly literal and drowns the director's visual subtleties. An embittered Wellman remarked  They cut out all the action and put in a narration to fill the holes. This was a good long picture the way I made it. I've never seen it and I never will. Ironically Wellman resigned with MGM and his next picture Westward the Women covered some of the same territory as Missouri albeit more successfully.An added irony is that the same Dore Schary supposedly the most literate and tasteful of all studio heads in Golden Age Hollywoosd was a serial offender. Only a few months earlier he butchered John Huston's brilliant adaptation of The Red Badge of Courage down to B picture length of a mere 69 minutes with bridging narration spoken by nonother than... James Whitmore!One last sad irony... as I write this review news that Judy Lewis age 76 passed away today is on the Web. She was the secret love child of Clark Gable and Loretta Young conceived during the filming of another Wellman Western epic The Call of the Wild in 1935. Miss Young never acknowledged that Lewis was her biological daughter and claimed she was adopted. Lewis' memoir Uncommon Knowledge was published in 1995.".

	schema:reviewBody "When one watches western films of the latter half of the 19th century the settlement of the west was on a course that was nothing but bad for the American Indian. As good as some westerns are always lingering in the back of any viewer's mind is the thought that no matter what the predicament of a given heroheroine in any film is the fact that the might and power of the United States Cavalry will ultimately tip the balance towards the white man.But the fur trappers of the early half of that century faced a far different situation. They were few and the Indians at that point outnumbered them. These people as typified by Clark Gable and the rest of the cast in Across the Wide Missouri were the really brave ones in our history. They wanted to trap their beaver and sell their pelts and the last thing they wanted was wholesale immigration of settlers. It took a lot of nerve to live in that lonely existence days and weeks at a time where you couldn't count on a troop of soldiers to bail you out of trouble.I'm a big old sucker for films about the earlier west and two good ones came out at this time this one and the following year from RKO The Big Sky. I give the nod to this one thought because it was done in color and on location.Gable gets one of his best post World War II parts as the sturdy Flint Mitchell mountain man who falls big time for Indian princess Maris Elena Marques. While grandfather Jack Holt approves of a white husband for his granddaughter the match don't sit well at all with Ricardo Montalban his successor. The climatic duel between Gable and Montalban is staged very well indeed and quite thrilling.Playing various fur trapper roles are Alan Napier James Whitmore John Hodiak and most of all Adolphe Menjou. Though one normally expects the debonair Mr. Menjou in tuxedo he's really quite good as the French Canadian trapper and sidekick to Gable.Maria Elena Marquess got her first of two chances in Hollywood and did well as the Indian princess. She was already a name in Mexican cinema and became an even bigger star down there due to this film with Clark Gable.This film marked the farewell performance of Jack Holt who died soon after it was completed. His career spanned all the way back to the earliest years of Hollywood. He makes a very impressive chief of the Blackfeet.Gable was a rugged outdoorsman in real life he liked to fish and hunt and brought his fourth wife Lady Sylvia Ashley on location. Unfortunately Lady Sylvia was not a big fan of the great outdoors and her experiences roughing it contributed to the Gables getting unhitched.Director William Wellman kept things going at a good clip and though Across the Wide Missouri is slightly over 75 minutes for an A film it's still a great item and rates being an A film for its cast and its production values.".

	schema:headline " Lovely and unjustly underrated";
	schema:reviewBody "This is one of Clark Gable's better films of the 1950s though it never really got that much attention and many have unjustly written it off as just another Western. However if you watch it you'll find that the film has two major points that make it unique and a very beautiful film. First the film is about the period BEFORE that shown in most Westerns. The typical Hollywood Western occurs between 18661880 though there are a few exceptions before and after. However very few deal with life in the West circa 1829 when the only White men were fur trappers. Since I am a history teacher I admire this about ACROSS THE WIDE MISSOURI. Second the film humanizes the Native Americans much more than most films and there are no black and white groups in the film. Many of the Indians are quite decent but they also are not uniformly good eitherand the same goes for the trappers. I particularly loved the relationship that developed between Clark Gable and his Indian bride. It did a lot to build sympathy for the characters and once again truly humanized both characters. The only real negative about this is that three of the key Indian roles are played by nonIndians J. Carrol Naish Mara Elena Marqus and Ricardo Montalbana standard practice in the time it was made.While these two points make this a memorable film it sure doesn't hurt that this film has some of the most vivid and beautiful scenery of any film of the 1950s. It's obvious that this wasn't filmed on some sound stage or filmed in the outskirts of Los Angeles! So overall what's not to like about this film?! Excellent acting a great script and a uniqueness make this a film worth seeking.By the way this film is highly reminiscent of the wonderful Robert Redford film JEREMIAH JOHNSONanother film well worth your time.".

	schema:headline " One small step towards 'The Searchers'. possible spoiler in last paragraph";
	schema:reviewBody "One of the first 'liberal' Westerns that emerged tentatively in the 1950s films showing that Indians weren't just bloodthirsty savages but peoples with their own culture and humanity.  In making this ethical breakthrough Wellmann doesn't reject the traditional Fordian Western that had relegated the Native American to a whooping menace instead he embraces it.  Like Ford's films 'Missouri' is a history lesson a tribute to the pioneers who 'tamed' America 'giants' as the narrator calls them the camera duly recording the suitably vast sky as a Wagnerian backdrop for these men. 'Missouri' records the development of a UNITED States and not only does the film bring together a melting pot of different nationalties  Americans Indians Scots French who provide the kind of knockabout Fordian 'humour' usually reserved for the Irish etc. with their own tongues stories music etc.  but also a series of structural opposites manwoman naturecivilisation capitalism language to create a national allegory of cohesion.  Even the past and the future are brought together  the narrator tells of great doings in the past stretching back at least as far as Waterloo the Old World but it is also his story the tale of his birth itself the literal and allegorical fruit of racial togetherness the white man and red woman even if the cheerful narration does sound conventionally WASPish.Of course you can't create without destroying and as in all those folk tales and myths that express the primal hopes and fears of a people the evil spirits have to be exorcised in this case the renegade Indian Iron Shirt who has the nerve to equate the white man's convenient desire for peace and mutual help with the loss of his own land.  We shouldn't expect miracles in 1951 'Missouri' is only as liberal as its times will allow it  only those Others that accept the White way of life are welcome.  Although Mitchell and Kamiah seem to engage in a reciprocating process of teaching and initiation it is Kamiah who is infantilised who is brought back to her grandfather who is put across her husband's lap and smacked for disobedience i.e. for following her own instincts and customs. Iron Shirt rightly hostile to a people who only see the awesome beauty of the Missouri landscape for the money it can make them is demonised.  The birth of the child is linked to the natural surroundings he is heir to when Iron Shirt tries to kill him his transgression is clearly unnatural just as his unwillingness to see the white point of view and give in.  In a world where translators hence communication conciliation are the true currency of progress Iron Shirt is a man of action and  physical signs not to be trusted.The film feels like a civic lecture made to be shown to schoolchildren to teach them tolerance and the great American way.  But Wellman has directed some of the most sombre Westerns ever made 'The OxBow Incident' 'Yellow Sky' where American progress has fatally turned in on itself and the bright colours and cheerful tone here are deceptive.  As if to warn us he uses his characteristic montage zoom whereby his camera pulls back from a composition not by a zoom but by cutting backwards at different angles from it creating an eerie distancing effect.

	onyx:emotionText "One of the first 'liberal' Westerns that emerged tentatively in the 1950s films showing that Indians weren't just bloodthirsty savages but peoples with their own culture and humanity.  In making this ethical breakthrough Wellmann doesn't reject the traditional Fordian Western that had relegated the Native American to a whooping menace instead he embraces it.  Like Ford's films 'Missouri' is a history lesson a tribute to the pioneers who 'tamed' America 'giants' as the narrator calls them the camera duly recording the suitably vast sky as a Wagnerian backdrop for these men. 'Missouri' records the development of a UNITED States and not only does the film bring together a melting pot of different nationalties  Americans Indians Scots French who provide the kind of knockabout Fordian 'humour' usually reserved for the Irish etc. with their own tongues stories music etc.  but also a series of structural opposites manwoman naturecivilisation capitalism language to create a national allegory of cohesion.  Even the past and the future are brought together  the narrator tells of great doings in the past stretching back at least as far as Waterloo the Old World but it is also his story the tale of his birth itself the literal and allegorical fruit of racial togetherness the white man and red woman even if the cheerful narration does sound conventionally WASPish.Of course you can't create without destroying and as in all those folk tales and myths that express the primal hopes and fears of a people the evil spirits have to be exorcised in this case the renegade Indian Iron Shirt who has the nerve to equate the white man's convenient desire for peace and mutual help with the loss of his own land.  We shouldn't expect miracles in 1951 'Missouri' is only as liberal as its times will allow it  only those Others that accept the White way of life are welcome.  Although Mitchell and Kamiah seem to engage in a reciprocating process of teaching and initiation it is Kamiah who is infantilised who is brought back to her grandfather who is put across her husband's lap and smacked for disobedience i.e. for following her own instincts and customs. Iron Shirt rightly hostile to a people who only see the awesome beauty of the Missouri landscape for the money it can make them is demonised.  The birth of the child is linked to the natural surroundings he is heir to when Iron Shirt tries to kill him his transgression is clearly unnatural just as his unwillingness to see the white point of view and give in.  In a world where translators hence communication conciliation are the true currency of progress Iron Shirt is a man of action and  physical signs not to be trusted.The film feels like a civic lecture made to be shown to schoolchildren to teach them tolerance and the great American way.  But Wellman has directed some of the most sombre Westerns ever made 'The OxBow Incident' 'Yellow Sky' where American progress has fatally turned in on itself and the bright colours and cheerful tone here are deceptive.  As if to warn us he uses his characteristic montage zoom whereby his camera pulls back from a composition not by a zoom but by cutting backwards at different angles from it creating an eerie distancing effect.  The climax in the woods as Mitchell fights Ironside has a clear symbolic purpose but it is the most chilling in the film with no music.  To root out the savage Mitchell himself must become savage using the Indian's tools to destroy him.  He has become destructive and can no longer take part in the forging of a community from which he voluntarily expels himself.  In this story of nation community and unity this breach of withdrawal is troubling and marks the film as a first step in the direction of the traditional Western's apotheosis 'The Searchers'.";

When this was shown on TCM William Wellman Jr. talked about all the problems with MGM during post production. Apparently this was originally meant to be an epic picture but the studio started cutting it to pieces and they eventually cut so much that they had to hire Howard Keel to do narration to bring any sense to the film. Watching the 78minute movies it's easy to tell that there's all sorts of stuff missing and there are even some very strange edits which make it clear that we were originally meant to see more. As for the final version it's really not too bad but it's not too good either. Gable is pretty good in his role but Ricardo Montalban steals the film. J. Carroll Naish has a nice role as well. The Technicolor really brings out the great locations but in the end one can't get over the edited product. The shock at the end of the picture is also ruined due to the narration which kills the suspense of how the film plays out.".

	schema:reviewBody "This Western film directed without any particular distinction by William Wellman is visually stunning and has moments that are exciting touching and even thrilling. It is also an uneven movie with a patchy script which relies heavily on a voiceover narrator. The film is pretty thin on a strong story line. Across the Wide Missouri mainly consists of a string of episodes that suggests there was more of a screenplay here not captured in the film. Why? One only wonders.Clark Gable continued his pattern of pairing up with much younger leading ladies. When this film was made he was 50 and Maria Elena Marques was 25. Interestingly in the similar Broken Arrow made one year earlier James Stewart playing a scout rather than a fur trapper like Gable was 42 to Debra Paget's 17an identical difference of 25 years! To continue the comparison both women portrayed Indian maidens although one is American Caucasian Paget and the other is Mexican Marques. Both married their leading man in the films and died as the price for doing so.Across the Wide Missouri and Broken Arrow have other similarities. Both films present sympathetic views of Native Americans and their ability to intermingle freely with white outdoorsmen in the spirit of mutual respect if not friendship. They also reveal that the treachery in these relationships often came from the whites and not the Indians. While Broken Arrow is better written Across the Wide Missouri may contain better performances by the two leading actors.One final interesting point to consider. Jack Holt in his last film played Marques's aged grandfather Bear Ghost. At the time he was 63 or just 13 years older than Gable. Yet Gable is playing Holt's grandson by marriage! Talk about make believe! In the blockbuster film San Francisco made by MGM in 1936 Holt and Gable played romantic rivals seeking the affection of lovely Jeannette MacDonald. At that point Gable was 35 and Holt 48. From romantic rivals to grandfather and grandson in just 15 years!".

	schema:reviewBody "Bernard DeVoto won a Pulitzer Prize for history in 1948 for his 1947 book Across the Wide Missouri. Some sources say that after MGM bought the film rights the studio threw away everything except the title. That's hardly the case because this film does a very good job of showing life in the early days of the American Northwest. DeVoto's book and this film are mostly about the native Indians and the white trappers known as mountain men. The latter were a breed of early pioneers that flourished in the 19th century from about 1810 to the early 1880s. The stage was set for all of this in 1803 when the U.S. acquired the Louisiana Territory from France. The 828000 square miles doubled the size of the young nation. The purchase brought in all the lands west that drained into the Mississippi River. But most of the lands west of the Missouri River had not yet been explored. President Thomas Jefferson got Congress to approve an expedition to explore the Northwest to the Pacific Ocean. After the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 18041806 written accounts of it aroused great interest in the East. The mountain men became the first Americans of European descent to migrate to the region. They went first as trappers and explorers who made their living in the lucrative fur trade. The mountain men peaked in numbers around 1840 at the time the largest U.S. migration began over the 2200mile Oregon Trail. The mountain men helped open the emigrant trails. They explored and lived and dealt mostly at peace with the various Indian tribes. This movie shows all of this very well. MGM filmed the movie in Southwest Colorado from Durango to Silverton. The spectacular scenery adds to the value and enjoyment of the film. I am a history buff and during the years leading up to and through the 20042006 bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark Expedition I spent most of my summer vacations traveling and visiting sites along the Lewis and Clark route. One of my guides for these trips was The Journals of Lewis and Clark written by Bernard DeVoto in 1953. DeVoto and Lewis and Clark give excellent accounts of the Indians of the time. This movie covers two groups that are prominent in the journals  the Blackfeet and the Nez Perce. I wonder how familiar the playwrights might have been with the journals. Their story of the young Indian maiden in the movie is similar to that of a real person with Lewis and Clark. Here Kamiah is of the Blackfeet tribe. She was captured and raised by the Nez Perce. In the Lewis and Clark Expedition a young Indian wife of a French Canadian trapper Toussaint Charbonneau became an invaluable guide across the Indian lands of the Northwest. She was Sacagawea a Shoshone Indian from the Snake River country of Idaho. She had been captured by the Hidatsa and taken to their village along the Missouri River in what is now North Dakota. At age 13 she was sold to Charbonneau as a wife.This movie has a large cast of firstrate actors. Clark Gable is excellent as Flint Mitchell. Adolphe Menjou excels as Pierre. Maria Elena Marques is dazzling as Kamiah. All the actors who played major Indian parts were very good. Ricardo Montalban plays Ironshirt John Hodiak is Brecan J. Carrol Naish is Looking Glass and Jack Holt is Bear Ghost. The rest of the mountain men and the supporting cast of Indians add to the historical feel and enjoyment of the film. There was an apparent controversy that arose over this film. From the various accounts I've read it's not even clear what it was all about. The studio head at the time apparently chopped quite a lot out of the film. Enough that director William Wellman disowned the movie and said he would never watch it. He alluded to the best action parts being taken out. Apparently James Whitmore who plays a mountain man Old Bill had much more of a part and most of his film time was cut out. It would be nice to see a director's cut which probably no longer exists. But that aside I think this is still a firstrate film. It has action scenery and a beautiful story told about a very interesting time and place in America's history. From that standpoint alone it is much more valuable than the two popular mountain men pictures that were made Jeremiah Johnson 1972 and The Mountain Men 1980. Across the Wide Missouri is a film that most should enjoy. It's an excellent snapshot of a pioneer period of the American West.".

Which works to it's advantage since it keeps the story moving along at a fast clip but has production values that keep it from descending into a B western. It could also have something to do with the cuts MGM made before the film's release but what you see today is what audiences saw when the movie premiered over 50 years ago.Clark Gable plays a 1830s trapper who 'buys' a Blackfoot maiden named Kamiah Mexican actress Maria Elena Marques who was earlier captured by the Nez Perces indians and uses her to gain entrance into Blackfoot territory in order to hunt beaver. Only problem is he starts to fall in love with her and they eventually have a child.There's also the complication of Chief Ironshirt Ricardo Montalban who despises the white man and kills any of them who set foot on Blackfeet land. He makes for a pretty muscular ruthless chief. It's pretty much a nonspeaking part for Montalban except for a couple of lines spoken in Native Indian.There's little gunplay except at the end when Ironshirt's men ambush Gable and his trappers near the river and Kamiah takes an arrow into her chest killing her instantly. The horse carrying Gable's son races off into the woods with Ironshirt and Gable right behind and there is an excellent gunbattle in the woods as Gable is forced to shoot Ironshirt with his powder rod still stuck in his rifle barrel. It goes through Ironshirt like an arrow. Great scene.Howard Keel narrates as Gable's now grown up son. With excellent on location scenery somewhere in the Northwest  I wish I knew where I'd like to go up there captured firstrate by cinematographer William Mellor and fast direction by William Wellman I liked it. Wouldn't mind owning it on DVD either.One of the best westerns Gable appeared in even though he didn't make too many of 'em.7 out of 10".

Here he is a fur trapper in a glossy Technicolor MGM western directed by Veteran William Wellman who here seemed to copy John Ford's style of adding a third dimension by adding depth to the characters. Several reviewers have noted that the film was hacked up by studio heads and several action scenes were cut to the detriment of the final product.I guess nowadays a western has to have a gritty realistic look but this one is oldfashioned in that respect and has a clean and fresh aspect in the appearance of the characters and sets.

	schema:reviewBody "Before cows replaced bison as the top herbivore of the Great Plains and before precious metal bonanzas were discovered west of the Mississippi it was the exploitation of the often abundant beaver of the West that was the primary reason for adventurous young men to brave this dangerous if often beautiful wild country. Relatively few Hollywood films have dramatized this initial frontier phase.Even more so than the mining and cow towns this was overwhelmingly a man's world. Hence the inevitable romances in films featuring 'mountain men' usually involve 'Indian' maidens or a woman back home or occasionally a woman at a trading post or army fort. Gable had long ago played a gold prospectorCall of the Wild and would a few years later star in a classic cattle drive filmThe Tall Men. Here he stars in a Technicolor film that looks like it was meant to be an epic treatment of this previous frontier era largely filmed in the spectacular mountains near Durango CO. But as others have pointed outit apparently was much downsized in scope and chopped up to leave a less than epic treatment. Nonetheless it does incorporate some historically relevant features including a Rendezvous which were most commonly an annual event. A run for his life after Gable's characterFlint Mitchell is captured by the hostile Blackfoot reminds us of a real event involving trapper John Colter generally regarded as the first mountain man and a member of the Lewis and Clark expedition.J. Carrol Naish has a small role as Nez Perce chief Looking Glass adopting father of Gable's romantic interest Blackfoot princess Kamiah. There was a real Nez Perce chief named Looking Glass who figured in the much later conflict with the US government over its reservation plans for the Nez Perce but he was at best only a small boy when the present story presumably took place. The Blackfoot did develop an early dislike for Europeans stemming from an incident occurring during the Lewis and Clark expedition. This dislike is personified in the war chief IronshirtRicardo Montalban who develops a personal dislike for Mitchell because he desires Kamiah whom Mitchell married. ThusIronshirt eventually orders the spiteful assassination of Kamiah and tries to kill her infant son along with Mitchell. Prior to these events Kamiah leads Mitchell and associates into her native beaverrich Blackfoot territory where aging peaceable chief Bear Ghost develops a friendship with Mitchell. Strangely Bear Grass is eventually assassinated not by Ironshirt but by one of Mitchell's fellow trappers! Evidently this trapper blamed Bear Grass for the arrowed death of his brother whereas Ironshirt was actually responsible.A good share of the dialogue is not in English which makes for a more authentic experience but at the price of some understanding. Surprisingly Mitchell and his wife apparently made no attempt to learn each other's languages during their rather brief marriage relying on interpreters for communication. The episode where Mitchell's infant son is strapped in a cradleboard to a runaway horse being chased by Ironshirt followed by Mitchell is very unusual.Presumably an inanimate 'stunt double' was used for the infant during the actual chase. In spite of Ironshirt's doings the film generally presents Native Americans in a favorable light and is thus unusual for films of that era. Ironshirt and Bear Ghost represent the two possible responses to the ongoing disaster of ever increasing European penetration across the NA continent and rapidly decreasing numbers of 'Indians' attempted extermination or passive resignation. Bear Ghost has lost all his sons to warfare hence understandably takes the later approach.Adolphe Menjou plays Gable's frequent companion French trapper Pierre. Alan Napier is also occasionally present as an eccentric Scottish aristocrat come to paint the inhabitants of this frontier land and to wow the natives with his full suit of armor. Maria Elena Marques makes a comely rather shy Kamiah. Nearly 30 years later the film Mountain Men was released with a remarkably similar story with Charlton Heston taking the place of Gable. Again we have a conflict between an antiEuropean Blackfoot war chief and the star trapper over an 'Indian' maiden who has been bartered between the enemy Nez Perce and Blackfoot. Again we have the excitement of a Rendezvous and again Heston has to run for his life from the Blackfoot in mimicry of Colter. However Heston's mountain man is much more of a loner than Gable's. His head is much more hirsute and he mostly wears thick hides rather than Gable's neat buckskin summer wear.Other notable Hollywood films featuring western trappers include Jeremiah Smith. The Last Frontier The Scalphunters and Man in the Wilderness'. This last film features a reeanactment of the most unbelievable incidence of an epic trek through wilderness after a savage mauling by a grizzly as documented by early mountain man Hugh Glass.The music consisted mainly of the traditional Oh Shenandoah periodically in the background the most common lyrics of which include the film title. This was sometimes sung by early boatmen on the Missouriwho might change the lyrics at whim. Incidentally 'Shenandoah' often was thought to refer to an 'Indian' chief rather than the Virginia Shenandoah Valley as most people assume. Also the children's songs Skip to my Lou and Alouette which were sometimes sung and danced to at trapper gatherings are featured. An 'Indian' lullaby is also sung by Kamiah.".

	schema:reviewBody "Clark Gable plays Flint Mitchell a fur trapper living out west on the edge of Blackfoot territory. After discovering that an Indian maiden named Kamiah played Marie Elena Marques is the granddaughter of Blackfoot chief Bear Ghost Jack Holt he decides to acquire her in a trade from the Nez Pierce chief Looking Glass J. Carrol Naish who stole her from the Blackfoot and raised her as his own daughter. The only way this will happen though is if Flint Mitchell decides to marry her. So since Blackfoot territory has an abundance of beaver he decides to take her as his wife. Love between them eventually develops. Even so the relationship between the white fur trappers and the Blackfoot remains somewhat hostile. As a result a group of fur trappers decide to take a secret route into Blackfoot territory and set up a fort. Bear Ghost is delighted to see his granddaughter but another Blackfoot warrior named Ironshirt Ricardo Montalban has no intention of making peace. Trouble results and both sides suffer tragedy. Anyway filmed in color in 1951 this picture does a decent job of capturing the cold but beautiful wilderness the fur trappers had to endure. And while the language barrier between Flint Mitchell and Kamiah was annoying at times I suppose it added to the realism. Most of the acting was adequate but I thought Clark Gable stood out with an excellent performance. In short this was a pretty good movie which was probably wellreceived in its time.".

So since Blackfoot territory has an abundance of beaver he decides to take her as his wife. Love between them eventually develops. Even so the relationship between the white fur trappers and the Blackfoot remains somewhat hostile. As a result a group of fur trappers decide to take a secret route into Blackfoot territory and set up a fort. Bear Ghost is delighted to see his granddaughter but another Blackfoot warrior named Ironshirt Ricardo Montalban has no intention of making peace. Trouble results and both sides suffer tragedy. Anyway filmed in color in 1951 this picture does a decent job of capturing the cold but beautiful wilderness the fur trappers had to endure. And while the language barrier between Flint Mitchell and Kamiah was annoying at times I suppose it added to the realism. Most of the acting was adequate but I thought Clark Gable stood out with an excellent performance. In short this was a pretty good movie which was probably wellreceived in its time.";

	schema:reviewBody "I hadn't heard of this film until I saw it listed in the TV guide and as it was only an hour and a half long I thought I'd check it out. I'm pleased that I did as it is quite different to most westerns I'd seen. Set when much of what is now the United States was still controlled by the native population and any European heading into there territory had to make friends quickly or risk being killed. The story follows group of trappers led by Flint Mitchell who head into Blackfoot territory to hunt beavers and elk in order to be welcome Mitchell buys and marries the Blackfoot chief's granddaughter who had been kidnapped by a Nez Perce chief and adopted as his daughter. His new wife Kamiah leads them into Blackfoot territory via a route that avoids the aggressive warrior Iron Shirt. Once there they set about trapping and hunting they also make friends with the Blackfoot chief Bear Ghost. There are still dangers though and Iron Shirt's band poses a danger. When one of the trappers is killed his brother takes revenge by killing Grey Wolf this leaves Iron Shirt as the new chief and the trappers are in real danger a danger that many of them will not survive.At first I though this might be a comedy as the opening scenes contained such sights as a brawl involving all of the trappers and an Indian chief who was wearing a suit of armour and Mitchell's new wife throwing pots and pans at him when he enters her tepee in a drunken state! As the film progresses things get more serious though as the trappers get in real danger and several are killed frequently without warning. One of the deaths I won't spoil it by saying whose was one of the most surprising I've seen in any film. The acting was pretty solid Clark Gable was good in the lead role as was Mara Elena Marqus as his wife Kamiah. Surprisingly much of the dialogue wasn't in English some was in French and much was in the Indian's language this wasn't subtitled which puts the viewer in the same position of not understanding that Mitchell was in of course he had a native speaker in his group who could translate for him and the audience. While I don't think this is a must see film I'd certainly recommend checking it out if you are a western fan and it is on television.".

There is one moment in the film that I really liked that being when one of the teens gets into the farmhouse and looks over a bunch of pictures on the wall. The way in which West shoots this brief sequence made something so simple as looking at photos take on a certain level of uneasiness.

Well let's just say that 4 People are stranded on an old country road in the middle of the night  seek shelterhelp at an barn that they stumble upon. Unfortunately for them the barn is infested with killer bats that have the ability to turn you into a zombie if you are bitten by them. WTF? Yeah It's a bit odd.

It's got plenty of atmosphere  the performances were pretty tightWhen you can hear them The sound is fairly bad. Subtitles help a lot. The ending was also pretty eerie.

Usually they get this wrong Malevolence Satan's Playground The Hazing etc. but sometimes a movie gets it right. Fortunately The Roost gets it right.Opening with the type of horror movie host that you saw in the old days Roost is actually a moviewithina movie. The actually movie is nothing original A group of friends car breaks down they get stranded and run into a deadly force here it's bats that turn victims into zombielike killers While the premise and movie in a way is nothing that original it works because of how it is all done. There is gore but it's not a gore fest as the movie focuses more on atmosphere and suspense which fails on a few occasions than gory slapstick gags and homages that can grow tiresome. Also effective is the way director sets up several scenes including a sequence where a cop is attacked by bats. Adding to it is a wonderfully creepy screeching violin score and some effective but never over used CGI effects involving the bats.The Roost won't change the face of horror. It's not too original and the acting is mediocre at best. However it's still a blast and will be a treat to those who grew up going to see Grindhouse movies or who watched creaky faded videos of horror movies.".

	schema:reviewBody "With The Roost young writerdirector Ti West the guy's only one year older than me damned! proves that making your own horror movie doesn't necessarily has to be unrealizable dream! On the contrary it's actually the easiest profession in the world just as long as your ambitions don't reach much further than telling a fun story and paying tribute to the Bmovie industry of the 70's at the same time! And if that happens to be what you're expecting to see as a viewer this really isn't such a bad little gem after all! The plot is incredibly basic telling a story that features absolutely no surprises no twists and no red herrings at all! Four adolescents on their way to a friend's wedding take the stupid decision to try a shortcut off the highway and face engine trouble in the middle of nowhere. When they arrive at the only farmhouse for miles around the place is congested with bats that turn people into bloodthirsty zombies. The elderly couple and the helpful police officer are the first to die but the kids will unquestionably follow next That's it nothing more!! There's no explanation given to the origin of the zombievirus spread by the bats or why it's specifically spread by bats in the first place no attempt to find a solution and not even a reasonable ending! Not only the script but also the technical aspects of The Roost are as primitive as can be. The cinematography is monotonous with loads of traditional pans and fixed camera angles and the editing is handled like a routine job. The makeup effects are occasionally nasty though with a satisfying amount of blood and guts. The most remarkable aspect about the entire production is the 70's throwback narration style. Underrated actor Tom Noonan Robocop 2 Manhunter stars as the ghoulish host  a sort of Crypt Keeper if you will  who briefly introduces the creature feature and simultaneously makes a couple of wit references towards classic cinema. This film certainly isn't meant for video game andor CGI effects worshiping audiences but fans of Hammer Amicus or even the The Twilight Zone will definitely appreciate it!".

Beats me because Wendigo isn't that great a movie either. This can be the only reason this tripe got into the festival.Anyway  The Roost  was introduced as homage to the early rent on VHS low budget horror flicks of the 80's. Great. I'm ready.What it is  is a boring tale of four or so people that end up at a farm and then go to the barn for no good reason and then get attacked by bats. Somehow I guess these bats can make you a zombie because occasionally someone acts like a zombie or doesn't die when they're shot. I think. Also at one point there's 'reverse reverb' type sound on a voice in the dark   so maybe they also make you a ghost.Now if the set up for this had been the first 30 minutes fine. Now they're trapped and they have to get out.But they don't  it takes a torturous 6070 minutes. It's essentially a one act movie  on Valium.But it's not like they're really trapped. The barn door is wide open and most of the time the only thing that seems like it's outside is the enormous amount of harsh light they're blasting at the Barn to light the scene. Eventually this could be construed as a spoiler the two remaining people decide to go out to the police SUV which is still parked from much earlier in the torture er movie. Of course its lights are still on and flashing as they were left before.The Director proudly mentioned how the movie was shot on film. Kodak would NEVER point to this as an example of what their stocks can look like. Much of the time it looked like they had pushed the film two or more stops. The grain was beyond ridiculous. Also FOCUS??? Who cares? Some shots nay scenes  shots indicates editing were so out of focus as to be pointless. The Lighting was essentially to get an exposure. There was no art or semblance of realism to it. I know budget is low etc. but it's not an excuse to just flip the switch on 5000 watts of light and call it a day  not when it's supposed to be night.The soundtrack  an incessant screeching of strings and 'found' type sound would have worked better if it hadn't been so damn loud. Though the overall volume level at the theater was in the I'll confess to anything range the mix of the movie itself was also not great.A wrap around as if all of this was a 'creature feature' TV show with guest host Tom Noonan was  so what? At one point the movie is interrupted by going back to the wrap around. Then it rewinds or forwards a bit in the movie. I think it was done to cut through an especially bad scene so  Thank you  good idea. On a cinematic level though  what were they thinking? Funny? Clever? Come on SCTV did this twenty years ago.If you want to watch a good bad 80's movie watch The Incredible Melting Man or any other number of movies. If you want to torture yourself with boredom grating sound awful lighting non existent pacing and ultimately thoughts of  WHY WHY WHY?!  or if you want to remind yourself of those bad 80's video rentals you shut off after four minutes  then The Roost may be your bag.".

	schema:reviewBody "I was at the final day of the Horrorthon Festival in Dublin this year when I saw what was in my mind the worst film of all time. I always make an effort to stay until the end of a film to give it all the chances it can get. However when I walked out of The Roost I felt completely certain that nothing that it could have done would have saved it from the train wreak that I had watched up to that point.I am a huge fan of Bmovie horror so it wasn't a case of me not getting the film... I got it... but it was the deep deep flaws that caused me to hate this film. The opening had potential I liked the idea of the old school narrator and got a bit of a TerrorvisionFright Night vibe from it. This is where my interest in the film stopped. The storyline was convoluted and had no actual purpose. The acting was some of the worst I have ever seen put onto film. I didn't give a damn what happened to the characters and if they had dropped dead at some point from some random disease I would have left happy because I wouldn't have had another 30 minutes of my life taken from me. The direction in The Roost is laughable the director must have literally just pointed at the actors and just said  just read the words on the page guys!. The editing is sloppy and sometimes continuity goes off to the land of Oz.Having said this there was one redeemable feature to paying to see this film. I saw how not to make a film. Utterly terrible. Don't waste your time on this film unless you're some sort of masochist. I honest felt like getting a lobotomy to forget this film ever came near me. The stinker of Horror movies.

	onyx:emotionText "I was at the final day of the Horrorthon Festival in Dublin this year when I saw what was in my mind the worst film of all time. I always make an effort to stay until the end of a film to give it all the chances it can get. However when I walked out of The Roost I felt completely certain that nothing that it could have done would have saved it from the train wreak that I had watched up to that point.I am a huge fan of Bmovie horror so it wasn't a case of me not getting the film... I got it... but it was the deep deep flaws that caused me to hate this film. The opening had potential I liked the idea of the old school narrator and got a bit of a TerrorvisionFright Night vibe from it. This is where my interest in the film stopped. The storyline was convoluted and had no actual purpose. The acting was some of the worst I have ever seen put onto film. I didn't give a damn what happened to the characters and if they had dropped dead at some point from some random disease I would have left happy because I wouldn't have had another 30 minutes of my life taken from me.

The young people had no individual character traits most of the dialogue seemed poorly improvised and though Director Ti West has several 'swelling' moments ultimately they lead nowhere. Again we have character who behave as though they've never seen a horror film. Now let's get to the Wait What moment. The film begins in a cheap 1950's studio where we are introduced to a Dr. Dementotype TV host of horror films. Tonight's movie is the Roost. Those sections are in black and white and suffer purposely however through tacky sets props and that hokey dialog we have come to know from the Creature Features of our youth. It was completely incongruous and unnecessary to the plot of the four kids of the story. The styles didn't even match the chemistry was wrong and pulled the viewer away from the intended tale. I cannot believe the film maker started out this project with that in the original script. It seems tacked on. I kept it on because I was doing things around the house having given up after the first 30 minutes during which time little happens. Not much happens at all. I do think directorwriter Ti West is talented and will be looking down the road for his next film.".

There were a lot of long twoshots that lasted WAY too long and revealed very little without cutting to closeups or medium shots. The sound was so bad it was like they just used the oncamera Mic on a prosumer DV camera which they may have because it looked like it was filmed in DV.In addition many of the shots were jerky or out of focus even when I didn't think it was the intent. The only encouragement that I got from this film is that if something of this quality can sell there is hope for some of us filmmakers breaking into indie films.".

	schema:headline " Noisome Nonsense";
	schema:reviewBody "I read the reviews of Three Men in a Boat before watching the film and couldn't believe that it is as bad as most reviewers claim. I mean to say just look at the cast. Tomlinson Edwards and Harvey are not a collection of comedic geniuses perhaps but surely they amass enough talent to produce an amusing adaptation of this admired novel. However the negative reviewers are correct this film is simply terrible. Although it only runs to 84 minutes it took me five sittings to get through it. I could barely tolerate watching twenty minutes at a time. I persevered becausewell look at the cast surely they would deliver something funny eventually perhaps the finale would be hilarious.I grew up in Britain and still love old British comedies Ealing of course Will Hay Alastaire Sim Peter Sellers and so many others. I even like the lowerlevel comedy of the Carry On series Benny Hill or Frankie Howerd. This film though has less laughs than Polanski's Macbeth.Some reviews have suggested that some people find the film unamusing because it is 'dated.' It was made in the fifties and set in the 1880s. However these facts alone shouldn't be detrimental to a film's appeal. A good number of Britain's best and most appreciated comedies were made in the fifties such as The Lavender Hill Mob Hobson's Choice and I'm All Right Jack. In fact the decade is a Golden Age for British film comedy. The story's setting in an earlier period can hardly be detrimental either. Kind Hearts and Coronets stands easily as one of the best British comedies yet it was set in the same historical period as Three Men in a Boat was released six years earlier and was filmed in black and white. Similarly Ken Annakin this film's director had his biggest successes with Monte Carlo or Bust! 1969 and Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines 1965 both of which are set in times only slightly later than Three Men in a Boat and are equally far removed from contemporary audiences but are still relatively amusing.Some films age badly because of the focus of the material. George Formby and the Old Mother Riley comedies relied for their context on a particular interwar period and a British working class culture that had largely disappeared by the 1960s and has little meaning for people in contemporary Britain let alone the rest of the world. Other examples are the sex comedies made in Britain in the 1970s or the blacksploitation movies made in the US in the same decade. These films are clearly dated but retain entertainment value because of their anachronistic fashions and dialogue.Astonishingly Three Men in a Boat was nominated for a BAFTA for of all things best screen play. This is baffling because the writers make little effort to drive the story with witty dialogue. Dialogue is in fact rather scant. The attempts at comedy come mostly from slapstick situations where our heroes wave tent poles and oars around for insufferable lengths of time fall in the water repeatedly and prattles on loudly and unintelligibly. The assumption is apparently that if these situations continue for long enough something funny simply has to happen. It doesn't. Slapstick can be badly done but it doesn't become dated. The silent movies of Chaplain and Keaton are still wonderful the Three Stooges are still ridiculous and funny much in Norman Wisdom's movies is dated but when he falls through a window he is still hilarious. Not so Tomlinson Edwards and Harvey.On this one I'm afraid I concur with the smug negative reviewers. This is the least funny Brit Com I've ever seen and I've seen Carry on England.".

	onyx:emotionText "I read the reviews of Three Men in a Boat before watching the film and couldn't believe that it is as bad as most reviewers claim. I mean to say just look at the cast. Tomlinson Edwards and Harvey are not a collection of comedic geniuses perhaps but surely they amass enough talent to produce an amusing adaptation of this admired novel. However the negative reviewers are correct this film is simply terrible. Although it only runs to 84 minutes it took me five sittings to get through it. I could barely tolerate watching twenty minutes at a time. I persevered becausewell look at the cast surely they would deliver something funny eventually perhaps the finale would be hilarious.I grew up in Britain and still love old British comedies Ealing of course Will Hay Alastaire Sim Peter Sellers and so many others. I even like the lowerlevel comedy of the Carry On series Benny Hill or Frankie Howerd. This film though has less laughs than Polanski's Macbeth.Some reviews have suggested that some people find the film unamusing because it is 'dated.' It was made in the fifties and set in the 1880s. However these facts alone shouldn't be detrimental to a film's appeal. A good number of Britain's best and most appreciated comedies were made in the fifties such as The Lavender Hill Mob Hobson's Choice and I'm All Right Jack. In fact the decade is a Golden Age for British film comedy. The story's setting in an earlier period can hardly be detrimental either. Kind Hearts and Coronets stands easily as one of the best British comedies yet it was set in the same historical period as Three Men in a Boat was released six years earlier and was filmed in black and white. Similarly Ken Annakin this film's director had his biggest successes with Monte Carlo or Bust! 1969 and Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines 1965 both of which are set in times only slightly later than Three Men in a Boat and are equally far removed from contemporary audiences but are still relatively amusing.Some films age badly because of the focus of the material. George Formby and the Old Mother Riley comedies relied for their context on a particular interwar period and a British working class culture that had largely disappeared by the 1960s and has little meaning for people in contemporary Britain let alone the rest of the world. Other examples are the sex comedies made in Britain in the 1970s or the blacksploitation movies made in the US in the same decade. These films are clearly dated but retain entertainment value because of their anachronistic fashions and dialogue.Astonishingly Three Men in a Boat was nominated for a BAFTA for of all things best screen play. This is baffling because the writers make little effort to drive the story with witty dialogue. Dialogue is in fact rather scant. The attempts at comedy come mostly from slapstick situations where our heroes wave tent poles and oars around for insufferable lengths of time fall in the water repeatedly and prattles on loudly and unintelligibly. The assumption is apparently that if these situations continue for long enough something funny simply has to happen. It doesn't. Slapstick can be badly done but it doesn't become dated.

	schema:reviewBody "It was when I saw a 2006 documentary about three friends taking a boat trip on the Thames River to emulate Jerome K. Jerome's story of Three Men in a Boat that I realized I'd never seen this movie. I recalled hearing about it from my youth but simply never had the opportunity  until recently when I got a DVD from my library.Now I've not read the actual book but I understand from other reviews I've read elsewhere the film narrative bears little relationship to the story that Jerome penned  one reviewer even going so far to say that the author would be turning in his grave. No doubt stories from other authors have fared the same or worse.So if you have read the story then you may be disappointed. However as an example of wellproduced British humour from the 1950s it stands the test of time as a lighthearted albeit clichridden romp with Jimmy Edwards as Harris Laurence Harvey as George and the very dapper David Tomlinson as J  the surrogate Jerome. For the love interest encountered along the way the three men meet up with Shirley Eaton as Sophie Lisa Gastoni as Primose and Jill Ireland as Bluebell.The story is filmed essentially as a series of set pieces beginning with the Preparations to Take a Trip  during which the three are shown for the bumbling idiots they are with a hilarious but predictable catastrophic attempts to package up all their supplies all ending in shambles at the bottom of stairs with a similar situation as they load it onto the boat almost capsizing.However off they row and their first port of call is Hampden Court where they decide to experience the Largest Maze in Europe or so we're told and naturally they get confused and confuse everyone else in the maze with their efforts to lead them out which naturally leads to more slapstick humour.Later that evening there is Making Camp for the Night which being England is wet very wet  and an occasion for more misery for the trio and much hilarity for the viewer as they go through all of the mistakes that many people make when erecting tents building fires and so forth. During the course of that day however they meet up with the three young women and begin the flirtations.The next day could be captioned the Photo Op whereby coming upon a large boating fraternity all waiting to get through a lock and with a local photographer on hand our intrepid three make further advances towards the women  but simply end up on their bums legs in the air and their boat in danger of being swamped. Only the quick action of Bluebell saves them by using a boat hook to prevent disaster thereby enhancing the budding relationships. The three men however are caught on camera much to their chagrin.In succession then there is the Evening Dance followed by the funniest attempts I've seen to Open a Can of Pineapple at their camp and which has almost the same level of madcap humour as that greatest of all  when Basil Fawlty John Cleese of TV's Fawlty Towers beats up his Austin car with a tree branch for refusing to start. If you've seen that you know what I mean. Now I wonder if Cleese was influenced by the can of pineapple that wouldn't open? The next morning they Take a Dip in the river  but skinnydipping. All goes well sort of until a group of women and children decide to have a picnic nearby. Ah watch how they finally get back on board their boat while retaining modesty. Priceless...After that the three manage to Ruin a Racing Eights Race when they cross the river in their boat to reach the women on the other bank numerous eights are left in shambles with entangled oars the three blissfully unaware of their transgression. And the film ends with the old standby The Cricket Match only in England of course where the three reduce that to chaos totally with the help of J's pet dog. I nearly fell off my chair.Sure it's a total farce but that's what the Brits are good at  well in those times anyway. The acting is topnotch as you would expect although I think Laurence Harvey to be kind was more suited to dark dramas like Room at the Top 1959 A walk on the wild side 1962 A dandy in aspic 1968 and so on. Comedy seemed a bit of a strain for him. Not so Tomlinson and Edwards of course.The script is very funny also alive with cracking good oneliners double entendre and heavy irony. The Eastman colour is vibrant to put it mildly but it does enhance the scenery and the idyllic settings. The women act well although they don't share the same amount of screen time as the men. Jill Ireland of course went on to appear in Robbery Under Arms 1957 and met her future husband Charles Bronson in the process. The film was directed by Ken Annakin who went on to direct Nor the Moon by Night 1958 Third man on the mountain 1959 codirector on The Longest Day 1962 and followed that by directing The Battle of the Bulge 1965 and others.Three Men is suitable for all ages and good for family viewing. Recommended for those who like English humour of the fifties and sixties.".

I always liked Jimmy Edwards' style on TV but it doesn't translate well after 50 years. Laurence Harvey made a big mistake with this he is not a comedian but as usual David Tomlinson provides a solid performance. Jill Ireland Shirley Eaton and Lisa Gastoni as the female interest are much much better than the boys".

Particularly in the bath scene! Strangely Lisa Gastoni was the only one who convinced what happened to her? Martita Hunt never a beauty but always a beautiful performance gave us her usual character the matriarch. And I wonder if she was ever in anything other than period costume dramas? The Hampton Court Maze scene was the best with a host of British character actors running around wildly trying to get out. In all it wasn't a bad movie. Like the book it sought to convey a picture of an idyllic England longsince vanished. Although in reality such a vision only ever existed for the privileged few. A true representation of the book would be difficult to reproduce and probably wouldn't be half as interesting.

	schema:headline " ANOTHER BIMAL ROY MASTERPIECE!";
	schema:reviewBody "Bimal Roy directs one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life in a very brilliant and poignant way. There are no elaborate sets as in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Devdas but Roy's Devdas has in it the pain that would melt one's heart. The acting by the main charactersand not so main characters is brilliant and heavily analyzed. Dilip Kumar is not called the 'tragedy king' for no good reason. He underwent psychological assistance after playing Devdas. Suchitra Sen brings the perfect essence into Paro with her weighted words and Vyajantimala is perfectly cast as Chandramuki. Every actoractress has the potential to bring you to tears. I have watched Devdas 2002 and it compares in no way to this movie. I agree this movie is not in colour and is not elaborate but I think that it what makes it realistic. Roy makes you believe that what you are watching is a village and not a palace as Bhansali depicted in his version. Calcutta is shown as it should be and Chandramukhi's kotha or clothes are not that elaborate either. We must remember that she is no queen like Madhuri Dixit in Bhansali's version. I have also seen Oriya villages that are very similar to Bengali ones because I originally come from one and I can say that Roy makes the village perfect. No Zamindar in a village had sparkling houses as in the new Devdas. Apart from the realism in location Roy's Devdas thrives in making the characters real. Sorry to say Shahrukh was Shahrukh and not Devdas in the new movie whereas Dilip Kuman epitomises the real Devdas as he brings the character to life. There is no melodrama as in the new one and the actors succeed totally into delivering dialogues with deep meaning and weight. Everything is irreplaceable.The music is brilliant. Every song seems to haunt you. The lyrics are deep and probing and perfectly suited to the story. Everything in this movie is perfect.I can go on forever because there is so much I can say. Nothing can explain the depth in this movie be it the dense story or the excellently portrayed and perfectly realistic emotions expressed by the actors. I get pulled into the movie whenever I see it and I always end up crying. This is one of the rarest and absolutely perfect movies I have seen. Bhansali's Devdas is in no way comparable to this movie except for the fact that it can boast stunning colour and lavish and glamorous sets. But personally that does not appeal to me. That is not realism it is a dream world which we should not aspire to achieve. Aesthetic elements do not make a movie great if the actors haven't acted well and the story loses realism. I would choose Roy's Devdas anytime and give it 1010. Nothing can surpass the talent and understanding of the material by the director in Roy's Devdas. Allow me to quote what Elvis Mitchell of THE NEW YORK TIMES said for The Two Towers obviously that film also deserved this praise 'Never has a film so strongly been a product of a director's respect for its source Creating a rare perfect mating between filmmaker and material.'. This also applies perfectly for Roy's Devdas. We will never be fortunate to see a movie like it if Bollywood continues to be clichd and not adventurous. I RECOMMEND EVERY MOVIE LOVER TO WATCH THIS MOVIE!".

He was no Dilip Kumar in the film but exact imitation of the role. He outperformed in perfectly getting under the skin of a prodigal Devdas in the first hour of the movie and a profligate Devdas in the last hour. Besides the very real to life and original performance of Dilip Suchitra Sen's weighted speech quality and simple dialog delivery adds resonance to an already touching storyline that goes to the heart of every viewer.The direction of Bimal Roy is superbly excellent and all the more imaginative and original i.e no artificial tawdry and superfluous love scenes and no vulgarity as well. He believed in ruling over the hearts of the audience through the sheer force of evocative and poignant dialogs songs and cinematography. That is a quality in sharp contrast with the latest version of Bhansali's Devdas. Roy's Devdas should be regarded as an intellectually perfect cinematic sequence in the history of Indian film making.This black and white old cinematic rendition of Chatterjee's novel is definitely head and shoulders above Bhansali's flamboyant and extravagant version of 2002 starring Shahrukh Khan.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is another film by the great Bimal Roy. Based on Sarat Chandra's famous Bengali novel Debdas Devdas 1955 is one of Bimal Roy's handful of films that are adaptations of Bengali novels and short stories others include Parineeta 1953 and Kabuliwallah 1960. In comparison with its successor Devdas 2002 Bimal Roy's Devdas 1955 provides a more realistic backdrop. The buildings such as Devdas' and Paro's houses as well as the brothel in which Chandramukhi dances are relatively simple unlike their overextravagant replicas in the recent adaptation by Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Also the costumes are simple and reflect the lifestyles of rural Bengalis in the past much unlike Sanjay Leela Bhansali's adaptation that features too much jewellery gold embroidery rich brocades and fabulous fabrics. In addition to that this film has great and subliminal histrionic performances by Dilip Kumar Suchitra Sen and Vyjayanthi Mala. I was captivated by Dilip Kumar's perfect picturisation of a drunk lovesick Devdas. His dialogues are simple and easier to understand in comparison with Shahrukh Khan's role who speaks lots of flowery language. Apart from that Dilip Kumar's blurred glint in his eyes while playing the drunk Devdas scene with Vyjayanthi Mala is simply natural. Leading Bengalifilm tragedy queen Suchitra Sen played Paro in this film and her performance was the greatest. In my opinion Paro's Aishwarya Rai reaching out to a dying Devdas Shahrukh Khan towards the story's end in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's adaptation was merely a copy of Suchitra Sen's act in this film the saris featured in the same scene from both films were exactly the same too! I strongly feel that Suchitra Sen's performance was at its strongest during this scene and no other actress can possibly duplicate it. Last but not least the round of applause should also go to Bollywood's legendary Dancing Queen Vyjayanthi Mala. She was handpicked by Bimal Roy for her flawless dancing skills. Nevertheless she not only spiced the film with her fluid Kathak she also gave the audience a neverseenbefore melodramatic side of herself when she played the converted Chandramukhi. Madhuri Dixit's role was simply out of the question whereby she even met up with Paro! Moreover one ought to note that Chandramukhi is just a courtesan not a diva as portrayed by Madhuri Dixit. In short Vyjayanthi Mala has successfully proved her versatility through Chandramukhi in this film. On top of that Devdas 1955 has a beautiful original musical score. The biggest credit should go to Lataji who was at that time enjoying early success. Her melodious voice made the mujras Aa Gayi Teri Marzi and O Jaane Wale as well as the touching Jisse Tu Kabool Kar Le Voh alltime bestloved nostalgic hits. In a nutshell Bimal Roy's Devdas 1955 will always rank as an evergreen classic in the charts of Bollywood thanks to the unforgettable acting by Dilip Kumar Suchitra Sen and Vyjayanthi Mala Lataji Talat Mehmood Mubarak Begum Asha Bhosle and Usha Mangeshkar's melodious voices as well as the memorable direction of the great filmmaker Bimal Roy.".

	schema:headline " A Classic Indian Story...";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm writing  and viewed this as an English nonIndian who simply loves film and is venturing from more obvious World Cinema into the more obscure and possibly more rewarding.So I'm more concerned with the story than who's playing whom and such. I came across the story Devdas via the 2002 very colourful and at the time may still be the case most expensive Indian film which is a feast to both eye and ear. I'll review that one once I've rewatched my new DVD of it having only seen on TV.The universal and accessible story written as early as 1917 is of two childhood sweethearts  Parvati and the titular Devdas who grow up but go their separate ways. Devdas flees to Calcutta and seeking the high life frequents a brothel and starts drinking to the extent that he comes alcoholic. She marries a wealthy husband. They both regret their parting and long for what could have been. Devdas befriends a pretty prostitute  Chandramukhi  who desperately wants to love the Devdas that she inwardly sees but cannot reach. His loves are for his childhood sweetheart  and the alcohol only. Add family issues and you've got a nice potboiler of emotion drama and pathos throughout the 160 minute runtime.Many think wrongly that Indian cinema is nothing but Bollywood  lightweight singing and dancing and that serious issues on Life are either treated in a dismissive way or not at all. In many ways this story could be Shakespearian or made for the Golden era of Hollywood. What makes it endlessly fascinating is of course the different culture from marriage and fidelity to the simple poetic beauty in the landscape and costume.There is some singing and dancing in this 1955 black  white version but little compared to a Bollywood production and much of what there is are the rituals of the working ladies that venture into Devdas' sordid existence.Naturally this monochrome  and much earlier film than the 2002 one is poorer in picture and sound quality. Mine cover exactly as shown had a varying faint greenolive colour cast had quite a few blemishes picked up through time and was slightly soft. The sound is OK if you're not fussy. However I know that this quality is typical for Indian film of this period. However one gets used to it and almost comforted by it being more intense somehow. At least is doesn't look like a video transfer thankfully.From what I gather many agree that Bimal Roy's film here is the definitive adaptation though it was made earlier the first of which was in 1928! For popularists and lovers of colour and spectacle go for the 2002 glossy version. If the story and the acting and a purer form of beauty is what you're after then this one will have you enthralled. Though the film itself is a four and half starrer I've not rounded it up due to transfer quality issue.".

Preindependence Bengal and Calcutta come alive in this movie but it is not a pretty picture.

That marriage happens only because Devdas' wealthy father and older brother refused to allow him to marry Paro the middle caste girl next door.  The pain is she loves Devdas too but cannot act on it.The parallel story has Chandramukhi Vyjayanthimala a dancer  call girl from Calcutta falling in love with Devdas as well while he is drinking away his sorrows.  But he is so focused on Paro and so negatively judges Chandramukhi's profession he cannot notice her.  When Devdas finally appreciates Chandramukhi's devotion for her own safety he dare not take her home.This is a sorrowful classic but with the overwrought pain it plays more like Wuthering Heights than like Gone With the Wind.".

Eventually it seems he must confront the demons of his past and unfortunately so must the Clan of the Dog.Pathfinder is played well by Russell Means and Ghost's love interest  Starfire  is nicely portrayed by Moon Bloodgood. Urban has great physical talent but this story did not lend itself to testing his ability to create drama and mood so there isn't much to say about his performance. Likewise most of the Norse characters were so underdeveloped and onedimensional that it is impossible to comment on the performances involved.Although the story relies on stereotypes to develop both its Norse and Native American characters since so little is actually known about the Norse colonies this seems forgivable. What is not really forgivable in my opinion is the reiteration of the trope established in Dances with Wolves and other similar works which suggests that it takes a European to effectively fight off Europeans. Although the characterizations of the protagonists in both films are adequate to explain their behavior the character and behavior of the Native Americans attached to them is less well developed and there is a lingering inaccurate and disturbing shadow of inferiority implied in their apparent inability to strategize and effectively lead in combat.However Pathfinder refuses to touch reality with any length of pole so sit back and enjoy the action costumes and sets.The film contains a lot of violence most of which is convincingly shot.

He guides them and agrees to lead to the hiding place of his fellow villagers but he has a scheme to destroy the cutthroats barbarians before reach the camp.It's the second version based on ancient folktale from Lapland the first and classic version was directed by Nils Gaup in 1988 winning several prizes. This new adaptation is an exciting picture plenty of action thrills chills rollercoaster ride violence and breathtaking fights. The brutal Vikings with horned helmets deliver the goods their appearance is spectacular and creepy including the majestic horses doing pirouettes. Furthermore the astonishing killings are gruesome executed and grisly graphic. Special mention to Russell Means  he was born Lakota Sioux a good actor Native American he along with Graham Greene Rodney A Grant Tantoo cardinal Eric Schweitz and Wes Studi appear in all movies about Indian themes. The evil Vikings are characterized in similar style to the classic 'Conan' by John Milius as when at the beginning appeared James Earl Jones in an unforgettable scenes . The sombre photography by Daniel Pearl with a sort of neverending dawn and dusk time is truly awesome. It's a kind of light mingled in a moody and foggy atmosphere. Many frames including the combats and cliffs scenes are made in a 300 style adding computer generator backgrounds. Stirring and evocative musical score by Jonathan Elias. Stunning and gripping realization by Marcus Nispel. He's a video hits director and expert on terror genre such as he proved  Friday the 13th Frankestein Texas chainsaw massacre but none of his movies have been based on original plot.".

He guides them and agrees to lead to the hiding place of his fellow villagers but he has a scheme to destroy the cutthroats barbarians before reach the camp.It's the second version based on ancient folktale from Lapland the first and classic version was directed by Nils Gaup in 1988 winning several prizes. This new adaptation is an exciting picture plenty of action thrills chills rollercoaster ride violence and breathtaking fights. The brutal Vikings with horned helmets deliver the goods their appearance is spectacular and creepy including the majestic horses doing pirouettes. Furthermore the astonishing killings are gruesome executed and grisly graphic. Special mention to Russell Means  he was born Lakota Sioux a good actor Native American he along with Graham Greene Rodney A Grant Tantoo cardinal Eric Schweitz and Wes Studi appear in all movies about Indian themes. The evil Vikings are characterized in similar style to the classic 'Conan' by John Milius as when at the beginning appeared James Earl Jones in an unforgettable scenes . The sombre photography by Daniel Pearl with a sort of neverending dawn and dusk time is truly awesome. It's a kind of light mingled in a moody and foggy atmosphere. Many frames including the combats and cliffs scenes are made in a 300 style adding computer generator backgrounds. Stirring and evocative musical score by Jonathan Elias. Stunning and gripping realization by Marcus Nispel. He's a video hits director and expert on terror genre such as he proved  Friday the 13th Frankestein Texas chainsaw massacre but none of his movies have been based on original plot.";

The main couple have no chemistry the dialog is UNenjoyably bad and the editing looks like it was done by a blind man. Scenes start and end with absolutely no flow. One scene was particularly bad I wont spoil it for you suffice to say its the one where the Indians charge into battle against the hero's wishes. That is the only scene when I laughed in the movie and its supposed to be a sadrousing scene.The trailer of this film looked really pretty but then again the consisted of mostly the fight scenes so I'm not surprised at all. The director seems to have had a good eye for visuals but his effort has ended there.Pathfinder  510 Five for the fight scenes.I was trying to find a path out of the theater at many times during the movie.".

Pathfinder proves to be another completely forgettable historical action movie at best generic as hell right down to your cookiecutter indestructible action hero played by Karl Urban.My biggest gripe with the film and I have many comes from how long it was pushed back for. If I remember correctly it was first slated for release in January of '06. It was delayed well over a year and I assumed that the crew were editing re shooting and doing other things that might make the film better. I should have remembered what happens when one assumes. In reality they were just waiting around for a good time to release the film because it obviously didn't improve in that year and a half. At one point they literally insert stock footage of an avalanche instead of creating their own CGI or real avalanche. Who are you guys kidding? There are about six words worth of meaningful dialog in this film. The Vikings don't even look human nobody ever really explains why they're going out of their way to kill everyone. The Native Americans are portrayed as weak and stupid little more than target practice. This film just lets the arrows fly and the heads roll.The acting is horrendous as well. Its got some cool action scenes but thats about it. It might have been a blessing having so little dialog in Pathfinder because if how brutal the little that was present proved to be. It was like Covenant bad. The script literally sounds like it was written by a child.Overall Pathfinder wastes its potential and fails to prove itself worthy of anyone's time let alone anyone's money. No amount of good action could have saved this film from its fate.".

Unfortunately many viewers such as my friend miss the point as they in fact look for a point.Unlike the new trend of films of this era Pathfinder did not submit to the theme of freedom the political freedom. None of the characters pronounce the word freedom such as the main character of the film 300 who shouted it out loud. Instead the main character of the film Ghost battles himself and his demons in order to find his own freedom and to fit in. Ghost tries to look for the peace he was raised in.Pathfinder challenges the modern stage of filmmaking and reintroduces a somewhat Western ideology that John Wayne's The Searchers had introduced in 1956. Therefore the audience has to place themselves in a position to examine each charactergroups' point of view. In that respect the film offers some depth to the little story that is filled with violent battle scenes.The battle scenes are enjoyable. There is a certain level of combat cruciality. That is also a part of the little depth the story gives us. Thus the issue of good and evil surfaces in the film in how battle is a balancing aspect of the life each side's lives.Of course since this film is trying to appeal to the general audience a certain degree of love and romance is involved. The love and romance of this film is actually not allsobad although I am not quite found of. However it brings a little strength into the issue of choice of life Ghost must endear.I think Pathfinder lives up to its own introduction Legend. Therefore it is filmed as such an old legend. The filmmakers saw it as such and they wanted to let us see it too. I know I did. The dialogues is not the perfect one but must resemble the simplicity of older times. I do not think this is the greatest film ever made however it is a well made film which I think people will enjoy its little story if they can go past the neoideology and what's the point? issue.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you went to see the movie expecting something like Mel Gibson's Apocalypto you will be disappointed obviously. But why would you expect it to be Apocalypto if you've seen the trailer? It tells a mythical tale of a legendary Norseman who was raised by native Americans. They called him ghost. And it's this ghost who ended up protecting the tribes from the destruction of the Viking Clang who shared the same lineage with him. The plot line is just that simple. What kept me entertained was the action sequence absolutely stunning cinematography and the overall presentation and atmosphere. The overall tune of the movie is dark mythical and menacing fit perfectly well for the theme. Vikings are presented more like beast than man with giant statue and equally ghastly giant armors and weapons.Some may argue that the vikings in this movie kill senselessly without any purpose. Does having a purpose makes evil more sensible? I have good news for people who are looking for reasons behind evil they all have purposes and reasons so don't waste time seeking one for them. Bad news for you it absolutely makes no difference! Throughout human history all aggressors had plenty of reasons to invade ravish and destroy other culture and lives the list goes from Vikings to Hitler... and it will probably go on forever. But does having reasons and purposes to kill make the killing more sensible? Absolutely not.In this movie Vikings are symbolic evil. Giving it a reason to kill doesn't make any differences as I stated above they all have reasons pick one and get over with it. On the other hand the movie was trying to suggest that not only there's this battle of good and evil going on in the physical world there's also a battle of hate and love in one's heart. When asked who would won Ghost was given the answer the one you feed the most. It's a very interesting theme that I wish the director would explore a little bit deeper. But in the end violence prevailed the screen time. The thought of inner struggle and loftier redemption was lost in the midst of killing and vengeance. No sin was forgiven and no bad deeds went unpunished. Though it's a more satisfying end but a shallow one.Overall I enjoyed the movie for what it is. I'm not looking for complicated plot nor deeper character development. For an action movie its visually stunning fast paced and immersing. It kept me interested throughout the 90 minutes and left me pondering about some unfulfilled premises. It's not as bad as some have painted it to be.".

There were some pretty odd incongruencies with language as well. The filmmakers relied on some trite Native American imagery and stereotypes...But Pathfinder was obviously never about the plot or silly Viking outfits. Ultimately I think the filmmakers wanted to impress upon the viewers the starkness of the landscape of uncivilized North America and how the people who lived there survived. One of the best lines in the movie is delivered when Ghost tells his lady friend that the Vikings know eternal winter but don't know our spring. I think the movie in its own kind of botched way did a good job conveying the awe reverence and fear that the people who lived in N.A. had for the seasons and the natural environment.".

	onyx:emotionText "Pathfinder was not nearly as bad as many people are making it out to be. True the editing was mediocre at best with the seasons clearly out of whack. There were some pretty odd incongruencies with language as well. The filmmakers relied on some trite Native American imagery and stereotypes...But Pathfinder was obviously never about the plot or silly Viking outfits. Ultimately I think the filmmakers wanted to impress upon the viewers the starkness of the landscape of uncivilized North America and how the people who lived there survived. One of the best lines in the movie is delivered when Ghost tells his lady friend that the Vikings know eternal winter but don't know our spring. I think the movie in its own kind of botched way did a good job conveying the awe reverence and fear that the people who lived in N.A. had for the seasons and the natural environment.";

	schema:reviewBody "This was quite possible the worst movie I have ever seen. Ridiculous plot no character development absurdly unbelievable this film gives up on the suspension of disbelief about 5 minutes into it. Sure it has some decent action and cinematography but as a whole this movie is a joke. A hilarious joke. I can best describe it as an hour and a half of Walker Texas Ranger blended with Army of Darkness and a sprinkle of randomness.Here is the plot insane genocidal Vikings with apparently nothing better to do in Scandinavia sail to America to trash the place and kill wantonly. Unlike the Vikings of history who at least targeted plunder to make their raiding worthwhile these bad guys just like to destroy stuff baskets of cranberries Native American women whatever. This guy Ghost cleverly named for his pale skin who is himself a Viking embarks upon a quest for vengeance upon the evil Vikings because he identifies more with the natives than his former people. Along the way a random retarded native decides to follow him in his quest and gets killed for no apparent purpose. The love interest also tags along occasionally helping and this old native The Pathfinder who is apparently some sort of badass shows up to provide some wisdom If you cannot defeat the bear use the bear's strength against him. and also to get killed. The inexplicably idiotic Vikings then take Ghost as a guide to the next village presumably to wreak more senseless destruction. Ghost tricks them into getting caught under an avalanche and everyone lives happily ever after. The End.Sound pitiful? That's because it is. I must say however that the final scene of the movie is so overwhelmingly clich that I honestly laughed the entire walk from my seat in theatre to my car in the parking lota distance of about 200 yards. It was that laughable.That said I do not regret seeing the movie as it isn't often that one gets to view a serious contender for the worst movie of his life. Hope this helps.".

	schema:reviewBody "Here we have a movie about a white guy who is raised by Indians and ends up choosing them over his own people. Sound familiar? It should because it's the basically the same plot device used in The Last Samurai with Japanese people instead of Indians Tarzan with jungle animals instead of Indians The Last of the Mohicans with Indians this time and countless other movies except that most of those movies managed not to suck. Speaking of which who remembers the scene in The Last of the Mohicans where the guy who acts like a jerk the whole time because he's hopelessly in love with the lead female character sacrificed himself so that the other good guys could get away and was then shot to death by his friends who wanted to put him out of his misery because the bad guys were burning him alive? Well the EXACT same thing happens in this movie. The only difference is that it's Vikings that are burning the guy alive instead of a rival tribe of Indians. Now you may be thinking maybe they never saw The Last of the Mohicans and it's just a coincidence. Not so...and how do I know this? Because the actor that plays the oldwise Indian in this movie is THE SAME FING GUY FROM THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS. You'd think he would have told the producers Hey I made this exact same movie in 1992 where I played this exact same role and we did this exact same scene except that when we did it that time it didn't have Vikings in it and we did it in a way that didn't suck. Or actually maybe he's the reason that scene is in this movie. Maybe he told the producers Hey guys we should totally have a scene where the guy who acts like a jerk the whole movie because he is in love with the lead female character nobly sacrifices himself for the good of everybody else and then gets burned alive but then his friends shoot him as they are fleeing so that he won't have to suffer any longer. Trust me we have to have that scene or this movie will be terrible. I'm not doing this movie if we don't have that scene. Basically this movie is such a rip off of other epic action movies that it's not even funny. It's kind of like watching a lame child limp along and try to play with the other kids...he's trying to do what everyone else is doing but somehow it's just not working for him. It's actually kind of hard to pinpoint why this movie doesn't really work. If you break it down to its essential ingredients it actually sounds pretty cool Vikings and Indians fighting each other  check Gratuitous sex scene with hot Indian girl  check Little kids getting their heads bashed in with axes and maces  check And yet for some reason this movie totally sucks. What's worse is that it doesn't even suck of its own accord it copies other movies and then sucks at it. But if you like scenes where a guy who acted like a jerk the whole movie because he's in love with the lead female character redeems himself by sacrificing himself and getting burned alive until his friends shoot him to put him out of his misery then this is the shameless rip off you've been waiting for.".

Whereas recent films like Mel Gibson's Apocalypto and Zack Snyder's 300 prove that a film with minimal plot can have its moments if it can build up on tension and sustain a viewer's attention Pathfinder fails to do so. Action scenes are at most moderately entertaining and lacks a kind of punch that would elevate it into a cinematic status. Attempts to impart emotions fall flat and there's no chemistry between Urban and Moon Bloodgood who plays the the obligatory role of the female sidekick.Overall Pathfinder is a film sorely lacking in impact that it would leave the viewer in the cold more than it would excite.".

	schema:headline " The Worst Movie I've Ever Been Dumb Enough to Pay to See";
	schema:reviewBody "If for any crazy reason you saw a trailer for Pathfinder and thought hey cool a viking movie! stop right there. This movie totally blew it blew long and hard and I got no satisfaction from it at all. I actually found myself thinking hmm.... should we just leave? I've never walked out of a movie theater I still haven't but that was the closest I've ever come.The good parts There was a scene where a guy got his face slashed and the eyeball fell out onto the ground and stared up at him... that was kinda cool. The viking costumes were kinda cool too. There was some good cinematography though which leads me to the bad parts.The bad parts The editing was absolutely abysmal. My 6 year old niece could've done better with some safety shears and a roll of scotch tape. There were these massive avalanche scenes and some nice panoramic shots that quite obviously did not come from the same stock as the rest of the movie picture Ed Wood's stampeding buffalo Most of the fight scenes were so badly edited you weren't sure who was slashing whom and if a hit was palpable or not. In one Ramboesque sequence I wasn't sure if there were 3 guys or 21 guys that all looked like the same three guys. The score while not technically horrible in its own rite did absolutely nothing to convey the story. Character development was mediocre when it wasn't null. Acting bad to horrible though in some cases I wasn't sure if it was the fault of the actors so much as the Lucas quality script. Did I mention the horrible washed out filters they used?

This movie totally blew it blew long and hard and I got no satisfaction from it at all. I actually found myself thinking hmm.... should we just leave? I've never walked out of a movie theater I still haven't but that was the closest I've ever come.The good parts There was a scene where a guy got his face slashed and the eyeball fell out onto the ground and stared up at him... that was kinda cool. The viking costumes were kinda cool too. There was some good cinematography though which leads me to the bad parts.The bad parts The editing was absolutely abysmal. My 6 year old niece could've done better with some safety shears and a roll of scotch tape. There were these massive avalanche scenes and some nice panoramic shots that quite obviously did not come from the same stock as the rest of the movie picture Ed Wood's stampeding buffalo Most of the fight scenes were so badly edited you weren't sure who was slashing whom and if a hit was palpable or not. In one Ramboesque sequence I wasn't sure if there were 3 guys or 21 guys that all looked like the same three guys. The score while not technically horrible in its own rite did absolutely nothing to convey the story. Character development was mediocre when it wasn't null. Acting bad to horrible though in some cases I wasn't sure if it was the fault of the actors so much as the Lucas quality script. Did I mention the horrible washed out filters they used?

One of his best underrated and too soon canceled programs the Showtime series Carnivale showed just how good he is at being bad but at the same time kinda good. Anyway back to the movie it's main problem is the awful editing It had some pretty decent action scenes but they just cut so quickly and you never get a hold on what you are seeing! My other complaint is that all the Indians speak English. I can understand this happening 20 years ago but are we really that lazy that we can't read subtitles? Especially in this day in age do we have to put all films in English? It sounds ridiculous and remember Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon did over 100 mil. U.S. and it was subtitled! The script also seemed repetitive sometimes as well. And whose Idea was it to not give the main character any lines 15 minutes into the movie? Well just don't ask too much of the film and it should be OK.".

	schema:reviewBody "It's impossible not to think of 300 when you're watching Pathfinder. Both are very loose accounts of historical battles that seem to be inspired more by video games than history. To be fair this movie was filmed and finished long before the film adaptation of 300 was as Pathfinder has been sitting on the studio's shelf for almost two years before finally being released. This is also where the similarities come to an end. 300 was a gloriously stupid movie that still managed to entertain thanks to some striking visuals and wellstaged sequences. Pathfinder on the other hand is so murky and muddy you almost feel like you're watching the movie through a dirty window at times. There's very little story to speak of and no real characters to give anything resembling emotion. All the movie gives us is some ineptly edited action sequences and a lot of over the top gore that isn't even presented very well to begin with.The film attempts to depict a struggle between a noble Native American tribe and some vicious Vikings. Because the Native Americans are the heroes they speak English while the evil Vikings are sometimes subtitled but usually speak in grunts and bellowing demonic roars that sound like they were lifted from a Godzilla movie. While exploring the ruins of a Viking ship a woman of the Native American tribe discovers an abandoned boy that the enemy left behind. She takes him back to her village and raises him amongst her people where he grows up to be an appropriately muscular and personalityfree young man who goes by the name of Ghost Karl Urban from Doom because of his pale skin. When Ghost's original clan returns 15 years later to continue pillaging and plundering the innocent tribal people he teams up with a small band of survivors to fight back. Numerous heads are removed from their proper place above the neck blood and limbs fly at the camera and we can't help but realize how dull and uninspired it all is.The only surprising thing about Pathfinder comes during the ending credits when we realize that the characters we have been watching for the past 90 minutes or so actually had names. Aside from the heroic Ghost I do not recall a single other character's name being mentioned in the dialogue. Kind of makes it hard to figure out who played who at the end since the entire cast is made up of faceless drones who all look alike and exist simply to be killed in the film's many action sequences. Besides not having names until the very end of the movie the characters don't seem to talk much either. I wouldn't be surprised to discover that dialogue makes up maybe 40 minutes and that's being generous of the film's running time. The lack of dialogue make the characters impossible to identify with or even understand their slightest motives. Things keep on happening but it leaves absolutely no impression on us. When the characters do open their mouths what they say is often so laughably bad that we look forward to them being silent again. Ghost may be the hero but he doesn't say a single intelligent thing in the entire screenplay. You get the sense that he's the lead by default rather than for his personality.All of this could have been forgiven if Pathfinder's action sequences were anything special. Unfortunately director Marcus Nispel 2003's Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake seems to have no idea how to stage or shoot a battle sequence successfully. He uses a lot of dramatic slow motion shots as the enemy approaches and then whenever people actually start fighting he suddenly shoots the battles so tight and so close to the action that we sometimes can't even tell what's going on. It's just a mess of blood and flying body parts that has been edited so sloppily that we can't tell who is decapitating who. A sequence where a man battles with a ferocious bear is particularly humorous in how badly the entire thing comes across. Since the fights make up a good portion of the story I quickly lost interest and found myself asking why anyone would want to watch this. It is a 90 minute long black hole that sucks the time and money away from anyone foolish enough to venture into a cinema showing it. It can't be bothered to entertain or excite us or even give us a very basic thrill. The film's visuals seem to have gotten about as much attention as the dialogue and often look dark and bland.At the very least Pathfinder is mercifully brief and manages to go in one ear and out the other without leaving too much of an impression. A lot of money was obviously put into the project and I can't help but wonder where it all went. Watching this movie is a lot like watching money being burned right up there on the screen for no reason at all. It can't give us a reason as to why we're supposed to be entertained so all we can do is wait for it to be over. When the end finally did come I didn't feel relieved or happy. I actually felt about as indifferent as I did throughout the rest of the film. Pathfinder accomplishes nothing at all and gets exactly the kind of reaction it deserves.".

They took him in and called him Ghost. Years pass and he is raised by the clan. Everything seems so well until one day Ghost's old clan came back. They came they kill and Ghost wants revenge. Then they fight and fight and fight.What I like most about this movie is the costume. After watching the movie I want a toy company to create the Vikings. The armors are nice. I like the way they shoot the movie. Pretty cool. The script is somehow OK. It is good but not that good.A cool movie. Worth watching if you are into swords and armors movies.

I think they came up with a great story and a nice movie. sure there are some short comings that a 100 million dollars could have fixed but all in all its watchable. I even enjoyed it and have seen it more than once.for those of you expecting a high budget dramatic movie don't bother but for action buffs who like a few good fights and some great scenery... its pretty good.I hope people will keep supporting small production house movies so they never disappear!!! nice change from flag waving American productions....".

So the whole part of the movie where you see old Diana is in fact a young girl's imagination hence some of the critic about the character of old Diana. Furthermore because there is not 15 years difference between the two periods you do see on purpose mobile phones or flat screens in the young days.For the rest a very good movie in my opinion.".

Unfortunately these segments are handicapped by a banal storyline and Thurman's lifeless performance.

Last time I checked copycat is used when you imitate slavishly you just reproduce some previous thing. Now if someone can't see the differences between The Sixth Sense Elephant and The Life Before Her Eyes maybe that person should watch more movies before writing. Taking another idea and putting a different spin on it has been done forever since art began in paintings music literature all arts. That's creativity when you put something personal on an old story. Now that person might think that we only need one film about a high school shooting and its consequences. We already have Elephant why do we need more? It's not like we keep having shootings right? I would also be really sad if I thought that the subjects treated in this movie are only interesting to academics.Overlyconvenient plot points? Well it's all her imagination of her own life before dying. You can't expect realism when it all has this dreamy life passing before your eyes feeling with a clever twist. Of course the reminders will keep popping up and flooding her consciousness. Besides since when all films have to be realistic? On one level the film represents the guilt and remorse experienced by someone who keeps trying to forget a traumatic incident. But sometimes the hardest you try the more things keep reminding you of it. The film could have interwoven a brief scene imitating a shock of memory instead it presents it from an external source which is how you sometimes feel the memory of traumatic events as something that is coming from outside something that you can't prevent or avoid like a radio that tells us what we've been doing the best effort to put out of our minds.A LOT of contrived pathos? It's about a person dying!!!!! An exploitation of columbine? See comment above about coypcat.Metaphorladen? Amazingly it's only the professional critics who are invoking this one. I really don't understand critics anymore. It's true that speaking plainly has its advantages. But since when do all films have to follow the same rules? Some artists thrive using metaphors. Let them use them! Or maybe they actually are annoyed because they understand the metaphors and we all know that the more unintelligible a film is the better. Especially if we DO think that we understand them because that means that we're part of the intelligent elite that can appreciate those films.Confusing and tiring flashbackflash forward method? The film follows the pathway of memory which goes through associations metonymies metaphors repetitions similarities and not chronology. Now wouldn't it be so much less hard if all the past were first and the future later? I guess we're too intelligent so we're above the metaphors but putting pieces in the right order is haaard! Finally the jewel An overwrought and patently offensive antiabortion drama? Clearly this is coming from a man Lou Lumenick New York Post. And he might not have any friends that have had abortions. I'm prochoice but I know that all of my friends who did it had feelings of remorse not guilt although that could be a component. What do you think? That a woman just pretends that it never happened that she never questions if she could have done something differently. That doesn't mean you're making an antiabortion diatribe. It's just dealing with a hard traumatic memory. I'm so sorry that this critic thinks that talking about those feelings implies a moral choice. Talk about manicheism.I'm not saying that the film is flawless. Maybe it is too precious even though it has a good excuse for it. It's a collection of idealized moments of past and future passing through someone's imagination. You could certainly find fault in the way that Evan Rachel Wood is sexualized I mean the camera really loves her and it's clearly from a male perspective. Others might be able to live with such obvious exponent of the male gaze.".

Everything seemed so real which played up every detail to me and made the picture all the more engrossing. Uma Thurman is top notch in this but i believe that Evan Rachel Wood really makes it because honestly who else could we expect to play the teen angst better than her? The relationship between Eva Amurri's Maureen and Wood's Diana is so realistic in every situation and much of that credit has to go to Emil Stern's adaptation. There are so many themes that run deep throughout this movie and the ever pressing scare of school shootings makes this hit home really really hard. This is an amazing film that will touch every single emotion and leave you thinking about it for days. Go see this movie whenever you get the chance. It is an intensely beautiful and moving film and most definitely one of the best I have seen so far this year.".

	schema:reviewBody "One of the main reasons for picking this up is the star pairing of Uma Thurman and Evan Rachel Wood playing the same character Diana in a tale that explores how lives get changed and affected in a post Columbine styled school shooting. Directed by Vadim Perelman who also helmed The House of Sand and Fog The Life Before Her Eyes is adapted from the novel by Laura Kasischke and the first scene sets up the hook beautifully  what if you're caught in a dead end with your best friend and a gunman?The narrative unfolds in nonlinear fashion which splits the story into two separate threads one with the younger teenage Diana Rachel Evan Wood and her BFF Maureen Eva Amurri discussing the usual problems issues and dreams a teenager would have and their aspirations in life and the other putting its focus on the adult Diana Uma Thurman now married to a professor and having to raise her child Emma Gabrielle Brennan who's quite a handful to handle providing some mean reminiscence into her own past that she hopes she's able to steer her kid out from that doomed past.In character pieces like this both lead actresses shine in their respective spheres with Evan Rachel Wood playing yet again an impetuous youth living life her own way never hesitating to dabble in sex and drugs and basically the making all the mistakes that one can make as a teen. The chemistry shared with Eva Amurri was excellently convincing so much so that with the pivotal scene in the bathroom you're put on the edge of your seat as to the choices that both will make. Which you can partake in if you put yourself in similar shoes with a gun pointed at you and a chance to live or die per your wishes.Uma Thurman tackles her mom role with aplomb juggling raising a kid with trying to avoid her past which is slowly coming back through flashbacks no thanks to the 15th anniversary of the fateful day in school. It may seem that she's living that perfect life but the cracks soon show up and little things become opportunities for reminiscence. I suppose as a parent you will try that utmost best to avoid your kid repeating the same mistakes you have made and will be on the lookout for warning signs. Thurman brings to the table that level of maturity as well as a sense of paranoia as she tries hard to forget her past.Vadim Perelman created a film that's basically very dreamlike in quality as it deals with themes such as conscience and selfpreservation and crafted the key bathroom scene with ingenuity that keeps you constantly guessing how it will all play out and pulling his punches at the right time to keep up that level of suspense right up to the end. Production values are purposefully split down the middle to differentiate the landscapes between the two time periods to reflect the lifestyle and mood of Diana and of course to throw clues in addition to what's being done by the narrative with a haunting soundtrack throughout courtesy of James Horner.Some may not like the how the finale played out but I thought it was refreshingly different from the usual narrative twist attempts. Some may deem it not plausible but I tend to consider it not as being performed during a single moment but more of being worked on over a period of time. After all an idea isn't just conceived and worked on overnight  we tend to think about it at some lengths not necessarily always during the same sitting. Even if you have an inkling of how it will play out it's the delivery of key scenes and the wonderful dramatic performances that make this way above average. Recommended!".

There won't be many better genuinely adult movies this year and most likely it will be ignored.";

	schema:headline " The Ultimate Test Of Courage And Friendship";
	schema:reviewBody "Vadim Perelman's 'The Life Before Her Eyes' is just as powerful but equally complex as his harrowing 'The House of Sand and Fog'. This movie is just as engaging and at times also confusing. Perelman uses fascinating visuals. The film opens with a montage of various beautiful flowers that have a symbolic definition and then follows two girls to a highschool bathroom. The shootout scene takes place only within the bathroom while we hear gunfire in the background but for me this movie has achieved in that first sequence what the pretentious 'Elephant' didn't which was also about a highschool shootout. While the focus is on the two girls you literally see the fear in their eyes as their 'nice' day is interrupted and their lives are threatened.On the technical side it is a very well crafted film. The cinematography the music the sets and editing are all top notch. The visuals are detailed and pretty much every frame has something to say.The ending is different from that of the book but I think both of them rise the same question. What would have you done if you were in Diana's shoes? The question isn't easy to answer because you never actually know unless you are facing such circumstance. That is the test of one's courage. Emil Stern's screenplay is dazzling. The story doesn't follow a linear structure but there's a reason for that. Dialogues are laden with interesting philosophy. Perelman beautifully tackles numerous themes such as friendship posttraumatic stress motherhood and abortion among others.The cast features three powerful performances by Uma Thurman Evan Rachel Wood and Eva Amurri. Thurman's portrayal of Diana's complexity devotion to her family and inability to cope with her past is spot on. Wood and Amurri deliver very natural performances as two girls going through the usual teen problems but dealing with it differently because 'one has what the other doesn't' and that way they help each other. Their on screen friendship is very convincing hinting that they might actually be good friends in real life. Then there's the bathroom scene which could have easily gone wrong had it been played by lesser actresses but this is one of the most powerful scenes in a movie of recent time and one only has to watch it to understand its impact.'The Life Before Her Eyes' is not an easy film to follow and those who are looking for something simple or light may feel let down but on the other hand it's a very strong movie. Perelman has hit the mark again just like he did with 'The House of Sand and Fog'. He seems to be intrigued by tragic stories and bringing them on screen. He does one hell of a job again.".

Uma Thurman hasn't been better as she plays a woman who is now well into adulthood living in the small town that she grew up in with a professor husband and a little girl. I love the way Perelman uses flashbacks here to inform us about Thurman as a teen. In many films flashbacks can yank us around and cut tension but here Evan Rachel Wood is so good that the two characters are seamlessly interwoven in a way that we are treated to a complex character study of a grown woman who is driving herself mad with regret and anxiety and guilt. There's nothing more fascinating than watching conflict that is internal rather than external and Thurman here is so good I hope she is remembered come Oscar season.Just a solid movie in every way. Good score from James Horner the guy who did the music for A Beautiful Mind and House of Sand and Fog equally lovely scores in their own right.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vadim Perelman has the Lifetime Channel TiVo'd 24 hours a day especially while he went to film school. That can be the only explanation as to why he seems to make nothing but garishly ornate melodramatic weep stories. His most famous film House of Sand  Fog kept a handle on the waterworks until its preposterous and forced conclusion. His newest film The Life Before Her Eyes is not quite so lucky.The film's storyline follows two eras of the same woman jumping back and forth between teenager Diana Evan Rachel Wood and her adult counterpart Uma Thurman suffering survivors' guilt after surviving a school shooting where she was directly faced with death and forced to make a choice whether she or her friend should die. In a sort of questionable career choice she works in a school just down the street from the school where she was faced with the horrible event the exact place that gives her all the bad memories that trigger all the flashbacks that we have to sit through. The narrative is cyclical jumping back and forth between the time before the shooting depicting Diana's unlikely friendship with an innocent church girl and her affair with an older man and her current life where she is a bit emotionally estranged from her husband due to the troubling memories taking care of her young child.Most noticeably the film is hideously overdirected. Perelman imbues every transition and a lot of extended sequences with this precious ornamental quality that makes the emphasis meaningless giving as much emotional weight to a tulip as he affords to a murdered teenager. I will give credit where credit is due the shot of one student lying dead in the gym with beams of light is a striking shot but drawing comparisons to 300 most of the film is seemingly shot that way which makes the freshness turn sour quite quickly. He needs someone to tell him No and make sure he only uses his visual flair when it's more necessary. If you put ketchup on everything invariably you're going to get sick of it especially because ketchup doesn't go on everything.The other major problem for the film is that its weepiness is so restrained that it makes a film a curiously empty experience. Something overwrought qualities could have turned it into camp not the director's preferred choice of enjoyment but enjoyment all the same but much of the film's runtime is spent in mundane purportedly meaningful or ironic discussions of pre and postshooting life or tiresome continuous flashbacks to the exact same moment The Moment if you will and there's not really enough variation or meaning in the sequence to require its appearance so frequently.The film culminates with an idiotic twist in its final reels one that including being stupefying is also presented in a way that is both baffling and infuriating as it negates everything that comes before it. That in itself doesn't necessitate failure there's a certain film one of the best of this decade that did exactly this and made even less sense if you've seen it you know what it is  but the way it is presented here especially after having to sit through so much blathering nonsense makes it feel like an extra helping of cheapness thanks to the fact that it negates much of the story. The Usual Suspects utilized this sort of twist after giving us a captivating and exciting crime tale then dropping the bomb. The Life Before Her Eyes gives us slice of life minutiae then tells us none of it happened. Why did what sounds to be a poignant examination of grief and life need a 'twist' anyway? Did The Sweet Hereafter need a twist ending? I think not. The way it comes off when it happens it smacks of desperation and intellectual exhaustion turning this supposed character study into a bizarre antiabortion screed that it doesn't fit in. There's a reason you haven't heard of this movie folks and I watch 'em so you know when you're at Blockbuster or browsing Netflix you can skip right past The Life Before Her Eyes.You're welcome.Grade 410 C  48 of 66 of 2008".

Diana is a superbly written character one that is not simple in its nature but detailed organic portrayal of a girl who has too much fire in her to help her fit in but who ironically longs what her best friend has. She is not complete unless she spends time with Maureen and there is true genuine affection between these two girls. They know each other's dreams troubles hopes and disappointments. The beauty of the film is how natural the dialog flows as we reach the surprising ending.In general the film is a masterpiece a work of art that explores the possibilities of life the repercussions of a single moment the way we must make choices and determine what we think might be best for us and yet what if we had chosen differently. This is a movie that turns clichs upside down giving us a new perspective on how refreshing storytelling can be if approached with a original design. Superb photography and a haunting score add to the overall effect but it all rests on the shoulders of a very talented young woman a girl who can tell us stories in seconds with just a look... and she brings to mind those cinema stars of the past before CGI started stealing our creativity and numbing our minds and hearts.In Bloom is bound to move you beyond tears because it appeals to both the heart and the mind never allowing us to forget how precious life can be.".

	schema:headline " Genre Women's film. Audience Everybody.";
	schema:reviewBody "The closing night film at the justconcluded 2008 Phoenix Film Festival was as wonderful as its opener The Visitor. The Life Before Her Eyes was directed by Vadim Perelman from an adapted screenplay based on the novel of the same name by Laura Kasischke. Perelman directed the moving tragic House of Sand and Fog released in 2003 which we raved about at the time. Before Her Eyes like last year's Sandra Bullock vehicle Premonition is what I call a women's filmwhich is decidedly not the same thing as a chick flick. It's a serious look at issues women face through a woman's eyes from women's perspectives. That's not to say men won't like and be thoughtfully stimulated by it too. The film is visually poetic right from the credits with imagescloseups of flowers melting away through lenswork or computer tricks or boththat herald the sensuous feel of the whole film.The film's axis is a massacre at a high school by a disturbed young manhardly an untopical event these days. It follows a couple of female teenage best friends up to and well beyond the bloody events of that day. Rachel Evan Wood plays Diana one of the two girlsa restless sexually active alienated selfwilled and somewhat confused young woman whose friend Maureen Eva Amurri presents a counterweight to those qualities.Uma Thurman plays Wood's character as a grownupan art history teacher with a husband a child and traumatic memories of the day that changed everything. We'll avoid spoilers since right up to the end of this film the viewer has been led to look at the film one way and it may not be the right way. That said there's a Sophie's Choice element at its crux though one less gratuitous in its framing and in its consequences than I've always considered that hinge of Styron's book and of the film made from it to be. However against the decisive turning point represented by the massacre the film examines what seem to be a number of uniquely female preoccupations and dilemmas For instance there's the question of sex. Men are generally all impulse expressing the conatus of Leibnizian philosophy women are the gatekeepers. Women adolescent girls deal with the good girlbad girl issue They can say no and are expected by parents society to do so but how long can they and keep a man they may want? So they deal with guilt. They deal with the pressure and then often the rejection even by the same source of the pressureyoung boys who then taunt their conquests as sluts. The blood of their period is akin to can lead to the blood of an abortion this is the blood of Christianviewed sin not of the redemptive blood of the lamb. Another item Men for the most part hold power of life and death over other living born peoplethey send others to war to their executions. Women hold that power over the unborn. Maybe it's a fair division. But maybe no one would like to have either power if they could avoid it.Women are taught socialized to make a relationship a marriage a home. If those things fall apart they are told in myriad ways to look first to themselves to blame. Even with a philandering husband. Even with a child who's simply programmed to behave act out resist rebel among other reasons as part of the eternal cycle of motherdaughter conflict. As Thurman's Diana says I thought if I cared for my child helped my students loved my husband everything would be all right. But doing those things the right thing doesn't necessarily control outcomes bring ultimate happiness.As an art teacher the lessons Diana is teaching focus on Gauguinlike the art references in Philip Roth's early seminal novel Goodbye Columbus. I'll leave the point of that reference that inclusion for the viewer to explore for themselves as with the Blake poem Diana reads to her daughter to soothe her to sleep. Likewise the ubiquitous imagery of water in the film in one scene young Diana getting wet in the spray from a fountain wonders where the boundary is between its mist and the air it is dissipating into. Where is the boundary between consciousness and notbeing? Between life in its vibrancy and the ebbing away of life? Echoes of Richard Linklater's Waking Life. There are a few false notes as in the somewhat hokey dialogue about the heart being the strongest muscle in the body. Some other witty exchanges reminded me of the improbably smart readyforthe DorothyParkerbookofquips utterances by Ellen Page's precocious teen in last year's phenomenon Juno. But they're infrequent and dissolve quickly in the potent larger mix. The title and final plot twist are in fact a hoary clichand a clue ... though one most people I feel are unlikely to crack. Another clue is to be found in the soundtrack in an old Zombies song heard repeatedly sometimes in different forms in the film.

	onyx:emotionText "The closing night film at the justconcluded 2008 Phoenix Film Festival was as wonderful as its opener The Visitor. The Life Before Her Eyes was directed by Vadim Perelman from an adapted screenplay based on the novel of the same name by Laura Kasischke. Perelman directed the moving tragic House of Sand and Fog released in 2003 which we raved about at the time. Before Her Eyes like last year's Sandra Bullock vehicle Premonition is what I call a women's filmwhich is decidedly not the same thing as a chick flick. It's a serious look at issues women face through a woman's eyes from women's perspectives. That's not to say men won't like and be thoughtfully stimulated by it too. The film is visually poetic right from the credits with imagescloseups of flowers melting away through lenswork or computer tricks or boththat herald the sensuous feel of the whole film.The film's axis is a massacre at a high school by a disturbed young manhardly an untopical event these days. It follows a couple of female teenage best friends up to and well beyond the bloody events of that day. Rachel Evan Wood plays Diana one of the two girlsa restless sexually active alienated selfwilled and somewhat confused young woman whose friend Maureen Eva Amurri presents a counterweight to those qualities.Uma Thurman plays Wood's character as a grownupan art history teacher with a husband a child and traumatic memories of the day that changed everything. We'll avoid spoilers since right up to the end of this film the viewer has been led to look at the film one way and it may not be the right way. That said there's a Sophie's Choice element at its crux though one less gratuitous in its framing and in its consequences than I've always considered that hinge of Styron's book and of the film made from it to be. However against the decisive turning point represented by the massacre the film examines what seem to be a number of uniquely female preoccupations and dilemmas For instance there's the question of sex. Men are generally all impulse expressing the conatus of Leibnizian philosophy women are the gatekeepers. Women adolescent girls deal with the good girlbad girl issue They can say no and are expected by parents society to do so but how long can they and keep a man they may want? So they deal with guilt. They deal with the pressure and then often the rejection even by the same source of the pressureyoung boys who then taunt their conquests as sluts. The blood of their period is akin to can lead to the blood of an abortion this is the blood of Christianviewed sin not of the redemptive blood of the lamb. Another item Men for the most part hold power of life and death over other living born peoplethey send others to war to their executions. Women hold that power over the unborn. Maybe it's a fair division. But maybe no one would like to have either power if they could avoid it.Women are taught socialized to make a relationship a marriage a home. If those things fall apart they are told in myriad ways to look first to themselves to blame. Even with a philandering husband. Even with a child who's simply programmed to behave act out resist rebel among other reasons as part of the eternal cycle of motherdaughter conflict. As Thurman's Diana says I thought if I cared for my child helped my students loved my husband everything would be all right. But doing those things the right thing doesn't necessarily control outcomes bring ultimate happiness.As an art teacher the lessons Diana is teaching focus on Gauguinlike the art references in Philip Roth's early seminal novel Goodbye Columbus. I'll leave the point of that reference that inclusion for the viewer to explore for themselves as with the Blake poem Diana reads to her daughter to soothe her to sleep. Likewise the ubiquitous imagery of water in the film in one scene young Diana getting wet in the spray from a fountain wonders where the boundary is between its mist and the air it is dissipating into. Where is the boundary between consciousness and notbeing? Between life in its vibrancy and the ebbing away of life? Echoes of Richard Linklater's Waking Life. There are a few false notes as in the somewhat hokey dialogue about the heart being the strongest muscle in the body. Some other witty exchanges reminded me of the improbably smart readyforthe DorothyParkerbookofquips utterances by Ellen Page's precocious teen in last year's phenomenon Juno. But they're infrequent and dissolve quickly in the potent larger mix. The title and final plot twist are in fact a hoary clichand a clue ... though one most people I feel are unlikely to crack. Another clue is to be found in the soundtrack in an old Zombies song heard repeatedly sometimes in different forms in the film. At least I didn'tthe whole weight momentum of the film are so forceful on behalf of a different supposition.

I was shaking and felt my heart pounding at various points in the film. I am amazed with the director Vadmir who did House of Sand and Fog. He has a unique style of bringing about various elements to convey his message. The cinematography was beautiful and the score was fabulous. James Horner that has done many different works can add another spectacular masterpiece to his list of credits. Eva Ammuri is beautiful and plays a role that is unlike any role anyone has seen from her. Evan Rachel Wood gives another emotional nail biting performance of a troubled teen. She was phenomenal in Thirteen and has come into her own as an adult for the role of Diane. Uma Thurman has never looked better than she did in this film. Young Gabrielle Brennan is the next Dakota Fanning and is a joy to speak with. She has such a wit about her and open to what life has to offer. I can't stop raving about this film as I am completely blown away by the talent and film. The story hits home for so many people and everyone can gain something from it. I can not wait to see it again as I want to rewatch and look for things I missed the first time. Go see the film it is well worth the 1.5 hours and will have you on the edge of your seat.".

But it has to do with conscience and how our minds create the image of the person we want to be.Uma Thurman is the adult Diana McFee and Evan Rachel Wood 15 years earlier is the Young Diana. The movie is edited so that it switches often between the two periods of time. But the movie actually starts and ends within about the same 3 or 4 minutes of time while Diana is in high school.Other key characters are Eva Amurri Susan Sarandon's daughter as Diana's best friend in high school Maureen.

Diana's husband is Brett Cullen as Paul McFee a professor she began to idolize as she went to a presentation of his for a class assignment when she was 17.MAJOR SDPOILERS DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE As the movie begins we see some of the typical issues for a high school girl and Diana and Gabrielle make a quick stop in the girls' restroom before their next class. As they banter they hear rifle shots and quickly figure out that a student is shooting other students and faculty.

	schema:reviewBody "I like Uma. She will one day regret making this movie. While some may say that this movie is the result of an artistic mind it will not be heard from anyone I know who saw the movie. It was obvious from the slow panning at the beginning and became worse as it progressed. Jerking the viewer around with repeated clips of the same scenes only made the movie longer and more boring. Developing a storyline and then deleting it for no obvious reason is the work of one with no vision. A good movie has a beginning a middle and an end. This movie had a very slooooooow beginning a confused and muddled middle and the end did not complete the movie. I've watched a lot of bad movies hoping that they produce something that I might want to watch again. I have watched some movies that succeeded in this. But The Life Before Her Eyes is a movie that I will warn people about and advise them waste their money on something else. This is a piece of junk created by those who have no creative ability...

While some may say that this movie is the result of an artistic mind it will not be heard from anyone I know who saw the movie. It was obvious from the slow panning at the beginning and became worse as it progressed. Jerking the viewer around with repeated clips of the same scenes only made the movie longer and more boring. Developing a storyline and then deleting it for no obvious reason is the work of one with no vision. A good movie has a beginning a middle and an end.

	schema:reviewBody "Laura Kasischke's intelligent novel 'The Life Before Her Eyes' has been brilliantly adapted for the screen by Emil Stern and with the skills of director Vadim Perelman this underrated movie in the theaters may find a wider appreciative audience in this DVD format. It is a film that challenges the viewer to think to piece together the evidence and to come to personal conclusions about the meaning of the story. Diana Evan Rachel Wood in an outstanding performance is a 'loose girl' in her highschool who happens to be best friends with her total opposite the moralistic virgin Maureen Eva Amurri. While sharing thoughts and gossip in the school's bathroom they hear gunshots and rapidly become victims of a wild student's killing spree terrorizing the school. The killer enters the bathroom asks the girls to decide which one of the two will volunteer to die gunshots blaze and we see Diana lying on the floor of the bathroom while Maureen shrinks beneath the sinks the last gunshots are apparently the killer committing suicide. Flash forward 15 years and Diana Uma Thurman is the beautiful wife of a professor Sherman Alpert an art history teacher and mother of young Emma Gabrielle Brennan. There is something not quite real about the atmosphere Diana lives in fear and grief ?Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome? and despite her 'perfect' surroundings she is ridden with anxiety. When asked by a friend if she is going to attend the 15 year Memorial for the school shooting event Diana says she hasn't decided. What follows is a series of flashbacks allowing us to fully understand the young Diana's motivations and impulsive behavior and her close relationship with Maureen before the tragedy changed their lives. But gaping holes in the history of the event and the subsequent years ultimately force the viewer to decide what actually happened in the past are we witnessing reality or imagined dreams  and it is left to every viewer to decide the facts of the story for themselves. Uma Thurman is brilliant in this challenging role and Evan Rachel Wood is equally stunning as the younger version of Thurman's role. The entire cast contributes an ensemble performance that keeps us involved in this thriller from opening frame to closing credits. Vadim Perelman's approach to the story offers subtle visually magnificent images that provide clues throughout the film about the division between real and imagined. This is a fine film on every level. Highly recommended. Grady Harp".

The ending even in those days might have turned out either wimpy or waspish.  In Bette's hands it is neither.  It works in a way that literally drains one of emotions. I might also add that while revealing only a bare back Bette shows more sensuality than a dozen of today's more open actresses.There is an old disparaging adage about showing the full gamut from a to b in this movie Bette not only shows A to Z but some letters that haven't been invented yet.Despite my gushing over Ms. Davis the film is solid in all departments.

I even saw it on the big screen in a revival house when I was in college. Yes some of the dialogue sounds corny now like the good doctor saying Women never meant anything to me before. But the interesting thing is when I did see it with an audience though they laughed as some inappropriate spots by the end you could hear the sobs on the next block.There have been comments that Humphrey Bogart seems miscast in a somewhat minor role. I frankly thought he was just fine. He certainly was short enough to be a jockey and he pulled off the brogue. I'm sure it's confusing for some to see him in such a small role in 1939 when only a few years later he was a total superstar. But he was under contract to Warners and kicked around for years before High Sierra and Casablanca. He obviously wasn't working when Dark Victory was cast so why let him sit around taking a salary and do nothing?And of course we have Ronald Reagan as a playboy. I actually find him delightful in this film. It called for charm and he had it.In today's fastpaced world there's nothing stronger than a message about time and our use of it. Oh give me time for tenderness...just give me time. Like Bette's character I want to hear that song again too in many more viewings of Dark Victory.".

	schema:reviewBody "Coming in the middle of her tumultuous 18year reign as Queen of the Warner Bros. studio this classic 1939 tearjerker proved to be the ideal vehicle for the mercurial talents of Bette Davis in her prime in a year marked by so many other memorable films. Adapted by longtime studio screenwriter Casey Robinson from a shortlived 1934 Broadway play the story involves Judith Traherne a frivolous selfabsorbed heiress living hard in the fast lane at 23 who finds herself confronting her own mortality with the discovery of an inoperable brain tumor. Naturally she denies anything is wrong with her at first but faces the reality of her condition by eventually rising to the occasion with courage and integrity. It has been the subject of many parodies and at least two remakes in the past seventy years but the original still works best thanks to Davis' careerdefining performance.Besides Davis and Max Steiner's equally emotional score the movie itself has not aged as well due to the pedestrian work of director Edmund Goulding Grand Hotel in guiding the venture and lackluster contributions from the supporting cast one of whom is seriously miscast In hindsight. Judith's Long Island social world is full of harddrinking party types like the perpetually drunk Alec who tries to woo her into marriage. He's not the only one as Irish stable hand Michael is equally smitten with Judith but there's the social class distinction to consider. The novelty is that a young Ronald Reagan plays Alec and Humphrey Bogart two years from his breakthrough in The Maltese Falcon plays Michael. Reagan does not make much of an impact but Bogart is sorely miscast as Michael to the point of being distracting as Davis blows him off the screen in particular a latenight failed seduction scene when she dismissively halfasks him You're making love to me aren't you?However it is Judith's steady best friend Ann and especially the stalwart braincell specialist Dr. Steele who help Judith in her true victory over the dark. Both Geraldine Fitzgerald and constant Davis costar George Brent do solid work in the roles but nothing nearly at Davis' caliber. Perhaps this was intentional but it does make for an odd imbalance to the film. Regardless the last twenty minutes pull at the requisite heartstrings as Judith faces her fate with a heavenly choir. It's a grand Davis sequence worthy of her legacy. The print in the 2005 DVD release is nicely restored. Film historian James Ursini and CNN film critic Paul Clinton provide a perceptive commentary track and there is a short featurette that explains how the film's reputation has unfairly suffered over the years. See the film itself for the vibrancy and depth of Davis' performance which hasn't aged a bit.".

	schema:reviewBody "Out of all the films she made Bette Davis thought this her finest role and greatest performance. That's a pretty big statement from a woman considered to be perhaps the finest screen actress of all time and one who turned in countless excellent performances. Yet Davis is truly fantastic here as is Irish actress Geraldine Fitzgerald in a supporting role. It's a pity that other elements of the film don't hold up as well today or even back then as the acting of Davis and Fitzgerald.At it's most basic DARK VICTORY is pure melodrama. Society girl Judith Trahene who spends most of her time riding horses and throwing wild parties is shocked into discovering the true meaning of life when she finds out that she has an incurable brain tumour. At first her doctor George Brent who falls in love with Davis decides not to tell Davis the true extent of her illness after surgery medical ethics are questionable here yet it's a plot device. However Bette finds out and even though she does succumb she dies gracefully having some sort of victory over the dark.As I said earlier Davis and Fitzgerald are magnificent. Fitzgerald gave two great supporting performances in 1939 the other came in WUTHERING HEIGHTS and I believe this lovely Irish lady would have walked away with Oscar she was nominated for the Goldwyn filmhad GONE WITH THE WIND not also premiered that year Hattie McDaniel won the Oscar in a tight race over Olivia de Havilland. Davis believed she deserved the Best Actress Oscar for this film and while she is terrific I feel Vivien Leigh was the rightful choice that year.So let's look at the rest of the film. Brent was a frequent Davis costar and although he lacked good looks and a strong screen personality he seemed to complement her well and he is quite good in his role. Henry Travers appears briefly as Davis' lifelong doctor who sadly cannot help her. Ronald Reagan has a small role as a playboy and he doesn't have to do much except act tipsy. Bogart is terribly miscastactually I think it's the worst Bogart performance I have ever seen though I have not yet caught up with the infamous SWING YOUR LADY or DOCTOR X but do I really want to??. He's the horse trainer Michael and it's hard to believe Bogart could ever be ineffectual or cringeworthy in a film but watch this and find out.As for the technical elements they are indeed wellpolished yet not in the league of other films of that same great year. The script is reasonably strong yet it has a few overly melodramatic moments that probably wouldn't have worked well in 1939 and definitely don't hold up well today.Greatest scene on the film? Fitzgerald and Davis in the garden.".

Judith loves horses and enjoys riding them and performing with them in various horse shows. The trainer of these horses is Michael O'Leary Humphrey Bogart who loves his work and likes Judith because of her love for animals. One day Judith is riding her horse and her vision becomes blurred and she sees double and falls off the horse. It seems Judy is having bad headaches but does not mention it to anyone and her own doctor refers her to a Dr. Frederick Steele George Brent who is a brain surgeon. Ronald Reagan appears in this film as a playboy drunk who is always drinking. Great performance by all the actors but bring the tissue box you will need it.".

	onyx:emotionText "This is definitely a tearjerker involving a young socialite Judith Traherne Betty Davis who is full of life and an only child who gets her own way all the time but is well liked by everyone. Judith loves horses and enjoys riding them and performing with them in various horse shows. The trainer of these horses is Michael O'Leary Humphrey Bogart who loves his work and likes Judith because of her love for animals. One day Judith is riding her horse and her vision becomes blurred and she sees double and falls off the horse. It seems Judy is having bad headaches but does not mention it to anyone and her own doctor refers her to a Dr. Frederick Steele George Brent who is a brain surgeon. Ronald Reagan appears in this film as a playboy drunk who is always drinking. Great performance by all the actors but bring the tissue box you will need it.";

	schema:reviewBody "Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon.Bette Davis gives a virtuoso performance here as Judith Traherne a young rich headstrong woman who has a brain tumor. At first she denies her symptoms the headaches the blurred vision the loss of sensitivity in her right arm the fainting spells but then she is taken to Dr. Frederick Steele George Brent who is about to quit his practice and devote himself to medical research. A wonderfully animated Bette Davis shows us how a young woman might react as she is won over by a man to whom she is becoming increasingly attracted. As he examines her she goes through the stages of reluctance acquiescence attraction and then the headlong fall toward love.Dark Victory is famously known as a threehankies tearjerker and it is that for sure. If you can keep a dry eye through the last reel you need to have your pulse taken. This is a tragedy with a silver lining a human victory over the darkness to come. It is melodramatic with the focus on the utter capriciousness of the tumor that medical science cannot arrest and on what it is like to go from happiness to despair to the depths of depression and then to acceptance and even a since of triumph. Davis takes us on this bumpy ride in a most convincing manner.Humphrey Bogart is the trainer of horses who loves Judith from afar. Geraldine Fitzgerald plays Judy's best friend Ann King. Ronald Reagan has a small part as Alec Hamm a rich drunk. Edmund Goulding directed. He is the auteur of many fine movies from the studio days of Hollywood most notably perhaps The Razor's Edge 1946 and Of Human Bondage 1946. The movie was adapted from the stage play by George Emerson Bremer Jr. and Betram Bloch.Beware of possible spoilers to come. I would like to see the script of that play because I think there is something in this movie that was handled so delicately as to be unrealistic and even unnatural. Although Dr. Steele and Judith declare their undying love for one another we do not see them in a scene involving physical passion. The reason for this may have been because Goulding didn't know what to do about sex and the consequences of sex in a married woman who has but a few months to live. The implication is that their marriage may not have been consummated in the usual sense.Also handled delicatelybut very well I thinkis the relationship between Ann and Dr. Steele. At one point Judith has reason to believe that Ann and Dr. Steele have been intimate but they have not and she comes to realize that although they have grown close because of their mutual love for Judith. Yet at the end Judy makes her friend swear that she will take care of Frederick after she is gone. We in the audience believe that she will and we also believe that that care is bound to blossom into something more.If you want to know how Bette Davis became a great star this movie is a great place to begin. She considered this her favorite role of a lifetime and it is not hard to see why. The part allows for a wide range of emotion. Vivacious energetic Judith is a sympathetic character yet there are places in the story where Davis is able to be the hard mean Bette Davis that we know from other movies and other places where she is as light and frivolous as an airy teen.".

	schema:reviewBody "While I was watching my VHS copy of Dark Victory this afternoon there was a quote from Bette Davis that her role of Judith Traherne was her most personal and that it was 98 of me.It certainly is one of her most moving performances on celluloid. The movie is her show as so many of her Warner Brothers films were becoming at this point in her career. The rest of the cast almost stands back in awe of her.We would call Judith Traherne a trust fund baby these days. Poppa made a fortune and drank himself to death Mom is over in Europe as an expatriate. And she's got a big house on Long Island where she raises steeple chasers and gives a lot of parties. But she's not an airhead. Bette Davis never was in any of her films. She's been having headaches and now blurred vision has been thrown in as a complication. When she crashes one of her horses into a side rail we the audience know right away that there are some serious health issues.Dr. George Brent is called in on the case he's a brain specialist. He operates and it's a success but only in terms of relieving the symptoms. She's got a death sentence hanging over her.The rest of the film is how she deals with it. Only an actress of incredible skill could have brought off the many mood changes that Judith Traherne has. If it wasn't for the fact that 1939 was the Gone With the Wind year Davis might have gotten a third Oscar. She was nominated and lost to Vivien Leigh.Humphrey Bogart was in this as her stable groom with an Irish accent that he was clearly uncomfortable with. My guess was that the brogue was there to emphasize the class distinction between Davis and Bogart. I'm not sure it was all that necessary for him but at least it wasn't as laughable as the Mexican accent in Virginia City.Geraldine Fitzgerald and Ronald Reagan are on hand as her two close friends. I understand that in the novel this is based on Reagan's character is gay. This was the days of the Code so gay was out. Probably in the long run helped Reagan's later career given his politics playing a gay character wouldn't have gotten him entre into his crowd. Still both he and Fitzgerald do very well as a couple of her friends who have a lot more character than most of them.George Brent was Davis's perennial leading man. She was involved with him romantically at some point during her Warner Brothers period I'm not sure if it was during the making of Dark Victory. He was a competent player who Davis could be sure would never upstage her.I did however hear a clip from a radio performance of Dark Victory and George Brent's part was played by Spencer Tracy. Though Brent played in fact in the underplaying style that Tracy was known for I'm sure if Tracy had ever done the film he'd have brought touches to the character that Brent could never have done. What a classic that would have been.Dark Victory is a moving story that never descends into soap opera. This is Bette Davis at her finest.".

The movie is helped by the fine score of Max Steiner.As Judith Treherne Bette Davis shows us why she was a great actress. She does some of her best work in this picture. Her interpretation of the socialite is right on target. Ms. Davis goes from a happy go lucky rich girl into the woman who has to face an imminent death. This film is so enjoyable because of the nuances Ms. Davis brought to the role. Bette Davis' range was enormous.George Brent as the medical specialist who tries to help Judith and falls in love with her in the process is also quite good as Dr. Steele. Geraldine Fitzgerald is wonderful as Ann Judith's loyal friend. Humphrey Bogart appears briefly as the horse trainer. Henry Travers put in a small appearance as the doctor who brought Judith into the world and sadly is not able to help her much. Also in the cast Ronald Reagan who doesn't have much to do.This is the perfect film to watch the wonderful Bette Davis at her best.".

If most of the supporting players can't match her it's no wonder  Bette is truly inspired here! The normally fine Geraldine Fitzgerald seems rather selfconscious in a difficult role and an early one for her and George Brent can't handle the really emotional stuff. But Bogart is stunning in that sexually charged scene with Bette in the stables. Ronnie doesn't have much to do but Virginia Brissac is memorable as Martha and Henry Travers terrific as the old doctor.Above all this is the excellent direction of Edmund Goulding the fine cinematography of Ernest Haller and the great music of Max Steiner. Sure dying in real life is never this beautiful but don't we all wish we could go out with the style that Bette Davis does? Be warned the last 15 minutes of this film are almost torturously moving  but then ALL of Lassie Come Home is. And don't we just love a good cry!".

The movie is beautiful and has several great supporting performances. Including Ronald Reagan as a great drunk Geraldine Fitzgerald and Bogie. The wonderful story flows and when you mix in Bette's great work this movie shines. The beginning of the movie details young Judith's status as a socialite perfectly you don't hate her like you could by today's standards. Then the dramatic diagnosis and medical drama leads directly into the healing of body and soul. The love story and friendships are portrayed to perfection. Bogie even becomes lovable which shows how Judith as changed since falling in love. I would recommend this movie to everyone.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bette Davis always cited this as her favourite role it is probably on a par with Margo Channing in ALL ABOUT EVE as the part which fans identify with as definitive Davis. Naturally this 1939 film will look a little musty corny and cliched to modern day viewers but the poignant sincerity in which Davis instilled via her magnificent performance still has the ability to leave the viewer in helpless tears you can be dumbfounded to think that something so obviously aimed at your tear ducts could succeed to induce the flow so completely and spontaneously!  The role is based upon a 1934 play in which Tallulah Bankhead flopped.  The character of Ann King was written especially for the film by director Edmund Goulding as a kind of Greek Chorus so Judith wouldn't have to complain about the inevitable. Geraldine Fitzgerald in her American film debut does a wondrous job with the part of Ann a beautifully etched supporting performance.  As Michael O'Leary Humphrey Bogart is unfortunately inept in the Irish brogue department why couldn't they have simply cut out the accent? and George Brent is adequately wooden as Dr. Frederick Steele whom Judy marries.  Davis slams through a gooey collection of cliches in her nerviest style during the early segments but her metamorphasis into a vibrantly humbled married woman is quite a striking contrast to the selfishly brazen spoiled heiress truly a multifaceted performance.  Ronald Reagan gets to play Alec one of Judy's drunken swains and Cora Witherspoon is memorable as the snotty Carrie.  The last twenty minutes of the film are expertly crafted and timelessly tearjerking the movie sold more kleenex than any other of its day.".

	schema:headline " A Woman Determined To Live and Die On Her Own Terms";
	schema:reviewBody "Bette Davis may have had several roles that the public identify with her more than Judith Traherne. But Judith's plight is actually the most tragic of all of them. Judith is young attractive lively and rich. But she's suffering from a brain tumor.A line of dialog at the start of the film made me wonder how really uptodate the screenplay was. Dr. Frederick Steel George Brent is a society surgeon with a great practice but he is about to leave New York City for his farmlaboratory in Vermont to do research into cells particularly those that turn deadly as in cancer cells and tumors. He is telling a visitor about a recent patient of his  a promising composer who had started working on a new composition just before Steel performed brain surgery. As he says very sadly the operation was a success but the patient died. In 1939 Americans would have picked up on that particular line. A year earlier America's leading popular composer George Gershwin was diagnosed with a brain tumor and had a well reported operation in Los Angeles California. He survived about a week. Dr. Steel is approached by a colleague Dr. Parsons Harry Travers regarding Ms Traherne. Besides being a family friend and the doctor who brought her into the world Parsons was one of a dozen witnesses the previous week when Judith took a spill on one of her champion horses. She has been complaining but dismissing a series of headaches. Steel agrees to see Traherne who is sitting outside with her friend and secretary Ann King Geraldine Fitzgerald. Traherne is friendly but again dismissive of the problem of the headaches. Steel is keen eyed enough to see that Judith is having problems focusing her eyes and reacts badly to sunlight she's squinting too much and she is burning her fingers due to accidents while lighting her cigarettes. Steel drops his plans to go to Vermont in order to take care of Judith.There is an operation and it is an apparent success. In the meantime Judith and Frederick begin finding each other rather pleasant company and a romance begins. Judith resumes her social activities with her equestrian shows involving her horse trainer Michael O'Leary Humphrey Bogart and her social set involving her male pal Alec Hamm Ronald Reagan. But she is soon aware of Frederick and Ann spending too much time together and while first thinking the obvious she soon comes across a medical report from some expert that Frederick uses on his serious cases. She confronts them at a restaurant with the knowledge that she is fully aware that while the operation was a temporary success the tumor cells are reemerging.After a period where Judith tries to forget the coming disaster with Alec and her chums she finds little solace there. Her best adviser at this point is Michael who tells her she should try to find as much happiness for her remaining days as she can. The irony for Michael of course is that he always has loved Judith but he can't compete with Frederick. Nor can Alec who later confesses as much to FrederickRonald Reagan later explained that Edmund Goulding told him to play Alec as an alcoholic homosexual. This was a bit beyond what Reagan liked to be seen as so he did not go as far out as Goulding wanted him to do. Yet to be fair Alec's behavior as Judith's closest male confidante comes close to what Goulding suggested. Besides one can make a similarly negative comment about Bogart's use of an Irish accent but for the purposes of the film it's fine.SPOILER COMING UPFrederick and Judith get married and we see her doing everything in her power to be as loving and close a wife as she can while Frederick is trying to live for her each day without thinking of the inevitable. They do leave the New York City and Long Island Social Set for Vermont and she does help him set up his lab and with Ann along as secretary sets up his professional lecture and conference appointments. It seems to be working but then comes the last fifteen minutes of the film.Frederick has a conference out of state and has to catch a train. Judith has been helping him pack but while out in her garden with Ann she is aware that she is seeing less and less. Ann becomes aware of this too but Judith tells her not to say a word  they both know that it is the sign of the last minutes of her life. They go through a careful pantomime where Judith acts as though nothing is amiss and Frederick is unaware that the end is approaching as he leaves. With the help of Ann and her servant Carrie Cora Witherspoon Judith gets up stairs to lie down on her bed and die with dignity.I can only add that my description of the last twenty minutes does not do close to full justice to how Davis and Fitzgerald handle that last portion of the film. DARK VICTORY happens to be one of those women's pictures that really work. The subject for a change is dramatic but realistic. While sex triangles and unhappy marriages and alcoholism are parts of life most of us relate to the fragility of life and how it can all come crashing down due to our physical construction. It's bad enough for the bulk of us but when like Traherne you have one of the best of life styles it is agonizing. Unlike so many of these socalled women's pictures DARK VICTORY is one that men find as fascinating to watch as women.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can just picture theater patrons leaving this movie during it's original release not a dry eye in the house an endearing testimony to the strength of Bette Davis' portrayal of the young snooty socialite turned human over the course of the story. As Miss Judith Traherne Davis exhibits a wide range of emotion in her role helping establish her reputation as one of film's finest actresses.Along the way Davis is supported by an unusually strong contingent of Warner contract players most notably George Brent as the doctor turned husband Frederick Steele. Established in a highly successful surgical career Steele is continuously frustrated in his attempt to semiretire to a life of research at his Vermont farm. Miss Judith is just his latest diversion one that his professional reputation and personal responsibility will not allow to go without helping. During his association with Judith he manages to fall in love while creating the same intense and wonderful feelings in her. Where his nobility fails is in his attempt to keep Judith's true condition secret from her in collaboration with Judith's best friend Miss Ann Geraldine Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald's performance in it's own way is almost as touching as Davis' own as the loyal friend and confidante who must watch her best friend slowly fade toward an unhappy ending.Ronald Reagan appears a number of times throughout the film as a member of Davis' social circle and whether by design or not he never appears sober. Henry Travers the diligent wing earning angel from It's a Wonderful Life appears as Miss Judith's family physician in a subdued role. And to be completely honest my original interest in this film was in completing my collection of Humphrey Bogart movies here he has minimal screen time as a horse trainer with an eye for Miss Judith who realizes that his station would never allow for such a match up. It's interesting to see Bogey near the end of the film in the obligatory trench coat for which he's well known.The film's ending is powerful and given added poignancy as Miss Judith plants a flower bulb after sending her husband off to an important medical gathering. With Judith's vision dimming Miss Ann cannot contain her tears and is sent off by Miss Judith as well to remember happier times. As Judith stumbles up the stairs to her bedroom the maid symbolically draws the curtain against the sunlight while Judith says a final prayer and it's over. Commence tears.To date my viewing of Bette Davis films have been limited to her collaborations with Humphrey Bogart but that's a total of six films more than any other pairing with my favorite actor. Edward G. Robinson appeared with Bogey in five films and one of them Kid Galahad also featured Bette Davis once again in a role showing many facets of her ability. Intrigued as I am with her performance in Dark Victory I'll be looking forward to more of her films.".

As Judith she finds out that at the ripe age of 23 and at a very inconvenient time in her social calendar that she has a fatal brain tumor.  George Brent plays the doctor who diagnoses her and of course her love interest.  Members of a fine supporting cast include a very young Humphrey Bogart Geraldine Fitzgerald and Ronald Reagan.  Who hilariously plays a social playboyboozehound.This film is definitely a classic and is a fun one to watch  it's worth it just to watch the scene in the restaurant when Bette orders a Prognosis Negative' after she finds out that she is dying.  Dark Victory is yet another piece of evidence that 1939 was the golden year of cinema. Shel".

Who hilariously plays a social playboyboozehound.This film is definitely a classic and is a fun one to watch  it's worth it just to watch the scene in the restaurant when Bette orders a Prognosis Negative' after she finds out that she is dying.  Dark Victory is yet another piece of evidence that 1939 was the golden year of cinema. Shel";

At first she is strong and forthright the way we all remember her but then when she faces death turns very compassionate for others. She doesn't dwell on anything she lives every moment as if it was her last. You will see Humphrey Bogart in a supporting role as a horse trainer. Bette plays a 23 yr. old whose father died and mother lives far away and is never around. She lives it up with huge parties and going everywhere. She doesn't worry about anything and let's things wait to happen in years ahead. That all changes with a blink when she enjoys everything and does things she was putting to the side like love. With all that she experiences things she wishes she only had done before. The bottom line  she falls in love and experiences the real meaning of happiness to simply enjoy life. You'll love her performance and the others in the cast too because they all have a place there not just there like in other films for no reason. Dark Victory makes all of us want to triumph over life and this film.".

Although having an unpleasant theme the message is beautiful and never corny. Bette Davis is amazing in the lead role very well supported by Geraldine Fitzgerald and George Brent. Humphrey Bogart in beginning of career in the role of a horse whisperer and the ham actor Ronald Reagan in the role of a playboy have a minor participation. Warner do Brasil only recently released this DVD in Brazil in a Box with three other excellent movies of Bette Davies. Unfortunately the Brazilian DVD has a great error in Chapter 18 the subtitles of the lyric of the song Time for Tenderness have the word  confirmar meaning to confirm on each line. I believe that who translated the song wanted to confirm the translation and sent the draft without deleting the markings to the DVD authoring. My vote is nine.Title Brazil Vitria Amarga Bitter Victory".

I knew only that I was deeply touched by Ms. Davis'. character and her heroic struggle to enjoy her last days in the face of great adversity.

	schema:headline " Argentina under the military";
	schema:reviewBody "In 1976 the Argentine military overthrew the constitutional government and took power on the grounds that the country was descending into chaos. The regime targeted even moderate progressives and contemplated the assassination of all subversives with any capacity for leadership including high school students demonstrating for reduced bus fares. There was systematic use of torture for obtaining information and disappearance of victims so relatives would never know their fate the word desaparecido disappeared acquired a new and sinister meaning.In 1977 a group of mothers with disappeared sonsdaughters began to demonstrate in front of the presidential palace in Buenos Aires and they became known as Las Madres de Plaza de Mayo the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo. In spite of the regime's efforts including death threats and violence to suppress them the Mothers pushed for information on the whereabouts of their children. Although they were initially ignored or ridiculed their efforts eventually highlighted to the country and the world the human rights violations occurring in Argentina. European governments to date strangely tolerant of the regime had to take note and the US that had supported the coup from its inception began to look discreetly for cover.La Amiga The Friend begins in 1978. Mara and Pancho Liv Ullmann and Federico Luppi are a happily married couple living in a workingmiddle class suburb of Buenos Aires. Their eldest son is one of the disappeared. Maria's relentless search for her son makes her a target of the regime especially when she joins the Mothers. Raquel an actress has been Mara's friend since early childhood. and she also becomes a target in a different way she is Jewish and her choice roles such as Antigone displease the dictatorship. The movie ends in 1986. After the military regime imploded in 1983 democracy returned to Argentina but the military intimated that any attempt to investigate their crimes would be answered with a new coup which induced President Alfonsn to pass an infamous due obedience law that exonerated all but those at the very top. This was completed by President Menem with an general amnesty. The movie was released in 1988 and its last sequences reflect this the menace of a new military coup is in everybody's mind and puts a damper on efforts to clarify the fate of the disappeared. This is shown in a moving scene where Mara recognizes one of her son's abductors in a restaurant.Now to the movie's specifics. Liv Ullman plays Mara dubbed in Spanish. I am not a fan of dubbing but in this case is of such quality that Ullman's face and body language combined with the voice of Argentinian actress Barbara Mujica merge into an outstanding performance. The rest of the cast Argentines Federico Luppi Cipe Lincovsky and Victor Laplace is at the same level. Dialogs by Argentine writer Osvaldo Bayer are faithful to the local brand of Spanish spoken in Buenos Aires and environs. Director Jeanine Meerapfel born in Argentina from German Jewish parents refugees from Hitler's Germany does an outstanding job overall.Although not germane to the movie here is what happened in Argentina after 1988. President Kirchner who took power in 2003 finally called the military's bluff derogated amnesty laws and initiated mass trials of figures of the 19761983 regime. The military were cut down to size and publicly humiliated and some of the worst violators ended their lives in prison. Thanks to Kirchner Argentines were finally rid of the military menace one hopes for good.".

From a biased perspective I want to give this movie a 10 however I feel I need to be fair to the majority.As far as Alan Rickman he as always shines. If you are a fan of Alan Rickman see this movie. He simply does not disappoint EVER in my opinion. He is one of those rare people who is just odd enough to always be interesting..coughs...and sexy... It has been argued that Rickman can be melodramatic which is kind of an oxymoron being that he is an actor however in this case the script was poorly written. Sadly Rickman was left with very cheesy lines which come across melodramatic so sorry! If you are 14 year old and going through puberty it might mesmerize you....might.As far as the rest of the movie I felt isolated from every character. I cannot quite pinpoint why this is. Was this the intention of the director? Somehow I think not...good excuse for him though. The movie seemed too short and inconclusive. It just kind of ended like never quite reaching climax while making love. Again was this the directors intention? Doubt it. The editing was very odd and choppy. It felt like I was watching a very long trailer there was just something missing.Also as mentioned by others it is hard to hear some of Rickman's dialogue. I do not find this a flaw because it illustrates Mesmer's character and personality...however turn your volume very high.If you are a fan of period films andor Rickman watch the eye candy. Otherwise you may be disappointed.".

Our hindsight perspective is 100 but in the days of leeching and bleeding to cure peoples' ills the fact that he showed patients great attention and compassion was certainly a change.  Mad people were usually penned up in Bedlam or some other horrid pigsty.  Here he is attempting bravely to take another tact in the unknown mysteries of mental illness. This movie also gives the scamlike aspects of his personality as he beguiles the royal courtiers with his water therapies touching them and arousing them thus giving the semblance of 'healing'.  I was reminded of the oldtime revivals and the sexy preachers coming close putting handson the afflicted and shouting 'heal' and 'Hallelujah sistuh'.  Of course if you're a repressed 'respectable woman' this is the only intimate way you can let a man not your husband touch you. His shrew of a wife and utterly spiritually retarded stepson is beautifully played.  I also like any movie that shows parts of the world I haven't seen and this one gives us Vienna parts of France and the costumes of 18th Century European civilization.  It is NOT your everyday movie!!!!  I would suggest viewing this one in series with biopics of Sigmund Freud and some of the other fighters of mental illness.  Rickman is indeed magnetic in this one.".

The costumes of the period ARE worth seeing and by watching the way mental illness was handled in that day one comes away thankful the same conditions do not exist now.

Unfortunately it went a bit wrong somewhere down the line and as others have pointed out it is quite hard to define where.For me the two main players of the cast did a great job. Rickman presented Mesmer as charming but complex Ooms brought plenty of emotion to her role as the blind pianist. Beyond this however there seemed little character development not helped by the relatively short runtime.The plot just seemed...well...dull. There was very little feeling of direction and most of the scenes were very static affairs. There also seemed to be lots of duplication of material as Mesmer treated numerous people in what looked like very similar ways. Occasional slapstick moments one in particular involving a certain throat complaint coming at the end of one of the most absorbing scenes in the movie somewhat destroyed the tone. Another was a brief appearance of a very caricatured Marie Antoinette. Both seemed rather out of place and had the effect of pushing the extraordinary events of the story into absurdity.Watch this film for the cast alone. As for the plot if you know a little about Mesmer before watching you may find it more absorbing but for a novice like me there seemed very little substance beneath that beautiful period setting.".

As for me if the creators had been able to decide what they wanted to tell us from Mesmer's story if it were a bit more wellpaced and the script better elaborated on it could be a good film.I had heard a lot of criticism about it before claiming Alan Rickman was the only good thing in it. Yes of course Alan Rickman is mesmerizing but although I am a fan I don't think either he could save the whole film or he was the sole good thing in it. To give the movie a bit more credit I think Amanda Ooms was also excellent in her portrayal of the blind patient  and as there is much more to her character than just that I think the basic idea of the story is excellent  if only it had been explored and elaborated on more subtly.In addition Alan's performance can be seen just as uneven as the storytelling although I'm sure it is the screenwriter and the director's fault. The fragmented sketches of sometimes seemingly random occurrences of Mesmer's life and career left Alan Rickman with not much space for a coherent performance. Still he does his best in every shot and his versatility shines through. I love the amplitude of the energy and the restraint he can display I just love this in an actor! He is able to express the extremes without being overthetop this is firstclass. Though I know he doesn't need a pat on the shoulder from me I'm just fascinated by his acting . All in all I think the film as a whole is better than I expected though it misses a real point and the performances are worth seeing not to mention the beautiful cinematography and the landscape both Hungarian so I might be seen as biased but I'm sure I'm not .".

Still he does his best in every shot and his versatility shines through. I love the amplitude of the energy and the restraint he can display I just love this in an actor! He is able to express the extremes without being overthetop this is firstclass. Though I know he doesn't need a pat on the shoulder from me I'm just fascinated by his acting . All in all I think the film as a whole is better than I expected though it misses a real point and the performances are worth seeing not to mention the beautiful cinematography and the landscape both Hungarian so I might be seen as biased but I'm sure I'm not .";

It kind of makes you feel for all of the people who have disabilities in the movie instead of looking upon them as if they are inhuman you don't have pity on them but rather you have hope FOR them it's quite an eyeopener actually. Rickman does mumble a lot so be sure to turn up the sound but you couldn't have achieved the same mood if he would have spoke aloud. I suggest if you are a fan of romance films or even Franz Anton Mesmer and his works with Animal Magnetism then go out and get a copy. You may be a little lost when it comes to what animal magnetism but don't be lazy just read up a bit and the movie will be all the more clearer for you.

	schema:reviewBody "I don't quite know what to say about The Breed. It has a serviceable plot compromised by an alternate reality setting. The plot is straightforward enough  vampires and humans attempting to peacefully coexist and a series of murders which may be either a rogue vampire or a more sinister political plot to derail the process. The players are all decent OK perhaps Adrian Paul lays it on a little thick and there are sufficient twists and turns to provide some sense of mystery andor suspense. To its credit the characters are well developed and you actually come to care about some of them. It even features a surprisingly engaging romance subplot. How much you can enjoy it though depends on how you react to the setting.The setting appears to be an alternate reality version of currentday America. Some scenes confuse the issue by suggesting a European setting but that doesn't explain the presence of an obviously American black detective. The vibe is strongly influenced by Orwell's 1984. Although references are made to historical events such as race relations in the 60's WWII Nazis and the Holocaust the sense of reality is severely compromised by the setting. TVs all appear to be BW sets from the 50's and automotive design seems to have stopped evolving in the 40's. Stylistically it's quite similar to Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow  and that's not a compliment in this case since it's obviously not supposed to be a period piece as Sky Captain was. The scenes inside NSA headquarters especially were highly reminiscent of both the 1984 film adaptation of 1984 as well as several Twilight Zone episodes.I should also add that I have only seen an edited for TV version broadcast on the SciFi channel. Some other reviews here suggest that the unedited version has some plot problems unrelated to the editing process.Did I enjoy it? Not tremendously although I did have a grudging appreciation for the audacity of how it was handled. Notably it presents an interesting and unique version of the entire vampire mythos. Would I recommend it? Not necessarily. As I said I feel somewhat conflicted about it. I rated it 6 out of 10 and have tried to explain that vote as much as possible.

Bokeem Whassisface plays a good cop and one look at the special effects shows you were the rest of the budget went.

The script by Christos N. Gage  Ruth Fletcher is the real problem here. Too many things just didn't work for me for a start could a high ranking scientist create a virus that has the potential to wipe out the entire human race without a SINGLE person questioning him or finding out? I mean the guy is even using the 'Nation Security Agency' laboratories for Christ's sake! Considering the Vampire race has been around for 1000's of years it seemed strange that there was only 4000 throughout the entire world  that they had never been noticed before. The central relationship between Grant the human  Gray the Vampire was clichd  really cheesy I mean at first they don't don't get on  seem mismatched but by the end they are best of friends  have saved each other's lives we've seen it all before  done a lot better. The whole story is predictable  I can't believe it took Gray over half the film to figure out the painfully obvious. The whole concept just didn't work as far as I'm concerned  the film spent a good 30 minutes explaining it's own set of Vampire 'rules' as Grant would ask a question like how to kill a Vampire  Gray would tell him thus making sure we the viewer that is know as well. The breed also makes a few feeble attempts to say things about racism trust  acceptance you know all the clichd things one would expect.Director Oblowitz thinks he's making a cross between The Matrix 1999 Lethal Weapon 1987  Vampires 1998 well noone told him that you need a budget to pull that off. He films the fight scenes with people 'flying' through the air plus shooting  reloading their guns in a 'cool' way but they come off as looking ridiculous. He films everything with bleached out colours  a greenish tint. As for the films supposed style you need to do a bit more than tilt the camera shine a few neon lights  have some mist swirling in every shot. The gore is none existent one neck biting a couple of slit throats a few gunshot wounds  someone explodes CGI style at the end  it looks terrible.With a really low budget of about 400000 it shows. The Breed has reasonable production values but it looks cheap throughout  you can tell it was shot in Europe in this case Hungary. Even though it is meant to be set in the future the cars clothes  the like suggest otherwise. I found the acting awful whats with the gay moustache Paul? Woodbine gives a terrible performance  just wasn't right for the role at all. Ling Bai is quite sexy looking whenever she appears.I was disappointed by The Breed it's one of those films that make a fantastic trailer when they show ALL the cool bits in the space of two  a half minutes set against some techno music. Unfortunately there's another eighty seven  a half minutes to sit through if you decide to watch it. Personally I didn't think much of it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Quite frankly anyone BUT Bookeem Woodbine would have been fine in this role but his portrayal as Steve Grant left me more than a bit cold. His character is a onedimensional whining cardboardcutout wannabe gangsta and he honestly just does not cut it as Grant which was a serious detriment to this film as Grant's was a key role. And what was WITH those short tiny ties?! Was he wearing a kid's tie?Additionally Adrian Paul as Aaron Gray here was reminiscent of a young uptight Gomez Addams lookalike. There was nothing wrong with his performance but his costumer should definitely have gone in another direction with his wardrobe. The pencildrawnlooking mustache did not help and neither did the liberal abuse of hair goo. All these elements contributed a certain air of detachment between the audience and his character which seriously brought down the film. His character was one of those principle characters which needed to enjoy a connection with the audience in order for this film to work. However Ling Bai's performance was very compelling provocative and professional here. You may remember her as Miss East from Wild Wild West. Other than that this was a rather entertaining venture into the future of the vampyric race in spite of the vastly missed potential. There are certain rules one must follow when in production of a vampire film. Some argue that these rules were created by Universal Studios when they filmed the old 30's 40's and 50's black and white horrors. Others say these rules come from the legends themselves. Whichever the case this movie does not seem to be aware of the vampire rules.The effects were less than they could have been but were otherwise passable. The flashbacks however were just annoying and the visuals lacked in creativity. The musical score was strong and contributed a nice suspense to the production and moved between action and suspense quite well even if it was overly techno at times. There are some good elements but they seem totally unconnected and even accidental. There is little flow and less continuity. Yet the good elements are enough to keep you watching to the end which is satisfying. Unfortunately it's also satisfying that it IS the end.It rates a 4.210 from...the Fiend .".

Just about EVERYTHING in this movie was stolen from something else. Of what threadbare plot existed in this movie I gathered that there was a small existence of good vampires who team up with humans to extinguish rebellious vampires. The good vampires live on a synthetic substitute to human blood while the rebellious ones go around murdering humans by drinking their blood.Bokeem Woodbine one of the worst actors to ever grace our television AND movie screens is the human cop teamed up with Adrian Paul of HIGHLANDER fame the good vampire sent on a mission to track down an evil vampire who is kidnapping young women and killing them. The setting is in some sort of weird postNazi Poland yet most of the people have American accents where the fashions and vehicles resemble that of 1941 yet pop culture of today has been blended in to give it that 'unique' flavor ie. references to 'James Bond' the existence of a hardcore nightclub leatherdominatrix outfits etc. Can someone say TITUS you know that forgettable and noisy artsy trash starring Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange?Woodbine spends most of his time running around saying the 'F' word as many times as he can while Paul just looks bored standing around with too much powder on his face and a glazed expression on his face delivering every line with a deadpan approach it gets very tiresome after awhile. It is the old cliched scenario of pairing up two unlikely cops one the brazen hero the other straightlaced and bythebooks. Except this time unlike films such as BEVERLY HILLS COP and LETHAL WEAPON the formula does NOT work. They even drag in Bai Ling who looks absolutely ridiculous as an ancient Asian vampiress who spends most of her time onscreen donning ludicrous outfits check out the leather headpiece bad makeup yellow eye contacts and an almost undecipherable accent that would make even Stevie Wonder ask Could you say that again please? If you thought those cliches weren't bad enough check out the cardboard cutout characters including the obvious villain the obligatory Asian male with platinum blonde hair the little boy whose life is saved by Woodbine in a climatic scene... I could go on but I have other things to gripe about.I could get past the bad acting and the nonexistent script but... okay maybe I can't. The sets were awful the usual rundown derelict building with lots of smoke and fog minimal scenery involving a graveyard shot or 'people running through the forest while being chased by men with guns' visual. NOTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS ORIGINAL! I can't emphasize this enough! The most embarrassing scenes was seeing Adrian Paul flying around through the air 'MATRIXstyle' wielding a tommy gun in slow motion as he fires at the bad guys yet you can see the 'pullstrings' that suspend him through the air it is too hilarious for words! When the director wants to make the action scenes 'dramatic' he thinks he can fool the audience by filming everything in slowmotion while adding an 'echo' to nearly every word spoken in the dialogue  it just boggles my mind as to why amateurish garbage such as this still gets financed in today's economy.I have no idea if this movie is based on a book comic strip legend or what nor do I care. I just pray to God that there isn't a sequel and if there is then PLEASE do not release it 'straighttocable'. It should go straight into the trash can where this movie rightfully belongs.My Grade  'Z minus'".

OK it wasn't the best acting I've seen especially by Adrian Paul but then he was playing a Polish Jew in a rather wooden performance  I mean aren't all vampires sexy?  Anyway I loved the location Budapest Hungary and the eerie feel to the movie.  I loved the story line of a human and vampire cop seeking out a vampire criminal reminds me of Forever Knight. I thought Bai Ling played a beautiful vampire she had it down pat not to mention her beautiful black panther. Loved the scene in the Pravda disco would have liked more of that. Sexy vampires with fangs not turning into monsters is very appealing.  I would like to see more of these characters.  The black cop was cool too loved his turn to the vampire side of life. Cool movie 810".

Anyway I loved the location Budapest Hungary and the eerie feel to the movie.  I loved the story line of a human and vampire cop seeking out a vampire criminal reminds me of Forever Knight. I thought Bai Ling played a beautiful vampire she had it down pat not to mention her beautiful black panther. Loved the scene in the Pravda disco would have liked more of that. Sexy vampires with fangs not turning into monsters is very appealing.  I would like to see more of these characters.  The black cop was cool too loved his turn to the vampire side of life. Cool movie 810";

It's really quite impressive considering the budget. Some of Adrian Paul Bai Ling and Woodbine's finest work and they really carry the film. Adrian Paul plays a more stern aloof yet compassionate vampire cop that has elements of his Highlander TV series role......a smooth badass with a lot of style. For Woodbine this is my favorite role of his since Freeway. He's solid and you just have to love that gravelly voice. As for Bai Ling...I think this was her best role since The Crow....she's cast perfectly as a beautiful tragic yet sexy vampire who you can really empathize with. I was just so impressed with the production given the budget. Approach the film with an open mind and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.".

And I did love the fact that they used BudaPesth as their setting...The club was also cool and slightly more fetishy than other vampire movies like Blade...The dynamic between vamp cop and meat cop was quite good still the same people from opposite sides aiming for the same goal while not quite trusting each other thing but it made for some passable character development. And did I mention the supersharp 40sstyle suit that the vamp cop gets to wear? Like I said the costumes were gorgeous and well put together. The dialogue was a scream but I'm sure it wasn't meant to be. Cut the Anne Rice act! From the lips of a vampire girl who I'm sure I've seen in gaming books in fact most of the main vamp characters seem to be based in the Masquerade vampstyle running from fetish cyberpunk to nosferatu. The random acts of vampire motion were misplaced too. Stopping during a chase and twitching madly may look cool but most viewers are going to be wondering WTF is going on. And the actor vamp is just the funniest thing alive...Or not quite so as the case may be. And the handgrenade made me laugh but that may just be my sense of humour.".

Unfortunately Ling Bai has zero chemistry with Woodbine although that's probably not her fault as nobody seems to. Disappointingly her beauty gets buried under enough mascara to embarrass Alice Cooper.Director Michael Oblowitz demonstrates a flair for tense shootouts.

A doctor named Fleming talks of James Bond and Blofeld and other characters are named no kidding Lucy Westernra Cross Orlock Gray Seward and Bathory. If that isn't enough fbombs drop everywhere.Needless to say writers are answerable to directors directors report to producers and actors sometimes insist on improvising.

Any film fanstudentmaker knows that the best way to set a film in the future on a limited budget without it looking incredibly dated within 5 years is to make the sets and costumes slightly ambiguous. I loved the blend of old cars with digital ID cards and transparent computer screens a la Minority Report.I thought the cinematography was really interesting too lots of interesting camera angles and slomo.

	schema:reviewBody "I freely acknowledge that this movie was total and utter crap. However I found myself watching it again and again. That could be explained away by the presence of Adrian Paul who looked sexy as hell with fangs. His delivery was a bit stiff but it still worked. My only beef with his character was the way we were led by the nose regarding his history. It does make sense for characters to bring up the Nazis being that the vampires were a minority fearful of persecution but the continued references were used more as a Neon sign pointing to Gray's Jewish heritage and the death of his loved ones because of it. The plot was all right good twists and turns but the dialogue was Rock Bottom. I was reminded of comedy scenes wherein two people are carrying on two distinct conversations with each other because they're so wrapped up in themselves they aren't paying attention to what the other person is saying. Here is an exampleWhere is headquarters Transylvania?You should be in movies Mr. Grant.How did that compute? It felt like there were chunks of conversations lifted out between lines and there may well have been. I really wish that Bokeem Woodbine had not spent the movie doing an impersonation of a pulpnovel gumshoe but I enjoyed the cameo by Reed Diamond and I thought Ling Bai did a good job. I like her accent I thought it fit well with the character and the overall atmosphere of the film. Just recast Steven Grant rewrite the dialogue so the characters have actual giveandtake conversations cut down on the use of the smoke machine and...well it would still be crap  But it would be in a better class of crap.".

	onyx:emotionText "I freely acknowledge that this movie was total and utter crap. However I found myself watching it again and again. That could be explained away by the presence of Adrian Paul who looked sexy as hell with fangs. His delivery was a bit stiff but it still worked. My only beef with his character was the way we were led by the nose regarding his history. It does make sense for characters to bring up the Nazis being that the vampires were a minority fearful of persecution but the continued references were used more as a Neon sign pointing to Gray's Jewish heritage and the death of his loved ones because of it. The plot was all right good twists and turns but the dialogue was Rock Bottom. I was reminded of comedy scenes wherein two people are carrying on two distinct conversations with each other because they're so wrapped up in themselves they aren't paying attention to what the other person is saying. Here is an exampleWhere is headquarters Transylvania?You should be in movies Mr. Grant.How did that compute? It felt like there were chunks of conversations lifted out between lines and there may well have been. I really wish that Bokeem Woodbine had not spent the movie doing an impersonation of a pulpnovel gumshoe but I enjoyed the cameo by Reed Diamond and I thought Ling Bai did a good job. I like her accent I thought it fit well with the character and the overall atmosphere of the film. Just recast Steven Grant rewrite the dialogue so the characters have actual giveandtake conversations cut down on the use of the smoke machine and...well it would still be crap  But it would be in a better class of crap.";

Of course not all vampires want this and some think it's suicide.  So a renegade vampire starts killing innocents to scare the human population and ruin any coexistence.  Human cop Grant and vampire cop Gray join forces and the hunt begins.  I couldn't believe the acting in this.  Adrien Paul has played the same role for so long that I can't identify him as any other character. I speak of the Highlander of course.  Paul even has Highlanderlike flashbacks to Nazioccupied Germany in the film.  It's also weird seeing someone who has been a decent actor in the past be flatout bad in this.  It may have been the dialogue but I didn't believe one word that came out of Bokeem Woodbine's mouth.  It just didn't feel natural for him to be saying things like vampires! and you're shing me big time.  Costars include Bai Ling The Crow William Hootkins Star Wars and Zen Gesner Legend of the Phantom Rider.  This is a capable cast so I was very surprised at how terrible the acting was.  Actually the whole movie is terrible...and boring.  Skip it.Note to genre buffs Many of the character names are taken from other vampire movies both characters and actors.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first half hour of this movie is really promising. The music is very good and one of the most intense moments I have ever seen is when the Policeman talks to Laura about the death of her family. The actors are doing well and the camera is professional. Begin spoilerA student girl from upper class in Germany Lara left alone by her parents for a longer time learns that her parents and her little sister died in an accident in Romania during a socalled business trip. After that the father describes offscreen that he is the key figure in bringing masses of meat infested with a terrible disease  something like mad cow disease  to Romania as aid deliveries. Lara decides to drive to Romania with some student friends of her where she sees the bodies of her family at the morgue. No further information about the accident is given to her so she investigates by herself with the help of a mysterious Romanian biker girl Nikita. She follows her to the place where the accident happened and learns that there was no accident but her family was killed by someone. One of her friends Alice is hurt by something in the woods and they follow Nikita to her nearby home where Nikita's angry and armed Brother Milan shows them that he and his sister helped to spread the poisoned meat between children of the street and other poor people and now the two are trying to steal it back. Lara doesn't believe him and eats one little peace of the flesh and wants to leave but she has to vomit and she passes out with a vision of her dead sister. After waking up she decides to leave.At this point about after half an hour the horror begins.  End Spoiler And it is not only horror as a movie genre it is horror for the watcher. I understand that it is the most easy and cheapest way to make a horror movie out of the given premises and I understand that directors and authors have artistic freedom what to do with the money and their skills.In this case the money and the skills are wasted. If the movie would have taken a different direction it would have been not so easy to fill the next hour. Instead we have a classical slasher movie with blood and gore and hide and seek and fear and cry. If you have seen one you have seen all. The only invention here is the first half hour and it could be longer because the characters especially Laras friends are not really introduced in fact they are not introduced because someone thought there is no need for. This could really have been a remarkable movie about the lies of our clean society and how we earn dirty cash even when we seemingly are helping others.Just show a few scenes where Lara's father is officially honored for his activities he says a few hypocritical words to the public applause applause and later he gets the big check for his institute from the minister. Show that he knows from the first minute what he is doing. If you want to be inventive and spare an actors salary hide him from the watcher and make all his scenes offscreen even when he is at home.Show how his position in his family or in his daughter's mind changes when the disease begins to evolve. Show how he tries to hide what he has done. And show how he fails and is killed by a bunch of his victims. That fills also a movie certainly not a forgettable slasher movie but something that lasts in our memory. The movie gives all premises for that otherwise I would not write so much about but does not follow them. This shows a major lack of ideas and I hope the author who is also the director will only direct in the future because this is what he can do very well. Elaborating a plot is not his thing.For the first half hour I give the movie 9 of 10 and for the rest 1. The camera and the actors are good for 2 additional points so there's a five at the end.A great great pity ! I would be happy if there could be a way to remake it even with the same director and team but with a better author like me ".

	schema:reviewBody "Bukarest Fleisch is a German television film from 2007 so it will have its 10th anniversary next year. The writer and director was Andy Fetscher and this is his first long movie. He was still in his 20s here and worked on short films before including a project named Bukarest Fisch. But back to this one here. The main character is played by Friederike Kempter and she is also the only cast member that you could call close to famous because of her work in Oh Boy and the Tatort series Mnster. But this is an entirely different genre. It starts off as a thriller but quickly turns too horror which is also when this movie gets considerably worse. Quite a shame actually as the premise about a young woman traveling to Romania to find out what exactly happened to her family could have been turned into a tense and edgeofseat thriller.But it turned out no such thing. It's probably still an okay outcome for a filmmaker of Fetscher's age but by general standards it does not hold up and the quality is not good enough. This is possibly due to the film always stuck between gore and thriller and the result is that it does not really elaborate convincingly in any of the two areas. I think the acting here was not really the problem. Yes there was a hammy scene here and there but I think Kepter and Iacob did a good job overall especially Kempter. Also sexuality plays a role here. One of them is for men who like blondes one for those who prefer brunettes. I am certainly more of the latter but I cannot deny that I really adored Kempter's looks here. She was completely stunning and it helps the film from the visual side that she is in almost every scene. The lesbian action at the end came out of nowhere and felt so random but I still have to say thank you for it. But this scene alone is not enough to check out the entire film for almost 90 minutes. It may have been aspiring sometimes but it was just not wellcrafted enough to be taken seriously which resulted in the opposite namely this film looking ridiculous at times. I give it a thumbsdown. Not recommended.".

	schema:headline " A Fascinating Look At Charles Bukowski";
	schema:reviewBody "Charles Bukowski is probably the greatest American poet who to this day remains largely unrecognized by the literary establishment in the United States. His greatest recognition came in and still is in Europe. He's the poet that college professors love to dislike because many of them tried to do what Bukowski did and failed. Bukowski became a cult literary underground figure in the late 50's known only to the few thousand fellow small press readers and publishers of the time. He wrote of his experiences in flop houses bars and women in a very distinctive oneofakind formless fashion. He worked for several years for the post office in two different stints in the 1950's and 1960's. Bukowski wrote on his own terms and never compromised thanks to his 100 monthly grant from a man that would become his lifelong publisher who started Black Sparrow Press. For the next 24 years from January of 1970 until his death on March 9 1994 Bukowski wrote stories poems and novels finding time in his later years to replace drinking with racetrack betting. This is an extraordinary documentary capturing Bukowski in the 1970's and 1980's mostly telling the story of his incredible life and alternatively capturing private moments that define him as well as defy his reputation. The film uses interviews of those that lived with him and knew him to portray a man that waded through an interpersonal sewer of a life only to conquer the literary world on his own terms and make a decent living from it to boot. It's the story of a man a writer who just lived life as it presented itself to him. He had an unflinching ability to face the realities of his life with charm wisdom and a determination that even he would not be able to recognize. Whether he spoke of his upbringing his drinking his laziness his unattractiveness his women and especially about love death and sex he remained steadfast in his cynicism laced with humor much like the comic artist Robert Crumb. Most of the highlights in the film occur when Bukowski is either conversing or reading his own work. He reads his own work in a world weary tone of voice that possesses a cadence that seems to say he's tired of it all. Just then though he hits us with another gem another truth about ourselves and the world around us. See this at all costs.  of 4 stars.".

I love his stuff most of it anyway and never really had a chance to see him while he was alive. His book Post Office is perhaps the rawest and perfectly written piece of literature that I've ever read. The documentary does him justice in that it captures him in his perfect drunken creative and impossibly complex environment. Filmed over 10 to 15 years it is not hero worship in any sense it's as raw and revealing of a tortured yet extremely funny individual as one can capture on film. We see his relationships with women unravel and patch up the dusty daily grind of a regular job that he hates his horrible childhood which would serve as material for Ham on Rye his struggle with celebrity in the twilight of his life. Like all great artists Pryor Lenny Bruce Van Gogh etc. Bukowski uses the pain and suffering of everyday life to his advantage the result is a great revealing documentary that opens him up and makes him accessible to even his most diehard fans. Much better than Barfly.".

We can be thankful it was shot at all since who knew what value it might have. The sound however is quite good.After many years of reading about Bukowski I still haven't decided whether he was a sensitive soul driven to occasional episodes of egotistical pettiness and meanness by a bad childhood or just a selfcentered ass who happened to have talent. However you view him in that regard you cannot deny that he stuck by his vocation in spite of all. He personified the driven writer.".

	schema:reviewBody "For those of us who haven't read any of his writing Charles Bukowski as seen in this informative engaging new documentary by John Dullaghan is a craggy deadbeat everyman a working class L.A. writer with enough cult status to have some cool famous fan admirers. Lawrence Ferlinghetti Harry Dean Stanton Tom Waits Bono of U2 and Sean Penn are the main guys who read lines or speak in admiring and affectionate terms of Bukowski. He also had a string of women some wives the last one Linda Lee a beautiful classy lady with a tough and tender edge worthy of Lauren Bacall. More important yet for his reputation perhaps he had an editor and publisher who put him on a monthly salary and brought out a lot of his books John Martin of Black Sparrow Press who saw Bukowski as an updated Whitman a man of the people spewing wild poetry. Somebody else told me he was the kind of writer you like if you're young and wild and drink a lot the kind of tortured outsider persona that appeals to a 22yearold but that you wouldn't go back to. If you used to hit the sauce and gave it up you may feel Bukowski's prose has lost its flavor like a doper's stoned insights. There are those who consider the writer a case of arrested development. Be that as it may all his life Bukowski never wanted to be anything but a writer and never stopped writing poems then stories finally novels. Two of his books most often mentioned are Post Office and Ham on Rye. These may be young men's books with more rough flavor than depth of thought but the fascination for the young man is with something solid the hard nuggets of brutal boring existence the courage of the deadbeat who's seen it all and bravely slogs on. First there's the six years age six to twelve of being beaten severely once a week with a razor strop by his exsoldier father. An experience like that Bukowski says is good for a writer because it teaches you to tell the truth. Next he had ulcerative acne vulgaris as an adolescent and his face was covered with pullulating boils that left his face craggy and pitted for life  though there are angles in some of the varied films from different decades that show him tanned and sunny almost elegantlooking and possessed of an evident macho sexiness that explains in part the many women in his life. The other part is that he was a late bloomer as a ladies' man and took advantage of the fame of his later years to make up for lost time. After the beatings and the acne Bukowski started visiting Skid Row to prepare for his future life. As his second decade wore on he wandered round the country staying at flophouses rooming houses and cheap hotels drunk obviously most of the time throughout the Forties excused by a psychiatrist from wartime military service. In the Fifties he settled into a minimal working stiff existence employee at the post office delivering mail living hell' later on sorting it all night which was so monotonous he'd get so he couldn't lift his arm and because he couldn't sleep spending the day drinking and writing.  Then when a new addiction to gambling kicked in he'd be at the racetrack playing the horses and play barfly in the afternoons brawling and flirting. He trashes the Barbet Schroeder movie from his screenplay about that part of his life says Mickey Rourke is too theatrical and flowery and he wrote a book called Hollywood after the filmmaking experience to show the dream factory was even stupider and faker than he'd ever imagined. Eventually a regular column in an L.A. weekly got Bukowski noticed. Then John Martin stepped in with his financial and moral support and through the Seventies and Eighties the man's reputation and financial success grew to the point where he moved to a nice house in San Pedro with his lovely wife. He wasn't expected to live after developing severe bleeding ulcers in his thirties 1956 but he recovered and had a new burst of creativity. In his last few years he got tuberculosis lost 60 pounds and gave up heavy drinking. He died soon after being diagnosed with leukemia at 73.Watching this documentary you feel good because of the man's clarity and humor. Simplistic his expression may be but it has the brilliant directness of the practiced writer who wears no mask. But despite all the tastes of his writing he and his celebrity admirers provide I still don't know if I'd want to read some of his prolific oeuvre and the picture of a similar but sober figure named Harvey Pekar in American Splendor Bukowski too was wildly reimagined by R. Crumb seems more complex and multilayered while no less down to earth. It's no secret that Harry Dean Bono Sean and Mr. Waits are enthusiastic boozers themselves and that's one big reason why Hank' Bukowski's their bard and patron saint. And if you compare Bukowski to another heavy user but a more wildly adventurous one William Burroughs his mind and work don't seem as rich or as interesting as Burroughs' nor his life as intensely engaged with the issues of his times as the Beats'. Nevertheless that's not to impugn the authenticity of his voice. There's nobody quite like Bukowski hence no doubt his cult status and the way people from other countries places where the brawling and the articulate life are less often combined find him so fascinating  and so accessible.".

It wasn't until the 1960's when a collector of 1st editions and manager of a printing company offered to publish a collection of his works when his career took off. He wrote possibly thousands of poems and was asked to write a novel. This work was Post Office an deadpan account of his 16 years working for the U.S. Post Office.Although he was and still is recognised as a 'Beat' writer alongside the likes of Jack Kerouac and Alan Ginsberg he was very much a man of his own style. Where Kerouac wrote about his personal journeys in a structured detailed way Bukowski wrote about mundane things in a straightforward way. It was very much poetry for the blue collar workers. In this documentary John Dullaghan pieces together interview footage shot by the likes of Taylor Hackford and Barbet Schroeder as well as pieces conducted by Italian and Belgian TV to create a portrayal of a very complex and misunderstood man there are also interviews with the likes of Sean Penn Bono Tom Waits and Harry Dean Stanton.Like A Man Within 2010 which focused on fellow beat writer William S. Burroughs Born Into This tries to tackle the various attributes that made the man. While telling a relatively chronological story of Bukowski it covers the subjects of his childhood abuse at the hands of his father his alcohol abuse his treatment of women his reaction to fame and how this led to an influx of women begging for his 'purple onion' as he called it. Running at 130 minutes this is an incredibly and necessarily detailed documentary that really gets to the heart of the man who created some incredibly pieces of literature. I remember reading Post Office and Factotum when I was younger and being blown away by its simplistic beauty and honesty. A mustsee for any fans.www.thewrathofblog.blogspot.com".

He worked at a post office and viewers are informed of the time he quit and his method of rehire. John Martin was his editor and publisher who enabled Bukowski a salary while presenting his writing in print. Various celebrities comment on his work and behaviour but their contribution however merit do not add so much as distract from the more important subject which is actual footage of Bukowski himself. Celebrities can tell much but they seem more as a marketing tool than an important collaborator. John Dullaghan's film should appeal to those scholars who study the intellect of men like Bukowski. He is presented as a man who saw only the dark side of life but delights us with his humorous presentation of it. He was born into a world where he saw no hope but scoffed the grim reality of humanity. Score 8   10".

The year was 1975 and I was 21.Now that I'm 50 and I've been clean and sober for over half my life Bukowski has lost quite a bit of his charm. Watching him in this movie I couldn't help but realize what a total case of adolescent arrested development he was. And although I think he should practically be canonized as a saint for his refusal to knuckle under to the phony plastic American success machine it's also apparent that most of what he had to say was only negative it only went half way there so to speak. In other words he provided no positive suggestions. He just said be yourself be a slacker follow your own obsessions. And this isn't enough as far as offering young people something good to believe in something that will help them feel like they can belong to something worthwhile.And much of the negative imagery quoted in his poems in this movie I was never a fan of his poetry only his prose is almost embarrassingly lurid and crude only a small step up from a slightly more polished version of garden variety Heavy Metal rock 'n' roll doom and gloom song lyrics.One other impressionistic thing I wanted to note was just how much John Martin the publisher of Black Sparrow books reminded me of Leonard Nipper Read the police officer that arrested and helped prosecute the infamous UK gangsters the Kray twins. Just a fun fact that's all.Another thing that struck me was Bukowski's attitude. I'd heard him speak before on cassette tape and on an early video of a reading he did in Bellevue Washington and I knew he had this kind of snotty purring way of talking but it really came through here. He really didn't seem like a very nice person not someone whose attitude I would put up with in real life for very long.But allinall this was a very well done documentary very well paced and hardly ever got bogged down. And it was a real pleasure to get a well rounded picture of a personality I had always been very curious about. And it was also very good to get to see and know some of the other people in Bukowski's life. John Martin for example is a very interesting and engaging man in his own right.As a portrait of an interesting literary and cultural figure I would recommend this film highly to everyone. And I think most Bukowski fans will like it a lot too.".

His poetry is of the nittygritty downtoearth noholdsbarred variety that I find revealing and fascinating. This movie goes beyond Mr. Bukowski's poetry to examine the man behind the work and does a credible job of presenting the life of this extraordinary writer and artist. It shows how he overcame major social emotional and financial barriers to become a world famous author while at the same time remaining true to himself. The movie tries to portray Mr. Bukowski as a gruff man which at times he was but he was also a decent man whose poetry gave expression to the thoughts and feelings of millions and millions of persons whose voices are never heard and if heard is never heeded. Watch this movie.".

His poetry is of the nittygritty downtoearth noholdsbarred variety that I find revealing and fascinating. This movie goes beyond Mr. Bukowski's poetry to examine the man behind the work and does a credible job of presenting the life of this extraordinary writer and artist. It shows how he overcame major social emotional and financial barriers to become a world famous author while at the same time remaining true to himself. The movie tries to portray Mr. Bukowski as a gruff man which at times he was but he was also a decent man whose poetry gave expression to the thoughts and feelings of millions and millions of persons whose voices are never heard and if heard is never heeded. Watch this movie.";

	schema:reviewBody "Put Sammo Hung and Simon Yam back together in this new Hong Kong action trial flick will not guarantee you much action and chemistry from their previous film SPL 2005. Though it looks like a sequel of SPL in overall unfortunately it lacks the punch that SPL has.While China born supporting actor Wu Jing who also had a supporting role in SPL appears as a supporting role in Fatal Move it was somehow rather disappointing to see leading actor Donnie Yen of Shanghai Knights Blade 2 and Seven Swords absent from the film. Instead Hong Kong veteran actor Danny Lee moves in as his classic role of police detective that he had from years of acting. Another veteran actress Kelly Tien Niu finally made her big screen appearance again as the wife of Hung.In terms of story line it looks like another 80's gangster flick from Hong Kong. Hung plays Lung a trial gang leader who owns a firm that conducts illegal drug business. His younger brother Tung Yam and a group of followers pledge their loyalty to the firm and of course Lung's wife Soso Kelly. However when a drug deal was busted by the police an inner war broke out in the gang where it was split into 2 sides and both wants to get rid of each other. Detective Liu Lee stands aside and awaits to get rid of the gang when he discovers one of his men is a spy for the gang.Comparing Fatal to SPL Fatal boasts a stronger appearance of veteran cast in a Hong Kong movie in the recent years. It is not that often where you get to see Hung Yam Lee and Kelly work together in a movie not counting the number of other veteran actors making special appearance in the film. Another selling point of the film is the high amount of violence. If you are not prepare to see hand chopping during gang fights sadistic torture ala Hostel liked torture or loads of throat slashing gore in the film the Fatal is not the movie for you even though the blood gushing scenes looks like some cheap CGI effects.For audience who missed the fighting between Hung and Yen in SPL they will be fairly disappointed in Fatal as Hung will not appear in any fights till the last 20 minutes of the film. And sad to say it is the focus of supporting characters that has been placed too much that it ends up both Hung and Yam had hardly any chance to explore their roles. To worsen this Lee had hardly any appearance as Detective Liu who wants to bring the trial gang to an end. Except from some explosive gun shooting scenes in the film Lee has hardly any way to explore his role. It was Kelly with the role of Soso that steals the limelight as it seems that she was the focus of the film compared to the rest of the male cast.Directer Dennis Law who was the writer for Johnnie To's Election 2005 and Election 2 2006 pens down the story which he try to explore the ugly and violent side of the trial gang. But in the end we got a movie that doesn't had the essence of Election and lacks the punch of SPL.Fairly entertaining to those who do loves movie featuring trial gang loads of bloodshed and violence.".

	schema:reviewBody "Tagline Almost as good as SPL Review by Neo Dennis Law have finally come of age and after 2 unfulfilled attempts Law have strike third time luckily with Fatal Move. Fatal Move is not just a good movie as saying that would be a clear understatement but one that Neo can proudly claim as the best in 2008 HK cinema so far. Despite a few unnecessary parts in between and some moments of predictability Fatal Move qualifies as an action movie with HK flair and almost matching the feat of 2005's SPL. It's been a while since Neo have witnessed a good HK movie and with it being so close to his 22nd birthday Fatal Move comes just at the right timing.Director Dennis Law have previously debuted in the teenage targeted Love  First Note and have since then gone on to make his first shot at action cinema with the above average Fatal Contact. There is no doubt that Law's career lies in action cinema and if this flick is any indication his direction is only heading one way and that is up and coming. It is always refreshing to witness a new generation director producing a good quality flick and it is all the more exciting when it comes to action cinema. Law smartly casts a trio from SPL namely Sammo Hung Simon Yam and Wu Jing and the result is some quality martial arts sequence and lots of fun to be had.Also of special mention it is probably the first time in years where action flicks have succeeded without the involvement of Donnie Yen. Perhaps it is time to unleash Wu Jing on his first true starring in almost a decade since Tai Chi 2. Like his role in SPL Wu Jing the protg of Jet Li is cool enough to rock the screen and likable enough to keep the audience attention. His fighting is slick and his youthfulness sets him apart from the rest of the aging cast. Still these kinds of roles might make him look cooler than anyone deserves to be but ultimately they are paper thin and not ones that allows Wu Jing to show his full potential. However it is nonetheless a sigh of fresh air as the days of Sammo Hung is closer to retirement than debutant.Also in the mix is Lee Sir Danny Lee and without a second though there is no doubt that Lee have aged considerably since his The Killer days and the sight of him with a gun is about as believable as a pensioner robbing a bank. With that being said it is always a pleasure to see him back on the big screen and once again reminding the audience exactly how movies are used to be made. Sammo Hung almost reprises his role of SPL but this time with a degree of remorseless and thus allowing the audience to maintain interest in his character. Unfortunately one of Law's weak points is that he is no Wilson Yip which means that he is not a character director. Luckily the fight sequences more than compensate and the result are some quietly entertaining long takes of these coolly filmed scenes.Simon Yam also appears here and there but is somewhat subdued and almost certainly a role more suited to the likes of Francis Ng. Veteran actress Tien Niu impresses the audience with a performance that is menacing yet understanding. Those final words of her are strong and her facial expression matched the strong dialogue given to her. As for Lam Suet he is just himself but for an actor that does so little Lam is damn memorable and his acting is just priceless to laugh or cry for.All in all Fatal Move is easily the best movie of 2008 so far and it is safe to say that it is a movie that Neo actually liked. I understand that the current reviewer has been a little too strict in recent times but there is no argument that the quality being delivered so far this year has largely been disappointing. With that being said it always feel good and makes Neo's day a hell lot better whenever he witness good HK cinema. Firstly it is surprising secondly it makes him feel like his effort and passion for this industry isn't just going straight to the garbage dump and finally it allows the current review to sleep well at night. So what's wrong with Fatal Move the answer is that there is nothing wrong but the fact that Neo got sort of overexcited like a little kid receiving a balloon Neo 2008 I rate it 910www.thehkneo.com".

	schema:headline " A Nutshell Review Fatal Move";
	schema:reviewBody "Written and directed by Dennis Law Fatal Move was originally conceived as the prequelsequel to 2005's SPL which had Donnie Yen and Simon Yam pit their skills on the side of the law against triad members played by Sammo Hung and Wu Jing. SPL had an interesting concept to begin with but I guess with the ending as it was a cop out in my opinion a successful sequel with an interlocking storyline with the surviving characters would prove challenging. A prequel on the other hand might not be as engaging as if we were to see the rise of Sammo's character to triad boss status it would ring too much a bell with Infernal Affairs 2.So Fatal Move offers a completely new storyline albeit with most of the SPL main cast coming back for another go. Donnie Yen is absent I'll see him in action later with The Empress and The Warriors and Simon Yam crosses over the fence to star as the brother of Sammo's triad boss character Lin Ho Lung. However Yam's Lin Ho Tung seems to be having a walk in the park and in fact he really did! as is Lin Ho Lung because those itching to see some serious buttkicking action by Sammo Hung will have to wait until the last 10 minutes of the movie. There are plenty of Milkyway regulars here with Lam Suet Cheung SiuFai and Maggie Siu on hand to lend their heavyweight support to appeal to Westerners here who are familiar with their works and Danny Lee returns after a long hiatus to play what else a cop yet again.The storyline is nothing to wow over and most times seemed to be running on a railway track completely fixed and oneway chugging along almost endlessly without a destination in sight. Character motivations were unclear and Tien Niu as Lung's wife Soso really let it all rip in a melodramatic monologue that contains a lot more story in her words than all the dialogue put together in the movie. It's about the selfdestruction of a triad gang from internal strife from the greed of man but its central theme was touched upon in a rather haphazard messy manner that you'd wonder if the subplots were just bookends for the action sequences.However despite its title Fatal Move is severely lacking in compelling action scenes. You have the tired car chases and it seems that there was little effort in trying to milk what Wu Jing and Sammo Hung could do. They're martial arts exponents but get to handle guns most of the time and this does not exploit the skills they are trained with which you can probably employ anyone to take over their place. Most of the fighting sequences were courtesy of Wu Jing who's especially mean with his lopsided bluedyed hairdo and an extremely sharp sword but given no competent exponent characterwise to spar with him it all boiled down to a onesided affair. Seriously I'm a fan of his and I think it's about high time he takes over the starring role mantle for Chinese action movie stars instead of getting bogged down playing side show villains.What gets compensated for the uninspiring action sequences was blood and gore done in CGI. I'm placing my bets that Herman Yau as director of photography here would have added some of his own pointers in this aspect and the camera does linger on in some of the more violent and gory aspects such as pumping continuous lead into a body and various forms of decapitations involving limbs and fingers right down to a castration. The much touted fight between Sammo Hung and Wu Jing was the main draw for me I have to admit but if you were to put SPL and this side by side Wu Jing vs Donnie Yen had a lot more intensity and slick moves compared to Wu Jing vs Sammo Hung.But alas despite the M18 rating here the movie was still subjected to multiple edits originally rated R21 uncut but no thanks of course to moneymaking distributors and most of the gory bits couldn't escape the censor's scissors. What made it unforgivable was that the much awaited duel too became victim and for that with the insipid storyline and relatively generic action I would have to recommend that this be skipped at the cinemas and rent the DVD if you're really interested.".

	onyx:emotionText "Written and directed by Dennis Law Fatal Move was originally conceived as the prequelsequel to 2005's SPL which had Donnie Yen and Simon Yam pit their skills on the side of the law against triad members played by Sammo Hung and Wu Jing. SPL had an interesting concept to begin with but I guess with the ending as it was a cop out in my opinion a successful sequel with an interlocking storyline with the surviving characters would prove challenging. A prequel on the other hand might not be as engaging as if we were to see the rise of Sammo's character to triad boss status it would ring too much a bell with Infernal Affairs 2.So Fatal Move offers a completely new storyline albeit with most of the SPL main cast coming back for another go. Donnie Yen is absent I'll see him in action later with The Empress and The Warriors and Simon Yam crosses over the fence to star as the brother of Sammo's triad boss character Lin Ho Lung. However Yam's Lin Ho Tung seems to be having a walk in the park and in fact he really did! as is Lin Ho Lung because those itching to see some serious buttkicking action by Sammo Hung will have to wait until the last 10 minutes of the movie. There are plenty of Milkyway regulars here with Lam Suet Cheung SiuFai and Maggie Siu on hand to lend their heavyweight support to appeal to Westerners here who are familiar with their works and Danny Lee returns after a long hiatus to play what else a cop yet again.The storyline is nothing to wow over and most times seemed to be running on a railway track completely fixed and oneway chugging along almost endlessly without a destination in sight. Character motivations were unclear and Tien Niu as Lung's wife Soso really let it all rip in a melodramatic monologue that contains a lot more story in her words than all the dialogue put together in the movie. It's about the selfdestruction of a triad gang from internal strife from the greed of man but its central theme was touched upon in a rather haphazard messy manner that you'd wonder if the subplots were just bookends for the action sequences.However despite its title Fatal Move is severely lacking in compelling action scenes.

The tone of the movie is similar to the one explored in the Infernal Affairs in that gangs will go to any extent to get their money involvement between police and the gang is portrayed in detail and deception plays a role in the story. What separates Fatal Move is the level of action and violence portrayed and Wu Jing shows his fast and very beautifully choreographed move as the heavy in this movie. This movie to me is a ground breaking movie in Hong Kong action movie genre like Better Tomorrow did back in the '80s. While Better Tomorrow was somewhat mindless violence this is violence with lots of intent backing it.The last fight between Wu Jing and Sammo Hung was the only mindless battle but if you have two such talent you'd be remiss as a writer not to include this fight scene.Danny Lam plays the usual cop role and Taiwanese actress Kelly Niu shows that she still looks great on the big screen.All of this brings good entertainment to this new age Hong Kong action movie. Highly recommended.".

Well it would have helped if the story was better. What was the point! Making A triad movie with some action in it or making an action movie with triad elements. Doesn't matter anyway because both attempts failed. But even then they could have made up for the bad story with decent action scenes and superb acting. Most of the actors are sleepwalking throughout the movie. And the action scenes were unimaginative and very poorly executed. The main flaw I think is the direction. The director hasn't got a clue what to do with the story which is evident at the end. While it was the best scene of the whole movie it didn't make any sense. Of course I am talking about the fight between Sammo Hung and Wu Jing. Without a doubt it was the highlight of this movie. But to be honest this fight came out of nowhere. Wu Jing a loyal subject of Sammo challenges him because he realizes that it is his last chance to do so. Not once did Wu Jing at least in the movie made it clear that it was his wish to find out who the better fighter was. And how can it be if you are loyal to your boss. I have said too much already. This movie is waste of time. Ignore it!".

Alas this was not the case.It's difficult to say just went wrong with Fatal Move but the disjointed storytelling is definitely the main factor. Simon Yam's character starts out as having the potential to be compelling and Jacky Wu certainly looks to be the man with whom not to k as his talent deserves but things quickly fall apart as too many characters are chucked at us too quickly for no real reason and after an hour or so of action scenes occasionally having been slotted in to keep our interest in an otherwise dull difficult to follow film I soon found myself scratching my head wondering how the mess on screen before me escaped some serious script rewrites.Aside from men carrying out hits with ninja weapons in a ludicrous excuse for more M.A. choreography when a machine gun could have done all the work in half the time there's also some truly awful CGI blood and gore effects which made me wonder why the art of film is deevolving compare Lord of the Rings to Ghandi Lone Wolf and Cub to this and to make matters worse the dramatic element which had been so sorely lacking throughout only graces us right at the very end when Sammo's wife Soso turns in a deft performance too little too late..No Simon Yam lines to justify wasting his talent no unarmed Jacky Wu.Fair enough Sammo still surprises us with a cool scene to show he's still got the moves despite his age but nothing could save this wreck once it had been greenlit without undergoing serious surgery at a local script doctor's.It's unfair to say that there's no story for as jumbled as it is it's there but the action just seemed to be tossed in for the sake of it for the most part was unrewarding and the total of this flick came up incredibly short given its concept cast budget and just about any other pro it had.".

Wu Jing plays another cocky hateful killer who enjoys mutilating his victims and during a torture sequence the film takes violence to a whole new level. Vicious car chases and the like certainly keep the energy flowing and my only complaint is that there's too little martial arts to enjoy. We have to wait until the climax before we see Sammo back in action although I have to say it's well worth the wait.Castwise Sammo bags the most interesting role playing a conflicted mob boss who doesn't seem to be that bad a guy for the most part. Simon Yam has a slick somewhat minor role and doesn't really do much and Wu Jing is there for the violence alone. However it's great to see Danny Lee THE KILLER back on the screens once more even if the film doesn't give him much to play other than the stereotyped dogged cop.FATAL MOVE is no masterpiece but I found it highly entertaining as genre entries go. It's certainly not on the level of the Wilson YipDonnie Yen collaborations but it comes close at regular intervals.".

The idea is based on the main character being able to communicate with his father who's been dead for 30 years. His father hears it then 30 years earlier. They quickly do some things that shouldn't have happened back then which then changes the futureor present. The movie deals very well with how they change the future back and forth. The plot is very good the acting is superb and the characters are all believable. The special effects are very good. The very idea behind the film is very good but the way it develops so much further is amazing. The ending while it may seem corny too some and is by all means a bit of a typical Hollywood endingsome might even call it a copout but personally I just think it worked better than anything else could have. I'd recommend this to pretty much anyone who can watch a movie where they have to suspend disbelief but especially anyone into timetravel or alternate timelines as this is in my opinion one of the best movies made concerning this subject. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "This unique and interesting film is actually more of a suspense thriller than a science fiction although I think fans of both genres will be pleased.Dennis Quaid plays a heroic firefighter who was killed trying to rescue a runaway from a burning warehouse during the days of the Amazing Mets' World Series victory in October 1969. Jim Caviezel The Thin Red Line plays his son now a cop thirty years later. Through some quirk of physics involving abnormal solar activity and the Aurora Borealis the two make contact with each other across the 30year span over a ham radio. The son is able to prevent his father's death but changing the past also turns out to have unexpected consequences with which the two must deal.The film really works on all levels with good action sequences and suspense a nice dose of humor and some very touching exchanges between father and son. It explores the what if scenario of one's being presented with the opportunity to change an event in the past and the way in which those affected must deal with the consequences in a very intelligent and thoughtprovoking manner.The acting is uniformly strong with Quaid very appealing as the courageous firefighter and loving father who has an almostchildlike love for baseball he even pulls off a Brooklyn accent nicely! Caviezel is equally good as the present day version of Quaid's character's son. Caviezel brings a subtle sadness to the character a quality one might expect from someone whose life hasn't quite worked out quite as well as it might have possibly due to a void created by the absence of his father. One of the strongest aspects of Caviezel's performance was a subtle shift in personality following the changing of events in the past a change which left him with memories both of his father's death and of time spent with his father in the intervening years.I have a good feeling about this film and think it has a chance to be a real surprise hit. It's certainly one of the best films of the year thus far.".

The pastpresent connections are stirring and intriguing especially the singleflash cuts at pivotal moments.

	schema:reviewBody "Several films have deal with changing the past and the ensuing effects on the future.  Back to the Future Timecop and The Final Countdown come immediately to mind.  Director Gregory Hoblit his Fallen 1998and Primal Fear 1996 were both excellent explores that theme again in Frequency.  But writer Toby Emmerich in his first writing credit puts a different spin on the theme.  In most 'changing the past' films a character goes back in time.  In Frequency one main character lives in 1999 while another lives in 1969and you see the actions in 1969 immediately affecting 1999.  Sounds confusing huh?  Well it is.  But it works.The movie opens with the introduction of the Sullivan family.  Frank Dennis Quaid is a heroic New York firefighter and escapes a harrowing situation to return home to his wife and his 6yearold son John.  It's an exciting time in New York as the 'Miracle Mets' have made the World Series.  Frank is a ham radio user and a strange disturbance in the sky solar flares I believe.  I never took astronomy in the sky has really increased the range of his radio.  I'm reaching people I've never reached before he says. Flash forward to 1999 when young John has grown up into a 36yearold NY homicide detective James Caviezel with relational problems and possibly a drinking problem as well.  We learn his father died several years earlier in a warehouse fire and it's obvious that John has never really gotten over it.  He ends up setting up the old ham radio did I mention that the solar flares are back? and contacts a fellow New Yorker named Frank.  It certainly won't ruin any big surprise when I tell you that it's his father Frankin 1969.  After recovering from his astonishment and convincing his father who he really is his knowledge of the 1969 World Series proves quite helpful they begin a series of nightly conversations.  Unfortunately their conversations change the pastand the futurein very dangerous ways. A serial killer who should only have 3 victims suddenly has more and John must use his knowledge of the crimes 30 years old to him to guide his dad in a 1969 pursuit of the killer.  And the chase is on.  Will they stop the killer?  Will the solar flares last long enough for them to finish their plan?  Will anyone in 1999 or 1969 believe them?That lengthy 'plot summary' really didn't ruin any of the suspenseor come close to explaining the whole story.  So it goes without saying that the story is pretty convoluted and involved.  But it's not hard to follow and the movie grabbed me and kept me interested throughout.  Granted you will need to use a serious amount of 'suspension of disbelief'.  If you get hung up on there's no way they could be talking to each other or changes in the past wouldn't immediately appear in the futurethey would have already happened and would have been there all along you'll do 2 things 1 you'll give yourself a headache and 2 you'll miss out on a very entertaining film.  The reason I gave this more stars than last week's U571?  I cared about the characters and I found Frequency much more entertaining.  Also the story was quite originalwith great use of the Miracle Mets and the 1969 World Series throughout.Speaking of the charactersQuaid and Caviezel both do great work.  Their conversations via radio are very touching and authentic once you accept the general premise of course.  Although Quaid is a 'movie star' don't let that fool youhe's a very good and probably underrated actor.  Just watch him as Doc Holliday in Wyatt Earp 1994 Remy McSwain in The Big Easy 1987 or Gordo Cooper in The Right Stuff 1983 if you don't believe me. And Caviezel's a real upandcomer 1998's The Thin Red Line.  He does a great job as a grieving son who is reunited in a way with his father but watches his joy dissipate in the face of the mess he's created.  He also believably portrays a character who has memories of the way things were but is now bombarded with 'new' memories of the way things have become.  The other characters are definitely secondary but Elizabeth Mitchell as wifemom Julia and Andre Braugher TV's Homicide 1998's City of Angels and 1989's Glory as Frank's policeman friend Satch are both solid.This film has some decent actionsuspense scenes and 1999 John's radio conversation with his buddy Gordo in 1969 is very funny.  There have certainly been better actionsuspenseserial killer movies the action scenes weren't amazing the story has some holes and I thought the ending was a little cheesy but the heart of the film is the relationship between Frank and John.  I bought into that relationship fully and that's why I liked this film as much as I did.  And that's why I definitely recommend seeing Frequency.".

Put behind you images of flying Delorians traversing through time and just let the film soak you in it's original story of what if. What if you could change history and bring back the ones you lost long ago. What if that power came with a price. Is it better to leave things as is or if given the chance to change the world you live in would you? These questions and more rise in this film that ask would you could you should you. Dennis Quaid in one of his best roles is a fire fighter from New York in 1969. His hobby is ham radio when not rescuing people from near death in the line of duty. His son John is just a child and dreams of being a baseball player when he grows up. But in the realities of life somethings were not meant to be. John grows up and becomes a police officer working on the homicide squad in 1999 and his father never made it out of a burning building in 1969. On October 10th 1969 sun spots rise up the day before the fatal day in the warehouse. 30 years later the same event happens on the same day in 1999. John finds his fathers radio and begins to play with it and finds a man who seems to have the same call letters and last name. The sun spots allow his radio waves to traverse 30 years into the past to his father. He can save his life with the knowledge of the future and have him back in the present. This comes at a deadly price for in 1969 there is a serial killer who preys on nurses. Johns mother is a nurse. Together John and his father must stop this killer from taking more lives in a game of cat and mouse that unfolds reverses and progresses over the 30 year gap. Memories disappear and new ones open in there place people survive and others die. All this leads to a fantastic final battle of old and new.This really is a film not to be missed. Fans of thrillers scifi and action will all be pleased with this film.".

Recently he has split up from his girlfriend he and his police partner Satch Andre Braugher are unable to solve a serial murder case that has been reopened due to the discovery of skeletal remains of a past victim. The thirty year anniversary of the death of his firefighter father Dennis Quaid is also approaching. John is beginning to sink in a pit of despair.One night John stumbles upon his dad's old ham radio. He makes an effort to get the machine to power up once again. When he does and begins conversations with another operator however he realizes the person he is communicating with is his long dead father. Somehow due to the presence of the Northern Lights John is able to transmit back in time to 1969 and literally alter the course of his existence. The concept of time traveling communication may seem farfetched  to some and Frequency is a little hard to grasp at times especially when the film never directly explains why the father and son are able to talk with each other through time. Notwithstanding the production works as a science fiction thriller with supernatural overtones. While the filmmakers do succeed in convincingly constructing Frequency most audiences might have to leave logic at the theater entrance before viewing it.Frequency is a wellstructured motion picture the movie is focused throughout. Although its story changes pace at different periods  for the most part the audience can follow along with the characters. This is a movie with a complicated and challenging story. Because of the film's complexity we are enormously involved if slightly confused. Screenwriter Tobias Emmerich links original and fresh feeling material here. Gregory Hoblit produces the right amount of action and suspense combined with gentle emotions to generate a film we have not seen before. Dennis Quaid and James Caviezel are the perfect choices for the principal characters. Quaid performs with intriguing tension and appropriate receptivity. Caviezel dazzles with intricacy and dexterity. Offering refined supporting roles are Andre Braugher City of Angels Get on the Bus and Noah Emmerich The Truman Show who furnishes some lighthearted material as John's best friend. Director Gregory Hoblit Fallen Primal Fear clearly executes topics on screen. This film is overflowing with ideas and contains enough plot for a television series. However Frequency is not without flaws. Sullivan's chaotic life is only vaguely portrayed. Although we do care for the character more development would increase the relationship between the audience and he.  Some of the makeup effects depicting age differences were disgraceful. Andre Braugher appeared as if his make up artists were straight out of junior high slapping too much pancake cream plaster on him. The film's contrived climax concludes with a formalistic fight instead of continuing its battle of wits. Despite a few unacceptable external problems internally this is a very effective production. As a whole Frequency contains a very encompassing story and places interesting characters in engaging circumstances. The movie is definitely worthy of recognition but do not view it unless you plan on thoroughly discussing it afterwards.".

I never took astronomy in the sky has really increased the range of his radio. I'm reaching people I've never reached before he says. Flash forward to 1999 when young John has grown up into a 36yearold NY homicide detective James Caviezel with relational problems and possibly a drinking problem as well. We learn his father died several years earlier in a warehouse fire and it's obvious that John has never really gotten over it. He ends up setting up the old ham radio did I mention that the solar flares are back? and contacts a fellow New Yorker named Frank. It certainly won't ruin any big surprise when I tell you that it's his father Frankin 1969. After recovering from his astonishment and convincing his father who he really is his knowledge of the 1969 World Series proves quite helpful they begin a series of nightly conversations. Unfortunately their conversations change the pastand the futurein very dangerous ways. A serial killer who should only have 3 victims suddenly has more and John must use his knowledge of the crimes 30 years old to him to guide his dad in a 1969 pursuit of the killer. And the chase is on. Will they stop the killer? Will the solar flares last long enough for them to finish their plan? Will anyone in 1999 or 1969 believe them? That lengthy 'plot summary' really didn't ruin any of the suspenseor come close to explaining the whole story. So it goes without saying that the story is pretty convoluted and involved. But it's not hard to follow and the movie grabbed me and kept me interested throughout. Granted you will need to use a serious amount of 'suspension of disbelief'. If you get hung up on there's no way they could be talking to each other or changes in the past wouldn't immediately appear in the futurethey would have already happened and would have been there all along you'll do 2 things 1 you'll give yourself a headache and 2 you'll miss out on a very entertaining film. The reason I gave this more stars than last week's U571? I cared about the characters and I found Frequency much more entertaining.

It's a time travel movie without anyone actually traveling through time!

She is killed by The Nightingale Serial Killer. That's not supposed to happen! Through a series of actionsdad is able to thwart this otherwise inevitable event. But as one thing is changed it sets off an unpredictable chain of events that could not have been anticipated. Extremely well written until the happy climax where everyone lives and only the murderer dies in two time periods simultaneously! That is the paradox of the movie how can the same person get his arm shot off in the past yet survive and die 30 years in the future? Wouldn't he have bleed to death? At that point the movie wraps up with breakneck speed and we are left both dazed and confused watching everyone play baseball! My theory is that the radio was somehow the timelink more so than the atmospheric phenomenon. However the movie manages to satisfy on several emotional levels especially the ability to speak to a loved one that we miss so dearly. There is a haunting quality to the film that makes you want to watch it more than once. Cuttingedge special effects. Rated PG13 graphic and intense content.".

	schema:reviewBody "Going into this film I had no idea what the true story line was. Is it a time travel film is it a scifi film or is it a murder mystery? Well it's a little of each of these. Put behind you images of flying Delorians traversing through time and just let the film soak you in it's original story of what if. What if you could change history and bring back the ones you lost long ago. What if that power came with a price. Is it better to leave things as is or if given the chance to change the world you live in would you? These questions and more rise in this film that ask would you could you should you. Dennis Quaid in one of his best roles is a fire fighter from New York in 1969. His hobby is ham radio when not rescuing people from near death in the line of duty. His son John is just a child and dreams of being a baseball player when he grows up. But in the realities of life somethings were not meant to be. John grows up and becomes a police officer working on the homicide squad in 1999 and his father never made it out of a burning building in 1969. On October 10th 1969 sun spots rise up the day before the fatal day in the warehouse. 30 years later the same event happens on the same day in 1999. John finds his fathers radio and begins to play with it and finds a man who seems to have the same call letters and last name. The sun spots allow his radio waves to traverse 30 years into the past to his father. He can save his life with the knowledge of the future and have him back in the present. This comes at a deadly price for in 1969 there is a serial killer who preys on nurses. Johns mother is a nurse. Together John and his father must stop this killer from taking more lives in a game of cat and mouse that unfolds reverses and progresses over the 30 year gap. Memories disappear and new ones open in there place people survive and others die. All this leads to a fantastic final battle of old and new.".

	schema:reviewBody "Director Gregory Hoblit brings us Frequency an intriguing sciencefiction tale that was as thrilling and shocking as it was heartfelt and emotional. The movie is about John Sullivan Caviezel a Cop who has never recovered from the death of his father Frank Quaid. However after a series of miraculous cosmic events John is given a chance to communicate with his father in the past. Now when I initially examined this film for what it was  a movie with a respectable premise but directed by a guy I had never heard of and starring a group of actors who aren't really wellknown  I was rather apprehensive about watching it. Though after actually watching Frequency I can say that my expectations were pretty much demolished. What threw me for a loop was the direction that this movie took. All I expected Frequency to be was a long drawn out reunion between a father and his griefstricken son which sounded to good to me. . .but didn't really sound spectacular. But about a third of the way in Frequency turned into a very intense crime thriller. That being said the film excels at interweaving thrills and poignancy without making the transitions feel jarring. The acting was very well executed I'd say for you learn to feel for both Frank and John Sullivan as Frequency's intriguing plot thickens. The script was pretty wellwritten too. Overall I'd say that Frequency was an entertaining scifi flick that offered a variety of gratifying elements within it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Frequency is very underrated!  I loved this movie when I saw it in theaters.  I saw it twice on cable and now that I bought the DVD I watched it again.  I was just as intrigued as when I watched it the first time! Needless to say the premise is extremely original.  I seem to always connect well with films involving fatherson relationships since I don't have an ideal relationship with my father.  So it was really sweet to watch a film about a guy communicating with his deceased father and watching them bond and chat about the AllAmerican game.  Not only is it a touching drama but it's also an exciting thriller.  Director Gregory Hoblit and writer Toby Emmerich couldn't have done much to make the film better. Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel both deliver great spirited performances.  I always notice more and more flaws in Quaid's New York accent in repeat viewings but his acting is terrific nonetheless.  Andre Braugher gives another strong performance as Satch.  And the actor who plays the villain is quite creepy.  I would expect that after seeing the movie a couple times the ending would no longer make me cry but the ending STILL chokes me up!  As a matter of fact I'm about to cry just thinking about it.  I'm by no means a fan of country music but I felt Garth Brooks' song beautifully fit the film's tone.  Tired of seeing movie's with the same plots and the same outcomes?  I promise that won't be the case when you watch Frequency.  Sure some elements of plot may be hard to swallow since they range from a little farfetched to very farfetched but at least the writer showed great imagination.  That's more than I can say for most of the Hollywood screenwriters out there.  My score  9 out of 10".

It has great performances and is a good scifi thriller. If you like these kinds of films watch it.";

	schema:reviewBody "An accidental crosstime radio link connects father Dennis Quaid and son Jim Caviezel across 30 years. The son tries to save his father's life but then must fix the consequences.Let me preface this review by saying this film is loaded with anachronisms and time travel flaws if we assume time to be logical. These holes were glaringly obvious. But if I disregard these things and just look at how well the film entertained me it is definitely one of the better time travel films out there.Dennis Quaid is the father Jesus is the son. Perhaps that makes Quaid God but I think that might be a stretch. He is Joseph at best. Initially the goal is to save the father from dying in a fire... but once that goal is accomplished why not do more? Save more lives maybe read off some winning lottery numbers. The plot shifts drastically about a third of the way in but then gets actually better.The best parts of this movie are the father tracking down a killer trying to stop him before he kills nurses thus gaining himself the nickname the Nightingale Killer. Using facts from the crime after the fact he is easily able to know where and when the killer will strike. The film then becomes an interesting detective story as well as a heartwarming family tale. Some of the family stuff is a bit hard to believe... way too much love going on here.Look close not too close and you will see a young Michael Cera as Gordo Junior. This is three years before Cera broke out with Arrested Development and went on to much bigger things from there though he had done previous acting roles by this point in things you probably never saw.Of course this film is recommended. If you are too much of a stickinthebutt and you can only focus on the flaws you will be frustrated with this film. But come on! Sometimes fantasy is just fantasy. Why let science ruin a good story?".

	schema:reviewBody "Pseudo time travel thriller manages to almost be believable while delivering an exciting story which grips the viewer.Dennis Quaid and Jesus himself Jim Caviezel star as father and son in a movie about causality. Frequency's vehicle is that the 2 manage to communicate through time the father being in 1969 and the son in 1999. The idea put forth to explain this rather implausible phenomenon is that Aurora Borealis The Northern Lights are managing to interfere with radio signals somehow allowing signals from different time periods to come together.Using this useful tool the son John Sullivan tries to save his father's life by telling him he will die in a warehouse fire in the line of his duty as a fireman. The father Frank takes his advice to avoid death and is amazed when it works.Obviously causality isn't finished and proceeds to add more layers of events to the story meaning that when you mess with the future you change more than just what you think you affect.This movie is great fun. It never takes itself especially seriously and everyone appears to be having a decent time here. Dennis Quaid's Frank has a quiet authority which suits him well and although his overly southern accent seems a mite contrived to start with we get used to it. Caviezel as his grown up son from the future is pretty decent here too. He comes across as a man who's a bit lost but when he gets a chance to talk to his father Who died 30 years ago hence saving his life through time he suddenly seems to have a purpose.All the other players contribute pretty well as well but this is really the Quaid and Caviezel show.The direction is pretty good too never getting in the way of a good yarn. It aids the flow really well and manages the old 'edge of your seat' effect well.The only real flaw in this is the quite appallingly sugarsweet ending. It's so sentimental that it incites nauseum. A feelgood ending is only going to work when it's not overplayed and when it uses subtlety. Trying to force the old 'this is a good ending folks' motto on the viewer leaves a sickly taste in the mouth.But fortunately the rest of the movie's quality lets it stand on its own 2 feet and the ending fails to ruin it.Overall not bad not bad at all.".

This time I was able to see the beautifully hand drawn animation up on the big screen in all its glory.I am a relatively new fan of the series but have been well exposed to the mythos by now. This film unlike the film tied to the earlier series Conqueror of Shamballa is not an endingfinale as much as it is a filler episode that fits into the Brotherhood series. It should be viewed as another chance to spend time with the Elric brothers though perhaps this time on an ever slightly more epic journey than usual. I feel viewing it this way which is how I went into it will merit the most enjoyment.I don't think anything needs to be said about the voice acting this dub is terrific truly one of the best. I know some fans only watch the subs but this is well known as one of those anime that almost every fan finds the English dub to be on par or in some cases above the original one.The visuals were fantastic and the action was excellently staged. The only downside is that Ed and Al seem to play side characters in this film whereas in comparison to Conqueror of Shamballa they were definitely main characters there. While I would have liked more of them and more stakes for them in the story that didn't stop me from greatly enjoying the film. The story keeps one eager to see what will happen and where things will go even though a few too many scenes without any presence felt by Ed or Al left me wondering when they would return to the screen.It isn't that I didn't enjoy the side characters just that Ed and Al were always on my mind when gone too long as this is a Fullmetal Alchemist film. The side characters are interesting and well designed there is a large back story about two warring countries and another caught between and a smaller back story about a brother and sister who like Ed and Al lost their parents The large amount of plot is well explained without getting too expository several flashback sequences definitely help.The film starts out very linear light and fun but soon gets very dark and heavy as it begins to pile on the plot twists towards the end backtobacktoback at one point. I didn't mind personally but I mention it just to help others decide whether they want to find this in a local theater or wait for the spring bluray release.On another note if this film didn't carry the title Fullmetal Alchemist or if Ed and Al hadn't been in the story I would have felt like I was watching an older Hayao Miyazaki film which I say as a compliment. Even the character designs reminded me very much of Nausicaa or other similar films.So while I do wish Ed and Al were more involved both physically and emotionally they mostly stand on the sidelines and give their opinions to these new characters who may make the same mistakes the boys once did it is nevertheless a good if not great film. It is especially engaging for those who love hand drawn animation as I do.".

However after seeing the reviews I found that people were disappointed because in the original series fullmetal is the main character. The film might look to be a show of mishandled characters to some of those who have seen the TV series already. However for a new viewer like me it was a complete treat. After watching the film I knew that the main character is somewhat kept aside most of the time but I personally considered that it was a perfect way compared to the 4th part of the pirates film. So overall I enjoyed each and every minute of the film.A must watch for all animation lovers and a definite one time watch for all others.".

It does have good action sequences and better plot than Shamballa but the animation and story feels it is lacking in quality compared to the brotherhood TV series. The main problem with this movie is Julia is the main character focused on and Ed and Al are the side characters. Worth watching but feels an unnecessary addition to the TV series.".

	schema:reviewBody "If you've read my review on Fullmetal Alchemist Conqueror of Shamballa already you would know that I am a fan of the Fullmetal Alchemist franchise which was originally a series of Japanese graphic novels often called manga written and designed by Hiromu Arakawa for Shonen Gangan a monthly magazine published by Square Enix. Yes. That Square Enix. It was turned into two anime television series sometime later one starting in 2003 while the manga was still being written and another in 2010 dubbed Brotherhood a few years after it was finished. Both of these anime series would premier in the United States on Cartoon Network's late night block Adult Swim.Fullmetal Alchemist The Sacred Star of Milos pronounced Mlss is the second feature film in the franchise. While Conqueror of Shamballa is spun off of the 2003 series and serving as its official ending this movie is spun off of the 2010 series and is an original story taking place somewhere near the halfway point of the show's run. It starts with a prisoner an alchemist breaking out of prison in Central City despite only having a few weeks left in his sentence. The Elric brothers consisting of Edward Vic Mignogna a young state alchemist dubbed Fullmetal and his younger brother Alphonse Maxey Whitehead decide to go after him. They end up near the edge of the country border to a town called Table City where they cross paths with a young girl named Julia Alexis Tipton who belongs to a society called the Milosians. Thus the Elrics end up becoming a part of a conflict that could either bring peace and prosperity or the extinction of an entire people.Even though I did say that this movie took place somewhere near the middle of Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood I cannot say where exactly this movie is placed in the storyline. Even if I did know the movie pretty much serves as just featurelength filler and I don't really see that as a bad thing here. However I do understand that there are a few fans of the franchise that will have a tough time wrapping their head around the overall plot. The animation is also pretty good for a theatrical release though it's not the best work I've seen from Bones the studio that has also worked on both the 2003 series and Brotherhood as well as other anime series and movies.So to sum up I actually enjoyed this one. Could it be better? Yes but what I got out of it is a rather thrilling and sometimes brutal adventure flick based on a Japanese franchise I hold as near and dear as Cowboy Bebop. However if you plan to watch this picture I would recommend watching at least half of Brotherhood first. It may not help you fully understand everything this movie unfolds but it would make it a little easier than it should.".

I at least know the names of the main characters and understand some of the basic premise. This movie features the Elric brothers Ed and Al. Although both are said to have lost their spirits only a fraction of Ed's body looks mechanical. This movie features them saving a town called Milos by finding the scared star.Yeah the title says everything. There's this woman named Julia who appears and it was weird not knowing if she was a main character in the series or not. What I love about this film is how beautiful the animation is and how great the action scenes are. We get tons of creative environments and elements. While not a fan that's all I want in something to love it! Anyone can enjoy this beautiful film that's nicely paced with great voice acting and likable characters. Edward is easily my favorite and that's pretty handy when he happens to be the main character. Should please any anime fan just like me. 12".

The animation is very good seeming to me to combine 2D techniques computergenerated effects smoke water waves flowing blood energy beams flames lava etc. and of course lots of bright colors but not so colorful and flashy it induces headaches. Visually this doesn't take a back seat to anyone.It's obviously been carefully prepped for a U.S. release. Except for the credits being entirely Japanese characters no clue is given to a naive viewer that this might be a variant. The voice actors as far as I could tell all with names that can be spelled with Japanese characters all speak completely unaccented idiomatic English. The problem of signs shops roadside etc. being in a different language is largely finessed by arranging that there just plain aren't hardly any. There aren't any written clues either  everything is drawings and diagrams. The few signs that do exist the newspaper page we see and even the inside of a book we get a quick glance at have all been redrawn so they appear to have always been in English.The thing I noticed most was the characters' mouth movements have all been redrawn to match the English dub!? There's more music in the sound track than most animations of course it's still not walltowall music.A pitchperfect dub a redraw of all the bits of writing new mouth movements and significant music add up to quite an effort to pitch this to general audiences in the U.S. as a breakout movie.That said the ethos just didn't mesh with my world.The storyline which I assume is outstanding in the anime world doesn't to me feel right for a movie. It's standalone no background is required to understand it and it's obvious a lot of effort has been spent trying to make it accessible to naive audiences. Yet its manga roots still show strongly. There's far too much dialog compared to what I'm used to the plot is far too complex for the length of a movie and there's too much abrupt jumping back and forth and back and forth between moralizing and joking. Many movies don't use the hidden identity trope at all some use it once but this is the first time I've seen the hidden identity trope stacked so a character that's revealed to be somebody else is eventually revealed again.Likewise some of the attitudes just don't fit what I'm used to. I could eventually get into the inadvertently wisecracking halfserious yet halfjoking or is it just plain juvenile? attitude of the principal characters but initially I found it jarring. I didn't realize until halfway through the movie that it was sometimes quite funny. The portrayal of the military as so central to the control of society and the portrayal of military people with drab exteriors but bright interiors and plenty of independence and rather cynical attitudes was foreign to me.Even though the visuals and the audio had gone out of their way to enter my world as far as possible I was left overall with the sense of peering into a different culture. It wasn't necessarily one I dislike just one that was different enough I couldn't really get into it right away. Maybe it's just my old age showing or maybe some sort of cultural baptism into the anime world is needed or ...".

	schema:reviewBody "This is kind of loosely based off of Fullmetal Alchemist and yet the addition to Julia seems as though it was a fan character brought into the show. The story brings the Elric brothers far from Central and the areas where they are normally are in both anime. Unfortunately it is the same story line we almost always have. Apprised people trying to get their land back. The story feels kind of old when you keep making it all about a hunt for the philosopher's stone.There are a couple inconsistencies that happen within this show like the fact that there is a Chimera that has some human in him but yet it seems that he isn't having any problems with his body unlike every other Chimera that we have seen.I'm not sure but Julia seems to be a Mary Sue character in a sense. Everything bad is happening to her and yet she seems to be able to get out of her predicaments. They basically showed her as a girl that has had really bad things happen to her since a young age. She has had no time to have anything good happen and bad things happen to her. Even the story about her brother seems rather sappy.The whole story line seems to be exactly like every other storyline where a group of people are fighting for some 'holy land' somewhere. I'm wondering if the people who wrote Fullmetal Alchemist and the ones who wrote this one have something to do with the whole 'Jews and Israel' thing. It also gets really gory lots of blood and guts scenes.When they show the CG it actually looks pretty well done. They made it look rather close to the animation but it seems to be used unnecessarily in times when the item is still. This shows up in the first few minutes where there is a close up of Edward's hand. The rest of the animation is actually pretty much the same as the anime beautiful details and sometimes exceeding the anime. The fighting sometimes seems a bit awkward at times since we get a lot of flashing lights from alchemist. Now a bunch of characters seem to be rehashed versions of old characters.The voices are actually alright though I'm not sure about Julia Crichton's voice though. It seems really sweet and innocent. Vic does a perfect job as Edward as always.".

They make a batch of Christmas puddings to sell to passing motorists but they are a complete failure. Other children are bottling mineral water from a nearby mineral spring which all goes flat. This is poured out along with the Christmas puddings into a drain where their pet goat drinks the awful mixture. Shortly afterwards the children notice that the normal white coat of their goat has changed into many colors. It is now in fact a rainbow colored goat and the children realize that they have a major discovery on their hands. They could breed colored sheep! What a saving for the wool industry! And that's exactly what they set about doing with hilarious results. A young Olivia NewtonJohn makes her film debut in this 1965 Australian musical comedy for the whole family!";

	schema:reviewBody "Chinese director Chen Kaige did the Chinese proud by directing Farewell My Concubine in 1993 which turns out to be the first Chinese film to receive an Academy Award nominations for Best Foreign Features 1994 and brings home The Golden Palm Awards in 1994 Cannes Film Festival.Farewell tells us a story of 2 Peking opera actors and the bond shared between both from the 1930's till the early 90's. Today Chen wants to bring the magic back again and here we have his latest feature Forever Enthralled. Also known as Mei Lanfang in Mandarin the film serves to be a tribute to the late Peking opera master Mei Lanfang who was not only well known for portraying female roles in the play but also being the first Chinese actor to performed in America.Sad to the say the magic seems to fail despite placing lots of effort to bring the life story of the late Peking opera master to screen.In a duration of 147 minutes you will see the life of Mei in three stages teenager young adult in his 20's and a more matured Mei in his 40's. Featuring Leon Lai as Mei in his adulthood and Sun Honglei as Qiu Rubai the movie should be renamed as 'Mei Lanfang and Qiu Rubai  The Two Sworn Brothers'. This can be supported with Qiu Rubai attracted and bedazzled with Mei's skills in portraying a female role which leads him to support Mei's career in various ways.From the young Mei Lanfang competing with his actor grandfather short romance with fellow actress Meng Xiaodong Zhang Ziyi after married to another fellow actress Fu Zhifang Chen Hong to how he refused to performed for the Japanese during World War 2 Qiu Rubai has always been with Mei Lanfang in all ways.The main highlight of the film which keeps the audience going on for more will be the first 50 minutes of the film. A teenage Mei Yu Shaoqun was a famous actor which makes him to go a path less traveled by changing the style in a Peking opera. The conflict between his grandfather and Mei shows how Mei wants to change the presentation of the opera so as to live up to the words left by his great grandfather where Mei is to bring Peking opera to a new level where actors gained their respects. By defying his grandfather's wishes and creates a new play Mei has become more famous than ever which leads him to his stardom for the next few decades.This is the only part of the story that really lives up to the title. The moment Mei reaches adulthood the story has fall flat unfortunately. Even when Chen Kaige wants to highlight the important point of Mei being the first Chinese actor to perform in America it fails to salvage the remaining parts of the story. Being the most important point of the story it was given a mere 10 minutes to summarize Mei's fame in America. Yu Shaoqun shines as a young Mei where not only he was given ample time to portray his inner struggle but also appears in various plays in the film. Leon however doesn't get much chance to put on the thick makeup and impersonates the beauties of the past in his play.Too much focuses were given to Mei's romance with Meng and how Mei refused to performed for the Japanese. Zhang's appearance of Meng takes up only 30 minutes of the story despite being highlighted as the leading actress. Apart from a bad dubbed over during her opera performances Zhang wasn't given much chance to explore her role. Chen Hong gets a bigger share in terms of appearances but less lines. Her appearance as a middleaged Fu Zhifang is a replacement of younger Fu Zhifang portrayed by Gillian Chung. Chung's appearance in the film has been removed after the nude photo scandal in 2008 which has unfortunately damaged part of the film. One will not know how Mei befriends Fu and in the later years of their life husband and wife.It was Sun Honglei who makes the film watchable. Playing Qiu Rubai from an adult to an elderly his influence towards Mei has changed Mei's life which was described in detail.It is not surprising that one will compare Forever Enthralled with Farewell My Concubine. In all Mei Lanfang shines in the real life but Farewell My Concubine will still be everyone's favorite in reel life.".

	schema:reviewBody "I got to watch this trailer inadvertently when it was part of a montage sequence honouring Chen Kaige with the Akira Kurosawa Award during last year's Tokyo International Film Festival and I was actually thrilled to have caught glimpses of it. I thought the booboys were out too early in lamenting Chen's choice of Leon Lai in the titular role thinking that he would ruin what would be a decent biopic about one of China's greatest opera singer.To me those fears were quite unfounded as I felt Leon Lai actually did reasonably well when under the thick operatic makeup to transform himself for his stage persona from Mei Wanhua to Mei Lanfang where portrays only female characters. But of course if put side by side with Chinese actor Yu Shaoqun Lai paled considerably as Yu was obviously the better of the two portraying the younger Mei who found his true calling when opportunity came knocking on his door and deciding to seize it yet being mindful all the time of where his roots were.And the best parts were of course the first act where Mei decides to up the ante and challenge his master the then largest opera star Shi Sanyan Wang Xueqi to a showdown of sorts if you will. Under his master's wing he finds himself somewhat stifled in not being able to explore his roles much further given the master's fear that his thunder will be stolen. At the encouragement of maverick magistrate and future sworn brother  business manager Qiu Rubai Sun Honglei he finds some new found confidence to test waters while still keeping true to the core of his character thus earning new praise and given one's talent with nothing much to lose one will go for broke  win and you win all lose and you have really no reputation at stake in contrary to his master.It's about control or the lack thereof. From early on we learn that actors in the days of the crumbling of the Chinese monarchy that they do not have any respect and have to play to the whims of those with power money and fame. Even then the child actors have to pander to lords with a penchant for young boys. Mei does not buckle his selfworth and is pretty clear that while he portrays ladies in more feminine terms than real ladies that it does not make him easy fodder. And we follow through his life how he does not get to live the life he wants to lead but rather according to both the rules and regulations of the stage as well as the same off it in society. Be it instructions from his managers his wife Zhifang Chen Hong or the Japanese occupiers each seemingly want to exert an influence over his career and personal life not so much for personal gain but to propagate that legend and persona so carefully crafted over the years.Naturally Mei finds an avenue to fight back and does so through an affair of the heart. While he portrays females on stage he meets his equal in Meng Xiaodong Zhang Ziyi who is his mirror opposite the best in the business in playing male characters. Together they blaze a trail of glory and naturally leads to tongues wagging. While Zhang Ziyi may share top billing in actual fact she's nothing more than a supporting role coming in only in the middle portion to highlight Mei's need for escape from his rigid world.Much is said about the supporting actors doing a far better job than the leads and that is true in a nice way. My respect for the Chinese actors have grown from watching a number of indie and mainstream films and I can't credit the likes of Sun Honglei Chen Hong Wang Xueqi and especially Yu Shaoqun in being nothing less than superb each time they come on screen to chew up the scenery. It's not really fair to say the leads acted poorly because the supporting cast had raised the bar in delivery which adds to the enjoyment of the film.I can never forget the really poor movie in The Promise which Chen Kaige made a couple of years back. The story was so bad it allowed the special effects to run wild in trying to salvage the show. There aren't a lot of Chinese biopics or at least those I have watched in recent years that were nonmartial arts related think Ip Man Wong FeiHung Fong SaiYuk Huo Yuanjia etc and somehow I'm glad Chen Kaige found his mojo back to helm this and in far elegant terms that I'm now better convinced to check out more of his filmography. He was able to shift gears quite effortlessly between distinct acts of the narrative which straddled a timeline from after the Qing Dynasty to after the surrender of the Japanese. However there might seem to be a quantum leap in addressing issues towards the last 30 minutes but for everything else it was paced quite evenly to keep you interest from waning.Forever Enthralled has all the ingredients of a credible epic from beautiful set designs and art direction to a wonderful soundtrack and elegant costumes Chen Kaige does not scrimp in making this film look and feel just like it would back in those days of sheer opulence. While opera may be an artform that is dwindling here don't let the Peking Opera focus here put you off as you just might find some reason to want to watch the real thing if you have the opportunity to. Definitely recommended.".

	schema:headline " CHEN Kaige back in form";
	schema:reviewBody "After going somewhat astray with Wu ji 2005 director Chen his loyal followers are happy to see is back in form with this biopic of China's legendary Beijing Opera icon MEI Lanfang. While general consensus has it that this film does not quite reach the height of Farewell my concubine 1993 it is a step in the right direction especially when you shudder at the realization of how low his onetime camera man ZHANG Yimou can sink with the likes of House of flying daggers 2004 and Curse of the golden flower 2006. People just have to realise that not everybody can be Ang Lee. But I digressed.Structurally twoandahalfhours Forever enthralled can be seen as a film in two parts. Part One comprising the first 60 minutes is young Mei without the stars Leon Lai and Ziyi Zhang. The ensuing 90 minutes is middleage Mei covering the main events in his life from a top artist's predicament an affair with a fellow artist tremendous challenge of bringing a totally alien art form to New York surviving with integrity and dignity during the Japanese occupation and triumphant return to the stage after victory. On the surface this second half should constitute the soul of the film. And indeed it is well acted and well shot. However if you can only see half of this film it should without question be the first half. It is just superb.Let me go into the second half first. Leon Lai portrays an introvert emotionally lonely Mei at the height of his career but seems to be in constant fear fear that he cannot maintain his performance at the pinnacle fear of life in general. While there are almost inevitable verdicts from some critics that he is pokerfaced Lai deserves better. While Mei shows little emotion at least as portrayed in this script there are times when nuances come through especially his transformation in the New York venture and his determined resistance of the Japanese demand that he perform during their occupation of Beijing. Lai in general handles his role credibly.While Mei pays little attention to anything outside his art two people virtually run his life. One is his mentor QIU Rubai played by the largerthanlife villain you saw in Seven swords 2005 SUN Honglei  playing against type  an actor of usually masculine parts finds fulfillment in the role of a thinker as a local magazine aptly asserts. It is a role that Sun fills extremely well stealing many a scene from our lead hero. The other is his pragmatic nononsense wife FU Zhifang played by CHEN Hong whom if you have seen the aforementioned Wu ji cannot fail to remember as Goddess Manshen with the most ridiculous hairstyle that anyone has ever seen. Chen has turned in a solid performance.Ziyi Zhang is billed as the female lead not so much because of the screen time she has been allocated as the importance of her role MENG Xiaodong an actress with whom Mei not only had the chance to collaborate but also to fall in love. In her relationship with Mei Meng is at various times coy flirty professional affectionate and coldly determined. This is the best yet that I have seen of Zhang's performance.This second half then has all the elements and ingredient of high melodrama. It plays out as such albeit at the high end of the scale of artistic melodrama.It is the first half that lifts this film a couple of notches. It has none of the stars in the second half except for Sun as Qiu appears very early in Mei's life. The theme of this first half is quite simple Mei's rise to stardom through a dual of artistic talent with his grandfather and teacher Shisanyan or thirteenth swallow his stage name. The two initially perform sidebyside but when Mei's quest for innovation becomes almost insatiable the two not only split up but also end up in fierce competition. There is no animosity only artistic pride and strive for excellence. Young YU Shaoqun plays youth Mei to perfection and would have you believe that he has decades of acting experience behind him. But it is veteran WANG Xueqi's the eccentric villain in The warriors of heaven and earth 2003 portrayal of Shisanyan that is above perfection. Rather than a onedimensional rigid old actor from the traditional school Shisanyan is a human being of flesh and blood proud but not vain never patronizing his grandson and protg who dares to challenge him. In Shisanyan's last show to an all but empty theatre we see two layers of unexcelled performance by Shisanyan with tragic pride and by Wang playing Shisanyan. Then there is the scene between young Mei and Shisanyan that will break the most cynical of hearts.The first hour of Forever enthralled is cinema at its best. The rest is just bonus.".

	onyx:emotionText "After going somewhat astray with Wu ji 2005 director Chen his loyal followers are happy to see is back in form with this biopic of China's legendary Beijing Opera icon MEI Lanfang. While general consensus has it that this film does not quite reach the height of Farewell my concubine 1993 it is a step in the right direction especially when you shudder at the realization of how low his onetime camera man ZHANG Yimou can sink with the likes of House of flying daggers 2004 and Curse of the golden flower 2006. People just have to realise that not everybody can be Ang Lee. But I digressed.Structurally twoandahalfhours Forever enthralled can be seen as a film in two parts. Part One comprising the first 60 minutes is young Mei without the stars Leon Lai and Ziyi Zhang. The ensuing 90 minutes is middleage Mei covering the main events in his life from a top artist's predicament an affair with a fellow artist tremendous challenge of bringing a totally alien art form to New York surviving with integrity and dignity during the Japanese occupation and triumphant return to the stage after victory. On the surface this second half should constitute the soul of the film. And indeed it is well acted and well shot. However if you can only see half of this film it should without question be the first half. It is just superb.Let me go into the second half first. Leon Lai portrays an introvert emotionally lonely Mei at the height of his career but seems to be in constant fear fear that he cannot maintain his performance at the pinnacle fear of life in general. While there are almost inevitable verdicts from some critics that he is pokerfaced Lai deserves better. While Mei shows little emotion at least as portrayed in this script there are times when nuances come through especially his transformation in the New York venture and his determined resistance of the Japanese demand that he perform during their occupation of Beijing. Lai in general handles his role credibly.While Mei pays little attention to anything outside his art two people virtually run his life.

	schema:reviewBody "Dear Director I can't help keeping comparing this movie with Farewell My Concubine one of the best Chinese movies I have seen which was also directed by you. Yes having the same director both tell us a story of Peking Opera singers and both cover a turbulent era of certain decades during the twentieth century in China. I have to say however this one is disappointing in many ways.I have no doubt about your directing skills just by watching Farewell My Concubine. There the roles were hysteria and it's original intensive surprising and thrilling. In Forever Enthralled you tried to use the exactly same style but unfortunately it feels unnatural and overdone as you were transfered from a brave pioneer to a boring follower of the previous yourself.Like all types of arts a real master piece can't be duplicated. Same as motion pictures. Farewell My Concubine is such a master piece that any mimicking trials afterwards intentionally or not turns out to fail even though they are from the same director. There's nothing wrong to make another film of Peking Opera singers but just don't use the same skill again and again.Dear Screen Play Writers Did you realize the story is unbalanced? The first half of this film drags too long and the pace is way too slow unnecessarily slow. I know you may want to emphasize Master Mei's earlier life experience that affected him so much but the title of this film is not The Teenager hood of Mei Lanfang.Visiting the US actually was an important experience of Mei and also a great step to give him the opportunity to gain the international fame. However your film made this part too weak. It's finished in such a hurry in the audiences' applause before I got a chance to focus on the singing of the leading actor. Is this a trick just because the actor couldn't perform the Opera well even though he is a pop singer? Check La Vie en Rose 2007 to see how a movie about a singer can make the singing magnificent.Dear Ziyi Zhang I didn't see much improvement of your acting skills from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Not bad but not good enough either. Yes I'm picky. But it has a long way to go before a actoractress becomes a top one.Dear Leon Lai Maybe they picked you for this role because you're a singer but this role turned out to be too weak and too blurry. Maybe this is not your fault. They just didn't select the right person to act Master Mei. Imagine in the movie Dream Girls 2006 if Beyonce played Effie White the situation would be insanely different.Dear Honglei Sun I usually don't like those characters you played in the movie but this one is an exception. Congratulations! You acted so well that I thought this movie should be called The Story of Mei and His Brother Qiu. YOU ARE LITERALLY THE LEADING ACTOR. They didn't give enough chance to let Mei sing but you got enough chance to act and acted the best compared with others in this movie. In this movie you were a super fan of Peking Opera and a super fan of Mei. You quit your staple teaching job and followed Mei to explore his career felt happier about his every success than himself worried him more than anybody else when he was in trouble and helped him become a real master. Good job! Good for Brother Qiu but not that good for this film because this film is not supposed to only focus on Brother Qiu.Dear Team Sorry frankly speaking this movie is not enthralled.".

It is not the same film and it did not strike me as a weak regurgitation of FMC. The plot kept me engaged and it did not feel too long in fact I would have liked to have known what happened afterwards. It is beautifully staged and the cinematography is excellent. How historically accurate the film is I'm not sure. If you read the Wikipedia article about Mei Lanfang his lovelife was rather more complicated and productive than portrayed. The major historical 'facts' I am sure are accurate. The portrayal of personal life relationships and emotions must inevitably be more conjecture and some aspects have to be simplified. Nevertheless I loved this film and it way exceeded my expectations. I also love Farewell My Concubine  in my opinion if you love that film you will most likely enjoy this one  though clearly other reviewers disagree!".

In fact I would say the fifth generation Chinese film directors are no longer worth watching. They have too much money and access and they are already devoid of stories to tell.Do not do what countless Chinese are doing going to the movie just to criticize it.

I had to agree with Tracy when she said the great director made Broken Back Mount again disguised in our traditional art form a mundane story in a luxurious robe  a bad metaphor or simile . The background music is genial triggering your memory for a film decades ago.Luckily the appearance of Zhang Ziyi at the middle of the stage in white robe halts the tune of love between two men. THe two lovers fall into love as planned a mediocre plot again. But destine or fate or enthusiasm for art or unfair life get them close to each other but separate them later no matter how much gallantry artists show on stage or in life. Although it's featured by super stars the protagonist fail to distinguish in continuous conflict of paradox every role seems to have his or her own charm to trigger sympathy from the audience. I want to say Pekin Opera is a traditional art of long and glorious history with a galaxy of artists dedicated to it. Maybe it's true sometimes it is associated with hidden oppression on human emotion and thinking and manifest its extremism in aestheticism in seeming like abnormality of human being or sometimes the Pekin opera singers outdid themselves in rendition of blend of sentiments however the tremendous artistic beauty survives the deviation from authentic art.".

To sum this film up its basically John Woo's take on Vietnam but it really hits you harder than any Nam film ive ever seen.  Woo pours alot of thought and emotion into the script and characters making it more than his shootoutgangster outings.  the film never pretends to have a positive connotation and the ending is absolutely one of the best endings in HK cinema.

Watching this film is a nightmare because it just doesnt stop till nearly everyone is dead. What it makes so attracting is the fact that it works this film is the climax of its genre it is hard to imagine that any film can be more focused on violence than this film. Its also hard to tell entertainment from rejection and thats what John Woo can do better than anyone. His intensity in violence is close to Pasolinis 120 Days Of Sodom And Gomorrha and some films of David Lynch but he does it in his own unique consequent ways which certainly generated a new set a new style and standard in filming. This film though not so amusing as hard boiled got 10 instead of 9 because of its extraordinary strangeness.

A Bullet In The Head would be a tale about friendship overcoming the hard times of war if the friendships in the movie actually prevailed. Instead the movie gives us a heart wrenching look at war and what it does to the three friends in the movie. The kids in the movie are in the beginning not very sympathetic and give off the impression that they deserve what they get but once they go to Vietnam you realize just how much in over their head they are and Woo filters the emotion from this situation and effectively conveys a story that is hard to watch but very rewarding nonetheless. After witnessing the debacle of Windtalkers I decided to see if Woo could direct war well it goes without saying this blows that one out of the water.

	schema:reviewBody "In 1989 John Woo made a film that would simultaneously redefine and reinvent the action genre forever. The film I speak of is of course The Killer. Blending a touching storyline with exuberant gunfights The Killer worked through excess and it was an absolute delight to be behold. It's hard to follow up on something like that and for his next Aclass feature Bullet in the Head John Woo wasn't quite able to recreate that what he did so incredibly well a year earlier. However what he has created is still an excellent thrill ride and one that fans of The Killer wont want to miss! Woo is keen to keep that gang element from The Killer except this time he fuses it was action from the Vietnam war and as the story spans across many different locations it can aptly be considered an epic. We follow the stories of three young men who leave Hong Kong after two of them kill another gang member. They decide to become smugglers and take advantage of the Vietnam War but little did they know that they would end up in the thick of it.The film takes obvious influence from the classic Vietnam war dramas such as 'The Deer Hunter' and 'Platoon' but through Woo's stylising it takes on a life of it's own and stands apart from those films that influenced it. Woo is known for going over the top and seeing three men in suits in the middle of the Vietnam war is over the top alright! However also going over the top is the sentiment and I don't know if it's just the way that Chinese translates into English or what but this film is definitely cheesy! The sentiment boded well in The Killer but here it definitely doesn't and the film would be a lot better if the amount of sentiment was more realistic. The sentiment messes up the characters as well as the film too as seeing one or more of them break into great long speeches undermines the fact that they're supposed to be criminals. However all this doesn't matter once you get into the gun battles which are incredible to say the least. If it wasn't for the sentiment it would have been a complete whole but it's still a damn good movie regardless.".

The sentiment messes up the characters as well as the film too as seeing one or more of them break into great long speeches undermines the fact that they're supposed to be criminals. However all this doesn't matter once you get into the gun battles which are incredible to say the least. If it wasn't for the sentiment it would have been a complete whole but it's still a damn good movie regardless.";

Jackie Cheung in particular was amazing.  Of his three acting nominations that year this was the leading actor nomination he earned at the Hong Kong Film Awards and I can't believe he didn't win.  The POW sequence was so sad so tragic so powerful so moving. Maybe The Deer Hunter was as moving to me.  Maybe.Anyway this truly is John Woo's Apocalypse Now.

	schema:reviewBody "If you've never seen a John Woo movie before you're in for one hell of a surprise about forty minutes into Bullet in the Head. Up until this point there has been violence in the film but it has mostly been restricted to street level brawling clashes between armed police and war protesters in Saigon and punch ups in Hong Kong slums. Then at the height of an argument in a Triad owned nightclub things get turned up to eleven as Waise Lee pulls a machine gun from out of a piano and massacres an entire room full of gangsters in one breathtaking swoop. After this things barely let up as Woo mixes in harrowing prison camp madness with over the top gun battles. If this implies that Bullet in the Head has no heart however then nothing could be further from the truth not only is this an incredibly violent movie it might also be Woo's most emotional.Stamped over everything is in the indelible trace of the Tiananmen square massacre which might explain the film's poor showing in Hong Kong where it played to the people who faced it first hand far too soon for them to embrace it. Over fifteen years later though Bullet In The Head could do with a reappraisal so that it might stand on its own two feet rather than simply being viewed as an Eastern alternative to The Deer Hunter or Apocalypse Now.The Eastern setting though provides a fresh spin on the Vietnam war which had already been captured on camera by an America eager to exorcise the ghosts of the war. The story of three ghetto youths Waise Lee Jackie Cheung and future superstar Tony Leung forced to flee Hong Kong it captures them in their early days before sending them to Saigon where the trio intend to take advantage of the war and make a fortune. Needless to say things do not go entirely as planned and they have to flee once more with a box filled with gold they have captured from a local kingpin. Unfortunately for them there is nowhere to run but into the Vietconginfected jungle...For the first time the true scale of the war is made readily apparent. In the East it is sometimes known as The Second Indochina War as the conflict didn't restrict itself to Vietnam itself spilling over into neighbouring Cambodia and Laos and affecting everyday citizens of countries who weren't even involved. Woo's vision of the 1960's Far East is one of unprecedented chaos triggered by the clash of Capitalist and Communist ideologies where suicide bombs are detonated in traffic jams and citizens plucked from the street to have their heads blown off by overzealous military police. It's an uncompromising vision and no mistake.All of this is told from the eyes of our heroic trio and the effects of the war leave an impression on all of them. Their friendship is tested to the limit and watching it dissolving countercut with earlier moments when they were smiling happy youngsters is nigh on heartbreaking. Corny yes but still heartbreaking.However for those of you have seen a John Woo film before and want action on an unprecedented scale well look no further. The aforementioned nightclub battle is just an impressive iceberg tip as Woo hurtles the characters from one set piece to the next with a riotous enthusiasm. A riverside gun fight keeps things moving followed by skirmishes in the jungle and a breath taking helicopter assault on a Vietcong camp bullets flying in all directions as fireballs bloom upwards and bodies contort in slow motion death rattles. Provided you've got the unedited version you'll also see a climactic car duel that is better than anything he has done since moving to the States.Action junkies then will be well sated but what about the rest of us who want bold creative film making that doesn't have to rely on helicopter explosions to make a point? Well Bullet in the Head delivers four career defining performances from the leads a cathartic and emotional script a harrowing impression of a world with a collapsing social order and a stark political message on the worries of Hong Kong citizens regarding their fate in the 1997 handover. All that's missing is a love story...oh wait there's one at the beginning. Admittedly sometimes it is a bit too violent for its own good and Woo could have eased off the throttle to let it breathe a bit but this is still a film worth catching and a career high point for the auteur.".

Director John Woo is definitely one of the most contemporary action directors around. He spares no punches or bullets with his incredible bursts of action sequences yet he can still deliver a striking message about the powers of morality and how a humane attitude can help overcome all opposition. BULLET IN THE HEAD has more than enough action to satiate viewers of effervescent action films.

The disturbing violence in this movie grips the audience as it coerces them to feel the pain.

This film has excellent action scenes and a constant mix of feelings as the movie jerks around with the character's emotions. They range from victorious to heartbroken to horrific.  The cast including the three leads along with Simon Yam and Fennie Yuen are excellent.BULLET IN THE HEAD may well be John Woo's best film. Although the graphic violence in BULLET IN THE HEAD is unbearable it is not gratuitous.  The inhumanity of the supercilious villains is shown as they evoke trepidation in their victim's eyes.  BULLET IN THE HEAD is one violent relentlessly brutal yet provocative thriller.If you feel that you are mature enough to handle the violence in BULLET IN THE HEAD then by all means rent this film. You'll discover the true brilliance of John Woo in this rarely seen film in America. He has talent for creating some of the most versatile action films ever! Thrills character development and a thoughtprovoking plot all commingle together in BULLET IN THE HEAD.  This is one movie that is impossible to watch throughout its entire duration without cringing but the chance to see this rare gem is well worth the time.RATING 12 out of .".

When I first saw it theatrically it became my favorite film ever... and is still high on my top ten list. I saw it with the office ending and it's the ending I will always prefer. Why? Because it's tonally consistent. The car chase ending is not. It is sloppily directed. Woo tries to make it resonate by intercutting the bike riding sequence but it feels forced. The sequence has no reason to exist. The film is extremely powerful and has sequences that are unforgettable  Ben bidding his wife farewell during a student demonstration the murder of Ringo the pee drinking scene Frank's final moments Simon's Yam's stylish intro the list is endless. The score by James Wong and Romeo Diaz is one of the greatest ever and takes its melodic cues from I'm A Believer The Monkeys. It is an extraordinary piece of work and it is a screaming insult that it is not available on CD. Tony Leung's performance as Ben is riveting and this is the film that truly showcased his awesome talent. The action sequences are Woo's strongest and most realistic and the cinematography is amazing. The opening twenty minutes are virtually dialogfree as Woo establishes the daytoday lives of his three protagonists Leung Waise Lee and Jacky Cheung and sets up their destiny. The emotional build is extremely powerful and the depiction of war is graphic insane and hideous. Ultimately Bullet in the Head is a devastating experience and testament to John Woo's incredible talent. Nothing he has made since has come even close to the cinematic majesty of this masterpiece.".

	schema:headline " Heroic Bloodshed on the grandest possible scale never seen before or after";
	schema:reviewBody "Saw BITH on DVD last night after watching it once years ago on TV. I found it surprising the impression it gave me this time is completely different. I did not actually seem to be impressed by it at all when it was shown on a local TV channel but is now completely overwhelmed when I watched it again on DVD last night. I suppose this movie must be enjoyed uninterrupted by TV commercials in order to get to grips with the atmosphere it created. From casual and lighthearted to brutal and deadserious. In other words it requires no less than totally focused attention from the audience.I'd like to clear the air for those fans who considered this movie involving the war in IndoChina is something of a first for Woo. Woo actually did a littleknown jungle warfare movie called Ying xiong wei lei Heros Shed No Tears in the early 80's on a shoestring budget of a story about the Thai government hires group of Chinese mercenaries to capture powerful druglord from Golden Triangle before he became famous in 1986 for his gangster classic A Better Tomorrow.In BITH Woo succeeded in recreating the nostalgic look and feel of the 1960's Hong Kong and Vietnam. The characters and events all appeared so genuine and real. I appreciate it as a great movie from the following anglesIn Hong Kong the street lives of those gangster youths vividly coincided with the antiBritish riots in the then Crown Colony. The three protagonists living life in poverty turf wars and a little romance over a backdrop of terrifying bombing campaign waged by proChairman Mao rioters met by brutal clampdown from the Hong Kong police in full riot gears all being exactly shown as how it would look in those unforgettable days. The scene showing a British bomb disposal expert deactivating a bomb is very true. I still remember in real life seeing the gruesome news picture of one of these guys got his arm blown off while doing such a nasty job in the Wanchai district. All these strongly convinces the audience why the three friends apart from a murder case hanging over two of them have good reasons to leave and go somewhere else.In Saigon the endless antiwar street protests leading to violent bloodshed daredevil assassinations met by ruthless summary executions the ever present pack of International photojournalists chasing after their opportunity of a good news story Chinese businessmen living in the country wheeling and dealing with the Vietnamese from North and South. Those mainly Americans and other foreigners who had the means enjoy themselves in seedy nightclubs as if nothing unusual was happening outside where life was so chaotic that looters could be anybody including the soldiers.In the Vietnamese jungle the three friends and the local hitman character went through a harsh lesson of survival including escape through unfamiliar terrain intense firefights frequent bickering unsavory POW camp rituals and a spectacular lastminute rescue by commandos and helicopters. A lesson of survival in which the temptation of getting rich quick was too much for one of the friends to resist leading to more tragic events. Although some of the scenes would remotely remind audience of Hollywood movie The Deer Hunter the fact is that the two are very different in many ways. Just as you can't really say The Great Escape and The Bridge on River Kwai are similar. Back in Hong Kong the two friends who managed to return had to confront each other in a finale that brought the whole story like a rollercoaster to an abrupt end.IMHO BITH is Heroic Bloodshed on the grandest possible scale never seen before or after.".

I did not actually seem to be impressed by it at all when it was shown on a local TV channel but is now completely overwhelmed when I watched it again on DVD last night. I suppose this movie must be enjoyed uninterrupted by TV commercials in order to get to grips with the atmosphere it created. From casual and lighthearted to brutal and deadserious. In other words it requires no less than totally focused attention from the audience.I'd like to clear the air for those fans who considered this movie involving the war in IndoChina is something of a first for Woo.

	schema:reviewBody "I only bought this because it was part of The John Woo Collection and having watched it I'm glad that I bought it as it is a good film although it isn't as good as The Killer or Hard Boiled. The action doesn't stop from the beginning to the end. I was expecting it to be a war film as it is mostly set in Vietnam during the war however it is really an action film that happens to be set during a war.Three friends decide to flee from Hong Kong when the police are after them for the killing of a local gang leader. They decide to head to Saigon believing they will be able to make a quick buck selling items they brought with them on the black market. Unfortunately for them their items are destroyed when a bomber blows up the taxi they were in during an attack on a high ranking ARVN officer. After witnessing the summary execution of the bomber they realise what they need to make money in Saigon is a gun. They soon meet up with their contact and acquire guns with these they steal a crate of gold from a local gangster in the process they rescue a singer who gets wounded in the escape. Their escape plan does not go as well as planned and they find themselves prisoners of the NVA. I've tried to keep the spoilers to a minimum so as not to spoil the story for those who have yet to see it.As one would expect from a John Woo film there is plenty of action in fact there is hardly a scene that doesn't involve fighting or shooting. The action looks good if a little unbelievable our pistol carrying friends seem to be able to beat machinegun carrying ARVN and NVA soldiers along with a hoard of gangsters. I'd recommend this to anybody who likes action films or is interested in seeing a Vietnam movie that isn't centred on the Americans.".

Jacky Cheung Surprisiing me at least gives a great performance.I will admit never liked Jacky Cheung as an Actor he was too overthe top for me but he gives an amazing performance as the goofy lovable Frank his performance is yes a bit goofy but he gets away with it in the end when goes crazy and I'm Amaze how he did a great job pulling it off.Waise Lee however unlike Tony Leung and Jacky Cheung his performance isn't that great which is a shame given the performance he gave in A better tomorrow was great.Past the lead Simon Yam does well with his small Role it's a shame he wasn't given much because his character was interesting.overall great film watch it see for your self.".

	schema:reviewBody "John Woo's Die Xue Jie Tou of 1990 is a great and intense action film that definitely keeps what its international a.k.a. titles Bullet in the HeadBloodshed In The Streets promise. This must be one of the most bloodsoaked ultraviolent and toughminded action flicks of the 90s and even though I personally liked Woo's earlier films A Better Tomorrow and The Killer even more Bullet In The Head is also a great film that lovers of violent action and uncompromising cinema can not allow themselves to miss! The Killer and A Better Tomorrow were not exactly Disney flicks either more precisely they are exceptionally violent films too but Bullet In The Head even surpasses them in means of brutality and is easily the most violent film by John Woo who wasn't exactly known for his tame films back in his Hong Kong days.After an incident in Hong Kong in which a person is killed three friends decide to go to Vietnam in order to get rich as quickly as possible. The time is 1967 and the wartorn country is pure hell but also a promising opportunity for people looking for nothing but a quick fortune...All three leading men Tony Leung Chiu Wai Jacky Cheung and Waise Lee are great in their roles especially Leung is outstanding. The supporting performances are also very good Simon Yam is especially worth mentioning. Both the story itself and the graphic depiction of violence is uncompromising and exceptionally brutal. But Bullet in the Head is not only recommended for its brutality. This is raw stunning Action cinema in its purest form and no lover of cinema can afford to miss the brilliance of John Woo's Hong Kong cinema. John Woo truly is an exceptional director of action cinema. None other than Horror genius Sam Raimi has once stated that Woo is for Action cinema what Hitchcock was for the Thriller and regarding the Hong Kongproduced films I agree. Sadly John Woo is mostly associated with silly blockbusters of the MI 2 kind since he went to Hollywood but the films he made back in Hong Kong such as Bullet in the Head still shine out as true gems of cinematic greatness!".

Reportedly John Woo was originally going to make A Better Tomorrow III for producer Tsui Hark using a large part of the storyline that appears in this film but some rather outrageous tension on the set of A Better Tomorrow II and only slightly less difficulty on A Better Tomorrow caused him to back out of that project which was rewritten and directed by Tsui Hark. This stunning movie is what John Woo created while Tsui Hark put out the much less worthy continuation of what Mr. Woo started. By this I do not mean to suggest that A Better Tomorrow III is a bad film It is somewhat above average but very far from being of Bullet in the Head's level of excellence.Storyline Three friends from Hong Kong find adventure terror tragedy and their own true natures when they end up in Vietnam during the war. Tony Leung Jackie Cheung and Waise Lee are the friends and Simon Yam is an initially enigmatic mercenary they meet in Vietnam. Leung is the star but Waise Lee is outstanding and Simon Yam shows that he is indeed capable of giving an excellent nuanced performance. As for Jackie Cheung I think that his performance here would be singled out for praise in most films but he is competing with great performers and doesn't quite measure up.".

Despite their best efforts though they become a part of the war. Woo's best movie and one of the best movies about the Vietnam War ever made giving a fresh slant to the conflict. Woo's scripts are often weak but this one time he came up with a story that perfectly dramatized his general concerns about the conflict between good and evil spiritual values and materialistic ones. The early parts of the story sound corny and naive but for once they should  this is after all a story about lost innocence. Woo's movies are also action showcases sometimes to the extent of depersonalizing the conflicts making it all choreography. Not really a knock my favorite Woo movie HARD BOILED epitomizes that approach. That doesn't happen here though  the violence is still wonderfully choreographed but it has weight it feels very meaningful. It can jab out of nowhere and it's presence is always seen as crazy and frightening. The sequences in the POW camp as well as Jackie Cheung's final fate are very intense in part because Woo connects the dots here between ideas and action. Superb acting by everyone concerned though Waise Lee hams it up a bit at the end. Tony Leung one of my favorite Asian actors does another classy job his eyes and his stance chart his character's growth from a callow child to a weary understanding adult. Simon Yam is also quite good doing a mean Alain Delon impersonation here. Somber and sad with a weight of personal feeling behind it. This once everything worked right for Woo.".

It was interesting to see this war through the eyes of someone besides American GI's for once.  The protagonists arrive full of optimism sure that fortune is just around the corner and that their camaraderie will persevere through all.  Needless to say things don't go as smoothly as they planned and the ensuing trials they endure have drawn welldeserved favorable comparison to the best American depictions of the war The Deer Hunter Apocalypse Now etc.If you are a Woo fan who hasn't experienced Bullet in the Head go rent it now.  Same goes for those whose taste runs to war movies.  It's not for everyone though.  Anyone upset by violence should steer a clear path.10 out of 10  Probably the best of all the Hong Kong movies.".

Together Woo has delivered some Brilliant Movies like Hard Boiled and A Better Tomorrow. I didn't expect much from Bullet in the head when i first rented it out. It doesn't star Chow Yun Fat and its a little bit of a war movie which i don't fancy. After watching the Movie All i can say is not only is this the Best John Woo movie I've ever seen. It is among one of the Greatest Movies of all time. After i watched it once i bought the VHS and as soon as the double disk DVD came out i had to buy the DVD. John Woo has mentioned in the Special features that this is his personal favourite movie since he has put a lot of effort in this movie. The Acting was Superb from all Stars especially Tony Leung and Jackie Cheung. The violent Scenes were directed Magnificently. The ending twist was very surprisingly emotional and Brilliantly directed. Till this day i never found any movie emotional. I can admit after watching this movie it did get to me. 1010".

As far as i know the film also had a very limited theater release in the USA which is a sad thing because this movie was surprisingly good and wellcrafted and was one of the best films I've seen in the last months.The film tells the true story of Danny Greene a tough irish gangster  and let me tell you it is definitely a story worth telling.I guess many of you are informed about the story of Danny Greene so i won't go further into the story.The movie features an impressive cast including Ray Stevenson Val Kilmer Christopher Walken and many other familiar faces known from other mob movies. Ray Stevenson gives an incredibly good performance as Danny Greene and manages to keep his character really violent but also likable. This movie could give him a career boost for bigger roles.The direction and the cinematography are very nice and i'm hoping this movie will enable Jonathan Hensleigh more work soon because he's definitely a talented craftsman.In some reviews i read that other people complained that this movie is just a ripoff of Goodfellas. That isn't true. The movie stands well on his own despite featuring some actors known from Goodfellas and wasn't that also the case in Shows like The Sopranos? Why complain about that? And last but not least it IS a true story and who grows sick of seeing good mobster movies? Definitely not me.".

In addition to Greene and Nardi many of the cast members were familiar mob types and testosterone was practically flying off the screen in the midst of bravado fistfights gunfire and countless explosions. But there was an actual story to follow also so it offered more substance than much of the drivel that manages to run in the theatres today.Even though they were gangsters Greene and Nardi were surprisingly likable charactersfor killers that ismostly because of the charismatic acting of the two leads Ray Stevenson and Vincent D'Onofrio. The supporting characters were interesting also including the talents of Christopher Walken Val Kilmer Steve Schirripa Paul Sorvino Tony Lo Bianco and Mike Starr.Interspersed with the actors' scenes were actual clips of film footage from local newscasts of the day which added authenticity and a touchstone to the amazing story that unfolded in Cleveland some 3040 years ago.I highly recommend Kill the Irishman as an actionpacked escapist period piece featuring superior acting and excellent film editing.

Ray Stevenson and Linda Cardellini give exceptional performances as Danny and Joan Greene in this hard hitting story based on his life. Unlike many biodramas this one moves along at a rocket pace leaving the audience on the edge of their seats. D'Onofrio is exceptional in this role as is Christopher Walken and you have to wonder how Stevenson keeps up with such powerful performers but he does. Lots of favorite character actors dress up this larger than life scenario including the lovely and always enticing Fionnula Flanagan as the neighbor Mike Starr as one of Tony Lo Biano's enforcers and Bob Gunton as the Union President who can't stand on his own. Paul Sorvino gives us the perfect NYC mob boss image and while his role is brief it's a performance worth watching. Val Kilmer's role as the police officer who grew up with Greene is subdued but he carries it off with the right tone and balance to the film. Since a great film always comes down to the director we have to give Jonathon Hensleigh a resounding round of applause for this fascinating and entertaining portrait of the underworkings of the mob. Rated R for violence language and sexual situations if you like films like the Godfather Goodfellas Casino etc you are going to love this one. And if you are a fan of those this needs to be added to your collection.".

	schema:reviewBody "'KILL THE IRISHMAN' Three and a Half Stars Out of Five Another organized crime biopic this one focuses on the infamous 70's union rep turned gangster Danny Greene. The film stars B movie tough guy and notable character thug Ray Stevenson as Greene. It was written with cowriter Jeremy Walters and directed by Jonathan Hensleigh and adapted from the book 'To Kill The Irishman' by Rick Porrello. Hensleigh is most well known for writing and cowriting such blockbuster action films as 'DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE' and 'ARMAGEDON'. He also directed the films 'WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE' and 'THE PUNISHER' which it's sequel 'PUNISHER WAR ZONE' starred Stevenson. The film costars the likes of Vincent D'Onofrio Val Kilmer Christopher Walken Linda Cardellini Vinnie Jones Robert Davi Paul Sorvino and other well known character actors. It's a little clichd and by the numbers it's certainly nothing we haven't seen before in the gangster crime genre but it is entertaining and interesting to a certain extent more so than a lot of others in my opinion.Danny Greene was a well known Irish gangster in Cleveland in the 1970's. He started his career in organized crime working as a longshoreman labor union representative until he was busted. He was released in an arrangement that he would turn over any information and evidence he uncovered in his future crime dealings to the police which he did very little of. He was eventually loved and admired by the public as sort of a modern day Robin Hood and hated by his criminal rivals. He became famously hard to kill as he continued to miraculously survive many attempts on his life. The film focuses on his relationships with fellow criminal businessmen including John Nardi D'Onofrio and Shondor Birns Walken as well as his family other love interests Laura Ramsey and a local cop Kilmer he knew since he was a kid.I'm not a big fan of biopics or mobster films like this. I admire the film craftsmanship of popular crime films like 'THE GODFATHER' and 'GOODFELLAS' but they're far from my favorite films. I don't especially like the element that the viewer is left with no one to root for and all of the lead characters are pretty morally despicable although organized criminals probably have a lot higher standards and respectable moral qualities than most other successful businessman. With that said the film is more fascinating and entertaining than most others of it's type. The actors are all good and well cast especially Stevenson. He's always been a cool action bad ass in films before but here he's really given a chance to show off his acting abilities and range. His performance combined with Hensleigh's better than average directing make the film one definitely worth checking out. Probably especially if you're a fan of the genre.".

The film focuses on his relationships with fellow criminal businessmen including John Nardi D'Onofrio and Shondor Birns Walken as well as his family other love interests Laura Ramsey and a local cop Kilmer he knew since he was a kid.I'm not a big fan of biopics or mobster films like this. I admire the film craftsmanship of popular crime films like 'THE GODFATHER' and 'GOODFELLAS' but they're far from my favorite films. I don't especially like the element that the viewer is left with no one to root for and all of the lead characters are pretty morally despicable although organized criminals probably have a lot higher standards and respectable moral qualities than most other successful businessman. With that said the film is more fascinating and entertaining than most others of it's type. The actors are all good and well cast especially Stevenson. He's always been a cool action bad ass in films before but here he's really given a chance to show off his acting abilities and range. His performance combined with Hensleigh's better than average directing make the film one definitely worth checking out. Probably especially if you're a fan of the genre.";

In the year 1976 in Cleveland 36 bombs went off but could they get Danny Greene?Based on the life events of Irish American gangster Danny Greene KILL THE IRISHMAN is by far one the most involved movies I have watched of its kind. Danny Greene a gangster from Cleveland in 1970s is a man with pride and honor. Quite unusual traits for a gangster don't you think? Exactly what I did think as well until I completed the whole movie! Danny Greene's story brings to light the hardships that certain people go through to meet their ends in life. Although not most of them are legal methods sometimes these seem to be the only way out for some of them. Most learned folk at this point would think I am a few screws lose upstairs to agree with an illegal approach to life. I sincerely believe that all humans will tread paths they never would if they too are pushed to extreme limits. This is just me however I am sure some may feel that to die with hunger is better than steal try it and let me know! Please note I am not promoting criminals since Danny Greene's revelation is entirely different. Danny Greene earned his bread and butter until the associations abused them and illtreated them. Danny stood up to them and took over the associations and became a selffound businessman. However when authorities came for him few years later he did not run he had the courage to stand up to his faults. Ray Stevenson Christopher Walken Vincent D'Onofrio and Val Kilmer bring to life the dark early 1970s of Cleveland. I am impressed of the precision performances. Especially Ray Stevenson he is amazing and its wise choice by the casting directors to go with an unfamiliar face although Ray Stevenson has appeared in a fair number of movies since it's a biography of an actual person. I believe Ray Stevenson fits into the character with ease rather than to have a Hollywood regular play the protagonist. I need not speak about Christopher Walken you put him in front of a camera and wonders emerge. Val Kilmer's weight does not stop him from slamming a great performance either. Unison is what it is with these men pulling the movie through.A very appropriate and touching soundtrack evokes a great emotion within me. Much like BRAVE HEART or ROBIN HOOD PRINCE OF THIEVES she captures and wraps me with a strange enchantment. It's like a spell I need to admit there were moments in the early parts of the movie where I did consider switching it off. The interest did not seem to be consistent. In my terms the attention span of the viewer is violated with Jonathan Hensleighs directorial approach. It lost me a few times however it did not LOSE me. I am having difficulty expressing what I felt let me try to elaborate. It's like water tasteless however after a long night when you wake up dehydrated after one too many drinks and that one glass of water you have at that point of time is the perfect drink. This is the only way I can bring myself to explain the feeling of this movie.A definite skip for those who look out for action and cleverly choreographed fight sequences. A good one for the mature audience who savor biographies and slow paced dramas.This is how I see it nothing more nothing less!Title Kill the Irishman Directed by Jonathan Hensleigh Starring Ray Stevenson Vincent D'Onofrio Val Kilmer Robert Davi Vinnie Jones  Christopher Walken Rated R for strong violence and some sexual contentnudity Rating 0710 106 Minutes".

Being of Irish decent the aspect of this one Irish guy who kept getting on the Italian mob's nerves it peaked my interest. The film has a great story to tell and I can only imagine how amazing the film would have been if they had a director like Martin Scorsese behind the camera. That's what I kept feeling while I watched this film that it was a Scorsese wannabe. That's not exactly a bad thing because I did enjoy the film but I wanted to enjoy it so much more. There are aspects of the film that are great and if a masterful craftsman were behind the camera than I can honestly see this film being one of the best of the year. The film feels short on a lot of things mainly the small things that would have made this film great. The relationship between him and his wife was nonexistent. The smaller characters played by Christopher Walken Val Kilmer and Vinnie Jones deserved more screen time. There was a relationship between Stevenson and Kilmer that was interesting as one was a cop and the other a known mobster but the film decided not to dive any further than two scenes. I hate to throw Goodfellas into the mix but had the story been crafted more like that film then this could have been great. The story is based on true events with some liberties of course. Some of the special effects like the car bombings are incredibly poor. A story like this deserves a bit more attention to detail from the writer and director. It felt like they loved the story but didn't know exactly how to tell it. Again if they had proper backing in the budget department then this film would have been really great. The car bombing scenes are really poorly done and this is such an integral part of the film. Some of them are actual explosions others aren't. It's poor production values stick with the real thing. Kill the Irishman is a good movie when it should be a great movie. In terms of gangster flicks it's one of the better ones. It's nowhere near the calibre of Goodfellas or Donnie Brasco. It feels like the odd film that wants to be apart of the family. It just falls short of admittance. A good film is good film though.".

	schema:headline " True story of famous '70's Cleveland based Irish mobster Danny Greene";
	schema:reviewBody "I've been pretty excited about getting my hands on this film for some time now without knowing very much about it. But watch the trailer and if you're a fan of your 'Goodfellas' 'Donnie Brasco's and 'Casino's then you'll probably relate.'Kill The Irishman' has been called the best film since 'Goodfellas' as was stated on the DVD box that came in the mail today. Now all that tells a man to begin with is that the film is the best imitation of 'Goodfellas' there's been since 'Goodfellas' was introduced to cinemas and VHS tapes. Fear not it is actually good enough to compare to the many times already aforementioned gangster classic and what comes as a surprise is pretty much everything about the film.Firstly a synopsis. Danny Greene's story  narrated by Val Kilmer who lends some heavy support throughout the film  tells of a tough Irishman working the grain silos at the Cleveland Docks whose rise to infamy begins when he goes to work for the mafia after a jail term for larceny makes headlines due to his muscling in on his former factory boss's business.Greene is an old fashioned street fighting man who will stand up to anybody and although readily willing to commit crimes to make money he is an honest and caring man by nature and this quickly endears us to the complex character so easily portrayed by Irishborn up and coming actor Ray Stevenson. I say up and coming but if you're British you'll already know him for television and minor film roles. If you're American you may know him for 'King Arthur' 'Outpost' 'Book of Eli' and 'Punisher War Zone'.As events unfold and just as Greene became unhappy with his factory boss he sees the mafia acting unfairly abusively and little involved. He declares that he will go into business for himself meaning that he will inevitably have to declare war on the Italian mafia. Naturally what follows is the titular plot the mafia attempting and failing over the duration of many years to hit the unflappable Irishman as he goes to great lengths to rub it in their faces and get revenge where necessary.The film based mostly in Cleveland throughout postwar '70's America looks and feels authentic but it is the strong earthy Irish charm that sets it apart from all those old classic ItallianAmerican gangster films and a style of filmmaking that sometimes takes you back even as far as the forties for its occasionally rich filmnoir texture.What I find amazing because this is actually no huge Hollywood film is that 'Kill The Irishman' boasts a hugely classic cast including Val Kilmer Heat Christopher Walken explanation??? Vincent D'Onofrio Law  Order Paul Sorvino Goodfellas and Robert Davi Die Hard and The Goonies to name a few. They're all very admirably cast in familiar roles some unfamiliar which works in favour of plot tiwsts and help to endear us towards a film that is actually very down to earth and sometimes even hilarious for a such a darkly toned crime drama.What surprised me the most is the link I made earlier on as I looked over the cast and crew of the film. Ray Stevenson the last man to portray killer exmilitary vigilante Frank Castle AKA The Punisher being directed as the film's lead by Jonathan Hensleigh director of the 2004 Thomas Jane version of The Punisher. And the team works brilliantly. Hensleigh who I associated with slow and simplistic storytelling since the latter has really thrown a curveball with this one and I can't help but wonder what if Hensleigh had directed Stevenson as the Punisher instead what kind of comic crime caper would we have gotten then? Kill The Irishman boasts some hilariously offensive dialogue that cannot be mistaken for anything but Irish the film to me at first glance was authentic and quite realistic and I recommend it to everyone with a fully functioning brain and heart. 'Kill The Irishman' is one of the best dramas on offer at this moment!".

'Kill The Irishman' is one of the best dramas on offer at this moment!";

	schema:headline " Irishman is iconic tour de force";
	schema:reviewBody "I was surprised at how this was a really well told story.It was made in 2011 but took place in the mid 70s. It is the story of Danny Greene an Irish mobster who would not sell out to the Italian mafia as they fought over turf in Cleveland.And the Director Jonathan Hensleigh did a great job on the direction and script. Too many who knew him Danny had a 'good' side and a bad side and it was represented in the movie. Danny served Turkeys at holidays saved an old lady from an explosion yet easily planted a bomb to eliminate adversaries. Jonathan told the story in 70's film language which has a lot of natural lighting some hand held camera realistic scenes and sort of a cinemaverite feel to the movie. This made the film seem like a documentary but without the ponderous narrator and constant talking heads. Hensleigh told the story with action and character. The lighting film stock and camera work was reminiscent of The French Connection a gritty 70's film.Ray Stevenson was almost a look alike for the real Danny Greene and added to the realism of the story.Even the fights were very realistic. There was no whack thwack of a bamboo rod on leather as is typically overdone in movies. Those fights are a realism unmatched in cinema. a they did not go on forever with high kicks and constant up and down moments for the hero. b sound of fist heating a chin was very real. Fights aren't an array of sound effects. c most real fights end pretty quickly as in the movie a few punches and the guy is down and you beat him up he doesn't keep popping up like a whack a mole after being knocked out. Thank goodness the fights didn't go on forever with 'artsy' camera angles.The feel of this movie was gritty and matched the grittiness of the story and labor garbage and longshoreman activities and you didn't feel the supporting cast was acting but that you were watching a mafia spy cam on their activities. See the extra features and the movie is pretty much the real story. The supporting cast of name actors had them nicely blended into the background and not upstaging the main character. Nicely done.I liked the incorporated newsreel footage and forgot about all those explosions in the 70s in Cleveland. Funny how bombs are the weaponof choice for criminal types.Thank goodness Scorsese did not direct this movie as it would have been over lit and much more hyped up and with those whack fist effects and other posed scenes.And people died in these explosions they didn't run ahead of them like Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford to beat the blast.If want to learn about the historic story of mobster vs. mobster in the 70s and an icon of resistance...this is the movie.".

This also reminds me of the Sly Stallone crime classic FIST. Of which is a tough film in its own right  but also a well made  story character driven drama like this film. Kill The Irishman has one of the best supporting casts around which includes Vincent D'Onofrio Christopher Walken Vinny Jones and Val Kilmerplus half of the cast of Goodfellas . Ray Stevenson holds his own among all of these great actors by playing Greene smart tough  charismatic and ruthless .

Being a huge fan of mafia movies I was really looking forward to this one. While the movie is very good and entertaining I was a little disappointed. The movie seemed to never keep up a steady pace. Some parts moved very quick and were fun to watch then the next scene slowed it way down and didn't seem to have any impact. The cast however makes this movie. There are too many stars to list here but there are about ten known actors that really make this movie as good as it is. If the cast was not what it was this would have been a really bad B movie but as it stands it is a very entertaining movie to watch. On a side note Val Kilmer is not embarrassing to watch in this unlike is last 4 or 5 movies. Overall a very good movie but a tad disappointing. I give it a B.Would I watch again?  I think I would.".

But sadly it fails to deliver.I don't know if the movie got slashed in post production or it was simply poorly written but the end result is a film which feels very rushed with numerous scenes missing. It seems like Hensleigh is so terrified of the movie feeling slow that he goes to the extreme in the opposite direction.In what seems like the first 20 minutes of the movie the main character goes from a struggling longshoreman to being the head of the union to getting married to some random waitress to being locked up to suddenly being an informant and ending up as a low level gangster again. Oh and somewhere in all of this he saves someone  I suppose a friend  from some loan shark but it's not entirely clear why or how although it for some reason becomes a big plot point later on. It's probably due to sloppy writing.Everything is portrayed in very short scenes in a pattern of and then this happened and then this happened and then this happened. The problem with this technique is that we never really get to know the main character his motivations his relations to the supporting characters his crew and antagonists and not to mention his first wife.This isn't Transformers where the audience might be content with seeing some massive explosions and robots beating the crud out of each other. For this movie to be enjoyable and actually make sense we have to at least know and care a little bit for our characters.Compare Kill the Irishman to Goodfellas a movie which obviously have been a strong influence on this film not to mention the opening car explosion which is taken almost beat by beat from Casino.Goodfellas is a full 40 minutes longer than Kill the Irishman but never gets dull. On the other hand it rather feels faster paced than Kill the Irishman. But we need those extra 40 minutes because it gives us time to get explore the points listed above.Kill the Irishman feels like wasted opportunity.It could have been a Heat style film exploring the relationship between Ray Stevenson and Val Kilmer's characters. But no.It could have explored the tension between being a snitch and having the life of crime as the only realistic way of life. But no.It could have been a riseandfall mafia style movie like Goodfellas or Scarface or even American Gangster. But no.It could have been a gritty look at the life of crime kind of like a reverse Narc. But no.This movie can't decide what type of film it is so it tries to be all of them at once which is a recipe for failure.It's a shame considering the talented cast which has very little to work with in this garbled mess of a film.".

Although this story tells the life of Danny Green it also intertwines the lives of many high ranking members of the Mafia into the spotlight. The movie itself does in certain parts hold a lot of truth with his dealings with the Cleveland Mafia but what the movie does not show is the paranoia and public solitary confinement he lived the last years of his life in. Although not told through the eyes I would have loved to see the simple fact of being consulted for references about friends and family members who were attached to this story was nothing less than fantastic.

There isn't anything wrong with aspiring to be one of the best films of all times. It's got plenty of solid actors in the many supporting roles. D'Onofrio is a standout although it may be trying to fit in too many characters. As for Ray Stevenson he has a really powerful presence. He's a hulking man. The movie has minor flaws here and there that keeps it from being a truly great mobster movie. Some of the side characters need to step up. The wife and mistress are bland. The movie doesn't always flow well but it's a good watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "I went in really wanting to like this flick and boy was I utterly disappointed. Not like angry I got ripped off wasted my time kind of disappointment but more of a why did they even bother going through the trouble of making this movie to begin with kind of disappointment.It is so full of unbelievable film and story clichs it's astounding And at some points kinda embarrassing. There is no attempt in any way to take something that on paper would appear to anyone as being a pretty typical mobgangster story and create a film narrative that can come across as something other than a typical mobgangster story.I think the worse thing the production does is start a story that is so obviously taking a page from Goodfellas and then proceed to deliberately hire half the cast from the same movie. Painfully obvious. Did it even occur to anyone during preproduction that there were more than a few sequences that seem rather... similar? Which speaking of Goodfellas cast members note to Tony Darrow The worst thing a character actor can do is get plastic surgery. On his face. See Dan Hedaya. The other thing is the movie. It's supposed to be a MOVIE as in you know moving motion pictures. This thing has such a glacial pace I wanted to start clubbing baby seals to relieve the boredom..And what was up with Ray Stevenson's hair? It's like a mutant grafting of Gene Wilder on a six day coke binge and John Belushi with six days of sobriety. Almost all the actors in this either looked like older impersonators of themselves or bloated inflatable pool toys. And I kept waiting for the alien to pop out of Vincent D'Onofrio's host carcass but then I remembered that was another movie back when he wasn't simply working to support his restaurant tabs. Which apparently are extensive.And poor Robert Davi we don't even get that good a glimpse of him in the whole movie. And he was a Bond villain for heaven's sake! It's not right. I'm just sayin'. And yeah yeah I know it was supposed to be a device to make his character seem 'mysterious' and 'dangerously ubiquitous' but it just came off as if the actor wasn't showing up on time and they had his standin complete all his scenes in a pinch.Then at some point some wiseguy editor managed to sneak in an extra reel of people sitting in their cars and then blowing them up over and over again on a loop that seemed to last for about 45 minutes. Then more things blew up. And then somebody said something or did something which all inevitably lead to a huge cue we all expected anyway that came lumbering up main street like the mother of all Godzillas... and then some kids came and more people blew up again.Next time I think I'll just watch Goodfellas.".

Occasionally Val Kilmer manages to make his character seem like a a real person otherwise it's strictly caricature from everybody else. But you can't blame 'em. The writer and the director clearly wanted to make several old films they'd already seen with all the interesting bits cut out. There's no character development so we never get to know much about our leading thug reallife Philladelphian Danny Greene except that for a while he regrets some of his more appalling behaviour. Basically though he wants to be top dog and there's always someone else who wants that job. There's a little bit of plot development but basically one power struggle leads to another in a series of punchups detonations shootings Mafiosi gesticulations insults and more explosions. Our hero's wife  after she's scowled for 6 scenes at her husband brutalising half the neighbourhood she's packed all the suitcases put the kids in the car and is leaving  says it's over. Can you imagine the wave of surprise that swept over the audience? One standout in this picture is the hair and makeup it's bizarre. Stevenson who reminds me of old Warner Brothers stock actor Alan Hale must have the worse hairdo of any leading man after Nicholas Cage.Christopher Walken plays a Jewish mobster who neither washes nor combs his hair nor has it cut over a timespan of a decade. Vincent D'Onofrio looks like the most unkempt wiseguy in the history of the Cosa Nostra and..I'd better stop here. Suffice it to say if you're happy with fisticuffs explosions and clichs enjoy.".

I initially heard of Danny Green from the Mobsters series on BIO Channel so I already knew the background story and overall this movie keeps things pretty real in that regardwith some dramatics added here and there for the sake of entertainment. Overall I was slightly disappointed as parts of the movie and the dialog was too Hollywoody. Casting Christopher Walken for example he's become such a fixture of humor because of the way he talks so when he talks in this movie about serious subjects its still funny. Plus the meetings and interactionsespecially amongst the Italian characters was so typical it seemed like a 18 year old wrote the script after watching a few episodes of the Sopranos. The special effects seemed very low budget on the car bombing sequences you can totally see a green screen poorly camouflaged into the some of the shots. That being said it is a good movie just not a classic like Goodfellas The Godfather or even something one tier lower like Casino or The Departed. Ray Stevenson is awesome and is able to carry the movie past some of the shortcomings I mentioned but with the talented names in the cast and the storyline they had to work with it could have been so much better.".

	schema:headline " Broad shouldered crime film based on one extraordinary true story";
	schema:reviewBody "I'm not too sure just how much of Kill The Irishman is based in actual truth but if even half of what we see on screen did happen that is some pretty impressive stuff. The film focuses on the life of Danny Greene a bulked sturdy Ray Stevenson who was an Irish American mobster working out of Cleveland back in the 70's a guy who seems to have caused quite a stir of chaos amongst organized crime back then. Getting a leg up from the longshoreman's union Danny quickly rose to power alongside several other key figures including numbers man John Nardi Vincent D'Onofrio enforcer Joe Manditski Val Kilmer and nasty kingpin Shondor Birns Christopher Walken. It seems it all went south pretty quick though because before he knew it he was at odds with Birns and dodging multiple brash assassination attempts coming at him from all directions. What's remarkable about Danny's story is his sterling resilience something like over a dozen attempts were made on his life and the darn mick just kept on going even taunting the underworld between car bomb blasts and raucous shoot outs. Of course such a life alienates him from his wife Linda Cardellini and puts him in perpetual crosshairs but Stevenson plays it casually cavalier a gentleman gangster who really cares not for the danger he's wading into and treads lightly amongst the mess making me wonder if the real Greene had such an attitude and the sheer luck to back it up. Walken is quiet and dangerous in a somewhat underplayed role but he is entertaining doing anything so it's all good. The cast is enormous and includes the like of Vinnie Jones as a bruiser of an Irish street soldier Robert Davi in an explosive third act cameo as a lethal specialist brought in to neutralize Danny and your usual kennel of Italian American character actors like Mike Starr Bob Gunton Tony Lo Bianco Steve Schirippa Paul Sorvino and others. It's loud fast paced and ever so slightly tongue in cheek. As a crime drama it works great could have been slightly longer but Stevenson keeps things moving briskly with his affable hyperactive performance and it goes with out saying that the rest of them provide excellent supporting work.".

	schema:reviewBody "America loves the tough guy. The guy who faces the impossible odds and beats them to a bloody pulp. Examples  Rocky Dirty Harry or Dalton Road House. America also loves the bad guy. The guy that we really shouldn't support but we do anyhow. Examples  The Godfather Scarface and Henry Hill Goodfellas. In Kill the Irishman we are now given a new underdog bad guy to cheer for Danny Greene played by Ray Stevenson. AllAmerican tough guy.In Jonathan Hensleigh's latest movie based on Danny Greene's life in the 1970s we see the tough guy who works his way up from the docks in Cleveland Ohio. Greene has it rough from the beginning an orphan raised on Cleveland's mean streets. He takes a job on the docks shoveling grain and is soon given the opportunity to become a union leader because he is one of the only guys that reads books. So he is also a tough guy with some intellect. He literally fights his way into his position of Union Boss. From there he leads a corrupt life assisting the local Italian mafia in robbing the docks where he works.Does this sound like any kind of movie hero? Why are we intrigued to continue watching? Maybe it's because some of us mainly us guys secretly want to be Greene. The guy that doesn't take nonsense from anyone. If someone gets in your way break his jaw beat him down and don't worry about consequences.Things are going well for Greene until his arrest his bad deeds finally catch up to him. He cuts a deal with the FBI to become an informant and is back home with his wife and kids. He now needs to find work. He soon becomes a debt collector for Shondor Birns played by Christopher Walken. Although Greene is Irish and Birns is Italian they don't let that stand in the way of their friendship especially since there is money to be made.Again things are going well for Greene he patrols Cleveland with his crew collecting past due balances for the mafia. Being a tough guy he usually lets his fist or hand gun do the talking. Things soon go south for Greene and Birns due to a lost 70000. Immediately there is a price on Greene's head.In 1976 there were 36 explosions that rocked Cleveland therefore dubbing it as Bomb City USA. This is all due in part to the Italian mob trying to kill the Irishman Greene. He dodges bullets like Superman and survives explosions like John McClain Die Hard then walks away with an indifferent attitude.How does he survive all of these assassination attempts? He is an Irish Catholic with the grace of God. Greene doesn't show fear he keeps himself believing his intent is to be a modern day Robin Hood for the community. Even after losing his children and wife he sticks it out because tough guys never give up. Especially Irish Catholic tough guys.Should you see this movie? Sure if you like tough guys and if you like cheering for the bad guy. Greene's takenoguff attitude kept his character interesting when the story seemed to lag or when there weren't any cars blowing up. He is supported by a cast of strong veterans Val Kilmer Vincent D'Onofrio and Paul Sorvino. The film also has an authentic documentary feel to it since Hensleigh incorporates actual footage from newscasts covering Greene's life as a local legend.".

Playwright David Shayne considers himself an artist and surrounds himself with like minded people most struggling financially as they create art for themselves not the masses. David however believes the failure of his first two plays was because he gave up creative control to other people who didn't understand the material. As such he wants to direct his just completed third play God of Our Fathers insider scuttlebutt being that it may very well make David the toast of Broadway. With David having no directing history David's regular producer Julian Marx can't find any investors... until a single investor who will finance the entire production comes onto the scene. He is Nick Valenti a big time mobster with the catch being that his dimwitted girlfriend nonactress Olive Neal get the lead role. A hesitant David and Julian who are able to talk Nick into them giving Olive one of the two female supporting roles instead go along with the scheme hoping ...";

Of course there are exceptions but in Bullets over Broadway show an inspired Mr. Allen doing what he does best. This comedy written in collaboration with Douglas McGrath is a happy take on a situation that only this director would have been able to create.We are shown two different worlds. In one the roaring twenties gangsters have the control of all illegal activities in Manhattan. On the other we meet an idealistic writer David Shayne who wants to have his play produced. Enter the capo Nick Valenti. This man has enough money to buy his current paramour the dizzy Olive Neal whatever her little heart desires. Thus the vehicle chosen is the drama David has written.Thus begins a frantic comedy of errors where the theater and the mob intermingle with funny results. We watch as the play gets produced on Broadway how the different factions come together each one with a different idea as to what to do with the play.The cast is first rate. John Cusack as the ambitious playwright does some of his best work in showing what this man is going through. Dianne Wiest one of the most accomplished actresses around makes a splash with her take on Helen Sinclair the first lady of the American theatah! Jennifer Tully is excellent as Olive Neal the girl from the provinces with high aspirations but no talent.Chaz Palmintieri as Cheech the mobster that understands what's wrong with the play is hilarious. The late Joe Venturelli was born to play his mobster Nick Valente. Jack Warden is perfect as the producer. Tracey Ullman and Jim Broadbent are simply marvelous as the cast members of the play in production. Mary Louise Parker and Harvey Fierstein Rob Reiner are also seen in smaller roles.Bullets over Broadway as most of Mr. Allen's films has a great musical score of the jazz songs of the era.

This problem is compounded by Olive's minder Cheech who has plenty of constructive criticism on how the play could be better.  David tries to balance all these in the name of art.It's rarely new ground that Woody Allen walks  but how come he manages to make it so damn sparkly and witty?  Here he delivers wonderful spoof on theatre people and the assumptions we all make about characters based on what they do or how they talk.  The writing is spot on Allen delivers tonnes of great lines but also creates characters that he expands over the film.  It is very watchable and it rarely suffers from the fate on some of Allen's recent comedies  feeling too light or whimsical for it's own good. Instead it is funny but has some points to make.Of course it always helps if you have a great cast and this does.  With people like Warden Broadbent Wiest Tilly Parker Fierstein Reiner Falco and Palminteri it's hard not to have at least the majority of the cast giving good performances  Wiest Tilly and Palminteri were my favourites. Cusack was good as the overpowered writer but the one thing I didn't like is the same with many actors who do the traditional Woody role  he gives a slight impression at times rather than cutting out the role as his own.Overall Woody Allen may not be everyone's cup of tea  but for fans this is him at his whimsical best.  Not a classic comedy but a warm Allen film that sparkles in nearly every scene.".

This story mix up with considerable success two ingredients that a priori seem not to combine very well the world of theatre with the world of mafia and gangsterism in the crazy twenties of last century. All the characters are very typical and greatly performed the young playwright looking for a place in the sun the ham actress who overacts a lot even in real life the mafia boss who imposes his girlfriend on the playwright as an actress the Greenwich Village intellectuals and so on. In my opinion however the feeblest character is the one of the gangster who becomes also playwright from a certain moment on. Some of his interventions lack authenticity.

	schema:reviewBody "Sadly I've been let down by most of Woody Allen's recent comedies.  So it was most rewarding indeed to see the Woodman back again true to form after a lengthy drought with 1994's Bullets Over Broadway.  Fun foamy and clever it has everything we've come to love and expect from the man.While Take the Money and Run and Bananas first turned trendy audiences on to his unique brand of improvisational hitandmiss comedy episodes and the more neurotic selfexamining cult hits like Annie Hall and Manhattan cemented his Oscarwinning relationship with Hollywood the comedy genius has stumbled mightily in this last decade.  Attempting to contemporize his image with the coarse foulmouthed antics of a Coen or Farrelly brother see Mighty Aphrodite is simply beneath him and has been about as productive as Stevie Wonder taking a turn at hiphop. Moreover casting himself as a 65yearold romantic protagonist with love interests young enough to be his grandchildren see Curse of the Jade Scorpion has left a noticeably bad aftertaste of late.  With Bullets Over Broadway however Allen goes back to basics and wisely avoids the pitfalls of excessive toilet humor and selfaggrandizing casting and gives us a light refreshing bit of whimsical escapism.  Woody may not be found on screen here but his presence is felt throughout.  Though less topical and analytical than his trademark films this vehicle brings back a purer essence of Woody and might I say an early innocence hardpressed to find these days in his work.John Cusack can this guy do no wrong? plays a struggling jazzera playwright desperate for a Broadway hit who is forced to sell out to a swarthy aging kingpin played to perfection by Joe Viterelli who is looking to finance a theatrical showcase for his muchyounger bimbo girlfirend Jennifer Tilly in a tailormade role.  The writer goes through a hellish rehearsal period sacrificing his words not to mention his moral and artistic scruples in order to appease his mob producers who know zilch about putting on a play.  The rehearsal scenes alone are worth the price of admission.Aside from Allen's clever writing brisk pace and lush careful attention to period detail he has assembled his richest ensemble cast yet with a host of hysterically funny characters in spontaneous banter roaming in and about the proceedings.  Cusack is his usual rocksolid self in the panicky schelmiel role normally reserved for Woody.  But even he is dwarfed by the likes of this onceinalifetime supporting cast.  Jennifer Tilly with her dolllike rasp is hilariously grating as the vapid virulent and thoroughly untalented moll.  Usually counted on to play broad onedimensional sexually belligerent dames never has Tilly been give such golden material to feast on putting her Olive Neal right up there in the 'top 5' funfilled film floozies of all time alongside Jean Hagen's Lina Lamont and Lesley Ann Warren's Norma Cassady.  Virile menacing Chazz Palminteri as the fleshylipped Cheech a dees dem and dos guard dog reveals great comic prowess while affording his pinstriped hit man some touching overtones. Dianne Wiest who has won bookend support Oscars in Woody Allen pictures for this and for Hannah and Her Sisters doesn't miss a trick as the outre theatre doyenne Helen Sinclair whose life is as grand and exaggerated offstage as it is on.  Her comic brilliance is on full flamboyant display stealing every scene she's in.  Tracey Ullman is a pinchfaced delight as the exceedingly anal puppydoting ingenue while Jim Broadbent as a fusty stickinthemud gets his shining moments when his actor's appetite for both food and women get hilariously out of hand.  MaryLouise Parker as Cusack's castoff mate gets the shortest end of the laughing stick but lends some heart and urgency to the proceedings.While the play flirts with a burlesquestyled capriciousness there is an undercoating of seriousness and additional character agendas that keeps the cast from falling into onenote caricatures.  And as always Woody's spoton selection of period music is nonpareil.  With healthy does of flapperera Gershwin Rodgers  Hart Cole Porter Hoagy Carmichael not to mention the flavorful vocal stylings of Al Jolson and Eddie Cantor Allen with customary finesse affectionately transports us back to the glitzy ginpeddling era of Prohibition and slick Runyonesque antics.I remember the times when the opening of a new Woody Allen film was a main event.  As such Bullets Over Broadway is a comedy valentine to such days. In any respect it's a winner all the way especially for Woodyphiles.".

The opposite was in a more serious affair Crimes and Misdemeanors where art and murder and infidelities all get into one big pot of personality crises. This is the same case with Bullets Over Broadway though this time Allen's tackling of the egomaniacal crutches of the Broadway scene the aging star Helen Sinclair Dianne Wiest one of her very best performances funniest too the bumbling boob Olive Neal Jennifer Tilly appropriately annoying and then how it sort of infects the outsiders to the major Broadway scene one the protagonist David Shayne John Cusack excellent here and Olive's bodyguard Cheech Chazz Palminteri a character he could play in his sleep but played pretty well anyway. Cheech is hanging around during rehearsals of David's first play he's writing and directing following getting funding on the condition of Olive as a psychiatrist from a heavyduty mobster and soon he's suggesting ideas and in the process becomes David's uncredited collaborator. But meanwhile infidelities are abound with David falling for the wonderfully selfindulgent Helen and a goofy romance between Olive and the thespian Warner Purcell Jim Broadbent leading to a purely ironic climax.Allen's skills at navigating the neuroses of all the characters is very skilled and sometimes the oneliners are surprisingly funny all based on the personalities Wiesst especially in a voice that is a little startling at first gives a classic line about the world 'opening' up and her running gag with don't speak. Even with the more dramatic connections which doesn't seem to be as much of Allen's concerns since it's pretty onenote with the mob side of things and frankly the fates of Olive and Cheech sort of seem a little too contrived for the sake of the irony par for the course we do get a very memorable bit to make things worth the while like David and Cheech's down to earth talk at the bar. But if there's anything else to recommend more strongly it's for the sharpness of the script in the theater scenes the backstage banter the hilarious tension stirred up by grudges and illtimed romances. Plus there's a bit of an added treat for fans of past Allen films where he casts Rob Reiner in a role sort of similar to that of Wallace Shawn in Manhattan. Not a masterpiece but a very enjoyable work that's successful on its darklight terms.".

	schema:headline " A Strong Supporting Cast Dominates the Action";
	schema:reviewBody "A Woody Allen written and directed film that does not include him in a single frame.  It may seem strange but it's true.  Allen's Bullets Over Broadway deals with a struggling stage writer John Cusack who is so desperate to get one of his plays on Broadway in the 1920s that he reluctantly enlists the help of the local mafia crime lord to fund the play. Of course there is a large stipulation.  The crime lord's girl must be in the play hilariously played by Jennifer Tilly in an Oscarnominated role. Needless to say she's terrible and Cusack struggles with her in the play. However he has booked Alist actress Dianne Wiest in her second Oscarwinning role who is an alcoholic who has seen better days in her career.  Tilly's bodyguard Chazz Palminteri also in an Oscarnominated role sees the play rehearsed firsthand and gives Cusack some directions on the project that Cusack cannot refuse.  Palminteri is street smart and knows how people really talk while Cusack is so educated that his words make no sense to the normal audience.  This film is what The Godfather would have been like if Allen had directed it.  The screenplay is outstanding and Allen's direction has rarely been better.  Cusack is fun and hilarious but it is the supporting cast that makes the movie work.  Other than the aforementioned Oscarnominated actors there are great turns by several others.  MaryLouise Parker Tracy Ullman Jim Broadbent Jack Warden Rob Reiner Harvey Feinstein and Joe Viterelli are all superb in wellcalculated supporting roles.  4 out of 5 stars.".

Of course the play has problems getting produced. They filmed it at the real Belasco Theater in New York where I saw Jackie with Margaret Colin in 1997. Of course that's what makes Woody Allen's films special is that he always films it in New York. I don't recall him as an actor in this film. He was wise enough to pass the role over to Cusack who does a superb job playing Woody's younger self. Anyway Tilly does a terrific job playing an annoying and terrible actress but girlfriend of a mobster. What she wants is what she usually gets. First rate cast with Chaz Palminteri who was nominated along with Tilly for supporting acting Oscars. I hope Woody Allen will finally be recognized for his genius and get top honors like the National Medal of the Arts and honored by the Kennedy Center finally for his work.

	schema:reviewBody "These last two words were what SHOULD have been added to the last line of the film to make this excellent movie even better. John Cusack in one of his better roles plays an aspiring playwright during the 1920s and considers himself to be a great onealthough he later learns that he really isn't. Like his Marxistinclined intellectual friend Flender Rob Reiner looking very much the part Cusack thinks that art is of supreme importance perhaps even more important than human life itself. Discussing art in a Greenwich Village cafe Reiner gives the analogy of a burning building if you could rush in and save only one of two thingsa human being or the last known copy of Shakespeare's works which would you save? His answer of course is Shakespeare's works. Why say such a horrible thing? Because to intellectuals art lives. You'd have no right to deprive the world of this great art just to save the life of an anonymous human being he says. Cusack agrees. But this belief is put to the test when in order to save a work of art gangster Cheech wellplayed by Chazz Palmentieri actually commits murder. Cusack then realizes that no work of art is worth a human life after all. At this point Cusack says I'm NOT an artist. This I think is the film's underlying Dostoevskian theme that because intellectuals deal in art and ideas they place far too much value on such abstractions and correspondingly too little value on human life. Didn't the 20th century prove how deadly this insane notion can be? Now we see Deep Greens telling us that the life of a human being is no more valuable than the life of a tree or a dog! I wish all the Deep Greens would watch this fine movie and be disabused of their inhumane notions. For my part I can also say that if art is to be considered more important than human life I'm not an artistThank God.".

	schema:reviewBody "I can not share the generally enthusiastic opinion of this film shown by most other IMDb database users. I am sorry about this as I want to like it  its main theme contrasting the relative importance of love and art both for Society and for most of its individual members is significant for us all and it is a very visually appealing presentation giving an excellent depiction of New York city as it was some 80 or more years ago mainly in shades of brown that are never jarring to the eyes. I am not one of those who dislike Woody Allen's work .The Purple Rose of Cairo and Love and Death where he showed he was able to combine farce with both fairly natural dialogue and his beloved philosophical discussions this deserted him in BOB are both treasured parts of my private movie collection. Although BOB is largely free of the artificial dialogue which spoils many of Woody's other films it was spoilt by unrelenting and continuous overacting. Many films include at least one actor guilty of this heinous sin but when they almost all do so the fault probably lies squarely with the Director. Here you could watch a few minutes culled from almost any point in the film and be confident of finding a shouting match or characters waving their arms about like windmills.Many cinema fans do not like watching silent films because of the overacting they are said to feature. This is conventionally explained by the absence of dialogue forcing a greater emphasis on gesture but John Barrymore even in some of his most unrestrained roles seldom continued exaggerated gesturing beyond the point when it was needed and this need was often due more to difficulty in creating effective close ups than to the absence of sound problems that coexisted in those early days. Today an actor can convey a world of meaning whilst quietly sitting at a table by for example just raising an eyebrow and uttering the word Really in an appropriately questioning tone. In silent days a one word caption Really would be almost as effective but the scene at the table filmed from 5 or 10 metre away would not do justice to the raised eyebrow in the same way as a modern close up filmed from a distance of no more than a metre so I can watch for example the 1925 version of Ben Hur more readily than I can Bullets over Broadway  improved technology has made us much less tolerant of artefacts that destroy the intended atmosphere. Fans of BOB claim the behaviour shown in this film is in fact typical of interactions between the types of character being portrayed and the overacting is not as severe as I am suggesting. I doubt if this is true but even if so the film itself makes it clear that this would be no excuse. The gangster's hit man Cheech in an early sequence explains carefully that it is no good presenting any dramatic work in a manner with which a viewer cannot empathise  depicted dialogue and behaviour must always be adapted to what would be expected and accepted by the potential audience. I do not live among people who shout and wave their arms about all the time although I will of course accept such behaviour in a film where it is a natural response to a stressful situation but if I do not live among people who behave like that I am not likely to watch a film that shows everyone doing so continuously for very long before I turn it off  or at the very least feel compelled to complain as I am doing now.Bullets over Broadway is of course dangerously close to being a direct copy of the film Mistress released a couple of years or so earlier the stories are almost identical except that the locale has been changed from Hollywood to New York and the film being produced has become a stage play. The same type of moral and artistic issues are brought out in both of them. Mistress was not so well enjoyed by IMDb users but it is very interesting to compare the impact created by the two works. Whereas BOB plays more like a farce most of the time Mistress provides biting satire which for me is both more enjoyable and far more effective. It was extremely well acted by almost all the cast and Robert De Niro in particular gives a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. No wonder the Hollywood elite did not like it many of its barbs must have struck very close to home! Recently after watching Bullets over Broadway I rewatched part of Mistress to decide whether my more favourable recollections of it were justified. I noted one short slanging match develop towards the end this was quickly cut short by another character telling the perpetrator to calm down. Back to reality  this was all I really needed to see.. Mistress was real enough for me to feel like an outsider watching events happening whereas BOB was definitely more like watching entertainers trying to keep me amused. For me the wrong film has been made available on DVD.".

	onyx:emotionText "I can not share the generally enthusiastic opinion of this film shown by most other IMDb database users. I am sorry about this as I want to like it  its main theme contrasting the relative importance of love and art both for Society and for most of its individual members is significant for us all and it is a very visually appealing presentation giving an excellent depiction of New York city as it was some 80 or more years ago mainly in shades of brown that are never jarring to the eyes. I am not one of those who dislike Woody Allen's work .The Purple Rose of Cairo and Love and Death where he showed he was able to combine farce with both fairly natural dialogue and his beloved philosophical discussions this deserted him in BOB are both treasured parts of my private movie collection. Although BOB is largely free of the artificial dialogue which spoils many of Woody's other films it was spoilt by unrelenting and continuous overacting.

Allen takes a very promising concept and somehow manages to craft a film that is devoid of hilarity.Idealistic playwright John Cusack finds the backing to mount his play from a gangster. The catch is that in return the gangster's bimbo mistress Jennifer Tilly is to be cast as a psychiatrist in the play. Henchman Chazz Palminteri is dispatched to babysit Tilly and coach her in acting but in the process makes suggestions to Cusack's play that dramatically improve its quality.This should be hilarious  yet it is not. I don't think I cracked a smile once during the entire course of the film. I have begun to believe that it is utterly impossible for Allen to write genuinely likable or appealing characters  even within the constraints of a broad fable such as this one. Nearly everyone we see on screen is selfish obnoxious and nasty.Too many scenes are directed as though by chaos. For instance I lost count of how many scenes start or ended with a group of characters stationed at different points of the set and shrieking their lines at each other often at the same time so that the scene is reduced to a wall of incoherent noise.While Allen thankfully delivers us from taking on the leading man duties again Cusack is simply too bland and uninteresting to hold attention or anchor the action. Tracey Ullman MaryLouise Parker and Jim Broadbent are wasted in underwritten roles. Dianne Wiest gets to ham it up as a legendary Broadway diva brought in to headline the show. While she throws herself body and soul into the part her lampoon of the haughty dowager becomes repetitive. This is a fault of the screenplay more than the actress. She is playing a caricature and one that we have seen done better and funnier in other films. The first time she strikes a pose like Greta Garbo and admonishes Cusack Don't speak! is barely amusing. By the umpteenth time she has done this throughout the film it has ceased to have any comedic impact at all.Apparently the majority of the comedy is supposed to come from the interactions between Palminteri's flustered gun man and Tilly's bimbo. Unfortunately their scenes are incredibly unpleasant. Palminteri is stuck playing a stereotypical goombah with the twist that he writes better than Cusack and Tilly is the quintessential floozy. Both of them hate each  and I mean they really hate each other. Their line readings are loud and shrill and generate all of the charm of a legion of car alarms going off at the same time. There is almost a collective sigh of relief when their scenes conclude and their dialog pretty much goes along the lines of Why don't you shut up! No you shut up! You shut up! and You shut up yourself! Oh the hilarity. It must have taken Allen all of five minutes to fabricate this winning dialog.By the time the film itself rolls to its unsurprising conclusion one realizes that you don't care about any of these characters and you want back the time that Allen and his minions have stolen from your life. A real endurance test akin to dental surgery without benefit of Novacaine.".

Bullets Over Broadway in many ways was not the brand of Woody Allen film I was accustomed to. The 1994 film explores the Woody Allen character played in an extraordinary way by John Cusack as a playwright who struggles with the casting decisions necessary to get his play produced. When the mob gets involved in influencing his choices in exchange for the successful production of the play Cusack's character must navigate through maze most artists grapple with in the balance between creating for themselves and creating for the masses of society. Bullets Over Broadway is a fantastic look at artistic struggle that just wasn't as much of a Woody Allen film as I would have preferred.".

	schema:reviewBody "A struggling playwright wants to direct his own play because he believes he's an artist with a capital A and is convinced that his previous plays didn't succeed because their directors have butchered his genius words. Unfortunately the only way for him to get funded is to accept money from a mobster who in turn demands that his emptyheaded girlfriend gets a role in the play. The said girlfriend is of course shrillvoiced opinionated utterly talentless and kind of lazy. But then it turns out that the hapless gangster conscripted to guard the girlfriend has a way with words and play scenes. A talent even he didn't know he had.It's an odd scenario for a movie but director Woody Allen makes it work. I've always liked movies that are about making movies or in this case theatre plays because they're such fascinating windows into the business that gives us the stuff dreams are made of. This film being no exception. It's full of glamorous actors empty stages rehearsals costumes scripts and playwrights. But thrown into the mix are gangsters which makes the film rather unique. It has a spin of its own.It's also the best Woody Allen film I've seen so far. I have not seen many of them and certainly none of his classics but so far his style has seemed a bit contrived. Like he's talking about something he doesn't quite understand or understands incorrectly. But in this I totally buy that he's talking from his heart. He knows and breathes this world. All its upsides and downsides.Definitely a film worth checking out for all those that find the premise interesting or are just interested in theatre as a way of life.".

	onyx:emotionText "A struggling playwright wants to direct his own play because he believes he's an artist with a capital A and is convinced that his previous plays didn't succeed because their directors have butchered his genius words. Unfortunately the only way for him to get funded is to accept money from a mobster who in turn demands that his emptyheaded girlfriend gets a role in the play. The said girlfriend is of course shrillvoiced opinionated utterly talentless and kind of lazy. But then it turns out that the hapless gangster conscripted to guard the girlfriend has a way with words and play scenes. A talent even he didn't know he had.It's an odd scenario for a movie but director Woody Allen makes it work. I've always liked movies that are about making movies or in this case theatre plays because they're such fascinating windows into the business that gives us the stuff dreams are made of. This film being no exception. It's full of glamorous actors empty stages rehearsals costumes scripts and playwrights. But thrown into the mix are gangsters which makes the film rather unique.

	schema:reviewBody "Bullets over Broadway is a mockery of theatre folk and all their high minded aspirations of the world. There is no better target to being with than the young idealistic screenwriter who has many a great idea. This man is David Shayne who has just arrived in Broadway and has a screenplay that seeks to transform men's soul. But it's a little heavy for other's tastes and besides he has no backer. That is until a gangster agrees to finance his play as long as his girlfriends gets a lead role. Cusack plays the Allen type  it is written almost exactly as if Allen intended to play it himself. Listen to the inflection and intonation of his voiceover so full of stuffed selfimportance and faux gravitas. It channels the Allen type perfectly who has always been supremely selfconscious. What keeps Shayne up at night? The horrible moral wrong of selling out so stressful that it stretches his ethical and artistic merit. Worse yet the fact that he is only a mediocre writer is slowly being confirmed to him.But Cusack isn't Allen so he can only go so far as to mimic. The character like the Alvy Singers and the Isaac Davis' before him is written to have the neurotic ability to make anything situation the worst thing in the world as well as simultaneously the funniest. He blows up about things that may matter but does so in such an exasperated and offended way that it creates humour. Cusack channels this temporarily when he defends accusations of an affair and flips the tables around so that it is he who is the victim later he gets mightily offended that she has been doing the same thing. He is so selfrighteous that it becomes her that is perpetuating the wrong by accusing him. The film is set up so that Shayne will have the same reaction when he discovers that Neal has been killed right before the play's opening night. Cusack merely explodes morally. Now imagine Allen in the same scene. He would have made a big fuss over the moral wrong of such a crime but at the same time would also have trouble hiding the fact that he cares more about how his play is now ruined.The cause is the comedy being played too straight. The film's world is one of absurd exaggerations and pompous theatre folk that place reputation above all. It's funniest moments come from the irony that it is the low class roughlyhewn gangster that is the most eloquent and complex. While all the others are fuming about their importance and trivialities he is the one most passionate about the artistic merit. More so that Shayne himself a fact which briefly rocks him and then comforts him as he goes on to take credit for all his ideas. Noble he is not. The rest of the cast is lovely although they are merely pieces to build the joke. Wiest is the best of them the airy inflator still perpetuating the idea that she is as relevant and essential as she was in her prime. At a bar she beats Cusack at his own game of selfrighteousness by ordering two martinis for herself and Shayne's answers illustrates just how selfcentred they all are. She constantly shushes him with a Don't speak! every time he tries to wax lyrical because it would ruin the idea of him. And if you had been paying attention to his dialogue you would certainly agree.".

The 1930's razzamattaz atmosphere comes alive in Woody's love letter to the great white way that is up there with The Purple Rose of Cairo and Radio Days in his tributes to nostalgia a genre known today as pastiche. Woody's Broadway isn't filled with innocent chorus girls who become stars just a dumb gangster's moll Jennifer Tilly who tries to become an actress after baring practically it all in a mob owned nightclub and ends up paying for it dearly thanks to the sudden snobbery of her bodyguard Chazz Palminteri. Writer John Cusack is having a difficult time truly understanding the characters he's writing about for the play being produced and Palminteri begins helping him out as a ghost writer ultimately getting his taste of being a Broadway baby a la one with a machine gun instead of a pacifier. A group of typical Broadway eccentrics surround Cusack in his desire to see his art make it to the big time and while they all have good intentions with egos of varying styles attached they end up causing him more headaches both professionally and personally. Of course the most memorable is the diva star of the show Dianne Wiest as far from her kindly mother roles and previous neurotic Allen characters as she can get. Helen Sinclair is Tallulah without the Southern drawl a boozy broad who sweeps into the theater as if she were Norma Desmond back on the set. Wiest deservedly won her second Oscar two for Allen films! for this showy performance that made legendary the simple lines of Don't speak! also comically repeated by Marin Mazzie on Broadway. When she orders two martini's Cusack is floored by her knowing what he wanted to which she replies dryly Oh you wanted one too? For this legendary stage star who never plays frumps and virgins Cusack is her muse of future greatness and of course that lands him in her bed.Tilly typifies the stereotypical dumb moll although she is not a blonde and quite selfish and nasty underneath her bird brained intelligence. She obviously hates her sugar daddy Joe Viterelli a fat old fool of a mobster who loves her in spite of herself treating him with disdain. Annie Jo Edwards who refused to be suckered in The Purple Rose of Cairo steals every moment she's on as their toughtalking maid who refuses to make anything out of horses when asked to make hor dourves and comments on how their illegal hooch ate threw the bottle. Jim Broadbent appears to eat everything in sight as an aging leading matine idol who is having a serious weight problem even eating the dog biscuits of flighty co star Tracey Ullman and ends up in an affair with the dumb but horny Tilly. MaryLouise Parker and Rob Reiner also appear as Cusack's longsuffering wife and his communist best friend who end up betraying him while he's too busy to notice thanks to the stress he's under with everything going on backstage.Allen's most honored film since Hannah and Her Sisters it is a delightful valentine to the hard work that goes into the creation of live theater and the dreams of those achieving success that is rarely given. The mixture of artists and the underworld gives it a fun vibe and everybody delivers the goods. There's tinted effects in the coloring that make it feel very much a part of its era and that ended up making it the surprise hit of 1994. While the musical chose to use period songs to help tell the story the few that are heard here are also appropriate to the time as well. Unfortunately the magic of the movie was missing according to critics for the Broadway version and it didn't repeat its success on stage that it had found on film. But the cast while not award winners were well chosen and it is a testament to Allen's initial screenplay that it did manage a national tour and a bit of a cult following.".

	schema:reviewBody "Michael Winner's career as a director has been plagued with some bad movies with the likes of Death Wish 2 Death Wish 3 The Nightcomers and Parting Shots notable for their awfulness. However there is one film that frequently makes it onto the Michael Winner craplist that I feel is rather better than its reputation suggests. That film is Bullseye! While not a forgotten masterpiece Bullseye! is certainly amusing enough and harmless enough to pass a little time.

What about the evident fun that Caine and Moore are having with their imbecilic characters? What about the way that the film is fast paced and rather entertaining in its simpleminded way?

However there is one film that frequently makes it onto the Michael Winner craplist that I feel is rather better than its reputation suggests. That film is Bullseye! While not a forgotten masterpiece Bullseye! is certainly amusing enough and harmless enough to pass a little time.

	schema:reviewBody "Pairing Roger Moore and Michael Caine must have thought to be a great Idea. Probably inspired by The Man Who Would be King where Caine was paired with another exBond Sean Connery. Bullseye didn't have benefit of larger scale epiclike canvass of TMWWBK as it didn't want itself to be taken seriously. Did Bullseye work?Yes and No God we all hate this kind of answer. No because most of the time the jokes fall flat on the face. Yes because Caine and Moore as usual are always great to watch. They play a pair of conmen and a pair of treacherous scientists. Keep an eye on Moore always known as a great adlibber. Unfortunately only this two guys are the only reasons to watch the movie.Bullseye takes the premise of impersonating this time two of them and adds twist and turn moving from a caper flick to espionage. While it tries hard to be a comedy most of the time you see some humourless farce in an inconsistent progress. I quickly lost interest in the story during the first half an hour and just sat through the rest watching the dynamic duo of England. Being a Bond fan I was especially delighted to see Moore playing off his Bond persona even throwing lines like For England'. Ring a bell Bondfans?There is Sally Kirkland who provides some personal agenda to the ageing conmen while also providing a bit of flesh here and there. She looks positively old and attractive at the same time. But her character does nothing much but to be in between Moore and Caine and helping them with their con. That's all. I checked out Michael Winner's the director past record and was surprised to note that he directed the more seroius films like the Death Wish films and The Big Sleep a supposedly sequel of Farewell My Lovely. While the former was successful in its own way the latter killed nostalgicnoir delight began by Farewell My lovely. He later went on to direct many bombs and regarded generally as a horrible director. Wonder how he managed to find job for so long. It is so evident in this film. Whether it's him the script or his crew the movie failed to amuse many at that time it will still fail to amuse many now. Bullseye is something the film couldn't achieve.".

How could any film be such a complete failure? Even awful films usually have some saving grace some ray of light that stops your viewing being a completely worthless experience  one good performance or one funny line or even just some good scenery. 'Bullseye!' however exists entirely in a vacuum in a cinematic black hole. The script No good. The acting No good. The direction No good. The editing No good. Even the music No good. Yet later I realised that the ray of light that I'd been looking for was actually in the fact that the film was such a total glorious misfire and if one watches it from that perspective it's a wonderful film. The next time it came on TV I made sure to tape it and every so often I watch it again in awe at its uselessness. It's nothing against Michael Winner personally.

As Caine says at the beginning of the movie everybody is said to have a double and Caine's double just happens to be a nuclear scientist who is attempting to rip off the American and British governments by leaching research money off them and then selling their discovery to others. After a successful jewel heist the CIA then approach Caine and Moore and blackmail them into posing as the scientists to get the plans.There is really little else to the movie other than the personality clashes and the comedy of errors. Caine's character seriously wants to get laid and finds out that the character that he is posing as is Jewish and shuns all of the luxuries that he desires while Moore's character seems to get everything that he wants. Moore is far more charming than Caine who in reality is a badluck magnet.The cameo by John Cleese at the end is also rather cool and goes to show just how much bad luck these two criminals seem to attract to themselves.".

It's a silly premise but it works well on its own terms at first but once the evil pair are aware of what the good pair is doing the film disintegrates. The plot becomes more and more convoluted and incomprehensible as the film goes along and therefore all the potential entertainment is extinguished. Caine and Moore aren't to blame for the film's failure as they both give good performances the fault lies with director Michael Winner.Even the cameo by John Cleese at the end is muffed.".

This is an energetic fastpaced comedy though crude at times there is an embarrassing scene of a wax dummy getting shot in the head and it does get a little tiresome near the end. Roger Moore's own daughter has a fairly big role and she's pretty cute and appealing. And I do appreciate the tour through many different locations that the movie takes us on.

	schema:reviewBody "The teenagers viewed at the center of Larry Clark's Bully seem at least to me to really have nothing going for them. They have sex almost on a constant basis drink smoke pot drop acid and have reckless meaningless lives. It might appear that Bully could possibly be a darker continuation of his 1995 outing Kids which also focused on endangered youth but I think the questions at this film's core run deeper.No doubt Bully will provoke outrage and controversy those feelings are warranted as they allow for intelligent discussion about the characters and events in the film. With this film Clark's direction certainly seems a lot more focused polished and has much more outside appeal than Kids.The story centers on Marty Brad Renfro and his subliminally sadomasochistic relationship with his socalled best friend since they were kids Bobby Nick Stahl. Marty is your average teenage surferbum. He's dropped out of high school and is constantly picked on by Bobby. Marty befriends and eventually impregnates his new girlfriend Lisa Rachel Miner.Rachel sees and quickly grows tired of Bobby's constant humiliation of his best friend and suggests to Marty that one way to deal with Bobby is to kill him. So they call upon the Hitman Leo Fitzpatrick to help with the dastardly deed. From that moment on Marty Rachel and several others embark on a path that is littered with boasting lying and guiltridden feelings about what they're about to do. No question that these teenagers get what comes to them in the end and the buildup to that moment is quite intense.If there is one thing that people can agree on about Bully it's that it is frighteningly accurate and true to life. The film which is based on an actual murder that took place in 1993 in Florida is quite authentic. Larry Clark even journeyed to the actual Florida suburb where the murder took place and the members of the film's young cast even take the names of those that were involved.The cast is perfect not a single terrible performance. If there's one thing these kids agree on it's that Bobby deserves to die. He's just a bully and a rapist to boot who does the deed for the cheap thrill of it. There is no question that Bobby is perhaps one of the most loathsome characters ever depicted on film. He may be a closet homosexual he has an obsession with gay porn he takes Marty to a gay bar and forces him to dance on stage while the patrons stuff dollar bills into his pants and his violent actions towards Marty and Lisa could be his way of dealing with those repressed desires and he is a sociopath who may have been pushed to these limits by his tough but loving father. But look at the bigger picture they're not killing him for the fact that he could be a homosexual Bobby's murder is even more terrible for the simple reason there is no clear warrant for it. In fact their actions aren't motivated so much by revenge as it is jealousy. Most of these kids work lowpaying jobs at fast food restaurants and live off of handouts from their ignorant parents. Bobby is on his way to college and looks to work with his father in their own business which strangely enough Marty takes up as a part time job.Like Kids Clark makes good use of imagery. One of the film's closing shots says a lot more than a teacher ever could Marty's younger brother stares sadly into his eyes wearing a tshirt that says D.A.R.E. To Resist Drugs And Violence. Powerful imagery indeed. And also like Kids he makes good use of people much younger than the main characters they talk drink and act like adults and they haven't even hit puberty yet.Much has been said about Clark's tendencies to zoom in on and focus on the anatomy of his young cast. True there is much sex and nudity in this film but I think it's beside the point. Clark is simply trying to capture the reality of today's troubled youth  how sex and drugs are pitiful attempts at giving meaning to their lives.Bully is an excellent exploration of the youth of today's dark and troubling times in America. Like Kids it's a film that's meant for intelligent discussion beyond the usual controversy and rage that's custom for movies like this.".

It really truly happened. The actors turn in outstanding performances as teenagers with nothing to do but turn to sex and drugs to fill the empty voids in their lives. Nick Stahl is particularly amazing as Bobby the boarderline psychotic who tormented his friends until they could take it no more.This is a sad realistic look at how many teenagers really do act with their peers. Don't look for your typical teenager fare here because you won't find it. The language sex and drug use may bother some people but thats because no one wants to believe that young adults can be this way. Well I got out of high school two years ago and I can tell you that this is not far from reality. Thats probably why it has affected me so much...because I know that stuff portrayed in this movie really does happen. This is a great movie. Watch it. Then go tell your kids you love them.".

	schema:headline " One of the darkest and most uncompromising borderline exploitation films ever made";
	schema:reviewBody "Larry ClarkKIDS KEN PARK has made a very difficult film to digest here. BULLY. The film is about a group of teenagers who decide to murder one of their own. Their victim is Bobby KentNick Stahl a sadistic coldblooded extremely homophobic serial rapist. However this motley crew of young people are completely inexperienced in such matters and decide to enlist the help of a trailer trash weirdo hitman who is barely older than any of them. The film is very explicit not only in it's shocking violence but in it's VERY graphic sex and drug use. The scenes of sex and drug use lack joy excitement pleasure and humanity and the camera likes to mash our faces in all the bruised sweaty scummy teenage flesh. Many of the sex scenes come off quite disturbing and bizarre. There's no sense of human restraint or dignity which makes the scenes all the more realistic. The violence and drug use are simply an embarrassment to watch. The drug use makes all the characters look completely ridiculous and foolish. The violence is cold brutal and messy without any sense of style strategy or mercy. It's all rather gritty.BULLY is perhaps Larry Clark's darkest film. What is incredibly horrific about this film to me is that these characters seem to have no idea what on earth they are doing throughout the entire film. They are completely unprepared and shallow when the time comes to actually murder Bobby Kent and then when they actually manage to eventually get it done they make one mistake after another and it's really quite pitiful to watch. I'm not going to give away the ending but I will say that it won't surprise the audience at all after seeing these characters' blatant clumsiness. The characters make so many stupid decisions that it almost becomes a dark comedy or dark satire. However the fact that it happens so fast is what keeps us from having time to laugh. The characters themselves are quite bizarre. There's Marty who is the main victim of Bobby who beats his girlfriend and gets her pregnant. He comes off as more of a bad guy than Bobby Kent does at times strangely. There's Lisa Marty's clearly psychotic and very sick girlfriend. Ali who has a child of her own and is the one who truly leads Bobby to his death. Heather an abused burned out exdrug addict. Donnie who is obviously has a good nature but is too stoned on a regular basis to think for himself. There's Lisa's cousin Derek who just wants to constantly take the easy way out. Then there's the hitman himself who has a slightly tougher posterior but ends up being just as unprepared and dehumanized as the rest of the characters when the murder actually takes place. Of the characters the only two I could really muster up any sympathy at all for were Heather and Donnie and I could probably personally relate to Donnie the best but they are in reality all equally dumb and crazed. No matter which way I slice it the only character I end up hating more and more is the Lisa character. I did end up feeling bad for Bobby as he was getting murdered but that was just because he had more potential and more of a future than all of the other characters meaning that he had more of a chance of redemption and feeling real sorrow for his actions than any of the other characters. That doesn't make him any less of a bad person but then again these are all bad people and we should only look at what they do and what the commit in this film as a reminder that parents need to be more in charge and take a stand. This film is incredible and it must be seen to be truly believed.".

Whether they know it or not their children at least know children like these they are living in a world that includes this reality. Some of the best insights are in the portrayals of the parents.Every one of them believes that their child has fallen in with the wrong crowd and they are all right. What they don't seem to be able to conceive of is that their child IS part of the wrong crowd and why it is wrong. None if then could be described as a good kid being lead astray but all of them except the psychologically monstrous Bobby do have some appealing or at least pathetic qualities and might have been saved by adult intervention. But there is none and they are lost from the beginning. These parents can't see their children don't know their children seem to be afraid of them afraid of confronting them either because they fear losing them or pushing them into even more destructive behavior. They seem to care but not enough to risk embarking on a messy intervention. They only want to relate to them as the accessible children they used to be.So the children even though are 1622 they are emotionally 810 are so addled by drugs and alcohol and sex that have no concept of the reality and consequences of actions. They do seem to have a good grasp of the one fact that their lives are essentially hopeless what they are doing is unsustainable and can not lead to anything but selfdestruction. They know it but it is no more real to them than a video game. Nothing is real you just hit the replay button and do it over. And there seems to be no one in their world but other teenagers just like themselves. This includes the hit man they have mistaken for an adult more competent than themselves able to lead them in safely freeing themselves from the sociopath who main interest in life is controlling them torturing them convincing them they are worthless and helpless. It is gut wrenching to watch them deteriorate individually and as a group in the face of the actual murder and its aftermath.Watching them is like watching school children hijack their own school bus and accelerate toward a brick wall watching the crash in slow motion fascinated and helpless seeing the expressions on their faces change seeing them looking at one another saying it wasn't my idea I didn't do it I didn't mean it as the gap closes. The conclusion the prison sentences is devastating.".

	schema:reviewBody "There's something about the kids in Larry Clark's films such as this Bully and his 1995 classic Kids which took place in New York and had the feel of an uninterviewed documentary where the characters are brought so vividly to life and their contemplations and actions in their deadend lives that I get reminded of the people I was around back in my grade school days I've been out of the public school system for six months now. I remember the layabouts the complainers the overly medicated and of course I remember the bullies laying on abuse that sometimes they weren't even aware they were inflicting.  Nick Stahl plays Billy bully among a circle of teenage friends in Hollywood Florida and his best friend from childhood is Marty played with striking intensity by Brad Renfro has been daily receiving torment if not with punches and slaps then more on the mental side.  Soon his girlfriend makes a suggestion he should be killed and very soon after that the circle of friends agree and then it continues along with a socalled hit man a good small part for Fitzpatrick who was noteworthy in Kids.There will be some out there who may not be able to stomach the elements  it's unrated not a bad move and there are as many moments of sex as in a Cinemax soft porn and as many moments of smoking dope as in a Method ManRedman production  but that's all part of Clark's overall effect and he pulls it off like a true craftsman and not as a overly exploitation filmmaker.  This circle of friends are a sad hollow representation of the kinds of societies the youth of the nation inhabit and the key is that it's correct at least in such a banal suburbia.  Grade A".

I remember the layabouts the complainers the overly medicated and of course I remember the bullies laying on abuse that sometimes they weren't even aware they were inflicting.  Nick Stahl plays Billy bully among a circle of teenage friends in Hollywood Florida and his best friend from childhood is Marty played with striking intensity by Brad Renfro has been daily receiving torment if not with punches and slaps then more on the mental side.  Soon his girlfriend makes a suggestion he should be killed and very soon after that the circle of friends agree and then it continues along with a socalled hit man a good small part for Fitzpatrick who was noteworthy in Kids.There will be some out there who may not be able to stomach the elements  it's unrated not a bad move and there are as many moments of sex as in a Cinemax soft porn and as many moments of smoking dope as in a Method ManRedman production  but that's all part of Clark's overall effect and he pulls it off like a true craftsman and not as a overly exploitation filmmaker.  This circle of friends are a sad hollow representation of the kinds of societies the youth of the nation inhabit and the key is that it's correct at least in such a banal suburbia.  Grade A";

	schema:reviewBody "Larry Clark first shocked the film world in 1995 with the explicit and relentless 'Kids' and that's the movie he has become known for and will be remembered for. However Bully is a superior movie in every way.Unlike Kids Bully is not an aimless attempt to shock the population. It is evident throughout the movie with the nihilistic view of sex and murder that Larry Clark's main intention here like with Kids is to shock the viewer. But here the shocks aren't gratuitously over the top with the exception of the actual murder and because there is a plot the shocks are allowed to become more shocking as we can care for what's going on not just see the shocking images. Also unlike Kids Larry Clark has put more emphasis on the characters and they are built up somewhat unlike the cold shells we were presented with in Kids. Of course the characters in this movie are based on actual living people and are not just works of fiction and therefore they are bound to have more depth.Bully is based on the true story of a group of kids that killed their mean friend in order to end their problems. The character of the 'bully' played to perfection by Nick Stahl is presented in a manner that very much makes him the villain of the piece. However at the same time the bully is given a human element it is obvious that he's not a true villain but rather a sexually confused teenager and therefore when he is killed the audience is made to feel guilty for wanting him dead and we can therefore identify with the other characters throughout their guilt. And this is a great thing for a movie to do Bully takes us on an emotional roller coaster ride and therefore it is a hard movie to forget. Unlike Kids we're not shocked by what we see we're shocked by what we feel and this makes for some very uncomfortable viewing.The entire cast of Bully excels in their roles and that's just another good point to add to Bully's already impressive resume. All characters involved are made believable and they all have their contribution to the story and none are lost within the film and therefore they all manage to stand out from the others.Bully is impressive in many ways the story is presented well and we are able to care for it it is well acted well characterized and the direction is more than competent. Overall Bully is a great if uncomfortable roller coaster of a movie and it is therefore recommended to those that want to see movies that break the Hollywood mould and movie fans in general.".

Anyway that was my introduction to Larry Clark and the amazing Leo Fitzpatrick and when I had heard not long ago that these two got together and made another harrowing teen film called Bully I just had to watch it but apart of me wishes I didn't watch it because I scared me in a way because of how real it was.   Leo Fitzpatrick is not the lead star in this one though this one is left to Brad Renfro Marty and Nick Stahl Bobby who are two best friends who live in world where they sell phone sex for gay people and make homosexual films to sell to porn shops just you're average teenager of course but Bobby is a dominating friend towards Marty and Marty just breaks and decides with his vulnerable girlfriend that they should kill Bobby so he won't be a problem in their lives from there we are taken into this dark tale of teenage revenge. There is a big build to what happens in this film and that's what makes it harrowing viewing because you just don't know what is going to happen. But by the time the film had ended I straight away bombarded the internet with information about the real happening of what actually went on.Overall this is Larry Clark's best work to date and it opens you up to a whole new world of talented actors and a director that should be praised more about his work.   This is not the sort of film that finishes and you go on with what you are doing it will stay in your head for a while and will leave wanting more in way because you really feel that you want the film to go on a bit longer to know more about these fascinating characters.".

Anyone who has watched other people taking drugs knows how boring it is and the sex is only there for titillation. Most of the nude scenes have little to do with the plot and yes  they do seem to point at the fact that the director is a pervert. There simply is no need for us to see Bijou Phiip's crotch in 'that scene'  it has been clearly established at that point that the character is a tad slutty.Well those who love it have little understanding of art and those who rail against it are reacting in a way that gives Clark the publicity that he wants.

The problem or benefit to Larry Clarke's filmmaking is that the scenario becomes uberreal.Here the casting and acting are all topnotch. Everything about the grimy swampy Florida suburbs are elucidated to the outside world giving us a look at the crappy lives of these deadbeat teens. None of the lifestyles here should surprise you if you've spent much time in a podunk beach town or a crappy stripmallinfested slice of Americana. But as previously said the casting and direction is a little too authentic.This movie is much better than Kids because it doesn't feel like a pederast obsession and highlights a more explicit event. Thing is Clarke's movies always feel kinda creepy and I wonder if the dude doesn't have an unhealthy obsession with this grimy broken youth culture. He seems to have really strong nostalgia for his experiences of living through it. It doesn't surprise me that Leo Fitzpatrick a character here and in Kids also worked with director Todd Solondz. In ways Solondz makes me think of a cross between Clarke and Woody Allen's darker clever moments.This is worth watching. Even if it isn't pleasurable viewing it's captivating and solid filmmaking.

	schema:reviewBody "Is not easy to talk about a movie like Bully. Maybe is because i'm young or maybe is because the film be for me hard to digest but whatever it is i'm convinced that this movie is an urgent and sad must see.Bully based on a book and on real facts told us the story of two boys Marty and Bobby. They know since children and now as almost men they make home porn videos between them for sold it to gay men. Go to gay clubs to win money and too make erotic calls for gay just for win more money and for fun. Marty loves surf Bobby to be a monster. Bobby always dominate Marty as he want he always beat him without any reason more than butter. But this going to change when Lisa Marty's girlfriend give to her boyfriend an idea Let's kill Bobby.Bully is not an easy movie as i say before is kind of explicit sexually but psychologically is really disturbing. Larry Clark smash up to us the reality gradually and that makes it more deep and more than visceral than anything. Second by second we see how these young people with a life to handle fall to an abyss with no return. That is the impressive thing of Bully is a tasteless movie with an important message to improve. This is the case of Bully Is it's atmosphere. Yes the photography is not any novelty but the thing is how is show to us. Bully have as a bottom scenario a beautiful sundown. But is a hard and absorbent yellow color. Then the night fails and is where the young people but they are not studying or playing something no thinking about what to do or at least not doing something at least sleep As i do much times. They are in the streets being promiscuous sexually taking drugs having sex or... ah yes maybe planning the death of somebody. Of course this is not the general situation but is happening in all the world. I'm not any saint believe me but movies like Bully makes you wonder about that at least just a little and is why is so deep and powerful.Is not only the power and Clark's direction what makes this movie a Must See and a Masterpiece is of course their performances. All performances are great specially Brad Renfro The funny boy form Ghost World and Rachel Miner As the girlfriend of Marty.This is not a movie for just a public is wide in it. It can be for people of the characters ages for parents for old for young. Of course is not the unique movie that teach us things but is an excellent and hard film for show to the world its situation. Bully is a film who takes some of the concerns of the young people and relation it with the adults with grown ones. We see in some scenes a really sad message this is not only their fate is the fate of much young ones. We see how some of the little children learn then how to win this kind of future. This movie develop their characters fears as any young have as any person have but this time that fears are concentrated in our past in that big step to let the child world and take front to a world of pain and pessimism contrary of child's world. Is about pressure as much know the law of the fittest. At the end Bully is about that is about a world that seems to be more near of fall into an abyss without return.Sorry for the mistakes...well if there any.".

These movies don't show those rotten kids hanging out on the street corners. They depict YOUR kids in a way you never want to see them. Thats why his movies are so powerful because they show a reality few people want to admit exists. This movie and Kids should be standard viewing for parents and teens alike.

Clark did his job just fine but the script was so meandering and desperate to shock that the film itself lacked any kind of narrative focus and did inevitably seem almost entirely dedicated to being shocking and nothing more. What though I asked myself could Clark achieve with a focused script a bigger budget and some more accomplished actors? Bully is the exhilarating answer. Although shot in the similarly gritty style of his debut  Bully has so much more going for it in every conceivable department. All of the actors involved give truly phenomenal frightening performances. The script is dark honest and thematically uncompromising. Clark's visual sense has sharpened ten fold revealing a film maker with an astonishingly accomplished grasp of both linear narrative storytelling and cohesive relevant stylistics. The best examples of both occur in the film's finale when for the first time in the film Clark resorts to using incongruous pop music on the soundtrack. As the film slowly slips away and the music eases us into the relaxed reality that we were only watching a movie the film's final image throws up a shattering caption which hits home like a fist in the throat. Its tough. Its utterly uncompromising. Its one of the finest films I've seen in the last ten years. I urge everyone with an open mind to go and seek it out.".

	schema:reviewBody "Larry Clark's newest film Bully is a nonstop ride of explicit sex violence and drugs in much the same spirit as his hit film Kids. Unlike Kids Bully is based on a true story that occurred in Hollywood a suburb of Ft Lauderdale Florida in July 1993.Mr. Clark based this movie heavily on the book Bully by Jim Schutze. VERY heavily.  In fact up until after the murder the movie pretty much reads line for line out of the book.  After the murder Mr. Clark takes a little creative licensing on events.  For example Marty Puccio's house was not raided by the police in real life. He turned himself in.  It was Derek Kaufman 'The Hitman' whose house was raided.  But these are small quibbles. Also Mr. Clark didn't cover any of the trials or much of the postmurder police investigation.  But again these are minor in terms of the story he is portraying.Two bigger changes that Mr. Clark made was Bobby and Marty's supposed steroid use and Lisa's weight problem.  In the book Marty and Bobby are portrayed as muscle bound steroid users with steroid aggression beating up on anybody that got in their way.  Whether they actually used steroids or not Marty and Bobby were very well built in real life.  Compare a photo of the real Bobby Kent to one of actor Nick Stahl and you'll see what I mean. The reason I bring this up is the book makes it easier to see why people were intimidated and fearful of Bobby Kent.  It is kind of hard seeing Mr. Stahl as this ruthless bully.In the book Mr. Schutze makes a big point of Lisa Connelly's weight problem.  In the movie Lisa played by Rachel Miner is very thin and in good shape.  The weight problem which caused her to have problems with getting boyfriends in the book makes her determination of staying with Marty despite abuse and rape more understandable.A casual viewer might not understand why these kinds of points are relevant but they are since the book explored the dynamics of these dysfunctional personalities whereas the movie just displays them with no background or foundation.  In other words the book better explored the backgrounds and personalities of the characters than the movie did.Overall I like the movie for its entertainment value and enjoyed watching it despite its very dark nature.  I think the young actors especially Brad Renfro were great.  I think the camera work was excellent.  And the music was outstanding.BUT with that being said.  Do not take anything in this movie as 100 factual.  There are a great many people who do not believe the book Bully to be completely accurate.  I personally believe the book to be very fictionialized and completely disliked how Mr. Schutze approached the subject.  For example Mr. Schutze gives no references for any of the 'facts' in his book.  One is left to guess if they came from court documents police reports the convicted killers or his own imagination. Some events he described were detailed to the point of unbelieveability. Even his narrative is flawed and inconsistencies can be noticed from one page to another.  There are many other flaws in it but this is not the forum to be listing them.  I am just pointing this out since the movie was based off the book and therefore might not be completely accurate to what really happened.Before you see this movie beware that it is unrated.  If it had been rated I couldn't imagine any rating below an NC17.  I actually saw a few older people walk out of the theater during the explicit sex scenes.  There is also gay sex rape drug use and heavy violence.  So if you do not like that kind of material I would not recommend you see this movie.If you do go and see it stay thru the whole credits.  Mr. Clark listed the killers original sentences just before the credits started but a few of them Marty Lisa and Ali's were significantly reduced on appeal and two Derek Dzvirko and Heather have been released after serving a few years each in prison.  Mr. Clark lists this info AFTER the credits roll.".

I saw it in good faith foolishly believing the critics who poured out their praise. Imagine my shock then when I witnessed possibly the most offensive and worthless creation I have ever seen. The problems I have with 'Bully' and Larry Clark are almost endless and I will not mention everything here. The characters are vile and there is nothing there to make you care in the slightest about them. The plot is weak and the script corny and pathetic. The main problem I have with the movie however is the apparent perversion of director Clark. Seemingly Clark is the definition of dirty old man as he has his young actresses nude whenever possible. Almost every scene involves nudity in some form or another. I'm sure Clark will claim he is making a statement about the repetitive and pointless lives of Suburban teenagers but that seemingly is his excuse to be a pervert. PLEASE do not see this movie! I dont know how I can put my disgust into words any more plainly. DO NOT SEE THIS!".

He is warned off the investigation by his boss as the school is a generous benefactor to the Police benevolent fund. Abel however cannot let the case go not only because his own brother committed suicide years before but also it seems that the spirit of the dead boy is leaving them clues as to what really happened that night.";

It is anyone's guess why a film of this quality should not make it commercially while there are so many less wellmade movies that linger on the screens for weeks or months. The film is well acted well directed beautifully photographed and well scored.The possible reason for its lack of attention may have been due to some test screenings where the audience was asked to evaluate. Despite all of the fine points of the film the problem lies in the screen adaptation by David Kane of the haunting novel by Alice Hoffman. Too many loose ends do not a story make and in the final analysis it is difficult to converse with someone who has not seen the film just what it is about.Ostensibly THE RIVER KING is about a private prep school out in the snowy fields of somewhere a place where secret societies still haze faculty are still under the control of the school's funders and appearances are far more important than truths. Abel Edward Burns is called in to investigate the found drowned body of a student and with his partner John Kapelos the two detectives suspect foul play  suicide murder hazing. Their investigation includes questioning the victim's only friend Carlin Rachelle Lefevre and one photography and English Lit teacher Betsy Jennifer Ehle. But as the investigation proceeds Abel has flashbacks to his childhood memories of his own older brother's suicide dark secrets that have haunted him and it is this psychic matrix which serves as the canvas for him to resolve the case as well as to relate to the various characters within the confines of the prep school.Many of the questions raised by the narrative remain unanswered by this frustrating script but the actors bring as much involvement and credibility as they are able to create a film of mystery and selfrealization in the snow and ice of the fields around the school. For those who wish more reading Hoffman's novel will be more satisfying. Grady Harp".

It pulled at my mind in a way very few films do these days and it did so without a lot of hype and overacting. I also found the film score very refreshingit was unexpected for the film's subject think Bernard Herrmann's score for North by Northwestnot what you expect but it fits beautifully. Overall a very enjoyable film if just a bit slow at the beginning. Makes me want to go buy the book!".

While they're not sure what to do with the body they notice a strange feature on the corpse's chest. Ed Burns takes this case seriously as everyone else wants to dismiss it so quickly as a suicide or accident. This is the great plot build up. The rest is downhill.

This isn't really a horror movie so don't be mislead or anything. It's more like a mysterywhodunitdrama with a touch of the supernatural. It was fun rewatching it because now I've noticed a few other things like some clues that were given. The movie's pace is very slow but that didn't translate to 'being boring' more like intriguing instead. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful and the musical score is excellent. I expected no less because this is a film by Nick Willing Hypnotic aka Doctor Sleep  Photographing Fairies.A boy in his late teens is found dead in the frozen river. Abel Grey Edward Burns starts to investigate and the trail leads him to a prestigious school with an exclusive student club. A lot of subplots occur and I didn't even mind that some of them don't really lead anywhere. They were rather interesting and provided some nice insights to several characters. The main storyline is of course the investigation of the accidental deathmurdersuicide of the teenager. Parallel with that investigation detective Grey comes to terms with a hidden trauma from his past involving the death of his brother. It is connected in more ways with the current investigation than only the outcome of the investigation. So The River King is a pretty clever movie which works on many levels. What it lacks in suspense it compensates in atmosphere.".

I'd say that there is a lot more soul in this movie than in Tarantino's gangster flick. In fact this movie probably had matched if not surpassed the Dogs in several respects and it had probably set a new benchmark for those who are aware of the existence of the modern Russian cinema. Both movies depicted stylized violence simply for the sake of violence. However in the Russian case it's not all made up. It's their everyday life. The acting of the Bummer gang was terrific. This movie depicts very realistically Russia's Putinera criminal nihilism which is less glorious than in the Yeltsin era but still very interesting for an outside eye the corrupt cops and the decaying provincial infrastructure. Unfortunately I doubt that the English language subtitles can do justice to the slang terms used in this movie I watched the Russian language version without subtitles.".

	schema:reviewBody "Bimmer's the Russian term for the BMW and with such a title the vehicle has to be a plot device in the movie.The film begins with the stealing of a BMW 7series by a gang of four petty thieves. Given that it's such a wonderful car they decide to keep it for themselves instead of selling it off. But before the film reaches cruising speed a confrontation with another gang goes wrong and our quartet is on the run from both the cops and from the mob.So they're off on a road trip in their ill gotten BMW and scene after scene we're treated to set pieces like encounters with a gang of truckers corrupt cops and a doctor in a small town. Some of these scenes are hilarious watching our quartet outsmarting and wriggling their way out of situations while others are sometimes plain boring. So it's rather uneven.Despite the title being a car model there is absolutely no car chases in this film which is a pity otherwise we could have seen the 7series being put to good use. However what's refreshing is the scenery. I haven't seen much of Moscow or Russia and this film offered an opportunity to do so.It also attempts to explore the relationships between the friends to see if there is indeed honour amongst thieves at a time when it really would have counted. The ending is kinda unexpected but all the more makes you wonder about the this theme.With an excellent soundtrack each time the Bimmer is driven you'll forgive this show for some of its shortfalls.".

	schema:reviewBody "It is unusual that a first time director knocks it out of the park for their first feature film especially below the age of 30 and fresh out of film school but Buslov did it with Boomer that is the correct way to pronounce it not Bummer or Bimmer. The story is pretty strong it has substance and body unlike many other crime films. There is no attempt at comedy here no desire to laugh at the expense of victims or the bad guys nor is there action just for the sake of action. Boomer reaches into the criminal dilemma as said by one of the criminals in rebuke to a woman who accuses him of being a bad person It's life that's this way. The characters are real and their journeys are credible. Their environment is also effectively put across Russia's confused 90's landscape with the criminal world on the one side and the suckers the populace on the other which is suffering from poverty and alcoholism. The cinematography by Daniel Gurevich is excellent sadly he was to die before the film was released together with talented Russian actor Sergei Bodrov Brother Brother 2 who had also seen rough cuts of Boomer and had been supportive. The music is likewise effective blending Russian folk themes with pop music. The cell phone ringtone ended up being such a hit that composer Sergei Shnurov ended up netting 1MM in royalties from it alone comparable to the film's initial box office performance. To me this is how crime films should be done  more focus on the human condition with action as an accompaniment not the goal.".

This is a classic fatalistic gangster movie about smalltime Russian criminals from the nineties who accidentally kill an undercover cop and go into hiding on a stolen black BMW. This film caught the dusk of the nineties of the gangster anarchy. The film's protagonists live by the rules of the nineties but the rules the world around them begin to change part of the change is police and intelligence becoming the dominant gangs. The heroes are dinosaurs of the era that is ending but they are not conscious of it. The whole film can be viewed as a story of new world and new rules marginalizing and destroying the protagonists. The first half of the film is stronger then the second in my opinion but all in all this film was made exceptional by unusually natural performances and authentic dialogue compared to other Russian crime movies.".

Its one of the few movies which are been made in this days where u actually start understand every character and their friendship and how their relationship are important to each other. For example how everyone became supportive towards injured Dimon and how same Dimon felt sorry when everyone was killed. Kostya aka Kot was a leader and it was obvious towards us without even making it clear to us because it was real obvious how in one way everyone was reliable towards him. The only question which probably left after movie is what were bandits were doing really in other words what kind of bandits their were. But on other way it wasnt really important what their were doing as lifetime in movie as it was really necessary in storyline. Overall Rank 810".

	schema:reviewBody "When geology geography and climate conspire against a human  canine family splitting them apart the resilience of the canines and the determination of the humans ensures that they're all best equipped in their psyches to deal with the devastation wrought by an almighty earthquake.A fictional film based on reality arising from the magnitude 6.9 Chetsu Earthquake of 2004 'Mari to koinu no monogatari' 'A Tale of Mari and Three Puppies' is a heartwarming tearjerker of a family film and a fantastic fable of the mutual benefits brought by the interpersonal bonds of mutual love compassion and trust which humans and canines can share. The most fictional additions are siblings Aya Mao Sasaki and Ryota Ishikawa Ryohei Hirota who anchor the emotional heart of the tale and who have a thing or two to teach the grownups about extending our familial circle of compassion beyond our own species.Set among the beautiful rice paddy terraced hillsides around Yamakoshi Village Niigata Prefecture Japan at first the children's lives appear to be a paragon of the rural idyll  yet their widower father Yuichi Ishikawa Eiichiro Funakoshi is planning on moving his family to the city of Nagaoka. As her fifth birthday approaches Aya and Ryota stumble upon an abandoned puppy on the edge of Moon Field. For Aya and the puppy alike it seems like love at first sight for the youngster attempts to follow the children home. However they know well of their father's dislike of dogs so while sneaking food out to the puppy who she names Mari and playing joyfully with her in Moon Field Aya cleverly recruits some assistance from her grandfather Yoshikazu Ebisu in adopting Mari into the Ishikawa family.Yuichi's resistance crumbles in light of the joy and comfort Mari so obviously brings to Aya who is still recovering from the untimely death of her mother. A year later Mari is all grown up and a mother herself to three adorable fluffball puppies of her own who Aya names Goo Choki and Paw. Yet such joy as the puppies bring to the human members of their family is shockingly cut short when the whole district is devastated by a massive earthquake. The younger menfolk survive unharmed at work and school but Yuichi and Ryota are powerless to help Aya and her grandfather immobilised as they are in the ruins of their collapsed home.However Mari is initially unharmed too and in her dogged determination to secure safety for her pack members she slips her leash tucks her puppies out of harm's way and sets about rescuing Aya and her grandfather. Realising that she cannot dig them out without help but not for want of trying Mari runs off to recruit a pair of Japan SelfDefence Force troops and leads them back to the ruins of her home. As a Chinook helicopter winches up first the injured old man then Aya she begs her rescuer to also take Mari and her three pups  but the timecritical nature of the medevac mission leads to the dogs being abandoned in a deserted village ruin. Some have argued that director Ryichi Inomata spends too little time on the lengths to which Mari goes to weather this storm of misfortune and while we do get to enjoy some of her intelligently resourceful canine resilience Aya's determined efforts to be reunited take precedence. She first inspires her brother to volunteer to journey on foot from their evacuation centre to recover their doggy siblings then persuades him to let her come too. However a heavy thunderstorm further destabilises the dangerously weakened hilly terrain and eventually Yuichi rescues them from their bold but failing mission of mercy. Two weeks later after the aftershocks have subsided the JSDF Chinook is tasked with taking one member per family back to Yamakoshi Village for a brief two hour sortie into the wreckage of their home hamlet. The whole community is so touched by the compassionate efforts of the Ishikawa siblings to be reunited with Mari Goo Choki and Paw that they ensure Yuichi Aya and Ryota all get a seat on the helicopter. But have their canine loved ones survived and if so will they manage to find them in time?Thanks to our shared evolutionary history maintaining a mental map of our accustomed territory allows both people and dogs to act with intelligent consideration in dire circumstances and thereby maximise our chances of survival. Factor in a crossspecies theory of mind eg which route would they have taken? where will they come looking for me? and our common mammalian smarts give us a head start in lifeordeath critical decisionmaking. In portraying this insight and more this glorious story shows both how much we have in common with our companion animals and also how much richer our lives can be when we embrace building bonds of mutual love compassion and trust beyond our own species.Best to have copious supplies of tissues to hand because tears of sorrow and joy are very likely indeed. A universal narrative of the compassionate resilience of the human and canine spirit in the face of natural disaster this film richly rewards being enjoyed by folk of all ages and deserves to be seen in every quarter of our global village. Make sure you stick around for the closing credits too  to drink in photos of the lovely Yamakoshi countryside her native villagers and the real life 'Mari and Three Puppies'.You can read about the true story of Mari's postearthquake deeds which inspired this fictionalisation and of her home village's Fireworks for Mari celebration in 'The Inspiring Story of Mari and Her Puppies' by the Japan News Group originally in Japanese  for text and photos search on The Inspiring Story of Mari and Her Puppies.".

A year later Mari is all grown up and a mother herself to three adorable fluffball puppies of her own who Aya names Goo Choki and Paw. Yet such joy as the puppies bring to the human members of their family is shockingly cut short when the whole district is devastated by a massive earthquake. The younger menfolk survive unharmed at work and school but Yuichi and Ryota are powerless to help Aya and her grandfather immobilised as they are in the ruins of their collapsed home.However Mari is initially unharmed too and in her dogged determination to secure safety for her pack members she slips her leash tucks her puppies out of harm's way and sets about rescuing Aya and her grandfather. Realising that she cannot dig them out without help but not for want of trying Mari runs off to recruit a pair of Japan SelfDefence Force troops and leads them back to the ruins of her home. As a Chinook helicopter winches up first the injured old man then Aya she begs her rescuer to also take Mari and her three pups  but the timecritical nature of the medevac mission leads to the dogs being abandoned in a deserted village ruin. Some have argued that director Ryichi Inomata spends too little time on the lengths to which Mari goes to weather this storm of misfortune and while we do get to enjoy some of her intelligently resourceful canine resilience Aya's determined efforts to be reunited take precedence. She first inspires her brother to volunteer to journey on foot from their evacuation centre to recover their doggy siblings then persuades him to let her come too. However a heavy thunderstorm further destabilises the dangerously weakened hilly terrain and eventually Yuichi rescues them from their bold but failing mission of mercy. Two weeks later after the aftershocks have subsided the JSDF Chinook is tasked with taking one member per family back to Yamakoshi Village for a brief two hour sortie into the wreckage of their home hamlet. The whole community is so touched by the compassionate efforts of the Ishikawa siblings to be reunited with Mari Goo Choki and Paw that they ensure Yuichi Aya and Ryota all get a seat on the helicopter. But have their canine loved ones survived and if so will they manage to find them in time?Thanks to our shared evolutionary history maintaining a mental map of our accustomed territory allows both people and dogs to act with intelligent consideration in dire circumstances and thereby maximise our chances of survival. Factor in a crossspecies theory of mind eg which route would they have taken? where will they come looking for me? and our common mammalian smarts give us a head start in lifeordeath critical decisionmaking. In portraying this insight and more this glorious story shows both how much we have in common with our companion animals and also how much richer our lives can be when we embrace building bonds of mutual love compassion and trust beyond our own species.Best to have copious supplies of tissues to hand because tears of sorrow and joy are very likely indeed. A universal narrative of the compassionate resilience of the human and canine spirit in the face of natural disaster this film richly rewards being enjoyed by folk of all ages and deserves to be seen in every quarter of our global village. Make sure you stick around for the closing credits too  to drink in photos of the lovely Yamakoshi countryside her native villagers and the real life 'Mari and Three Puppies'.You can read about the true story of Mari's postearthquake deeds which inspired this fictionalisation and of her home village's Fireworks for Mari celebration in 'The Inspiring Story of Mari and Her Puppies' by the Japan News Group originally in Japanese  for text and photos search on The Inspiring Story of Mari and Her Puppies.";

The place where the movie shot was kinda reminds the village with trees and paddy fields from the movie 'My Neighbor Totoro'. The brothersister combo as well resembling two sisters. If you liked these two titles you would love 'A Tale of Mari and Three Puppies' for sure.Definitely it is an inspiring movie. But many scenes were not realistic especially rescue operation stuffs looks clearly a fake with amateur stunts. Just like seeing a commercial movie where story had caliber to deliver a fine product. I think they missed as opportunity to make this movie as an wonderful drama. For a story like this it would have been slow in pace to development required artistic presentation. But character emotions had a strong hold on the important scenes. Yes it is a tearjerker movie with lots of commercial elements.The little girl and the dog's performances were excellent and in few parts grandfather role as well. There were sufficient humours to make us laugh in few portions. As they say it was based on real events but a fiction story. The story follows as a family with two kids and a father and a grandfather who live in a village next to a big city which divided by a river. These kids find a puppy which comes across from nowhere on their way to go and play in a place called moon. With a struggle they finally get a permission to raise the dog. The days go on after a few years the village get hit by a major natural disaster which disconnects from the outside world. The rest of the story tells how the people who were trapped get escaped from the tragedy.I was a little disappointed for the product's final output and I could not resist mentioning it. This movie traveled in one direction sometime that did not make any sense. Like this story had no surprises and only had a happy ending as expected. On two occasions they had a chance to make a deep emotions by eliminating characters like the movies 'Hachiko' 'Red Dog' and 'Star Watching Dog'. Sentiments easily attract families so they missed to do that magic.There's two reasons why you must see the movie. If you are a animal or dog movie fan you should go for it. And of course if you like emotional stories that mean a tearjerker movie fan then it the right movie to choose.".

Whilst Juju listens in on local mutterings Clair slides pass to dip through the looking glass window to follow the play fighting of children which uncannily matches the locals descriptions of Barbier's crimes. Keeping Barbier out of sight in The Artist house Clair holds down his surreal stylising to instead give the poetic crane shots down the winding streets of the town and the whippans down to the loft an earthy proto Kitchen Sink grit rubbed from the house being given a confined rundown appearance.Opening the gate to Juju and The Artist friendship in their adaptation of Ren Fallet's novel the screenplay by Clair and Jean Aurel tantalisingly give plenty of breathing space for the friendship to gradual cover the screen as Artist and Juju have tiffs in the house they share but make up by singing songs in the pub. Putting a dent in the friendship with the runin of Barbier the writers subtlety place a Film Noir longcon bubbling in the background to explore the themes of loneliness and mistrust poured from Juju placing a much greater level of trust on Barbier's friendship than The Artist and Juju's misplaced love for pub barmaid Maria.Bringing a real warmth when hanging out together Pierre Brasseur and Georges Brassens give fantastic performances which compliment each other via the bohemian vibes Brassens wraps The Artist inand the slowly sinking himself into exile edge Brasseur gives Juju. Getting in the middle of the friends cute Dany Carrel gives an innocent sweetness to kindhearted Maria whilst Henri Vidal keeps wanted criminal Barbier's back up against the wall as the gates of Paris close.".

Keeping Barbier out of sight in The Artist house Clair holds down his surreal stylising to instead give the poetic crane shots down the winding streets of the town and the whippans down to the loft an earthy proto Kitchen Sink grit rubbed from the house being given a confined rundown appearance.Opening the gate to Juju and The Artist friendship in their adaptation of Ren Fallet's novel the screenplay by Clair and Jean Aurel tantalisingly give plenty of breathing space for the friendship to gradual cover the screen as Artist and Juju have tiffs in the house they share but make up by singing songs in the pub. Putting a dent in the friendship with the runin of Barbier the writers subtlety place a Film Noir longcon bubbling in the background to explore the themes of loneliness and mistrust poured from Juju placing a much greater level of trust on Barbier's friendship than The Artist and Juju's misplaced love for pub barmaid Maria.Bringing a real warmth when hanging out together Pierre Brasseur and Georges Brassens give fantastic performances which compliment each other via the bohemian vibes Brassens wraps The Artist inand the slowly sinking himself into exile edge Brasseur gives Juju. Getting in the middle of the friends cute Dany Carrel gives an innocent sweetness to kindhearted Maria whilst Henri Vidal keeps wanted criminal Barbier's back up against the wall as the gates of Paris close.";

He really breaks loose in the dancehall scene when he picks up Dany Carrel and spins her around daring anybody to stop him. Otherwise he goes glumly around the neighbourhood bearing the brunt of children's insults these kids are the most overactive in any French film.Georges Brassens made no more films after this one he shows little talent for acting but boy can he sing.

It's the quintessential film of the genre yet although it delivers pretty much all of the classic western tropes in spades I think the main reason I love it so much is because it's also such a great buddy movie.Pairing John Wayne's stoic hero sheriff against the selfdeprecating wit of Dean Martin's alcoholic deputy was a stroke of genius as was the casting of a very charming Angie Dickinson in the female lead role and veteran Walter Brennan as grumpy old Stumpy. The constant bickering between all the main characters makes 'Rio Bravo' so much fun but the humor in the great script and the wonderful performances by the game cast are only half of what makes this movie so great.The other quality 'Rio Bravo' has which makes it stand out among other greats of the genre is its mood. There's an almost apocalyptic sense of doom permeating the movie throughout and that constant dread combined with the film's humor  which is often of the gallows' kind  gives it a special kind of atmosphere that other classic American westerns of that era lack. What also adds to that unique tone of the movie is the central piece of music the hauntingly beautiful Mexican ballad 'El Deguello' which plays an important role in the film.'Rio Bravo' was the last truly great movie by one of the towering figures from Hollywood's Golden Age Howard Hawks who had previously made such classics as 'Scarface' 'Red River' 'The Big Sleep' 'His Girl Friday' 'To Have And Have Not' and many more. The veteran director seemed to have realized he had made something special too as he went on to remake 'Rio Bravo' not once but twice during his remaining years. In fact his two last films were those two remakes 'El Dorado' in '67 and 'Rio Lobo' in '70.

	schema:reviewBody "For many Hawks' 'Rio Bravo' is the perfect Western... For me it is the antithesis of 'High Noon' and the clearest exposition of Hawks' philosophy of professionalism... His tough lawman solves his own problem without going out looking for help... So he welcomes volunteers and in fact depends on them... What is more he wins by displaying superior skills and quicker wits...The survivors in Hawks' philosophy are the ones who conduct themselves with the greatest degree of coolness and discipline... It is not difficult to appreciate why Hawks has used substantially the 'Rio Bravo' plot with only minor variations in both his subsequent Westerns 'El Dorado' and 'Rio Lobo.'In Fred Zinneman's 'High Noon' Gary Cooper struggles to round up a posse that might help him deal with four desperadoes arriving on a noon train to kill him... In Rio Bravo John Wayne is faced with a similar situation but takes on the forces of evil in the shape of a gang of local tyrants... Wayne always makes us feel that somehow he'll cope... So when the wagon master Ward Bond asks him if he wants to use any of his men as deputies in fighting Burdette's men he turns down the offer... Wayne holding a brutish prisoner Joe Burdette Claude Akins on a murder charge waits for the U.S. marshal to take charge of him... But the prisoner's powerful brother Nathan John Russell wants him free and is determined to release him by any method possible...The obvious method is the traditional onehired gunmenand in effect the sheriff becomes a prisoner himself in his own town But in this instance the lawman is not absolutely without help... The two deputies are a semicrippled veteran Walter Brennan and a pretty hopeless drunk with a past 'fast' reputation Dean Martin. But the whole point about this cleverly conceived movie is that this unlikely trio do in fact have something to offer when the cards are dealt... Like the sheriff they're professional people and what Hawks seems to be saying is that whatever the odds such people will always have the courage and the deeds... This is demonstrated in one inspired sequence which has become a classic Dean Martin  drying out and eager to win back his selfrespect  tells Chance that he wants to be the one who chase the killer into a saloon and that Chance should assume the less dangerous role of backing him up from the back door...'Rio Bravo' is a beautifully controlled film... John Wayne who recreated and heightened the mythology of the West is at his best...John Ford imitates Howard Hawks' tendency for having his male characters never back down from a fight even when it means they are initiating the fight themselves... In Rio Bravo's famous wordless opening villain Claude Akins throws a silver dollar into a spittoon daring Dude so desperate for a drink to humiliate himself and get the coin... Hawks' clever camera emphasizes how far beneath the standards Dude has fallen... Now Wayne is ready to confront Akins...The same scene in Ford's 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.' Lee Marvin trips unarmed James Stewart as he carries a steak dinner to Wayne in the restaurant where he works... He stumbles and the steak falls to the ground... Stewart has been obviously humiliated... Suddenly Wayne enters the frame and orders Valance to peak up 'his' steak revealing his gun belt as he faces him... He is ready for the showdown...In 'Rio Bravo' Hawks' men win out primarily because they fight together... But Hawks helps them by having the outlaws mistakenly play a Mexican tune called 'cutthroat' a song which Santa Anna tried to intimidate the Texans under siege in the Alamo... As the music plays we see Dude putting down his glass untouched... He observes that his hands no longer shake...In Hawks' 'Rio Bravo' there is tenderness and humor... In Hawks' film a man is defined by how well he relates to women how well he handles pressure and how he reacts to danger... Angie Dickinson playing the gambling gal enriches the mixture with a nicely judged performance... 'Rio Bravo' is an action Western which captures a legendary West that fits the legendary talents of Wayne and Hawks... But what makes the film so special is the relationship between the individual characters... It is a traditional straightforward Western goodhumored and exciting rich in original touches...The best moment of the film when Martin and Nelson join each other for some singing and guitar picking and Walter Brennan joins in with his harmonica and his scratchy voice... The film has a terrific score by one of the great film composers Dimitri Tiomkin...".

	schema:reviewBody "When Joe Burdette Claude Akins murders a man on a whim Sheriff John T. Chance John Wayne arrests him and puts him in small Texas town's jail. The problem is that the U.S. Marshall is a week away from taking Burdette off his hands and Burdette's brother Nathan John Russell won't see his brother put away. Complicating the situation even further Burdette is rich enough to hire a score of thugs and the only support that Chance has is from a drunk Dude Dean Martin and an elderly crippled man Stumpy Walter Brennan.Rio Bravo is a sprawling pressure cooker. For anyone not used to the pacing of older films this is not the best place to begin. Uninitiated audiences are likely to find it boringthe plot is relatively simple and they would likely have a difficult time remaining with Rio Bravo for its 2 hour and 21 minute running time. It's best to wait until one is acclimated to this kind of pacing so as not to spoil the experience. The film is well worth it.John Wayne was an enthralling paradox and maybe no film better demonstrates why than Rio Bravo. He had almost delicate pretty boy looks and a graceful gait that were an odd contrast to his hulking height and status as the action hero of his day. He speaks little and doesn't need to although he is the star and thus the center of attention. He tends to have an odd smirk on his face. Wayne's performance here interestingly parallels the pacing and tenor of the filmthat's not something that one sees very often or at least it's not something that's very easy to make conspicuous.And he's not the only charismatic cast member. Dean Martin Ricky Nelson Walter Brennan and Angie Dickinson are equally captivating. Even when the full blowout action sequence begins and that's not until about two hours into the film although there are a few great shorter action scenes before that the focus here is still on the interrelationships between these characters with Brennan the continually funny comic foil Nelson the suave skilled youngster Martin the complex and troubled but likable complement to Wayne and Dickinson as the sexy forward and clever love interest.Director Howard Hawks seems to do everything right. He guides cinematographer Russell Harlan in capturing subtly beautiful scenerylike the mountains in the distance over the tops of some buildings and a great sunrise shotand asks for an atmospheric score such as the repeated playing of Malaguena by a band in the background that shows that plot points weren't the only element of the film that influenced John Carpenter who partially based his Assault on Precinct 13 1976 on this film. But most intriguing is probably Hawks' stagingblocking. You could easily make a study of just that aspect of the film. The characters are always placed in interesting places in the frame and they're constantly moving in interesting ways throughout the small collection of buildings and streets that make up the town. There is almost a kind of performance art aspect to it. Wayne for instance repeatedly touches base at the jail then picks up his rifle circles around to the hotel and back almost as if he's doing some kind of western Tai Chi.Rio Bravo is nothing if not understated and as such it may take some adjustments from modern especially younger viewers. But it's a gem of a film and worth watching and studying.".

	schema:reviewBody "Howard Hawks initially wanted to reunite John Wayne and Montgomery Clift who had worked so well together in Red River in his second film with Wayne. Clift however was at the beginning of the slide that would ultimately destroy him in seven years and said no. It was then that Dean Martin was cast as John Wayne's alcoholic deputy. By the way if Clift had done the part it would have reunited him with Walter Brennan also who is playing a very similar part to the one he did in Red River in relation to Wayne.In the wordless beginning of Rio Bravo Wayne while going into the town saloon to fetch Dino witnesses a cold blooded killing perpetrated by Claude Akins. Akins is the no good brother of rich rancher John Russell who keeps trying to spring Akins from Wayne's jail. He also brings in some hired guns who bottle the town up.Both Howard Hawks and John Wayne absolutely hated High Noon and made Rio Bravo as their answer to it. This sheriff doesn't go around begging for help from the townspeople he's sworn to protect. He's supposed to be good enough to handle the job himself with some help from only a few good men.Dean Martin said that the Rio Bravo role for him was one of the most difficult. At that time he was playing a drunk on stage and was not yet into the substance abuse problems that beset him later on. But turns in a stellar performance.This film marked the farewell feature film performance of Ward Bond who took some time from his Wagon Train TV series to play the small role of a Wayne friend who offers to help and gets killed for his trouble. Fitting it should be in the starring film of his best friend John Wayne.The only bad note in Rio Bravo is that of Ricky Nelson who is too much the nice kid from Ozzie and Harriet to suggest being a young gun. But Rio Bravo marked the first of many films Wayne used a current teenage idol to insure box office. Later on Frankie Avalon Fabian Bobby Vinton all the way down to Ron Howard in The Shootist brought a younger audience in for the Duke. James Caan who played the Ricky Nelson part in El Dorado was much superior to Nelson. Then again Caan is an actor. But I will say that Dean and Ricky sung real pretty.When you hear Dean singing My Rifle Pony and Me in the jailhouse you might recognize the same melody from Red River as Settle Down. Dimitri Tiomkin wrote it and Dean recorded it as well as the title song for Capitol records. At Capitol Dino did mostly ersatz Italian ballads it was what he was identified with. When he switched to Reprise Dino started doing far more country and western and it really starts with the songs he did in Rio Bravo.Rio Bravo is a leisurely paced western probably one of the slowest John Wayne ever did. But Howard Hawks created some characters and a story that hold the interest through out.".

	schema:headline " Howard Hawks could perhaps have learned something from High Noon";
	schema:reviewBody "Rio Bravo is sometimes described as a rightwing riposte to Fred Zinnemann's High Noon. I am not sure why High Noon needed a rightwing riposte because it has never seemed to me to be particularly leftwing. On a literal level it deals with a subject the need for a strong stance on law and order which has always been dear to the hearts of conservatives and on a metaphorical level it would be just as easy to read a rightwing meaning into it as it would a leftwing one. Given that the film was made during the Korean War it would be easy to see Sheriff Kane as a symbol of America as the world's policeman Frank Miller and his gang as Stalin Mao and the other Communist leaders and the cowardly townspeople as the antiwar movement in the West. The received idea that the film is an allegory for McCarthyism has always struck me as a strained interpretation.It would appear however that what angered Howard Hawks and John Wayne about High Noon was not so much Zinnemann's views on McCarthyism but rather his implication that the citizens of Hadleyville are cowards for refusing to help Kane. This seems to have inspired the most direct reference to the earlier film in Rio Bravo. When it is suggested to John Wayne's Sheriff John T. Chance that he should round up a posse he replies that asking amateurs to help him fight hardened professional gunmen would only give the villains more targets to shoot at. The inference is that Gary Cooper's character was wrong to ask the townsfolk to risk their lives on his behalf.The two films are in fact broadly similar in plot. Both concern a courageous and incorruptible Sheriff taking on a gang of dangerous villains who are threatening the peace of a whole community. This basic plot was used in numerous other Westerns such as Dodge City and Gunfight at the OK Corral. In Rio Bravo Chance has arrested a local hoodlum named Joe Burdette on suspicion of murder. Burdette's brother Nathan a wealthy rancher organises a gang of gunfighters to try and free him from the jail. Chance has to try and hold off the thugs for several days until the US Marshal arrives to take Joe to stand trial.His chances of doing so however seem slim because his only assistance comes from his deputies one of whom Dude is an alcoholic and the other Stumpy is a onelegged old man. Was Dude the inspiration for Gene Wilder's character in Blazing Saddles? Dude and Stumpy however find reserves of courage within themselves and Chance recruits another volunteer a young gunman named Colorado who has seen his boss murdered by the villains. Rio Bravo in fact is not simply an action film but also a character study. One of its themes is the way in which the characters battle to overcome their problems Stumpy's disability Dude's alcoholism and in Colorado's case his initial moral cowardice and reluctance to assist.Colorado is played by Ricky Nelson a teenage pop star of the period who was brought in to try and attract a younger audience. He was however only seventeen when filming started and seems far too young and callow for the role. If Chance was so concerned about avoiding innocent casualties he would no doubt have sent such an inexperienced greenhorn back home to mother before the shooting started. Walter Brennan's Stumpy can seem a bit irritating but with those exceptions the acting is mostly good. I am of the generation which always thinks of Angie Dickinson as the sexy older woman in Police Woman so this film gave me the opportunity to see what she looked like as a sexy younger woman. Very nice too. Chance is the sort of role which John Wayne excelled in portraying but the best performance came from Dean Martin as Dude a man who finds redemption for his past misdeeds. There is also a good cameo from John Wayne's close friend Ward Bond as Pat Wheeler Colorado's murdered boss.The main difference between this film and High Noon is not one of politics but of style. High Noon is shot in real time and conveys an urgent sense of time rushing towards the final showdown it also observes the Classical unity of action as well as that of time with no digressions from the main plot. Rio Bravo is much more leisurely and spacious running to nearly 2 hours. Besides the main action there is also a subplot detailing Chance's burgeoning romance with Dickinson's character a female cardsharp and goodtime girl named Feathers and plenty of comic relief involving Carlos the Mexican barman who closely resembles Manuel in Fawlty Towers and even Stumpy who for all his bravery is often treated as a comic character. Of the two films my preference is definitely for High Noon. Rio Bravo never drags as there is always something going on to hold one's interest but it lacks the gripping pacing which makes High Noon one of the most thrilling films ever made. In my view it is perhaps the greatest Western ever. Hawks may have disagreed with Zinnemann over politics but he could perhaps have learned something from him about filmmaking. 710".

	schema:reviewBody "Well I finally got to see this flick after having seen the remake El Dorado many times and having reviewed it previously. I like this movie for what it is but those who call it a classic western or put it in the same league as High Noon are sorely mistaken. Rio Bravo is essentially the Rat Pack out west but with the Duke filling in for Frank. The Duke is never really in danger or seriously hurt. Okay he trips down the stairs. The movie lacks a compelling villain since Claude Akins pre Movin On is in jail most of the time. Ed Asner  Chris George were a great pair in ElD. Rickie Nelson as the youngest Rat gets to sing a few tunes and keep his hair puffed. He looks about old enough to shave. Dean Martin isn't bad but can't touch Robert Mitchum's performance in El Dorado. I love Walter Brennan and he's great moanin  groanin and rantin  ravin. Put him and Arthur Hunicutt Bull from El Dorado in a cell together and that would be something. There is lot's of sexual tension here provided by Angie Dickinson but I'm sorry I don't believe she'd radiate it for a guy that old. The Maudie character played by Charline Holt was a more credible and still sensual mate for the Duke. I give the nod to James Caan as Mississippi over the younger Rickie Nelson  Colorado.If this was Hawks'Waynes answer to High Noon than it's a weak reply. High Noon is a serious black  white look at a town's abandonment of it's sheriff who is in mortal danger. He's saddled with a wife and torn between staying and leaving. There's not a second of comedy in High Noon. John T Chance Wayne is a Lucky Chance with everybody he meets offering to help. This is not Western reality its Hollywood. Note that Sheb Wooley High Noon scenes in Rio Bravo were cut out.".

A fashion conscious sheriff who wears a red shirt on one day and a blue one the next who does his laundry?. A drunkard and an old geezer as his helpers. A funny stereotype Mexican couple who run a hotel. A dance hall girl who has sort of a crush on the sheriff. A saloon keeper. And lots and lots of firearms and ammo. In the beginning there are quite a few people on the streets later the town seems to be deserted except for the afore mentioned persons plus an unspecified amount of hired gunmen out to free an imprisoned murderer.Where did all the people of the little town go? They just disappear without any trace. My guess is that there was much more gun action than shown on screen and that many a good citizen succumbed under the friendly fire of the forces of the law. John Wayne and his companions are nervous and extremely trigger happy the sheriff's plan to hold out alone and wait for the Marshall to pass through the town does not seem to be dictated by common sense there would have been alternatives but by personal pride. There is no interaction whatsoever between him and the community he is supposed to serve. Frankly the sheriff seems to be a pretty irresponsible guy with the mind of an adolescent  and responsibility was the main theme of High Noon a film it must be said of a different league.On the whole I find Rio Bravo an unconvincing movie. The main protagonists have to deliver long winding unnatural monologues as to their motives and feelings which makes the movie also slow at times. This surplus of talk unfortunately does not give it or its message more substance but harms it suspensewise. Amidst the general mediocrity the brilliant performance of Dean Martin as the alcoholic who wants to regain his standing among men stands out. The same can be said for the use of music which is beautiful and fitting.I am a great admirer of John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13 a low budget movie reportedly based on Rio Bravo. I count it to my all time favorites. Amazingly Carpenter's version of the story works far better is more convincing also in a moral sense more gripping and on the whole more intelligent than the original.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have read the user's comments about Rio Bravo. Frankly I can't understand how is it possible that most of them say this is a Masterpiece or Hawk's Best or Great Movie or Still One of the Best and a lot of similar opinions.The story is rather interesting and could have done a great movie but it has so many terrible flaws that turns into a B western and that being generous. Lets see1 John Wayne is always John Wayne. He doesn't really act except perhaps in his two best westerns Stagecoach and The Shootist both really good. 2 Sheriff John T. Chance looks always as if he knew the script is on his side and he'll come out well no matter what. 3 Ricky Nelson looks exactly like a comic magazine cowboy totally out of place and surely someone told him about the happy ending too. And we also are forced to listen to his singing! 4 The movie is too long and with plenty of hard to believe sequences. 5 Most of all the final shooting that is really incredible and impossible. Wayne Martin and Nelson engage in a shooting contest hitting small dynamite bars not only when static on the floor but moving rapidly through the air far from them. Wayne does it with a rifle difficult enough but Martin hits them with a six shooter without even aiming!! I can assure you also that dynamite bars don't blow off when hit by a bullet a spark is always needed. The whole sequence is absolutely ridiculous more proper of a spaghetti western and definitely sinks the film to the bottom.My 4 points rank for Rio Bravo comes out of acceptable setting and good performances by Angie Dickinson Walter Brennan and Dean Martin shortly after breaking his comedy partnership with Jerry Lewis. Fine music too. But that aside nothing at all to match the great westerns of the 50's we enjoyed through the decade High Noon Shane 310 to Yuma Gunfight at OK Corral The Gunfighter and so many others. In fact I think Hawks himself realized the movie was really poor and spoiled so he made El Dorado within a short period of time though almost a remake of Rio Bravo and not a top western either El Dorado has not the terrible flaws and ridiculous sequences we saw in Rio Bravo and is a far better movie.Don't you agree?".

And we also are forced to listen to his singing! 4 The movie is too long and with plenty of hard to believe sequences. 5 Most of all the final shooting that is really incredible and impossible. Wayne Martin and Nelson engage in a shooting contest hitting small dynamite bars not only when static on the floor but moving rapidly through the air far from them. Wayne does it with a rifle difficult enough but Martin hits them with a six shooter without even aiming!! I can assure you also that dynamite bars don't blow off when hit by a bullet a spark is always needed. The whole sequence is absolutely ridiculous more proper of a spaghetti western and definitely sinks the film to the bottom.My 4 points rank for Rio Bravo comes out of acceptable setting and good performances by Angie Dickinson Walter Brennan and Dean Martin shortly after breaking his comedy partnership with Jerry Lewis. Fine music too. But that aside nothing at all to match the great westerns of the 50's we enjoyed through the decade High Noon Shane 310 to Yuma Gunfight at OK Corral The Gunfighter and so many others. In fact I think Hawks himself realized the movie was really poor and spoiled so he made El Dorado within a short period of time though almost a remake of Rio Bravo and not a top western either El Dorado has not the terrible flaws and ridiculous sequences we saw in Rio Bravo and is a far better movie.Don't you agree?";

Director Hawks was a master of the obvious. His films rarely have any surprises and this is no exception. You know as soon as you see Directed by Howard Hawks during the credits that every good guy will survive the story. You know John Wayne's character is in about as much danger of not making it as say James Bond in a 007 flick.Because of the lack of surprises the story lacks any punch and is just another tepid bit of fluffy entertainment from the Howard Hawks mold...and he sure did like that mold. It's hard to keep this Western separate in my mind from El Dorado and Rio Lobo as they all follow the same formulaic character ensemble story. Heck it's hard to separate this in my mind from Hatari.A couple of Dont's and Dos DON'T expect anything subtle or nuanced nice cinematography indepth character development or absorbing storyline. DO expect hammy overthetop wooden acting a complete lack of clever dialog obvious plot lines typical stage lighting and studio back lot sets.It's occurs to me that Rio Bravo is to Westerns what It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World is to comedies and if that kind of broad and obvious treatment is your cup of sarsaparilla then you will no doubt savor this one.".

	schema:reviewBody "This film is perfection.I hesitate in calling it the greatest western of all time as so many defining elements of the genre are lacking for one thing all the action takes place within city limits  so much for horse riding across western landscapes. More importantly it transcends genre barriers and stands in a world of its own. A world of pure and simple correspondence between ends and means of the filmmaking process that is of classic perfection.As many have noted the starting point is simple a sheriff needs to keep an outlaw in custody other outlaws try to spring him. The ease and grace with which Hawks creates a twohour long narrative from this both elaborate and always radiantly clear at the same time fastpaced and seemingly immobile would be overwhelming if the result were not of such classic evidence.This he does by perfectly balancing the characters whose common point is the need for redemption or fulfillment whether they are too old Stumpy too weak Dude too young Colorado or even too desirable Feathers. Sheriff Chance is both unwilling to relate to them and unable to do without them  thus conferring a constant ambiguity to his behavior balancing between pardon and anger an ambiguity instantly redeemed by the righteousness and the physical grace with which he moves among them  Sorry don't get it done Dude must be my favorite quote from any movie.The same balance can be found between the few action scenes and the more gentle episodes. The action is scarce but then all the more intense as it comes both inevitably and at unexpected moments. It is climactic and beautifully shot and choreographed. There are few gunshots excepting the ending but always to the point if not always on target. To illustrate this let us examine the episode in which Dude shoots an outlaw he and Chance are pursuing. He is unsure of whether he has hit him this uncertainty is at once transmitted to his whole character and to a characteristically sceptical as well as sympathetic Chance. In this sense not a shot is wasted as they define so powerfully the essence of characters and relations between them. The same could be said of young Colorado's ascension materialized through his gun fighting ability. This is a classic feature of westerns brought to unseen heights by Hawks.These action scenes contrast beautifully with three other kind of scenes the romantic seduction scenes in which Angie Dickinson shines the comedy scenes taking place in the hotel and the alternately anguishing and joyful scenes in the prison  culminating as a reviewer has noted in the songs shared by Dude Stumpy Colorado and an appreciative and silent Chance a blissful moment in which time the plot the suspense are cast aside and all is left is an exceptional complicity between the characters the director and the spectator.Many defects can be found here and there yet as a whole the movie is perfect as it creates with seemingly effortless grace a world  complete with strong and weak characters a sense of time and space right and wrong necessity and chance not a meaningless name for Wayne's character  we at once recognize and love as our own.".

This is only my third John Wayne film which I'm surprised by because I feel like I'm more familiar with him. The other two are The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance which I really like and The Searchers which is good but has its flaws. Its charms comes from its colourful and warm network of great characters. It has a lot of heart and I come to care from them all greatly and genuinely wish them no harm during inevitable danger. In particular the tragic and heartbreakingormaking Dean Martin who's a pleasure to watch in every single scene he's in especially in one in which he sings with Ricky Nelson.The witty script has a great dry sense of humour with every joke hitting the mark and making it an even more relaxed affair than it already is. There isn't much urgency in the plot with a simple story stretching for 2 hours and 15 minutes but it never feels too slow or rushed despite this jarring with the everpresent possibility of death. It effortlessly weaves the compelling character drama within the narrative and it's a genuine pleasure to watch. The great cinematography and sets are the best preSergio Leone era I've seen in a Western with a fantastic sepia colour theme but not completely saturated. Rio Bravo is pure cinematic bliss. A very pleasant and welcome surprise. As a sidenote this is the third new favourite from 1959 I've seen so far this year. Good year.910".

The macho plot is simple but wholly effective as our heavily out numbered heroes John Wayne Dean Martin Walter Brennan  Ricky Nelson defend a jail house against a marauding mob trying to release an incarcerated friend. This alone sounds grand but the truth is it takes the film nigh on close to 100 minutes to get to the adrenalin rush of the siege and even allowing for fine character development the film is ponderous and even at times dangerously close to being self indulgent.The casting of Ricky Nelson was as is widely regarded now one of the worst of its kind in the history of cinema he was there purely as a marketing ploy to garner the teen audience who were bopping to his pop tunes way back then. In fairness to Hawks he saw straight away that this was out of Nelson's league and promptly and cutely gave him few lines of note to speak of. Also a big negative in the film is Angie Dickinson as the Female interest she is raw and fresh out of water and it shows just like sushi on your plate.The bonuses with the film however keep the film talked about for ever more Wayne is magnetic and believable whilst Martin comes into his own as the drunk trying to do right a superlative performance from him and one would think that is really down to Hawks' direction. The action sequences are of a high standard while the tight intimate feel of the town is precious and who can resist an ending that makes you want to go fire yer guns in the air?Very good film but not a Western masterpiece by a long shot. 710".

Contrary to some of the negative reviews here he's not just playing John Wayne. But he always was an underappreciated actor especially among certain types. As for his love interest Angie Dickinson despite the age difference he has great chemistry with her. Dino has probably his best acting role here. Walter Brennan is always fun. The most surprising part of the cast is Ricky Nelson and how good he was alongside these more experienced actors. The cast works well together and there's a real sense that these people like each other that comes through in their performances making it all the more believable.The plot is deceptively simple but it just goes to show that stories don't have to be complex to be interesting. It's a great character western slow but wellpaced. Howard Hawks shows why he is one of the alltime greats with how well he handles these characters and their actors the flaws and strengths of each and tells a simple but powerful story. The Furthman and Brackett script is great. I read some of the negative reviews here and all I can say is that I feel sorry for those people. Most of them seem to either have an ax to grind with Wayne and Hawks or they just don't like westerns to begin with. The good reputation of this film has lasted decades. It's inspired directors from John Carpenter to Quentin Tarantino. It's a genuine classic. On my top ten westerns list for sure.".

However with almost a week until the US Marshals arrive in the town Chance is forced to try and hold out against the constant but subtle pressure. Unwillingly he enlists help from the most unlikeliest of places  a drunk an old man an unwilling boy and a woman who seems to have fallen for his western charms.In the top 100 lists of many critics you'll find this western.  I know that there must be some link to the politics of High Noon as this appears to be too similar in theme to that film to have no connection.  However I'm not sure of the politics behind it and to be honest didn't give it a great deal of thought while I was watching it.  The plot is the same for the whole film the stand off starts 5 minutes in and doesn't stop until the end.  The pressure is not constant and the film could be seen as lacking in action as it mostly is a silent stand off.  However I liked the way this worked as it created a tension that was well serviced throughout.The film feels sow the odd time but it actually goes quite quickly.  The script is witty and clever and every scene keeps the interest quite easily. Even the traditionally weakest strand to the film the romantic sub plot is used well and adds a little fizz to the film mainly thanks to a really feisty and sexy performance from Dickinson desperately trying to get John T's attention in any way she can.  The action is pretty good although sparse but the film is better when the action is threatened rather than executed.Wayne is easy in this film and he carries himself very well with charm and witty touches to his performance.  Martin steals the acting award by doing something other than mugging which he does do too often in other films. His character is believable without being too serious and he carries some scenes himself.  As I have said Dickinson was excellent and pitch perfect while the support cast in all their guises do well despite the stereotypical evil land owner'  in fairness the stereotype was born in these films not enforced in them.Overall this may feel a little slow but it is a very enjoyable western.  The script is sparky and amusing while the use of dark streets and interiors help build the tension over the whole film.  Good performances and likeable characters also help and make for a western that is well rounded and enjoyable.".

	schema:reviewBody "All the glare of the publicity that has been generated for this movie because of some sex scene between Beren Saat and Murat Unalmis has been apparently not enough to make it a hit movie. The Turkish movie industry has been trying to treat the 82 coup d'etat over the past few years. Unfortunately the socalled movie moguls either made a mess of the subject by treating it in a melodramatic ideological fashion as in Son CellatThe Last Hangman or they just used it as a minor subtext to accentuate a love story or to underscore a story of filial love as in My Father and My Son.Tant pis this one is no different than that. The movie starts with a flashback  Gece a kid of 56 year oldBeren Saat witnesses the death of her parents during a police raid in the aftermath of 82 coup. After the flashback we see Gece as a member of a leftwing gang. She gets chosen as a suicidebomber. She is not an angstridden teenager but she seems to have learned to live with sorrows and she wants to take a revenge for her parents. Beren Saat puts in a convincing performance as the greenhorn suicide bomber but she looks too young to be someone thirty given the fact that the events set in a year of late 2000s. This is a major goof which is insulting even to general cinemagoers.While Gece is on the wait for the attack day she stays at a flat where the organization arranges for her.Gradually she starts to have feelings for Yusuf Murat nalmisthe son of the concierge. Though she knows that the relationship can have no future she still can't keep herself away from him. While the movie questions the act of vengeance and implies the notion that ideologies somehowsomeday die but love prevails it does not really question the ideology. By juxtaposing the 80's revolutionary militants who lost their lives for their ideology and today's revolutionary militants who try to grapple with the modern day capitalism the movie does not really achieve its purpose.In the first halfit sounds like it's so partisan that it glorifies the actions of leftwing militants but in the second half it sounds like it's so simple and naive that in today's world leftwing gangs fight for no noble purpose.It's more like saying Give up on this stuff.Go homemake love! As a cinema viewer I am not sure where the movie stands and which half we should take credit for.Stillwe should not be surprised by the fact the movie does not exactly focus on one thing because the screen play writer of this movie Mahsun Krmzgl always does this. An example? Think about Gnesi Grdm I saw the Sun. While we were thinking we would see a harrowing movie about lives broken asunder by the ethnic PKK terror we saw an unnecessarystopgap transsexual subtext which could have been the subject of a different movie. We don't know how the director went along with all this but The Wings of The Night is just a damp squibanother resounding flop about one of our notorious coup d'etats.".

	schema:reviewBody "Jr NTR lives up to the expectations in everything. He brought many laughs in theaters with his Brahmin character and hilarious characterization. Narasimha part is quite routine. The movie totally belongs to Jr.NTR. His screen presence voice modulation and dances are a treat to watch on big screen. The intense gaze coupled with some quirky punch dialogues in the early parts of the film give a distinct tone to Narasimha's role. On the other hand Jr.NTR is chirpy talkative slapstick and innocent characterization as Narasimha Chari will definitely bring a smile on to your face. His dances took away the breath of audiences. Especially his steps in 'pilla na valla kaadu' received oncemores in theaters. Nayantara is slim and sleek while Sheela looted young hearts with glowing skin and sensuous garments. Nothing more is left for heroines than this to discuss.Brahmanandam is awesome as Bhattu. He is one of the pillar to the movie. Even if you see many number of times you can't stop laughing .Finally Single line is  Watch it for NTR's dances and his hilarious Brahminic performance and it's definitely watchable movie .".

	onyx:emotionText "Jr NTR lives up to the expectations in everything. He brought many laughs in theaters with his Brahmin character and hilarious characterization. Narasimha part is quite routine. The movie totally belongs to Jr.NTR. His screen presence voice modulation and dances are a treat to watch on big screen. The intense gaze coupled with some quirky punch dialogues in the early parts of the film give a distinct tone to Narasimha's role. On the other hand Jr.NTR is chirpy talkative slapstick and innocent characterization as Narasimha Chari will definitely bring a smile on to your face. His dances took away the breath of audiences. Especially his steps in 'pilla na valla kaadu' received oncemores in theaters. Nayantara is slim and sleek while Sheela looted young hearts with glowing skin and sensuous garments. Nothing more is left for heroines than this to discuss.Brahmanandam is awesome as Bhattu. He is one of the pillar to the movie. Even if you see many number of times you can't stop laughing .Finally Single line is  Watch it for NTR's dances and his hilarious Brahminic performance and it's definitely watchable movie .";

	schema:reviewBody "I saw Bunny Lake Is Missing for the second time last night at San Francisco's Castro Theatre. The first time was also at the Castro twelve years ago during an Otto Preminger festival. Preminger made a number of better films  Laura and Anatomy of a Murder come to mind  but I have a special fondness for Bunny Lake even though at times it drags and is overly talky.Among the merits of casting Carol Lynley and Keir Dullea it can be successfully argued that they look like siblings  often not the case in films  which works very well for this film as does their ethereal outofbody quality. Criticism has been made that the role of Ann Lake was written one dimensionally and therefore offered Lynley little to do but weep and whine but this may have been Preminger's intention to support that part of the plot that suggests Ann may not have a daughter and that Ann herself may be more than a bit unbalanced.Dullea is an unusual looking actor who can photograph good looking or simply strange. Preminger used this well early in the film although he seemed to lose subtlety as the narrative headed towards its denouement.The film's superior blackandwhite widescreen photography is one of its strengths. London locations and interiors are effective and impressive. I especially liked the doll hospital cellar sequence with Lynley holding an oil lamp as she moves about the high angle shot of the backyard the begins the final sequence and several sequences when characters pass quickly from one room to another.The sexual subtext is not as hidden as it would have been in the 50s but subtler say than after 1970 its ambiguity adds to the film's texture without getting in the way. In fact 1965 seems a perfect time for this film to have appeared since the cinematic fulcrum was still well placed to balance a filmmaker from older Hollywood who also enjoyed pushing the envelope. A little bit later color photography would have been mandatory and the characterizations would have moved into a much more bizarre psychedelic arena.Perhaps because of how its strengths and weaknesses combine the film has a seductive haunting integrity for me. As the film began with the Saul Bass titles and Paul Glass's score I felt a pleasurable sensation of awe which I used to feel more often when seeing a movie and which reoccurred a number of times in Bunny Lake.Try to see this film on a large theater screen to experience the full power of the blackandwhite widescreen cinematography. Otherwise view the letterbox DVD on a screen large enough to allow you to see details. There is much to enjoy in Bunny Lake Is Missing so don't miss out.".

	schema:reviewBody "The vast range of responses to and assessments of this movie here are a tribute to what an odd film this is in many ways.  And it's difficult to comment on some of its oddest features chiefly the performances of Dullea and Lynley without giving away aspects of the plot that it's best you don't know when seeing the movie.   I guess it's safe to say that  I found both of these performances underwhelming but adequate.   To be fair both of them come off better by the end of the film than they do in its first third.  Your take on Lynley's character will definitely evolve as the film progresses which must in some degree be to her credit.But by far the most compelling reason to see the film is Olivier's rich and understated performance from the period postArchie Rice but preOthello.  It takes a while for his character to appear but once he arrives he is unquestionably the center of the film at the true heart of what's good about it.   The last 20 minutes of the film maligned elsewhere in these IMDB comments would probably have benefited greatly from a little more of his presence.His every moment onscreen is fascinating and worthwhile and the script gives him some fine moments of verbal eccentricity which he delivers with variety and brilliance  we leave this film wanting to know even more about his character because he just seems so interesting beneath the surface.Also a plus is that occupying nearly every small part in this film is a truly fine British character actor with the old dotty schoolmistress Miss Ford Anna Massey I believe a standout.  But everyone from the various employees of the little girl's school to Olivier's sidekick to the fellow manning the shipping counter are fabulously wellplayed.   And then of course there's Noel Coward....who gives a truly perverse performance in what amounts to only three scenes.The combination of black  white photography and widescreen while not all that uncommon  would soon be all but extinct by the time this film was made at least until our more recent era when it's made a conspicuous comeback but it makes for a very effective look and feel to the movie often dark and noirish with somes an almost documentarylike grittiness but always very wellcomposed and a large part of the film's success.  On television it's nearly impossible to see it in widescreen and in fact the TV print isn't even panandscan  it's just stationary and incomplete so over and over again we hear people talking whom we KNOW are on camera but they're invisible to us. No attempt was made in the TV transfer to even bother to scan.  It's definitely true that the film is less effective without the widescreen component but it's still watchable because you can clearly tell what you're NOT seeing if that makes any sense at all!One final note I originally tracked this film down over a decade ago because of the interesting score by composer Paul Glass totally unknown to me except for this film.  Way back when the soundtrack on vinyl for this film was kind of rare and I had a copy and really loved the music.  In the context of the film the score alternates oddly between working quite well and being inappropriate or irritating.   Sometimes during the scene in the doll hospital for example you can understand what the logic was behind the musical choice but it's intrusive and simply not working.  The score also adopts the unfortunate injoke of having some variant of the main title melody which is quite lovely and fitting for the film featuring recorder strings woodwinds and what seems to be a soprano sax to good effect to create the child's world motive to open the first 15 minutes of the film ALWAYS be present as source music.  For example when we see Noel Coward in his apartment a radio  or phonograph is playing some kind of muzak version of the theme.  There's another scene in a bar where the main title theme is playing jazzily.  This sort of thing rarely works and it's particularly egregious in this film.  John Williams once lampooned the practice in his score for THE LONG GOODBYE.  But a few blunders aside Glass manages to do a great job balancing the really expressive simplicity of his rather pastoral tune with some really fine dissonant percussive atonal cues.   The score sounds like nobody else in particular yet is very distinctive which I mean as a compliment to the mysterious Mr. Glass.All in all an interesting enough effort with a really wellwritten screenplay.  One can imagine it looked great on paper when it was offered to Olivier though perhaps the film turned out a little less successfully  than might have been hoped for.  But it's definitely worth seeing.".

But a few blunders aside Glass manages to do a great job balancing the really expressive simplicity of his rather pastoral tune with some really fine dissonant percussive atonal cues.   The score sounds like nobody else in particular yet is very distinctive which I mean as a compliment to the mysterious Mr. Glass.All in all an interesting enough effort with a really wellwritten screenplay.  One can imagine it looked great on paper when it was offered to Olivier though perhaps the film turned out a little less successfully  than might have been hoped for.  But it's definitely worth seeing.";

Lynley a newcomer to London England takes her four yearold daughter to nursery school and in a hurry to meet movers at her new flat briefly leaves the child in the custody of a rather unfriendly cook.  Later the cook has quit and the child is gone. Worse no one seems to have ever known about the child or has ever even seen her except Lynley and Dullea.  No tangible trace of the child seems to exist!  Olivier is brought in to head up the investigation and scours all the various clues and suspects all while trying to determine if there even IS a child to be searching for.  The film kicks off with famously innovative Saul Bass titles and sets its contrived but fascinating story in motion with skill.  Lynley manages to come off rather well in a difficult role. Dullea is also strong in a part that never gets completely fleshed out. Olivier is reliably commanding and slick and offers a lesson in understated excellence.  These performers are surrounded by a lustrous galaxy of terrific British character actors.  Most notable is the delicious Hunt as the vaguely sinister yet delightful headmistress of the school.  Massey is also excellent as a frustrated teacher.  Coward pops up as a creepy landlord with designs on Lynley.  It is not easy to watch the somewhat disintegrated legend put the moves on her.  Many other great people show up and even if they don't get a moment of glory their participation adds greatly to the class and feel of the film.  A sense of dread and uncertainty hangs over the movie as the viewer is never exactly sure what is going on.  As stylish and intriguing as the film is certain sections drag on a bit too long none more so than the climax in which Lynley must fend off the villain of the piece and seems to go out of her way NOT to escape or harm the person at times.  Even with this and other gripes like a needless annoying and intrusive appearance from The Zombies the film is well worth watching and deserves a better availability and reputation than it currently accords.".

Can't wait to see it Witherspoon was really good in a movie with Keifer Sutherland where she plays a teen runaway.So as a result of the remake the original is due out on DVD! So technology really does lead to better living. BLIM is a very wellmade scary movie. Don't watch it alone unless you are not easily made well uneasy. Not a slasher type movie or a 'watch out it's going to get you ' scariness but a psychological thriller.Like other movies from the 1960's set in Europe Bunny Lake is austere and stark the characters have an emotionally remote manner as if in a trance. Other examples are Alfie Blowup Georgy Girl and the horrifying Repulsion the last of which if you are going to try to watch at all you should not do alone and you should be warned that it's no picnic watching even Catherine Deneuve come totally unglued while no one seems to suspect a thing. The various settings in the movie that should be quaint innocuous or at worst drab but end up being terrifying in their shadowy oddness. A children's day care center an apartment a hospital and a 'doll hospital'. Maybe the discordant soundtrack of various whistley pan pipe y sounds is a big reason for the desolate mood of the film. You just fall in love with beatific Carol Lynley she is adorable in this and very brave after all if we are having to watch this nightmare her character is actually living it.Supporting cast boasts kindly detective Sir Larry Olivier leering neighbor Noel Coward and highhanded brother Keir Dullea.If you enjoy this one you may also enjoy 'The Shuttered Room' another scary flick from 1960s Britain with Miss Lynley being threatened by dastardly Oliver Reed as an evil country lout.

I first saw this on TV back in the early 70's and then again in a 16mm panandscan print  and enjoyed it.  But it wasn't until I saw it in a 35mm widescreen print that I could appreciate Preminger's expert use of the widescreen space which gave Bunny Lake added dimension.Bunny Lake isn't a great thriller but it's a good one.  The story itself doesn't rise above a certain amount of contrivance but the performances are mostly solid enough to keep you glued to the screen until the suspenseful climax.  Best are Olivier beautifully restrained as the chief inspector Lynley as the frantic heroine and Martita Hunt as the eccentric owner of the school where Bunny first goes missing.  As Lynley's brother whose feelings for his sister are almost incestuous Kier Dullea does well walking a tightrope between normal brotherly concern and something darker but occasionally overdoes his role.Unfortunately Preminger can't help but indulge his desire to titillate and shock with the character played by Noel Coward.  Watching the playwrightactor caress his face with a leather whip handle a scene not in the original novel I believe is a piece of vulgarity that will produce more adolescent giggles than gasps.".

It stars Laurence Olivier Carol Lynley Keir Dullea Martita Hunt  Noel Coward. Music is by Paul Glass and cinematography by Denys N. Coop. 1960s Brit Pop combo The Zombies also feature in the film.Ann Lake Lynley turns up at her daughter's school to collect her after her first day there but nobody has any recollection of ever having seen the four year old...It was a film that irked Otto Preminger he was never happy with the finished product this even after changing the ending from the one in the novel and relocating the story from New York to London. Yet time has been very kind to the film after reevaluations from auteurist critics the film has found a sturdy fanbase giving it cult classic status and a reputation as a sleeper classic of its type. You feel that with its thematic links to Hitchcock's Psycho Preminger wanted to make a film worthy of being in the same league as Hitch's classic. Certainly the marketing for the film lends one to think the makers wanted to be compared with it that it of course isn't on a par with Psycho is a given otherwise it would be more well known. But it's a damn fine picture stitched together impeccably by Preminger film holds attention and intrigue from Saul Bass' nifty opening credit sequence right to the eerie denouement.Here we go round the mulberry bush The mulberry bush The mulberry bush. Here we go round the mulberry bush on a cold and frosty morning.With real London locations used and Coop's pin sharp black and white shadowy photography tight to the unsettling mood story carries an air of psychological discord about it. The mystery element is strong and this coupled with the edgy near unhealthy relationship between Ann and her brother Stephen Dullea makes for a shifting in your seat experience. Then there's the small matter of Noel Coward as Horatio Wilson creepy landlord extraordinaire he may not be in it for much but the impression made creeps the flesh. Slotted into the tight narrative are scenes that the likes of Hitchcock Welles and Kubrick would be proud of where Preminger calls on his film noir know how to feverishly glide around a doll shop and track his actors as they cavort around a children's garden play area. All topped off by the supreme performance of Olivier as analytical Superintendent Newhouse a man calm and versed in psychology he is the perfect contrast to the hysteria and borderline mania that surrounds him. Is it Hitchcockian? As some critics have called it? Well yes it is but not overtly so it has closer links in tone and narrative thrust to under seen British thrillers like Don't Talk to Strange Men 1962 and Taste of Fear 1961. Is it flawless? No! Dullea is way too animated some character reactions to situations are eyebrowraising and Paul Glass' score is at times maddeningly wrong for the mood sequence it accompanies. But they are problems easily forgivably when taking the film as a whole. 8.510".

As mentioned by a previous reviewer there is considerable demand for a DVDVHS release preferably letterboxed the opening credits are well worth it.

Mostly he pumped out overwrought epics like Exodus bloated biopics like Saint Joan slick trash like River of No Return and Hurry Sundown remember THAT mess? and let's not forget 1963 when he crammed all his skills into one overwrought bloated slick trashy epic The Cardinal which reveals less about the Roman Catholic church than The Sound of Music does about the Anschluss.Bunny shows early flickers of promise eccentric Brits missing kid anticipation of Olivier Noel Coward and the Zombies but it quickly bogs down and so badly that even the climax is boring.There are a few good scenes creepy moments as when brother Dullea takes a bath while sister Lynley is perched on the edge of the tub. But when the climax finally comes the only real surprise is how surprisingly silly it is. After having spent the entire movie as quite a shrewd fellow Keir Dullea abruptly regresses into a wildeyed kidnapper in halted adolescence a transmogrification that happens in one illlit scene which builds into a sequence that drags on and on and on even worse than this sentence. While we wait for the predictable Olivier ex machina and his Scotland Yard cops Lynley frantically distracts her nutty regressed brother with children's games so he won't harm her missing daughter.Oh yes Bunny is real. She's been napping peacefully in the maniac's car trunk all day this movie is stupider than anything by M. Night Shyamalan I promise you and when she's lifted free she doesn't so much as shed a tear let alone a traumatic scream. I'd have forgiven her if she'd come at the adults with a tire iron. But no. Unflappable urchin that she is she doesn't even ask Why did you lock me in the trunk Uncle Steve? Fouryearolds can talk I've heard them. Not this one. She's pure prop.The combined forces of silksmooth Olivier and scenerychewing Noel Coward could not save this celluloid debacle. The only reason to see it is to help correct the lingering impression that Otto Preminger was a competent filmmaker. I normally reserve low scores 1 2 for badly made AND badly conceived films but this one is a bottomdweller on the sheer force of its stupidity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Do you know what this is? asks the cook at the Little People's Garden School as she ladles a white liquid into bowl after bowl. Why it looks like junket says Ann Lake who arrived minutes before to deliver her little girl Bunny to the nursery school. It not only looks like junket it is junket...junket is junket. And no matter what you do with it it still tastes like swill and swallows like slime. This exchange is one of the many pleasures of Otto Preminger's Bunny Lake Is Missing...a movie made up of a collection of eccentric and creepy performances dialogue by John and Penelope Mortimer which is unexpectedly witty an atmosphere of foreboding and dread photography that keeps us in the mood for the worst to happen and a steady performance at the heart of the film by Lawrence Olivier as Superintendent Newhouse Ann Lake Carol Lynley has arrived in London to join her older brother Stephen Keir Dullea. She takes her little girl to the Little People's Garden School but when she returns for her in the afternoon there is no trace that Bunny was ever there. In the course of the next several hours Ann will become both distraught and determined. Her brother will forcefully try to help her. Superintendent Newhouse will need to seriously consider whether or not there ever was a Bunny Lake...and except for the last twenty minutes or so we'll have a fine time. The unfortunate aspect of the movie is that it falls apart at the end and that two of the three main players aren't quite up to the demands of their characters. Both Lynley and Dullea give it all they've got. Lynley in particular comes close. Dullea on the other hand also tries but he has finely wrought weirdo written all over his face. Still one man's weirdo is another man's psychiatrist. Without Olivier providing a subtle and compelling performance as a middleaged copper who is shrewd indirect amusing at times and prepared to be skeptical we'd be left with only a shell of a psychosuspense thriller. Olivier grounds the movie. You must think I'm a terrible mother leaving her that way Lynley says to Olivier. No Mrs. Lake he replies I don't know anything about you yet. Unfortunately when at last the film shows us what's going on we've long guessed the situation. At that point the air goes out of the balloon and we're left with a murderous psychiatric breakdown which is almost embarrassing in being so over the top. But in the meantime the pleasures of Bunny Lake Is Missing are worth savoring starting with the remarkable group of supporting players Preminger gathered. Noel Coward plays Horatio Wilson Lynley's landlord who shows up at unexpected times looking like a poorly preserved ancient turtle. Wilson is a leering amusing alcoholic tottering old degenerate who favors heavy sweaters and loves his Chihuahua. He recites on the BBC. Coward's enunciation of Hello...we've come back...from wettest...Worcestershire is a delight. His selfamused attempt to interest two policemen in his collection of whips has to rank among the movies' great cameo performances. You ever hear him recite poetry? Olivier asks Lynley. It's like a Welsh parson gargling in molasses. Martita Hunt so wonderful as Miss Havisham in Great Expectations plays with equal and wonderful skill Miss Ada Ford the longretired cofounder of the Little People's Garden School. She lives in private quarters above the school spending her time at her desk making notes and listening to the recordings she made of children describing their nightmares. She's an odd bird but observant. The scenes Hunt shares with Olivier are highlights of the movie. Finlay Currie is an aged doll maker who calls the dolls his children. When he fixes them from his wheelchair his assistant places them in the recovery room downstairs where a lamp is needed to see anything. Anna Massey a terrific actor is Elvira Smollett who runs the school and is at various times defensive condescending harried tearful and irritated. The first twothirds of Bunny Lake Is Missing is so good that it's worth watching and rewatching despite the last third. A movie as witty and foreboding as this  Superintendent Newhouse turns out to be a great fan of junket  needs to be enjoyed for all the odd pleasures it offers.".

	schema:reviewBody "Saul Bass' opening credits and Paul Glass' jazzy score set the tone for this psychological thriller about the disappearance of a little girl and the police investigation that follows. The atmosphere is dark unsettling and tense and is beautifully enhanced by Denys N Coop's magnificent cinematography. There's something undeniably perverse about the behaviours of many of the story's characters and this not only complicates the investigation but also increases the number of potential suspects.After arriving in London from the United States single mother Ann Lake Carol Lynley takes her 4yearold daughter Bunny to be enrolled at a local nursery. With no staff members available to receive the new pupil Ann enters the kitchen and informs the grumpy German cook that she's leaving the child in the building's First Day Room and rushes off to meet the removal men who are waiting to move her possessions into the apartment that she's due to share with her journalist brother Steven Keir Dullea. Later that day when she goes back to the Little People's Garden School she's horrified to discover that Bunny has disappeared and none of the staff seem very helpful or indeed willing to take any responsibility. Ann turns to Steven for help and after he carries out a search of the building they decide to call the police.Scotland Yard Detective Superintendent Newhouse Laurence Olivier is assigned to the case and discovers that noone at the nursery remembers seeing the little girl and the cook has quit her job. Furthermorewhen one of his detectives goes with Steven to his apartment to get a photograph of the missing girl they find that all Bunny's belongings have mysteriously disappeared. This leads Newhouse to question whether Bunny actually exists and when he's informed that as a child Ann had an imaginary playmate also called Bunny he starts to have doubts about Ann's mental state.Ann feels frustrated about not being able to prove that Bunny exists until she remembers that she has a receipt for one of the girl's dolls which she'd taken to a nearby shop for repair. When she succeeds in collecting the doll things suddenly become more sinister in a way that shocks her but eventually enables the mystery surrounding Bunny's disappearance to be solved.The eccentricities of the characters in this movie provide a great deal of interest for its audience as well as providing the actors with some colourful roles that they're able to exploit to the full. Ada Ford Marita Hunt is the retired cofounder of the nursery who lives seemingly as a recluse in an attic room where she spends her time researching and writing about her rather unhealthy interest in children's nightmares. Ann's creepy landlord Horatio Wilson Noel Coward is an alcoholic masochist and radio broadcaster who despite being gay still hits on her and tries to impress her with his melodious voice. Superintendent Newhouse is thoughtful reserved and methodical in his work and also recognises that Ann and Steven's relationship seems more like that of a married couple rather than that of a typical brother and sister. The acting performances are all of the highest calibre and enormously enjoyable to watch.Bunny Lake Is Missing didn't receive the critical or commercial success it deserved at the time of its initial release but has achieved greater recognition since. It certainly does well at evoking the period in which it's set and in this connection the three songs contributed by The Zombies are both important and great to hear again.".

The detective in charge Supt.

Bunny Lake is Missing is very offbeat and will make you uneasy as you along with Newhouse try to figure out what's going on. The acting is very good  Olivier obviously did this role for money  there is nothing particularly interesting about it though he does a good job. The pretty Lynley gives an ambiguous performance  she's either a grieving mother a nut or both and Dullea is equally ambiguous  does he know more than he says he does? Is he placating his sister? Noel Coward has a showy if small role as the Lake's landlord a rather strange bird into SM who proudly shows one of the detectives the skull of the Marquis de Sade.Though not entirely satisfying this is a great movie to see on a Sunday afternoon. It takes you right into the darkness of London and leaves you there as it travels through a child's strange world and comes out in illusion? Reality? Or madness?".

Her mom Ann Carol Lynley and uncle Stephen Keir Dullea both having recently arrived in London England from America become concerned and enlist the help of Supt. Newhouse Laurence Olivier.The film's underlying premise is intriguing. But the screen story is full of plot holes. More than one character behaves in ways that are not believable given the circumstances. It's the kind of psychological thriller that Hitchcock could have made successfully. But this film lacks a convincing script and lacks Hitchcock's convincing directorial touch. The setup here is too long and drawn out and so too is the final Act.By far the most interesting character in this character driven story is Ada Ford Martita Hunt an elderly lady vaguely sinister with an intimidating gaze and deep voice. I wish Hitchcock could have found a place for her in some of his films. Noel Coward also gives an interesting if peripheral performance as an inebriated landlord.The BW cinematography is competent it's slightly noir with stark contrasts in lighting. This works especially well in the upstairs lair of Ada Ford. Some of the film's dialogue seems dubbed as if it had been reworked in postproduction editing. I did not care for the film's score. The flute and strings arrangement creates a nondescript and too casual tone which dilutes the suspense. The television in the pub is irritatingly intrusive especially with The Zombies song Just Out Of Reach.Bunny Lake Is Missing is not a bad film. It will keep viewers guessing as to the story outcome. It's just that the film could have been so much more. As is it's worth a one time viewing especially for those interested in psychological puzzles.".

	schema:reviewBody "I recently saw this at the 2008 Palm Springs Film Noir Festival. Not exactly from the time period after the war to the late 50's associated with Film Noir it does have a Film Noir feel and look to it. This film was based on the 1957 novel by Marryam Morell about a single mother in New York's Upper East Side whose young daughter disappears from her school and the existence of the girl and sanity of the mother is brought into question. In the screenplay by John and Penelope Mortimer the setting is London in the mid 1960's and a new central character is added that changes the story and adds a different plot twist to this psychological thriller. Noted director Otto Preminger directs Carol Lynley as Ann Lake and Keir Dullea as her brother Stephen who have recently moved to London from the United States. Laurence Oliver is the wise and seasoned police superintendent Newhouse and Noel Coward is the seedy and lecherous Shakespearean stage star turned landlord. Lynley plays it fairly cold and lacking in the proper hysterical emotions for a mother whose daughter has disappeared so one doesn't know for sure if the daughter is real or in her imagination. Dullea is as creepy as Norman Bates as the straightlaced button down concerned brother with strong hints of an unnatural relationship between the brother and sister. Olivier is as smooth as silk as the inspector in charge of the case. Noel Coward is deliriously over the top in his performance and brief screen time as the landlord. The 60's British Invasion rock group the Zombies culled from an appearance on the BBC pop show Ready Steady Go get a lot of screen and soundtrack time in this and I never figured out how or why they are in this film. They did have a number one hit called She's Not There which could tongueincheek tie in to the film's theme but the song isn't in this film. The plot takes a a sudden and disturbing twist that seems a little farfetched but the film is interesting and Hitchcocklike but not one of Preminger's best. some great supporting roles from Martita Hunt as Ada Ford the eccentric old spinster who owns the school Anna Massey as Elvira Smollett as a school administrator and Finlay Currie as the elderly doll maker. Carol Lynley was on hand for the festival screening and did a QA for the audience following the film. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10 and recommend it.".

Consequently the mystery of this film is never whether Bunny exists but what the motive is behind her kidnapping. The film offers the AWOL cook at Bunny's new school and the sicko alcoholic landlord as reasonable suspects  except they seem to have no motive. Then there's Bunny's uncle Keir Dullea. Pretty quickly his involvement becomes clear. Now only a couple of questions remain How did he pull it off are the cook and the landlord accomplices? What was his motive? These are sufficient to maintain your interest through about the first hour.All suspicions are confirmed when Dullea sets fire to the doll in the repair shop. The succeeding scene enlightens the audience about his motive jealousy and the rest of the denouement is way overblown and overlong  and yet totally unexplained. The cops' coming to the rescue at the end is so predictable it is a clich.That Dullea a cunning scheming adult reverts on occasion to a child is totally inexplicable. We never learn HOW or WHEN or WHY this total personality metamorphosis occurs. That his sister and Bunny's mom Carol Lynley through childhood games IS ABLE TO CONTROL Dullea not only shows that she has been aware of his serious problems since childhood but it is the icing on this dumb cake. We learn WHAT motivates Dullea but WHAT motivates this dumb blonde????Once it becomes clear that Dullea is a wacko and that Lynley HAS BEEN AWARE of his lunacy all along we are left wondering why in the world she ever moved into his flat and why she hasn't seemed the least bit suspicious of her brother  much less expressed any suspicions to the police! We are left to wonder whether she enjoys the incestuous relationship with Dullea as much as he does with her  so much so in fact that either she is willing to shield him or she is blind to his possible involvement with Bunny's disappearance until the hospital scene. These loose ends are never wrapped up.Carol Lynley is always easy to look at and here her acting is credible enough in a onenote performance. Dullea is simply a onenote expressionless performer  robotic as one commentator notes. His character here is simply not believable  perfectly functioning articulate responsible journalist by day and 10year old by night! Nor is the character of Bunny credible. After being kidnapped and kept in the trunk of a car by her uncle she is all wideeyed innocence while playing children's games in the climactic scenes  never once seeming traumatized or desperate to get away from her wacko abductor! I am surprised at how divided opinions are over Olivier. In a role he might have performed in his sleep he seems like an efficient dispassionate police inspector  typically British. Noel Coward is terrific in an incredibly smarmy role that is pretty bloated for its purposes as a red herring. The eccentric school mistress in the attic is probably the best of the lot. Most of the other school personnel are mere functionaries. None of them seem overly concerned with Bunny's whereabouts but then again none of them ever laid eyes on her.I agree with the commentators who said that Preminger is very spotty. Most of his films are hugely disappointing  this one especially.".

Unfortunately the ending was complete and utter hogwash and made me wish I hadn't even bothered spending my time on this dopey film. It was as if the actors just winged it at the endand the payoff didn't make any sense! The film begins with Carol Lynley and her brother moving into a flat in London. It seems that Carol in particular is very busy and she drops her young daughter off at daycareand entrusts her to a cranky cook instead of the proper staff person. Later when Lynley returns for the child Bunny there is absolutely no trace of her and no one can recall having ever seen the kid. Oddly and this is a mistake due to poor writing the staff seemed rather rude and indifferent about all this. And when the police get involved she has a devil of a time trying to convince them that the child even existed in the first placeespecially since she and her brother Keir Dullea just arrived from America and know no one in the UK who can vouch for them. The longer the two of them try to convince the police that she exists the more the police assume they are two nutcases! At this point in the film the audience is also strongly suspecting that the child doesn't even exist. However when a few clues come out that indicate she might the viewer is no doubt puzzled and intrigued by the premiseI know I was! Unfortunately there was the uggh! ending. I'd say more about it but this would spoil it for someone who might actually want to see it. Suffice to say that the following problems are undeniable and I am surprised that a professional like Otto Preminger would make such a Swiss Cheeselike ending 1. Many many many times Lynley could have called for the police or gotten help from ANYONEbut didn't! 2. When Lynley found out the truth she did not call the police get help or kill the culprit. To call her efforts pathetic and minimal would be reasonable.3. Psychologically speaking the whole ending was a lot of mumbojumbo and was a muddled mess. It made no sense and could have if the writers hadn't been lemurs.4. The only way this ending would have worked would have been if the viewers were stoned or brain injured! So up until the ending I'd have given the film an 8 or 9especially since Laurence Olivier did a great job as the investigating officer. But the ending deserved a 48 and so I am charitably giving the film an overall score of 3.".

	schema:reviewBody "He's supposed to be the leading authority in freelance surveillance but from the start there are hints that while he's good he's also careless. While his apartment is locked his landlord leaves him a Happy Birthday present. His mistress Amy Teri Garr in a small role tells him she saw him standing in the staircase for an entire hour. He invites a rival coworker to his office which seems to be a warehouse with several other people and carelessly allows the man to record his own conversation by means of what looks to be an innocuous pen which wouldn't be out of place in any James Bond movie. And his liaison with a call girl he meets at that party results in her stealing the tapes of a conversation he has recorded and that has lately been the focus of his obsession.This is Harry Caul a loner who is a little too glum to be good company and takes his work seriously. Maybe too seriously  which eventually proves to be his downfall. The fact that his own coworker Stan John Cazale leaves him to go work for a rival agency Moran only serves to prove Harry is really someone who is so much a loner he drives anyone away from him. He can't seem to have any form of relationship  it's only time when Amy will also leave him as she seems somewhat frustrated by this wall of privacy he's built around himself. His entire life revolves around secrecy and he only is able to live vicariously throughout others even if he himself feels guilty about it and would deny it because to top it all he has a strong religious streak and discloses under confession that he was witness of a surveillance gone wrong and which resulted in the deaths of three people. Now this assignment has him worried he's listened to a conversation between a man and a woman and is afraid the woman's husband may try to kill them both.But is this what he's heard or has been misinterpreted due to the limitations and distortions of sound? Like 1966's BLOW UP which dealt with what the human eye is capable of discerning through the mechanism of a camera and what happens when one zooms in THE CONVERSATION deals with the manipulation of sound to make out a sentence that lies just underneath the sounds of the city. But while that elusive sentence comes through  he's kill us if he had the chance  what Harry fails to catch is the intonation itself which would have radically altered his deduction and completely shifted his attention. Like the definition of the word caul Harry is unable to see or hear the reality or that he's been a victim of his own occupation by the end of the film by making himself visible to whom he thinks was in danger he's now made himself the target of surveillance by the same agency who employed him as he receives that disturbing call at the end We'll be listening to you. Whether it be real or not one shot implies it is a panning shot to the right then to the left from an elevated angle showing us the destruction of Harry's apartment through his own hands as he has fruitlessly tries to debug his place. It's the telltale pan of a surveillance camera which he has failed to discover. Again.This is most definitely not an actionpacked thriller but one that is totally cerebral  it forces you to pay attention to listen to heighten your senses and discover for yourself what Harry is trying to find even when we know he will be wrong all along. Even as he seems to teeter over madness near the end as his grisly discovery of blood pouring out of a toilet bowl at the Jack Tarr Hotel indicates we still wonder if he's actually seeing this or not. Like BLOW UP this is one of those mysteries that doesn't look to get solved cleanly but by being inconclusive lingers in the mind long after the credits have rolled and in the process leaves one man destroyed.".

The suspense builds when Hackman is followed by Duvall's shady employee Harrison Ford and eventually the heat rises to a boil as all the very loose ends are tied together in a wickedly twisted final act. The Conversation was Coppola's other film from 1974 remember Best Picture Oscar winner The Godfather Part II?. With this movie Coppola created arguably the two best films of that dominant cinematic campaign of course Roman Polanski's Chinatown would have something to say about that. Hackman delivers a deceptively difficult and dark performance as a man who seems to be selfdestructing slowly on the inside out.

At its basic form however The Conversation is a film that carefully follows a man who is curiously trapped within his own secretive existence of solitude. Harry Caul is nothing more than an observer we do not witness any noticeable personal interests outside of his profession aside from his occasional musical performances. But notice how Harry is always playing along to another band contrast this to the solo at the ending and never performs for an audience. There is no audience for Harry a man who is entirely absorbed within his occupation and allows his neurotic obsession to control his personal relationships. Harry treats himself like he treats his clients he divulges no personal information displays no easily distinguishable characteristics and remains blissful in his peaceful state of ignorance. Whenever he is not entirely engulfed within his work Harry disappears into his apartment satisfied with his general indifference towards any truly beneficial active existence. Harry has thoroughly convinced himself that it is inappropriate to become involved in his client's affairs. After all Harry's job is not to take responsibility for himself or to investigate any potential consequences resulting from his surveillance intrusions. Harry's job is to take orders display no personal interest in the content of his recordings and deliver the results completely unconcerned for anyone's potential safety or security. It is only after Harry accepts his need to take responsibility that he is able to take interest in his client's mysterious dangerous affairs.As Harry slowly drags himself into the precarious business of strangers the film's intentions become increasingly suspenseful and perplexing. Coppola maintains his deliberately methodical pace throughout the entire film it is only through our imagination that we are capable of creating and perpetuating such a consistently fascinating atmosphere surrounded by a cloud of tension and mystique. The Assistant Director never physically carries himself as an intimidating antagonist it is through the complexity of the film's plot and through the continual uncertain environment that we are able to associate this element with his character. Every person that carries himself in a convincingly dubious manner immediately becomes a potential suspect. Harry becomes compulsively obsessed with the fate of his client's targets completely submerging himself into the substance of the recordings looking for any potential details that might assist him in solving the mystery. Harry's investigation quickly becomes our task as well as we begin to subconsciously observe and scrutinize each character involved. The beauty of Coppola's film is the fact that it makes its point by using the audience as proof of the inherent devious nature of privacy. The movie transports us into Harry's world as we become infatuated with the secretive plot unfolding before us and we desperately search for clues into the lives of the film's characters. Of course after intense investigation Harry ultimately comes to realize that he has violated all of the principles that he had once stood proudly for. Whether or not Harry ended up better off by becoming involved in the dealings of others is a completely subjective matter but it is a crucial question that the viewer must ask himherself.The ending of the film is what interested me the most about The Conversation. The consequences of Harry's obsession become manifest through the destruction of his own privacy his property and even his faith. Was Harry morally appropriate when he decided to intervene into the relationship and associations of complete strangers? Did Harry do the right thing by taking responsibility for his actions and reaching out to help another in desperate need? These are the most important questions that the film ultimately asks its audience. The final shots of Harry perfectly capture the ambiguous mood of the film's finale. Harry is sitting alone in his stripped down apartment looking exhausted humiliated and defeated. But if you look closely you will realize that he is indeed playing the saxophone to his own beat for a change. At what costs do we accept the need for our responsibility to others?".

This is a classic suspense thriller and a terrifying psychological horror film!  From the opening credits I like the characters was unsure of where I was going or what the opening conversation which is what the entire film is built around might lead to.  It seemed so unusually powerful despite its masterfully simplistic execution.  There is no overkill or excess in this film nor is it under written or underplayed.  It's just perfect! And I was even more surprised at how little was shown and how much it could engross or frighten the hell out of me!  My heart was racing even though there was little action!  This is the kind of film Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud to direct.  The direction went to another master instead Francis Ford Coppola.  I felt ahead of the movie at its opening credits. But then it blasted me and got miles ahead of me.  It is an attack on our psyche and our fear and it's amazing how like the film itself the conversation in the film that seemed so small and irrational could lead to something as big as it did!".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched this film because of all the recommendations people had made about it and also because of Francis Ford Coppola and Gene Hackman. The thing that marks this film out from other thrillers is the level of realism in it. 'Harry Caul' Gene Hackman's character makes for a complex hero. He's emotionally disciplined and brilliant at what he does. He's a man who eavesdrops on others for a living yet values his own privacy to a selfstifling fault. He also lives with regrets. As the film progresses the plot almost takes a backseat to the closely guarded world of Harry who is impressively brought to life by Gene Hackman. It's perhaps the kind of role we rarely see him in and yet he gives one of his best ever celluloid performances and an understated one at that. The film also makes great use of sound as a tensioncreating device. We the viewer are invited to eavesdrop with Harry and his assistant 'Stan' played wonderfully by John Cazale  The Godfather The Deer Hunter and participate in the films central theme. This device is effective in gaining sympathy as when Harry is eventually faced with a dilemma his problem is one the viewers can identify with. Yet he isn't the gungho gritbearer that we wish him to be. He crumbles when faced the truth he reluctantly seeks and he takes money from the very people that he suspects of a possible murder. All these traits make him a frustrating man to side with. A lot of credit has to be given to Francis Ford Coppola for the film's suitably subtle pace. This isn't a carchase type of movie so don't expect 'The French Connection'. But if you want a plausible plot and a challenging vulnerable performance by Gene Hackman then see this. One of the best thrillers I've ever seen.".

	schema:reviewBody "To me The Conversation is one of most underrated movies ever. The movie carries on so quietly throughout that the suspense of the movie keeps on building up to one of the best endings in movie history.The directing of this film was among one of the best I have ever seen. Coppola is able to craft his way through another one of his classics. The movie is just perfectly edited together and is so gripping throughout. His directing really takes the audiene to another world that most to almost all of us do not know about. That world is the world of security surveillance and spies. This though is not an ordinary spy movie it is a very realistic psychological portrayal and the affects of knowing the real truth. Instead of this movie becoming a complete flop it becomes better and better as it carries on. Along with the cinematography and music he makes the audience feel how remote and controlled our society is. Coppola did not just show it he gave you the actual feeling of it. Coppola deserves much of the credit for this.The writing was very good too. Once again Coppola uses his writing to keep the audience very much engaged into the movie. The writing in this movie ranks up their with his other screenplays such as The Godfather series Apocalypse Now and Patton.The acting was a bit of surprise to me. It was better than I expected. This film convinced me that Gene Hackman is prime talent. He is not just a man who plays the man always involved in a shouting match but in fact he is a versatile actor who has really limited himself rather than his abilities limiting him. He was perfect for this movie. The supporting cast was great as well. Robert Duvall who always gives the best cameos was good in here too. Harrison Ford who I wish actually had some more screen time was very convincing as a manipulative high ranking executive.The ending in this movie to me is one of the best ever. It shows how or fears can consume us and alter our live. It displays how if our fears consume us we lose the feeling of life itself. That is at least my take of it. This is Coppola's hidden masterpiece that should be seen by all. It will definitely make you think.".

	schema:reviewBody "Harry Caul I'm not afraid of death but I am afraid of murder.'Two weeks ago I wrote a review of The Silence of the Lambs' I said I thought that it was one of the greatest suspense films of all time. Well Francis Ford Coppola's ingenious and frightening film isn't one of the best suspense films of all time it simply is the greatest suspense film of all time.  It follows professional ease dropper Harry Caul's job on a conversation that goes way beyond anything that he ever could expect. This film is truly something else in its own right.  Coppola is such a master such a brilliant mind.  This film is him at his best after The Godfather' and before part two.  He makes this film so brilliantly and so knowing of what emotions the audience will feel every pause and every silence is direct and timed.  The film is completely intentional.  It is constructed off of films like Michelangelo Antonioni's Blowup' or most Hitchcock films.  Coppola takes these aspects brought by most of the great filmmakers and takes them to a whole new level of personal texture.  He puts so much more into it.  Making him I can't say this enough one of the greatest filmmakers of all time and most misunderstood.  His films are like pie they look good they taste good heck they even smell good but you never really know what they are made of.  All his films are deeper then they seem it takes a true TRUE! film lover to respect what influences the man has made.  Look at it like this the greatest Hollywood film of all time The Godfather' the greatest War film of all time Apocalypse Now' The greatest Sequel of all time The Godfather Part II' and the greatest IndependentSuspense film of all time The Conversation.'  What else is there to conquer?  Science Fiction?  His next film Megalopolis' will tackle that void.  Who cares about his slips he has made some of the greatest films of all time.In this film his talent is at its best with an involving brilliantly executed screenplay and flawless direction.  He makes cookies into Danish if any other man ever made this film it would be good no doubt but the greatest suspense film of all time?  I think not.  Harry Caul's Hackman character is so deep and so magnified.  He is such a character's character this film is a pure and simple character study.  Not to mention the flawless cinematography and music.  The little jazz piano riff fits the film perfectly and the cinematography is so mechanical like a piece of surveillance equipment.  The dialogue in the first few minutes is so perfectly written it makes the viewer cringe wanting to know what it is the couple is saying so when we find out it is more of a gift.  The conversation that the film is based on is set up so well all threw out the film the more we hear the more we think it is repetition at its perfection.  The repetition is a true part of the film the more the viewer hears something they ask themselves why am I hearing this again what does it mean?  Then the conversation tears at the viewer until they fall apart just like Harry. The viewer understands his motivations they see his reasons.  We are set up and moved around this maze of murder and mayhem we are Harry J. This is just one of many brilliant aspects of the film.  It never dives down or falls off it always stays paranoid like the main character.  The Conversation' is a haunting and well constructed masterpiece that molds great acting with brilliant storytelling.  This is what films in this day and age should try to do.  But they won't they never will and The Conversation' will hold its ground as the most thoughtful and suspenseful film of all time.Mark He'd kill us if he got the chance.".

Harry Caul's Hackman character is so deep and so magnified.  He is such a character's character this film is a pure and simple character study.  Not to mention the flawless cinematography and music.  The little jazz piano riff fits the film perfectly and the cinematography is so mechanical like a piece of surveillance equipment.  The dialogue in the first few minutes is so perfectly written it makes the viewer cringe wanting to know what it is the couple is saying so when we find out it is more of a gift.  The conversation that the film is based on is set up so well all threw out the film the more we hear the more we think it is repetition at its perfection.  The repetition is a true part of the film the more the viewer hears something they ask themselves why am I hearing this again what does it mean?  Then the conversation tears at the viewer until they fall apart just like Harry. The viewer understands his motivations they see his reasons.  We are set up and moved around this maze of murder and mayhem we are Harry J. This is just one of many brilliant aspects of the film.  It never dives down or falls off it always stays paranoid like the main character.  The Conversation' is a haunting and well constructed masterpiece that molds great acting with brilliant storytelling.  This is what films in this day and age should try to do.  But they won't they never will and The Conversation' will hold its ground as the most thoughtful and suspenseful film of all time.Mark He'd kill us if he got the chance.";

	schema:reviewBody "SPOILERS.Coppola made this a personal movie after the riproaring commercial and critical success of The Godfather. And it's a good one. Whereas The Godfather was a splashy violent welldone gangster movie dealing with power and sex and persuading us to sympathize with a family at least as murderous as that in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre this one has to do with something else entirely. It's not about that old theme of illusion vs. reality. Nobody plays say Jack the Ripper in a stage play and then begins to butcher women on the streets. It has to do rather with the interpretation of reality whatever that is which is an issue of a different color.Briefly Harry Caul Hackman is hired by the director who seems to be a rich and powerful executive to spy on a young woman and the guy she's seeing Cindy Williams and Frederick Forrest. He's the best surveillance technician on the West Coast and he does an ace job of capturing them on film and audiotape while they wander around Union Square in downtown San Francisco. Harry puts the pieces together and suspects the Director plans to murder them. Well this isn't Harry's first time at bat here. Back in New York doing his usual dispassionately expert job of spying he was responsible for the deaths of a man his wife and his child the incident that drove him to The City. He's a very secretive guy Harry and minds his own business but he's not about to let THAT happen again. When he tried to withhold his tapes from The Director the tapes are stolen. And when he tries to interfere further a murder does in fact take place. But Harry had it backwards. He interpreted everything on his tapes as signs that the young couple were in danger from The Director whereas in fact the couple had been planning to murder him for the inheritance and they succeed too.You can never truly be sure that your interpretations of what's going on are the correct ones because as Kant argued our interpretations are limited by our perceptual apparatus just as Harry's interpretations were limited to what he could learn from four unidirectional microphones a camera and a hidden portable mike attached to a receiver. And what all this electronic junk told him was real enough but so ambiguous that its meaning could be twisted one way or another.The movie is rife with symbolism that I'm not sure I'm getting because it too is ambiguous. Harry is as secretive as anyone can be without being frankly paranoid. Nobody knows his home phone number. His girlfriend who deserts him doesn't know his birthday or his age. A cawl is the thin layer of white fat that covers and conceals a piece of meat such as a leg of lamb. But Harry's raincoat is translucent one of those ugly plastic ones you can pretty much see through. And he wears prominent glasses so his sight can't be what it used to be. And after all an envious competitor in the bugging business does manage to plant a hidden mike on Harry and record a private conversation. And somebody does get Harry's home phone calls him up and tells him We're watching you. This leads to Harry's tearing his whole apartment apart in a futile search for the hidden mike and leaves him playing a desolate tenor sax while sitting alone on the floor. Harry has no family. His assistant John Cazale is a little too inquisitive and is fired. Someone describes Harry as anonymous and lonely. But he's neither anonymous nor lonely. God and The Director know who he is where he lives and what he does. And everywhere Harry goes he is now accompanied by his guilty conscience. Oh Harry's got a lot of company. Or as he tells his new fake girlfriend while listening to the tapes It's no ordinary conversation. It makes me feel  something.There aren't too many weaknesses. There's a murky dream sequence in which Harry describes his childhood paralysis but it doesn't have too much to do with the person we know as an adult. Cazale is professional and sympathetic. Allan Garfield is a standout in a mostly comic role as Hackman's jealous rival a blustery showman who pulls jokes on everyone including himself. The way he uses his blonde assistant in a tiny dress to help him display his wares at a buggery convention is hilarious. He's like an onstage magician cracking jokes while he stuffs the doves up his sleeve. The party scene reminds me of La Dolce Vita when the partygoers explore the ancient castle. People inhabit vast empty echoing spaces. Most of the time they are blocked from one another by iron gratings or hanging sheets of plastic. They whisper intimacies to fantasies.The score is fine. Carmine Coppola uses old melodies behind some of the scenes and a tinkling puzzling piano statement behind most of the incidents. Sensibly the screen is left silent except for natural noises when Harry looks into the scene of the murder he thinks he witnessed.You know sometimes it's possible to read too much into something to see Gestalts where there be no Gestalts. I don't know if I'm making something out of nothing but is it a coincidence that Harry's birthday falls on the same day he develops a conscience? Or that on the same day the Director's assistant offers him Christmas cookies? Is it pure chance that the repetitive song Red Red Robin contains the line Still I listen for hours and hours? That the assistant's name Stett means leave it alone in Latin? There's much more to be said about this film but I don't want to run out of space so I'll simply recommend seeing it. In its own quiet way it's a far more provocative movie than The Godfather.".

	schema:reviewBody "Francis Form Coppola's The Conversation was his only film from the seventies written and directed by him and made through his Zoetrope studios and it is no less than a major credit to his status as a creative successfully experimental filmmaker of the newwave of American directors of the 70's. The Conversation is a firstperson story of a surveillance man named Harry Caul played by Gene Hackman who's well respected by his fellow snooppeers but isn't always that good at it.  After getting audio on a conversation between a man and woman talking about a murder or one that could happen and trying to decipher some muddled words in it he leaves his door open for the tapes to be stolen and this sets him into a paranoid state fearing a dejavu will occur for him his work caused some deaths years before.What's so fascinating and telling about The Conversation is that its basic storyline and development is that of a thriller yet the way Coppola uses Hackman's Harry brings to the story themes of guilt privacy fear loneliness and so forth that go to reel the viewer into the psychology of this character.  The ones Harry is listening in on are important to the story but not so much as Harry's placement on the outskirts of what else is going on in the story.  A more conventional film would've gone with The Director character in a cameo by Robert Duvall or even with the people Harry Caul listens in on.  Instead we get a viewpoint strictly from the sideline which is often harrowing especially from his perspective.Two aspects to The Conversation really struck me on my first viewing outside of Bill Butler's keenly observatory camerawork and the acting from the main and supporting players the sound in most scenes is rather extraordinary for the times.  Whether we're hearing the conversation in its repetitious forms listening in on a silence about to break or even in just a seemingly normal scene when sounds either diegetic or nondiegetic come into play it's like Coppola and his Academy Award nominated should've won sound men Walter Murch and Art Rochester are stretching the boundaries for it and were arguably expanding its usage before moviegoers ears. The other thing that struck me was how Coppola gets the viewer deeper into Harry's mood with surrealistic images that are all the more frightening since they seem totally real to Harry.  The prime example of this would be the hotel room scene  because Harry is a sort of antihero and we can still identify with him slightly on a moral level the dreamlike moments become potent visionary.And then there's Hackman as Harry Caul he plays him to the best of the great actor's ability revealing levels of sorrow bitterness humility and regret all with total conviction that another actor might've not grasped. By the end of the film the viewer's been brought along on this journey via Harry and though Coppola was the mastermind behind how it was crafted it was Hackman to me who brought the whole experience to a sense of realism to a thriller that has illusions to spare.  Whether or not the conversation hurt others or brought upon shame on The Director isn't the point and that's how Coppola must've wanted it  he was inspired by Antonioni's Blowup which used photographs as a man's obsession instead of sound  the point is Harry's journey through this assignment and how it begins to whittle him down to a nub...One of the best films of 1974 The Conversation also won the prestigious Palme D'Or at Cannes that year.

What could have been an extraordinarily fine suspenser is turned into  a slowpaced character study that only skims the surface of its  protagonist who is an expert in surveillance but unable to connect with  any of the rather boring individuals around him. The script fails to  inject any of the other characters with life so that we never get to  know what makes anyone tick. Annoying? Yes. Frustrating? Yes.  Enigmatic? Too enigmatic for comfort.  After nearly two hours of watching Hackman spy on a young couple and  teasing us with the one sentence he is sure means they are afraid of  being murdered the script takes a different turn at the last moment  and the audience at least gets a bit of a twist if it is still awake to  face the denouement.  Maddeningly slow with scenes that aren't even needed to fill in some  awkward gaps in the screenplay this could have been a tremendously  suspenseful film under a director like Alfred Hitchcock with a writer  like Ernest Lehman who did North by Northwest.  But Coppola has skipped all of the conventional ways of building  suspense in favor of a semidocumentary approach that falls flat and  fails to register in a gripping enough way to keep the story taut and  interesting. Instead his departure from the usual way of filming is  an exercise in tedium.  This is the sort of filmmaking that became common in the '70s a sort  of audio version of Brian De Palma's BLOW UP but not nearly as  effective. What might have made an interesting story never reaches its  full potential.".

	schema:reviewBody "My hunch is that the buzz surrounding this film is largely due to the fact that it OUGHT to be good. The idea is a good one. It's been made into a film so far as I can tell exactly once no other film in history that I'm aware of is a remake a foreshadowing a knockoff a parody or a faithful homage. There's really nothing better or worse to compare it to. Coppola made the film between The Godfather and The Godfather Part II two films which are widely if incorrectly regarded as among the best of all time with a talented crew and without any obvious mistakes. However few or many positive virtues it may have it has few positive failings. On balance it's probably okay and certainly worth watching once.Spoilers follow...But surely even the film's champions can see how painfully boring most of it is. It's depressing all right because it's always depressing to spend two hours in the company of someone or something with no energy no life and not very many thoughts and I'm not referring to Harry Caul here although I could be but to the film itself. Coppoloa is as obsessive about getting down every little uninteresting detail about people and events he doesn't understand the significance of as his protagonist is if the process of watching the minutae of bugging is SOMETIMES involving as in the opening scene where we see how the title conversation was recorded in the first place or the sequence in which Caul patiently and methodically sifts through what sound like random crackles in order to pull out complete comprehensible sentences or even the trade show where matters of moment look as though they might be under discussion this is because it's sometimes going somewhere. But Coppola doesn't know how to build. When the key sentence He'd kill us if he got the chance leaps out of the soundtrack at us it's an arresting moment but only because we suspect that the sentence means something. Only gradually does it dawn on us that we're never going to be told what it means nor will we be given any further evidence not even the thinnest little sliver that might help us work it out. Nor does this sentence move the story forward in any way. Harry gets more paranoid as a result of hearing the sentence but while he moves around more frantically he doesn't seem to be going in any particular direction.Another writer calls Coppola's film a great paranoid character study disguised as a thriller and goes on to say that it works well on either level. This view could not be more wrong. If The Conversation worked well as a thriller we wouldn't need to invoke the central character's madness and the fact that any particular thing we see may not really be happening at all simply to make sense of the story and if it worked as a paranoid character study we wouldn't need to think that some of Harry's delusions may not be delusions at all in order to be interested in them. This leaves open the possibility that the film works as a COMBINATION of paranoid character study and thriller but for that to be the case it would have to be less tedious.The ambiguous ending is a simple copout which is why the final shot of Harry's smashedtobits rooms which OUGHT to be shocking and creepy carry almost no charge whatever. Ambiguous endings only work when there is at least one satisfying disambiguation in there somewhere. There's none to be had here. This is the best I can come up with Harry has been had by is colleagues again just as he was at the trade show. The device he thought was fake the one which would purportedly a distant wiretapper to turn any telephone receiver anywhere in the world into a live microphone in fact WORKED and Harry destroyed everything in his flat looking for newlyplanted bug when the only bug present was the one that had been there all along.The murder or wouldbemurder or imagined murder whichever it was is on this theory little more than a red herring. I don't like this but don't blame me if the film doesn't know what it's about.".

	schema:reviewBody "THE CONVERSATION is my favorite film of Francis Ford Coppola. For all of the hoopla surrounding THE GODFATHER films and APOCALYPSE NOW over the years I actually think that THE CONVERSATION may be Coppolas most perfect entertaining film. Coming out in 1974 at the height of the Watergate scandal THE CONVERSATION is on the surface a film about wiretapping and spying on other people's private conversations. But it is also an effective thriller as the viewer is hard pressed to figure out what is really going on even upon multiple viewings.At its core it seems to be a very personal film about a man who has serious difficulty distinguishing fact from fiction due to his supersheltered existence. Gene Hackman stars as professional wiretapper Harry Caul and this folks is the absolute best performance of Gene Hackman's career! And that's saying a lot bc the man has always done fabulous work. But here you almost won't know that it's Gene Hackman. As Harry Caul Hackman is extremely quiet lonely sad sensitive and suspicious. And Hackman embodies all these characteristics with 100 believability. It's one of the most perfect performances that I've ever seen. It's almost too bad he won Oscar for French Connection in 1971 bc had he not I almost have got to believe that he would have won for this film and he wasn't even nominated for THE CONVERSATION! Supreme oversight by the Academy.At the start we are introduced to our hero Harry Caul through a brilliantly executed sequence of longview overhead tracking shots of a bugged Harry circling a park while his cohorts are in a building on a rooftop and in a van picking up the conversation between a couple that Harry is following. The editing in this scene is fantastic as it subtly shifts between hearing the muffled words that Harry and his men are picking up and the actual words spoken. They are speaking at such a whisper that you can hardly make out what they are saying. You also get a lesson in wiretapping here.During the film we meet several of Harry's cronies. One is his very young girlfriend Amy played by superyoung Teri Garr who loves Harry but hates him keeping things from her. Another is his partner Stan played by the great character actor John Cazale who seemed like he worked in just about every great film of the 70s. Stan also doesn't like the fact that Harry is so guarded and leaves to work for a rival. During a wiretapper's convention we are introduced to one of Harry's biggest rivals Bernie Moran played by Allen Garfield in perhaps the second best performance of this film. Bernie is extremely jealous of Harry and has an eerie stalkerlike affinity for him.Harry is working for some mysterious 'Director' of a powerful company played by an uncredited Robert Duvall and the woman of the park couple is The Director's wife played by Cindy Williams in a refreshingly mysterious and sexy performance who he thinks is cheating on him with the man played by Frederic Forrest who works for him. Upon taking the conversation tapes to The Director his assistant Martin Stett played by an extremely youthful Harrison Ford in an effectively creepy performance tries to intercept them and take them from him but Harry only wants to put them directly into The Director's hands. A suspicious Harry begins to investigate further and carefully tries to make out the meaning of the couple's conversation and concludes that they are having an affair and based on what they said he thinks The Director wants to kill them.The film speaks a lot to the paranoia at the time due to Watergate and the disillusionment and general malaise that existed due to the Vietnam War. The film itself is an effective and thoughtprovoking thriller that keeps you guessing until the very end. It has one of the most ambiguous film endings of all time. A highly provocative and unique film! Perhaps Coppola's best!".

	schema:reviewBody "Sandwiched between the epic successes of 'The Godfather' and 'The Godfather Part II' Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Conversation' might at first seem to be a comparatively light film. Admittedly I found it rather underwhelming while I was watching it and yet the more I thought about it the more I recognised the complexities of what had originally seemed a completely straightforward plot. In this brooding character study Gene Hackman plays Harry Caul the most respected surveillance expert in the business. In order to succeed at his job Harry has learned to value a certain level of detachment from his victims maintaining that his client's troubles are of no concern to him. Accordingly Harry often distances himself from intimacy in his personal life his only relationship being with a lonely woman named Meredith Elizabeth MacRae to whom he reveals nothing about himself.After Harry successfully records a quiet conversation between two people Frederic Forrest and Cindy Williams in a crowded courtyard he begins to suspect that his surveillance may lead to their assassination. For the first time he begins to question the ethics of his chosen field eventually becoming actively involved in his client's issues. 'The Conversation' is probably most remarkable for its brilliant sound editing mixing together recorded conversations muffled words microphone static and ambient sounds it was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Sound category but lost out to Mark Robson's 'Earthquake.'. By the end of the film after his suspicions have proved him to be completely wrong in his assumptions Caul has become paranoid and insecure. Being reputedly the best bugger in the business he is finally forced to face that terrifying possibly what if there is somebody better than him?As Harry literally tears apart his apartment in search of the bug notably he doesn't look anywhere in his beloved tenor saxophone the camera slowly and mechanically pans from right to left just as a surveillance camera might do. This camera movement reinforces one of the Coppola's main themes just as Harry is a voyeur on the private lives of his subjects we the audience are complicit in his deed. Indeed we are surveilling Harry even in his most intimate moments and the knowledge of this has permanently unhinged him forcing him even to destroy his statue of the Virgin Mary which symbolised the relics of his devout Catholicism. Gene Hackman is brilliantly understated in the main role his brooding silence saying more than even the most colourful dialogue possibly could. We see him complete detached from sharing his emotions and we see and feel his loneliness.Hackman is also supported by a solid cast of talented actors including John Cazale and Allen Garfield as fellow surveillance experts. Frederic Forrest and Cindy Williams play the young couple whose taped conversation forms the backbone of their story and through clever editing it is remarkable how the meanings behind their words changes depending on the context in which it is heard notably one very important piece of dialogue he'd kill us if he got the chance was rerecorded for the climax since preview audiences had difficulty picking up on the change in emphasis. Robert Duvall makes an uncredited cameo as the Director who hires Harry's services and I was exceedingly impressed with a young Harrison Ford straight from George Lucas' 'American Graffiti 1973.'".

When the movie started it felt like a usual feast especially because of Namitha mainly. Though Ballaya looked a little old for Sriman Narayana's role but he seemed serious. The first half was overall average the usual fights sequences villains making grueling faces heroins drooling over Ballaya and all. However post intermission movie turned out to be much better. The Narasimha role suited Ballaya very well. He looked every bit of that fiery tiger. Nayanthara looked royal and elegant. Sneha Ullal seemed lost while Namitha looked ugly she is too fat even for being a porn star now.".

	schema:reviewBody "Before starting about RGV and all the hype he does. Primary factor to be discussed here is the Story of the movie. As everybody knows Raktacharitra is a make of popular rivalry between Paritala Ravindra and MaddelaCheruvu Suryanarayana most of us in Andhrapradesh knows the facts of the story. But the unknown facts hidden are always hidden under the darkest corner of the history. And to find them all in a movie is greater experience. The movie provides wonderful and powerful story which Indian audience are missing since years. As the title shows it the soul of the story is revenge power and politics And all the three factors not in tuxedo style but on pure Indian grounds. All the three factors played significant role to make the story powerful.But the movie play and storytelling could be better. The movie opens with a murder scene in daylight Which introduces us with the emotion and heat of the story world. When story slowly unfolds a stretch of scenes are merely visual and audible No scene development is done which resulted in no emotion and banal storytelling and a feeling of watching Discovery Documentary show. Adding to the fuel RGV's Voice over is a partial disaster but he was able to carry the emotion of the scene and intention of the story in his voice. The scope of the first half is huge. A director can ask for no more. There is lot of politics going around in the first half which would've resulted in an epic drama if scenes are well planned. Unfortunately no ideas in Storytelling and screenplay were used and all drama was wasted. Maybe the director doesn't wanted the screenplay to dominate the story? Wat soever It could've been an epic.After the first episode The big time drama starts and audience lost themselves in to the dramatic world of the story. Politics Power Revenge and Powerful Characters are the life of this movie. Every scene is linked has value and content. Raktacharitra is gore story and demands gore scenes. You cannot see a Gandhi with a missile and Adolf Hitler preaching Peace. This movie is presented as it is chosen by Story and the story is chosen by reality.Other Factors RGV could've concentrated on the dubbing artists which brought previous movie experiences and confused audience unknowingly.Screenplay and scene development cud be better.The idea of voiceover is good to make the lengthy story short and a direct interaction of story teller to the audience.One song is an abuse to the movie.We need more movies with content. Thanks to RGV".

	schema:reviewBody "RAKHT CHARITRAThere is a certain level of violence one can take in a film. And there is a certain level of violence one can take in a day of watching multiple films. Rakht Charita RC crosses both the levels in its first hour. I read what Ram Gopal Verma RGV tweeted about RC not being for one of those who liked K3G but now I feel that was an understatement. I happen to love RGV's hardcore cinema. Company and Satya are my all time favorite movies and I remember each and every dialogue of those films but even for me RC was a bit too much to handle.Let me clarify one thing. I am not saying it's a bad movie. It's a good movie which actually wins on most of the technical and acting grounds. The problem is the level of bloodshed it shows. Very authentic very red but not the entertaining violence of Dabangg that makes you whistle in sheer pleasure but a bona fide brutality that makes you take your eyes off the screen.The film shows numerous methods of torture and killings for retribution and in politics with different weapons drawing different levels of pain and blood. In a 50 occupied theater on the eight day of its overseas release which I think is a big achievement for this kind of film I heard someone saying 'Damagh Ka Vaat Laga Diya' it has screwed my brain. That's what RC is.The story based on a real life character of South India is pretty much Mahabharata and God Father in the first hour. It becomes a lot more original in the second half and becomes really interesting after the introduction of Shatrugan Sinha in a very attentiongrabbing role. The 'Khaaamosh' of Mr. Sinha has been replaced by 'Topic Khatam' in this one. The story moves between being realistic and being a bit mindboggling throughout and has also been dragged on multiple occasions. The overexposure of Bukka Reddy could have been slashed by 30 very easily. That amount of time could have been given to the love story of Pratab and Nandini to make things lighter and show a softer side of Pratab. To top it all the movie does not finish when it finishes. It's only half of the film that has been released as of now and the remaining half will be released on 19th November. That might still be a smart move because those who sat through the entire movie will actually end up watching the second part as well. I will also watch it because I saw Priyamani in the trailer it showed. PRIYAMANI in Hindi movie!Vivek Oberoi does very well as Pratab. His concentration and the effort he has put in that role are noteworthy. Watch out for his scenes in Nandini's college altercation with Manda and attacking the Reddy house. He very well looks like a man with vengeance on his head. However the stage where his career is now he has chosen a wrong film for his comeback. This is a make or break film for Vivek with more chances of breaking it because it will be very difficult to find the audience for this film. He would have been much betteroff with something like Saathiya for his return.Abhimanyu Singh as Bukka Singh is one of the most terrifying villains I have ever seen in the Hindi films since Ashutosh Rana's Lajja Shankar. Even though he gets a bit comical at times with his choice of wardrobe which means nothing but shorts but he does emanate cruelty. He surprises you when he cries but the way he treats the lady police officer sends shivers through your body.Zarina Wahab is excellent as Pratab's mothers. Radhika Apte as Nandini is very cute. Her role could have been meatier. It will be interesting to see how she performs in glamorous roles in the future. Another show stealer is Ashish Vidyarthi as Manda. Good to see the guy back in a very strong performance. The actors playing Pratab's right hands are excellent. Ashwini Khalsekar as the lady police officer is strong. Sushant Singh as Pratab's elder brother does justice to his small role. The men in Pratab's gang are efficient. Shatrugan Sinah looks different and goes overboard at times but has an important role to play.Cinematorgrpahy by Amol Tahor is very good. It suits the need of the film and he has an RGV stamp on it. The light and smoke treatment throughout the film is excellent. Background sound is too heavy and adds to the violence. The title song in the background keeps haunting you in slightly lighter scenes.RGV has done a good job. The film is quite real and raw and he has achieved what he wanted to achieve. He could have achieved the same in slightly shorter duration too but it looks like he deliberately kept it longer so that the violence looked prolonged. RC is sadistic and that's what he wanted to show. The questionable thing is his purpose to show that much bloodshed. He looked to be on a spree to satisfy some fetish of his. I would believe that he has been a bit unfair to Vivek for this role because his career doesn't seem to be going anywhere with it.The tagline of RC says 'REVENGE IN THE PUREST EMOTION'. The film justifies this tagline to the core. If you have a 10 reservation against violent films and your definition of violence is the last fighting scene of DDLJ stay away from RC. If you like RGV brand of cinema like Company Sarkar and Satya even then it's going to be challenging. I will as I said watch the second half too but I have my own reasons. PRIYAMANI. You can decide on your own.".

He really deserves respect the way he had presented it. Though story is different at times reminds us of Satya Company Sarkar etc may be because of the Camera Angle the presentation is similar. RGV we can feel his passion for film making. Very rarely does in India somebody comes up with a movie about a Real Life Prominent person and almost all the time they had given us an above average movie. Eg Company Nayagan Sarkar Gandhi Iruvar Legend of Bhagat Singh etc.. Part 1 The raise of Pratap Ravi is explained at the same time we hear a lot about a person who is the reason behind the fall of Pratap and here is the lead to the Part 2. Thats a very different Idea and good indeed.  he had given a movie which is not for soft heart not for kids not for family and not for masala movie fans.Minuses At times its seems like a Documentary. The story is tolled in the voice of 'RGV' itself the sound is not catching but 'had shown a very good voice modulation' still should have given to somebody else. The glory of Violence will keep the Family viewers and Kids away from theater. And People who are the fans of movies like Brindavanam Khaleja is not going to enjoy this movie. The film is exceptionally good to the Targeted viewers and very bad for others.Overall The story moves slowly in the first half you will witness few of the most drastic and terrific scenes in an Indian movie and second is very thrilling where number murder is reduced and the politics takes the key. The Part 2 is expected to release on 19th Nov 2010. It shows the director who want to give the second part before the viewer forget the part 1. You will come of the theater with a feeling as if you had just watched a person's real life very closely.Point Vivek Dominates first Part along with Shatrugansinha Abhimany. And I expect Part 2 is a Suriya movie with Sudeep. The characters are introduced in the First Part itself and will see another side of the same story. Very good thinking and direction by Ram Gopal Varma.Lookout Post Interval Scenes between Shatrugansinha and Vivek. Most splendid scene  Suriya's Introduction.Tagline Hats of to RGV for his Passion Sincerity and love for Film Making.Glorifying Violence Dark side of the politics".

	schema:headline " Epic!!!";
	schema:reviewBody "RGV did it again!! Rakht Charitra can be easily mentioned as one of the best of RGV or even one of the best in the history of 'Dark Cinema'. The direction is top notch the dialogues are hardhitting and the performances are extremely natural and great. Rakht Charitra has all those elements in the right place to make it a classic. The movie is flawless fastpaced and freakingly violent! Yes the weakhearted better stay away from this flick!! Rakht Charitra is about an era where it was believed that 'Revenge is the purest emotion' rather than 'An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind'. It is about Pratap Ravi one with a strong heart. After he loses his father and brother in the dirty game of Politics he decides to take revenge and the real Rakht Charitra begins. There is a lot of tears in the movie tears of downtrodden mothers and wives tears of abused and exploited sisters but there is even more blood in the movie which takes the revenge to all the tears shed. But do not expect a mindless movie with blood only it has a strong storyline without which the movie would have been a forgettable offering from RGV. But this has the story and is executed extremely well and it has turned out to be a must watch for people who watch movies with true spirit.Vivek Oberoi is in his topform he does the role of the lead protagonist Pratap Ravi with ease he is excellent in his role. Look at his eyes the way he looks gazes and stares you will realize it!! And Abhimanyu Singh he is damn great!! Excellent acting it is fact that villains in RGV flicks will be notorious but this guy is great he is excellent in his role. Sushant Singh was awesome in his scenes I had a strong sensation of clapping loudly while watching him walk in slow motion. Shatrughan Sinha is good Zarina Wahab Radhika Apte Ashwini Kalsekar Kota Srinivasa Rao Rajendra Gupta Anupam Shyam all were good. Sudeep and Darshan Jariwala I guess is reserved for the 2nd 'Adhyay' of Rakht charitra.I really want to point out some scenes that prove the director's excellence but it may lead to spoilers so I'm not going to do it now. The only negative I could find is RGV's voice which lacked high power. However all I can say is watch the movie you won't be disappointed. The movie has got the power it is not just a movie it is Epic!!!".

	onyx:emotionText "RGV did it again!! Rakht Charitra can be easily mentioned as one of the best of RGV or even one of the best in the history of 'Dark Cinema'. The direction is top notch the dialogues are hardhitting and the performances are extremely natural and great. Rakht Charitra has all those elements in the right place to make it a classic. The movie is flawless fastpaced and freakingly violent! Yes the weakhearted better stay away from this flick!! Rakht Charitra is about an era where it was believed that 'Revenge is the purest emotion' rather than 'An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind'. It is about Pratap Ravi one with a strong heart. After he loses his father and brother in the dirty game of Politics he decides to take revenge and the real Rakht Charitra begins. There is a lot of tears in the movie tears of downtrodden mothers and wives tears of abused and exploited sisters but there is even more blood in the movie which takes the revenge to all the tears shed.

Story narration by RGV in Telugu is apt for the genre of the movie that he selected. Story goes as it is supposed to go with no flaw in any corner of the movie. Varma did a great job in selecting appropriate characters for the roles. Vivek was stunning in the role as Paritala Ravi. Portrayal of characters with no compromise is what every director has to learn from RGV. Am eagerly waiting for its sequel to release which is going to hit screens on 19th Nov. There would not be any look back in going to movie on first day even for its sequel Rakta Charitra 2.".

And as Gandhiji said An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind.After the collateral damage in the form of Aag Ram Gopal Varma RGV has risen from the ashes like a phoenix. He delivers a well paced well scripted and well shot movie in the form of Rakht Charitra. The film is split into two parts with the second part slated to release on November 19.The plot sticks to the actual story of the Telugu politician Paritala Ravindra. Ravindra started out as a naxalite to avenge the death of his father and brother and later enters mainstream politics. Read the document from Scribd for more details about him.spoilers aheadComing back to the film Vivek Oberoi plays the role of Ravi who leaves his studies and comes back to his village Anatpur to avenge his father's and brother's death. Aided by his father's people he succeeds in killing the big shots who were behind the tragedy that occurred in his family. One of the villains son is left and that causes the wannabe politician cum superstar Sivaji Shatrughnan Sinha  looks like he is trying to portray NTR to enter the scene.He makes Ravi an MLA and a minister. Ravi using his new power wipes out his last enemy. The film ends with the introduction of Suryanarayan Reddy Suriya Sivakumar which leaves the story open for the second part.spoilers endMost of the cast delivers commendable performances. Vivek Oberoi especially delivers his career best. Shatrughnan Sinha as the shrewd politician is really convincing. The teaser for the second part gives us a glimpse of a powerhouse performance by Suriya. National award winner actress Priyamani also joins Suriya for part 2.As one will expect the camera angles are trademark RGV. The background score which samples heavily from Hindu slokams are apt though a bit repetitive at some times. There is only one song which was completely unnecessary.Like any other RGV movie RC has all the ingredients to make it a dark movie. This time the blood and gore has gone very high which forced RGV to comment that company will look like Kabhi Khushi Khabhi Gham. Beware this is not at all for the light hearted.I will give it 910.One more thing. If you are going for the part 1 book your calendars for November 19 for part 2. Otherwise it will be like just having the starters and skipping an 8 course meal!!.".

	schema:reviewBody "Vengeance is back on Indian screen with a baggage of excessive violence. After making one of the worst film of his career Ramgopal Verma is back with a big bang. He returned to his fort of crime violence power politics and thrill with the original real life story of Andhra criminal cum politician Paritala Ravi. This is his striking and desperate attempt with a punch with all his capable might and madness which either make you hate or just praise him for his daring effort showing you never before unthinkable violence and bloodshed on Indian screen. Though in showing reality of dirty nexus between crime politics and shifting volatile power and portraying some of his character too diabolic he crossed the limit of Indian audience and orthodox censor board but while doing it in his limitless frenzy he made another 'original' and 'cult' film for his fans.This is the only Indian commercial film shot and made with a length of more than five hours and the reason enough why it has to be released in two parts. The first installment begins with impressive shifting of power that gave birth to revenge and bloodshed with mindblowing treatment brilliant ensemble cast and striking performances all with what one can expect from RGV's diabolic dark mind. The film is saving grace and praiseworthy comeback not only for RGV but also for Vivek Oberoi and he's the extension of fire what we witnessed in his debut 'Company' with the same mentor. Apart of him the film has fine ensemble and supporting presence of many RGV loyal cast with certain new entries. The prominent among them is Shatrughan Sinha who has short but impressive presence with his mustache less face as popular film star cum politician Shivaji with dialogues and attitude that suits his aura this time his 'Khamosh!' is replaced with 'Topic is over'. Abhimanyu Singh who blew our minds in his short but terrific presence as Ransa in 'Gulaal' has performed one of the most heinous and violent villain you have ever seen on Indian screen as Bukka. It's in portraying him as 'Rakshas' RGV showed certain objectionable violence crossing all possible barriers. But the intensity of Abhimanyu Singh's act is visible in some of the striking scenes with his bloodthirsty rage in expression and pervert body language. Watch the scene where he continuously slapping the lady cop repeating 'Touch nahi karna' or another where he's showing his temper when his brother comes to meet him in prison. Without a doubt he's the villain of the year.Technically film is almost flawless and has gripping editing with few avoidable distractions and a song. Cinematography background score and production deserved clapping. The only complain is too dark portrayal of characters shedding their part of violence on screen. It would have been better if Ramu had explored multiple dimensions of their charcterization like 'Satya'. He ended the film on interesting turn with showing you rushes of his second part releasing 19th on next month with the entry of South Indian superstar Suriya to give Vivek enough fire. I'm desperately waiting to see the second part and I'm sure that Ramu won't fall short of my expectations in making this epic bloodbath of his career.The film is strictly no no to family audience and achche ghar ki bahubetiyan. It's all loaded for RGV fans who're as mad enough as him. Watch it at your own risk it's quite hard to digest for all.Ratings810PS I am like a hardcore porn DVD. You might hate it love it look down upon it or get disgusted by it but if it is in the room you can't resist watching it.  RGV's interesting comment on his blog.".

	schema:headline " Good Job Vivek and RGV !";
	schema:reviewBody "The movie tackles a revenge story that a guy vivek successfully takes for the murder of his wannabe politicians father and brother and ends up becoming a robin hood kinda politician himself Story is fairly simple but execution is quite brilliant. Technically the movie is completely an RGV movie Close up shots awkward camera angles sporadic use of shaky cam dimlit backgrounds and loud but effective background score in one scene the camera even takes a 360 degree rotation. The movie relies heavily on the treatment as the story is pretty straightforward and RGV does just that By providing a heavy background score he builds tension and background score replaces dialog's at many places Another strong point of the movie are the acting performances. Vivek has done a excellent job as expected of him 'cause of his previous gangster movie outings in company and shootout at lokhandwala its a role which is made for vivek only and he does it with utmost ease i am sure this movie is going to change his career for good RGV also comes back in his company satya sarkar mode and makes a realistic entertaining movie shatrugan sinha also has done good justice to his rather short role .A special mention for abhimanyu singh who has played bukka reddy haven't seen such a terrifying evil act ever in any movie his bloodshot eyes  ruthless expressions and merciless killings is enough to give the fainthearted nightmares kudos for the brilliant performance. The movie is quite graphic in nature  the killings are brutal and so are the depicted atrocities on women certainly not a fare for people who like to stay away from gore but else everyone should like it 810".

	onyx:emotionText "The movie tackles a revenge story that a guy vivek successfully takes for the murder of his wannabe politicians father and brother and ends up becoming a robin hood kinda politician himself Story is fairly simple but execution is quite brilliant. Technically the movie is completely an RGV movie Close up shots awkward camera angles sporadic use of shaky cam dimlit backgrounds and loud but effective background score in one scene the camera even takes a 360 degree rotation. The movie relies heavily on the treatment as the story is pretty straightforward and RGV does just that By providing a heavy background score he builds tension and background score replaces dialog's at many places Another strong point of the movie are the acting performances. Vivek has done a excellent job as expected of him 'cause of his previous gangster movie outings in company and shootout at lokhandwala its a role which is made for vivek only and he does it with utmost ease i am sure this movie is going to change his career for good RGV also comes back in his company satya sarkar mode and makes a realistic entertaining movie shatrugan sinha also has done good justice to his rather short role .A special mention for abhimanyu singh who has played bukka reddy haven't seen such a terrifying evil act ever in any movie his bloodshot eyes  ruthless expressions and merciless killings is enough to give the fainthearted nightmares kudos for the brilliant performance. The movie is quite graphic in nature  the killings are brutal and so are the depicted atrocities on women certainly not a fare for people who like to stay away from gore but else everyone should like it 810";

	schema:headline " Ram Gopal Varma redefines REVENGE in Indian Cinema with his answer to the western KILL BILL.";
	schema:reviewBody "To be straight the movie is A Big No for all the kids and even for the grownups having weak hearts. The extremely brutal killings shown freely in the film can really leave some disturbing marks on the innocent psyche of the kids. So the first rule of watching RAKTA CHARITRA is that you should not take your kids along to the theaters and may be the ladies too.The second revelation about this first part of RGVs sequel is that it is evidently not everyone's cup of tea in the literal sense. The viewers who wish to have a good time and fun in the cinema may find it unentertaining meaningless bloody and too hard hitting. But movie freaks who are well familiar with the brand RGV and love to see some cunning strong and realistic kind of cinema told with a fresh narrative are sure going to love it in one manner or the other.Returning to the movie itself it is apparently made on the true story of famous gangster turned politician Paritala Ravi of Andhra Pradesh. Here I would like to add that if everything shown in the film is really true and is not glorified to a large extent then it is really scary to know that it all actually happened in a city full of living human beings.Apart from the storyline you may also complain about the similar RGV kind of camera angles lightings and confrontations scenes in the film reminding you the ones seen earlier in his SATYA COMPANY SARKAR SARKARRAJ and many other underworld movies coming from the RGV factory. And for many the film might be a documentary focusing only on all the hardcore murders coming one after another on the screen without any basic storyline behind them. But still RAKTA CHARITRA works in a particular way for all the RGV fans and for the viewers who are game for something experimental tried by the gutsy director of Indian Film Industry.Frankly what worked for me in RC is the attitude with which it is made fearlessly by the one  only RGV. The man dares to do what he feels like and with his every new film tries to make his own set of rules about film business. For instance he simply doesn't care if his project gets deliberately avoided by groups of college going boys and girls love couples and families especially having small kids even if this takes away a major part of his collections at the box office. He makes what he wishes to make and that too in a style which cannot even be thought by many other glossy filmmakers of Bollywood churning out chocolate movies with big stars every year. Mahesh Bhatt was the one man who used to take up such kind of subjects earlier but then he too always decorated his projects with controversial scenes loud emotional dramas and hit songs. Today RGV moves way ahead in that direction with RAKTA CHARITRA and delivers a film which might be unbearable for many having his name written over every frame of the reels till the end.Using hidden talented actors such as Abhimanyu Singh Ashwini Kalsekar Zarina Wahab and Rajendra Gupta RGV transforms them into believable lively characters with his remarkable vision and skill. Now who could have thought to cast Shatrughan Sinha with a look without his famous moustache? And who could have thought of making a complete film of 4 hours and then releasing it in two parts at a gap of one month?Only RGV showed these guts but honestly his sequel idea also looks like inspired from Quentin Tarantino's KILL BILL series of movies. Tarantino's world famous classic is also a pure revenge action thriller which was initially made with a duration of 4 hours to do full justice with the script. With this extra length Tarantino also decided to release it in two parts but at a gap of 6 months. RGV seems to be following the same idea but the master moves one step ahead than Tarantino when he right away shows the trailer of his IInd part in the end of RAKTA CHARITRA and that too along with the date of its release written of the screen in red. This he earlier vaguely tried in his AGYAAT too.So as a final verdict I would like to recommend RC to the viewers who wish to see execution more than the content and don't mind blood thrown all over the screen right from the start. Its strictly for the movie freaks who get excited watching the slow motion sequences of terror accompanied by a haunting background score. And for the ones who get pumped up watching the real action on screen with the voice of Rakta Charitra  Rakta Charitra being played in the background constantly. Moreover I would like you to watch RAKTA CHARITRA for three names alone and they are Abhimanyu Singh Shatrughan Sinha and Vivek Oberoi in this particular order. The three excel themselves in the movie undoubtedly but the surprise element is delivered by Abhimanyu Singh as Bhukha who will get hatred in return for his role from every single viewer of the movie unconditionally. And that truly would be the real reward for his superb performance filled with terror.Summing up with RAKTA CHARITRA RGV redefines the word REVENGE in BOLLYWOOD and makes all previous movies made on this topic look like dwarfs. It will not get appreciation from all but if you are real movie lover then you got to see this pure example of a director's bloody vision of an old story. In clear words its an RGV movie all the way with his famous attitude of I WILL DO WHAT I WANT  If you don't like it then don't watch it.".

	schema:reviewBody "Ram Gopal Varma has given Bollywood some of it's most famous movies. But may be he has given all he had because in Rakht Charitra I he tries to stuff in all the elements he ever had in his kitty. What new he adds to it is sheer loudness. A grumpyirritating voiceover unnecessarily explaining what we could otherwise easily see with our eyes and make out leaves not much for the audience to do  treating them like school children being dramatically read out a history lesson in class. And the overtly loud background music with repeatedunnecessaryharsh chantingswhose meaning we couldn't often make out tries to keep the audience engrossed in their 'lesson' and never miss the feel  but it fails miserably as it sounds simply ridiculous at times and doesn't go with the pace of the film. May be RGV was too afraid that his audience would not be able to relate to his story like they couldn't in AgyatAagDarlingNishabd etc.The director overdoes with some of his poor clichs which he should have done away with by this time like trying to involve the family a bit too much and not transforming characters well with time. Women readying breakfast on the table while serious matters are dealt with a few hands away the maid cleaning a candlestand while statelevel politics is being discussed in the room and with a transformed Vivek Oberoi his aides' wardrobes remain pretty much the same as before. Similar things we have seen and spared in hits like Company and Satya  but we expect the director not to repeat them emphatically which he does here! May be all these to hide the bit jumbled up script.In terms of acting is where the film does best  with a host of talented actorsa few too many one may think with bits of parts to play. Vivek has a little lesser screenpresence to my liking and does look a touch confused n shaky with his characterization right from his first scene where he strolls a scooter down the neighbourhood.not a grand entry But he does well to get into his character as the film progresses. And the topsyturvy transformation journey he is set into is handled efficiently showing glimpses of his earlier brilliance in the dying scenes of the film. May be RGV could have left a bit more on his shoulders since he is supposed to be the central character  hopefully we will see more of him in the 2nd part. Shatrughan Sinha is provided with the bulk of the smart dialogues which he does justice to. But the show is stolen by badman Abhimanyu Singh who gets lots of screen presence and intrigues some real fear in this otherwise hypedtobe violent movie. Almost all the violence is left to him alone and will be missed in the 2nd part. Radhika Apte and Subroto Sen deserve mention for their expressive characterization! The kind of violence didn't intrigue the nausea I had prepared forprepared for a lot but it's the music and voiceover which does the job instead! The Telegu version I guess is a better watch with a more suiting screenplay and better dialoguesdon't know about the voiceover?Better can be expected of the 2nd part.".

Khoon!!! woah! that sounds like a 70's and 80's Hindi film  wherein a servant comes to the room and sees his Memsahab murdered with a knife and half a liter of blood on her.. But here its tons and tons of Blood splashed everywhere! And RGV calls this 'Bloody' film of his  RAKHTA CHARITRA!Its Gang War in Telugu Desam! Reality Screams on Screen! Indian cinema's infant terrible may just have peaked in his perennial quest to portray the worst in man. The real rivalry between the Andhra Pradesh gangsters Paritala Ravi and Madela Cheruvu Suri is brought with blood galore on the rusty regions of Anandpur to Celluloid. Its Ravi's journey from a softspoken man to a junglebound rebel bent on avenging the deaths of his father and brother. And the revenge from both the parties is also politically captured by Shivaji Rao a take off character from the politician NTR. And what's more its Blood some more! The film has an Interval and another long Interval for a period of 3 weeks before you get to see the continuation of the Bloody Film! Rakta Charitra Part II to HIT the screens on November 19th.Now I mentioned HIT the screens. Because its for sure that the film is a HIT. This film is technically brilliant with the Script Screenplay and the Background score. Direction of RGV with his camera moments doing the magic its the acting capabilities of Vivek Oberoi and Abhimanyu Singh that gets lots of applauds and could be in the nomination lists of awards too! Shot Gun is impressive as a Politician and his get up is brilliant! Radhika Apte gets little scope and she gets attention! Hey did you ask for Surya the Tamil actor? Wait..N Watch for his performance will be highlighted in the II series. And the Kannada actor Sudeep gets No Phoonk this time! He looks more or less like an Extra in the film.But Yes.. This film is definitely not for the Classes. But for the Masses. And for the Gory and Strong Hearted Ruthless and Stone Hearted Masses as they would love to see the killings murders torture and cruelty on screen. I guess RGV was a 'Butcher' in his previous birth as he gets his actors enact the brutal killings that a Butcher does with his animal in the slaughter market! Men being hacked to death maimed by bloodied sickles bodies hammered with bullets body parts strewn around. And this film is strictly avoidable to the Ladies and Children. Meant only for ADULTS and MEN only! Now that is something a PORN film can be! With so much PAIN and CHARITRAHEEN as women are assaulted and raped in broad daylight. It can be a Ooh Aah and more 'Ouch' for everyone watching this PAINFUL film!".

	schema:reviewBody "After an impressive yet underrated 'Rann' Ram Gopal Verma is back again with 'Rakhta Charitra'. Having heard that it was based on the rivalry between Paritala Ravindra and Maddela Cheruvu Suryanarayana and given that the director has a knack for crime films examples include classics like 'Satya' and 'Company' expectations were reasonably high. While 'Rakhta Charitra' does not overall disappoint it could have been better.The film is stylishly shot. However there were a few instances when I felt the camerawork was too erratic. We know how Verma loves his camera but sometimes he needs to take it easy. The background score too should have been toned down in a few sequences because it brings a melodramatic feel. Ram Gopal Verma's voiceover is quite terrible. While his voice does add some irony to the story he should have left the task to someone else. There is one song which should have been better left out.The scenes of violence are wellexecuted but sometimes it appears as though they overshadow the story. Verma could have developed the story a little more and added a little more personal moments between or within the characters in order to involve the viewer. There are a couple of scenes that are overdone and unintentionally funny but otherwise the atmosphere and tension is well contained.The casting is excellent. Vivek Oberoi effortlessly pulls off the role of Ravi Pratap. Of course he's played similar characters earlier in 'Company' and 'Shootout at Lokhandwala' and here he does nothing short of a great job. Abhimanyu Singh is equally good as the ruthless menacing Bukka. It's good to see Shatrughan Sinha back in films this time as the fiery Sivaji Rao. The supporting cast that includes Zarina Wahab Radhika Apte Sushmita Mukherjee Sushant Singh Ashish Vidyarthi and Ashwini Kalsekar is superb.Even though 'Rakhta Charitra' may not be up there with Verma's earlier films like 'Company' or 'Satya' it is an interesting film that is gripping and wellpaced. It's good to see Verma going stronger after 'Rann' and hope he keeps up and offers good cinema. I look forward to the sequel.".

Sadly this film is not really in its league despite a bigger budget and more ground coverage. The main problem is that the authors clearly love the original and this leaves so much of what happens as a question mark to the new viewer. Characters are thrown in from nowhere and Carters involvement with his bosses' girl is almost in another movie. Micheal Caine's small role as a barman is funny in that he was the original Jack Carter here reprised by Sly Stallone.While quick to admit this is mediocre stuff you have to say that you get your share of car chases well done too fights creeps sleaze family bonding shoot outs and even the odd bit of light humour. The fight between Stallone and Mickey Rouke here playing a buisnessmanstrokecreep for example.This film features interesting cinematography with strange forward jump cuts ripped off from The Limey odd angles and the use of colour filters. In short the producers trying to make more out of the material than is in the script. The choice of a wet Seattle is also curious and different. Presumably the nearest to NewcastleUponTyne the setting of the original that the producers could think of. So it is only an average product but will see much worse than this in our lifetime and it does move along at a fair and steady clip. People are getting to knock Stallone for being Stallone but he doesn't do bad a job here a stonefaced enforcer that is prepared to shed a tear when needs be! Not great acting but he looks the part.Don't be put off by the low IMDB ratings plenty of worthy films are two or three points higher but are far more boring. Popcorn fodder it may be but I thought it was worth seeing through and even declared myself modestly entertained at the end of it. Not as good as the original but not a lot is.Footnote This is actually not the first remake of Get Carter. A blackspolitation version was made in the 1970's called Hitman.".

	schema:reviewBody "The central figure of this film Jack Carter is a Las Vegas gangster who returns to his roots in Seattle following the death of his brother. This was officially reported as an accident but Jack suspects that his brother may have been murdered by members of the local criminal underworld. The film charts Jack's attempts to find out the truth and to take revenge.This is of course a good example of Hollywood's cannibalising of the British and European film industries in its endless search for a good story. It is a remake of Mike Hodges's classic from 1971 one of the few great British gangster films. That film was one that grew out of and yet at the same time transcended a particular place and time the NorthEast of England in the early seventies. This was a time of rapid social change in Britain marked by increasing social mobility growing permissiveness and relative prosperity elements all reflected in the film. Like many of the best British films it had a strong sense of place. Its fidelity to a real time and place was not a weakness but a strength helping to establish it firmly in the realm of reality and to convey its major theme the sterility and futility of the criminal lifestyle. Its view of the underworld acted as a necessary antidote to the tendency very prevalent in the late sixties and early seventies to glamorise criminals The Thomas Crown Affair sentimentalise them The Italian Job or mythologise them The Godfather.Stephen Kay's film attempts to establish a similar sense of place to the original the Seattle we see has a bleak forbidding atmosphere always shrouded in rain or mist. It has a much more starstudded cast than the original with at least one reasonably good performance from a convincingly thuggish Mickey Rourke. Despite this however it is a far inferior film when compared with the original. The main reason is the way in which the character of Jack Carter has been changed. Michael Caine's Carter was for all his sharp suits and fast cars no more than a ruthless street thug a poor boy made bad at a time when other poor boys were making good. Sylvester Stallone's character by contrast may have a rough exterior Stallone plays him as outwardly impassive with a gruff emotionless voice but beneath it he is one of the good guys. The plot has been rewritten to make Carter less brutal and ruthless and to allow him to survive at the end. The original was a morality play on as another reviewer has pointed out the theme of those who live by the sword shall die by the sword. The remake is simply a revenge thriller with a hero whom the audience can root for.This illustrates one of the perils of the remake. Kay's film has kept the title the bare outlines of the plot and even some of the names of the characters but completely fails to capture the spirit of the original. Moreover it is unable to replace that spirit with anything new. If the filmmakers had wanted to make an exciting goodieversusbaddies revenge thriller they could have chosen a better startingpoint than the plot of a film made some thirty years earlier with a very different aim in mind.It has become something of a tradition for remakes to feature cameo appearances by the stars of the original films. Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear for example featured no fewer than three actors who had appeared in the earlier J. Lee Thompson version Gregory Peck Robert Mitchum and Martin Balsam. That however was a rare example of a remake that we as good as or even better than the original. Kay's Get Carter however is not in the same class as Hodges's. It was therefore rather disappointing to see Michael Caine appearing in a remake that can only diminish one of his best films. 410".

Did anyone notice that the guys sent from Vegas came in a Jaguar?  I assumed that Seattle was a good US version of Newcastle northern wet and gloomy.Unfortunately as the film progressed it became obvious that this was not in the same class as the original.In fairness there was some good acting from Stallone and Rourke and the action sequences were wellhandled and stylish particularly the car chase. Unfortunately that wasn't enough to save the film.  The problem was that no matter how hard I tried I couldn't help comparing it to the 1971 version.In the original Carter is cold and calculating beyond anything we have seen before to the point of being irredeemable and it was this facet that shocked audiences then and still does.  He only shows emotion once when he sees the 'blue' film but this only stirs him into violence rather than reason.  He kills without compunction everyone he feels responsible for his family's fate and those he can't kill he leaves open to the authorities.  He is the ultimate 'hard man' and when he says 'with me it's a full time job' you know he means it.Stallone's Carter should be in group therapy by comparison.  He comes across as actually quite weak by the end of the film.  In the original we never know for sure that Doreen is his daughter rather than niece but it is signposted.  In the Hollywood version it is made explicit and the story loses a lot of impact replaced by some sort of fatherdaughter bonding that is out of touch with Carter's character.BIG SPOILER  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.The ending really put the cap on things.  For those of you still reading this who have not seen the original you have been warned Carter is shot dead by a hit man after killing Paice.  The irony is that Kinnear has ordered this not knowing that he is about to be arrested by the vice squad for peddling underage pornography.  All of this is lost in the remake as Stallone's Jack Carter drives off into the sunset presumably redeemed by his experiences.And with that a classic is reduced to a good but not great thriller.".

	schema:reviewBody "By far the most entertaining moment on the DVD of Get Carter is the hilariously outdated 1971 theatrical preview for the original version of the film which starred Michael Caine. Caine does appear in this Stallone update. Sadly this update stinks. Sylvester Stallone's Jack Carter a Las Vegas button man skips town without his boss's permission and heads up to his old stomping grounds in Seattle to investigate the mysterious death of his brother whom he hasn't seen in five years. That's the pitch.The action is surprisingly restrained and impressionistic. For example when one of the minor bad guys gets killed we see the result of a headlong plunge but not the actual slaying. But this kind of restraint doesn't dovetail with the promise of the previews an asskicking Stallone in a Rat Pack suit. The director tries to gloss over the many plot holes with slick fauxFincher cuts and zooms but he's just covering.Here's the tragedy. Actionthrillers don't require good acting but they sure are enhanced by it. Most of the actors in Get Carter have the ability to far outshine this genre much the way the actors in 1998's Ronin didwithin the context of the plot the cast of Ronin delivered their lines with utter conviction.Not necessarily so here. Those stars in Get Carter who have real talent weren't used enough and those who don't have the strongest dramatic chops were given boatloads of screen time. Sly is wooden at times as per usual but has some fine moments.Miranda Richardson as Carter's widowed sisterinlaw is solid but underutilized. Mickey Rourke as an internet porn purveyor has obviously been working out some more but it's still apparent that he peaked in Diner. The big surprise was just how much actual characterization they allowed Rachael Leigh Cookas Carter's bereaved nieceto show off. Any one of these actors given enough onscreen opportunity might have saved Get Carter from its ridiculous plot holes and incongruities. But they didn't. Do yourself a favor avoid this film.".

Jack Carter's brother Richie dies under mysterious circumstances. Jack goes back to his home town to check things out and perhaps find out the truth. What he finds is not all that easy to get to grips with.This is not your usual run of the mill revenge movie. The story has some layers to it and I am surprised to see that people did not appreciate that. Jack Carter is not a good guy. He is a bad man working in bad town doing bad things. Always was a bad guy. But he reaches a moment in his life when the things that take place  between him and his boss's girl Audrey the things that he finds out about his brother and his brother's family all of them act as a catalyst. For once in his life he tries to set things right. How does he do that? By doing what he knows to do. He does bad things. The guys he goes up against are a little a out of the reach of the law. To wait for justice to set things right is not a concept Jack is familiar with. The only things he knows is to take care of his own dirty laundry. And at the moment his life is his dirty laundry. He was not there for his brother for his niece and he missed some oportunities... Time to set things right. But he does only bad things in this movie. He kills people by shooting them by throwing them out of the balcony by beating them up in the elevator. WHY? Because these are the same things that would happen to him if he let his guard down.Great acting performances form most guys in the movie. Stallone seems to have found some serious acting genes within himself. This is some of his best work and his best is very good. Not only for the genre. Although when looking back at Oscar his 1991 comedy DTox a very underrated movie and Copland I have to say that this is not a one off. No sir. When the script the director and the rest of the cast are good he can act big time. Michael Caine made a very good movie called get Carter back in 1971. I love that movie and is always one of my favorites to watch on Turner Classic Movies. The remake I felt is just as good. Sure it has the sort of usual happy ending but that is just the American Way of ending action movies. They love a hero. Mickey Rourke Alan Cummings Michael Caine and Rachael LeighCook are very good in this one. Somehow Miranda Richardson seemed a little over the top in her angry widowmother scenes.Michael Caine acted in this one simply because he knew it was good. The movie could have been done without him without a doubt. But he did it because unlike other remakes this one is just as good as the original. It has it's own style a somewhat different story and a happier ending. Otherwise they are two very similar movies. And even if some consider the original as better they should not write this one off. The layers are there you just have to dig. And this only because the producers did not get this movie. The director the cast everybody got this movie and knew what they were making except for the producers who seem to have been thinking of another movie. Michael Caine seems to have given his seal off approval to Stallone's acting in this one. The producers wanted a classic 80's action movie. At least that's what I feel. So this is a very good movie. Just as good or almost as good depending on how you look at it as the original. It has great acting sharp directing nice car chase scenes nice action scenes some great moments some wonderful music a simple yet effective storyline that keeps you guessing and wanting to see more. And as someone put it crap like XXX The Fast and The Furious sequel at least is has some cars Charlie's Angels sequel. could not even watch and other such teenhormoneslangflashdriven movies have a higher rating IT SIMPLY ISN'T RIGHT!!!!!! 7.510".

The updated film has added the blood gore and nonstop drama which is common with newer versions. The story remains the same in that Carter Stallone learns his younger brother died under suspicious circumstances and he is determined to learn why. Along the way he is met with business types who are not interested in helping Carter find the truth. To that end John C. McGinley Mickey Rourke and even Michael Caine get in the action.

	schema:reviewBody "Oh yes he's heavy and he ain't got a brother anymore. I saw this in 2000 in THX Dolby  I was engulfed from the moment it came onto the screen!! that is probably the best way to view this on a huge screen with a kickin' surround sound system in the dark! Undistracted of course.For one the story fit him the scenery taking place up in Seattle was a smart departure from some of the other movies he's made. A different town than Vegas and L.A. for a loneshark heavy who is looking to settle a major score. Stallone is a marvel in this picture  for me anyway  I don't mind if some others would not agree on that. The music scoring from Mr. Bates was authentic in that it captured the film's situations movement and the places that the story took course. From the train itself to the rainy weather and the cemetery etc. I was so into this story and the fact that the music was right on the money that it literally mesmerized as I watched everything take place! A day of reckoning for Jack in regard to his brother's untimely death. Actually in this story as Jack catches up to an old acquaintance Rourke who is very stubborn and truly as strong as a bull a real fighter. Mickey Rourke I believe was at his apex in looks and ability for this. He seems so different now a days.Michael Caine plays a seedy character looking somewhat financially made but washed out as a man standing against Jack he was perfect for the part as well. He dresses impeccably well and yet he will bust heads in order to get his business done. I thoroughly enjoyed the performances the rainy weather music score and the scenery that Stephen Kay put together for Get Carter The Truth Hurts .I felt again as if the studio tampered with the ending and it did not stay true to the story thats why I rate it a 9 not a ten. Even so... I would say it is worth the time of the die hard Stallone fans to see this even for those lovers of drama and revenge stories. Recommended ".

An acceptable noir film produced by actor Andrew Stevens  Elie Samaha and professionally directed by Stephen Kay Boogeyman  The last time I committed suicide though with no originality . An extremely tough movie burdened by cruel murders and seedy characters  based on a novel titled 'Get Carter' by Ted Lewis from 1970 . This brutal  austere crimethriller focuses a cheerless enforcer Jack Carter hardworking star Sylvester Stallone  a tough  amoral gangster who works as a killer in Los Angeles . Passable Sylvester Stallone in the title role  but inferior to Michael Caine he played Jack Carter in the original here playing a secondary role as Cliff Brumby his character was only in one scene in the original cut but test audiences said they liked him and they transformed the movie to have Caine as the bad guy . Here Stallone is a hitman who returns home to investigate his brother's death by some mobsters .As he decides to travel his natal Seattle to investigate who is responsible  Jack contends enemies  but he stands a head above fellow hoods  but not apart from them . Twofisted Jack in order to revenge his sibling  vows vengeance and spontaneously meets sleazy characters bad ass Mickey Rourke and nasty computer magnate Alan Cummings in the middle of sinister bands war and running afoul into underworld . When his brother dies under mysterious circumstances in a car accident  gangster Jack Carter travels to Seattle to investigate and reunites his widow Miranda Richardson and niece Rachael Leigh Cook and he subsequently meets ominous characters who may have been involved . Carter aware the murder of his brother at the hands of a gang opponent led by a mobster . We see as his facade of sophisticated and elegant mob gentleman with exquisite manners  educated pose  and expensive costumes  begins collapsing  leaving see the lascivious malleability and a cold killer . Carter starts moving in this ambient but all of this ends in a shocking discovery delivered by a compact disc which greatly angers Carter . This triggers a wave of violence that sweeps the the underworld lumpen in Seattle . Carter keeps the things moving along until ending vendetta. The end of the film is like a summary of the entire story for the scenarios that uses austere bleak and cold environment .This interesting film features thrills  wellstaged car chases  raw energy  adult subject matter  clunking cruelty surrounding  lots of violence and enlivened by highpowered performances . Plenty of intrigue atmospheric music noisy action and grisly killings until impressive finale vengeance . It is a very violent film  depressing charismatic  magnificently set  but always strong  with a perfect abstraction of a climate of moral misery to game with a colorful photography by magnificent cameraman Mario Fiore . Adequate and moving musical score by Tyler Bates with a rare mixture . The picture obtained moderated Box office  there were plans to do a sequel which never materialized .The main differences between the classic version and this recently made story are the following  The British 1971 bruising film GET CARTER far superior to remake  is an original movie with abundant nudism  kinky sex  excessively violent and set in Newcastle  a city in northern England portrayed as a cool place  foggy  sordid  rainy  dirty  gray and industrial aspect  shabby environment and ramshackle scenarios  full of sad pubs  buildings almost in ruins  piers of black water and ravaged aspect postindustrial  while this remake 2000  viewed as an act of sacrilege in Britain  was set in rainlashed Seattle  a bustling city full of light and luxurious pubs and glamorous nightclubs .

The Picturization of Various locations in Rajasthan are beautiful. Songs didn't reach audience but the background Score and title music is very good. The way Mahesh delivered dialogues is Humorous and entertaining. Though the story line in the second half touches the spiritual matters It is Interesting and bagged the positive responseThough the initial talk about movie is somewhat negative i have no doubt that it will slowly pick up the Hit talk.".

My guess is keeping all these kind of things in mind Trivikram tried to reach the audience in a lighter manner with a decent message so audience say its not up to expectations.

He is simply superb in mouthing the dialogues penned by Trivikram. He is also exceptionally good in the action episodes and of course acting. You can see the hard work he has put in for this movie on the screen. He changes his body language for this movie. His costumes are cool and he used scarf throughout the movie and it helped in Mahesh Babu look different. Mahesh Babu shed a lot of weight and looks extremely handsome in the movie. Anushka is good in the movie as an 'iron leg' lady. She has put on a little bit of weight compared to her recent outings. Prakash Raj is good as villain but has a limited screentime and has a conflict with hero only during the climax. Subbaraju is nice. Rao Ramesh is very good in a new getup of a soothsayer and performed well with a controlled modulation. Shafi is fine. Tanikella Bharani Dharmavarapu and Raghu Babu are adequate. Brahmanandam Sunil and Ali entertain. MS Narayana is wasted. Archana did a small role. I fail to understand why Kota Srinivas played such minuscule role. Khaleja movie has a divine element in it. Trivikram tried to balance the divine part of it by saying that there is a God in everybody and all we need is an intent to serve others. The aspect of killing village men by mixing toxins in water seem to have resemblance to that of Sahara 2005 movie. The entire first half of the movie is like a roadfilm where the hero and heroine bond with each other while traveling. The second half sports the main story of the movie. Trivikram is a terrific dialogue writer and he gave his best dialogues to Mahesh Babu in Khaleja. Trivikram has a class taste while conceiving comedy episodes and he made sure that there are many episodes of such nature in the movie. Direction of the film is good in parts and screenplay should have been more effective. The beginning point and interval bang are good. Trivikram couldn't justify the second half with right content and tone. Trivikram should have ironed the script better and made it conciseeffective. The unbreakable glass episode of the movie seems to have been inspired by Sabrina 1955 movie especially lady secretaries dancing on the glass to test strength. Dialogues by Trivikram are huge asset to the movie. Music by Mani Sharma is good in three songs Sadasiva Taxi and Piliche. Though Yash Bhatt is the official cinematographer parts of the movie were also shot by KV Guhan Athadu and Sunil Patel Hum Tum. Cinematography is very good and there is a visual theme for the movie. Fights by Peter Heins and Ram Lakshman are excellent. First half of the movie is entertaining though there is no story in it. Second half should have been better. Climax disappoints. Plus points of the movie are Mahesh Babu terrific dialogue comedy and superb characterization and Trivikram brand entertainment. On the flipside the second half plays a spoilsport and movie lacks consistent tone.".

	schema:headline " A Decent Entertainer";
	schema:reviewBody "A happy go lucky taxi driver turns into a good samaritan becoming the saviour of a downtrodden remote village. The plot of Khaleja has nothing new to offer except that Trivikram adds a supernatural tinge to the hackneyed storyline. But barring a few boring moments Khaleja never loses its steam and entertains all the way! Trivikram is a master in giving classy and engrossing look to his movies and Khaleja is no different. Whole movie has a 'desert' visual theme as background and sequences in rajasthan and the barren village are visually nothing short of awesome  credit goes to the brilliant cinematography! . Most of Mahesh's previous successful movies relied a lot on his characterization. Trivikram earns brownie points in this aspect with strong characterization of hero but failed in convincingly developing other characters including heroine! Trivikram is synonymous with his simple yet impactful dialogue writing and he is at his best in Khaleja.He used godavari dialect for hero and it works perfect in making otherwise simple scenes a delight to watch! Action episodes are well choreographed with Manisarma's impeccable background score adding that much needed extra zing.The 'supernatural' element adds impact to the action scenes but thankfully it is not overdone. Songs remain a sore point barring 'sada siva' and to some extent 'piliche' there is nothing much to rave about. Song picturization was alright but I expected a lot more from 'sada siva' song. Its Mahesh's show all the way and he carried his role with aplomb relying heavily on his comedy timing and dialogue delivery. He never looked more handsome  lost quite a few kgs since Athithi  and his costume styling was done with a great taste. All in all he delivers a brilliant overall performance after 3 year hiatus. Anushka's role is limited to being a centre point for majority of comedy episodes and doesn't get much scope.Other actors are nothing to write about with Prakash raj Sunil Ali and co.essaying their usual clichd roles. The actor doing sadhu role is goodespecially in the closing scene. Although lacking a strong storyline Khaleja is an entertaining film with good comedy and exhilarating action sequences.".

	onyx:emotionText "A happy go lucky taxi driver turns into a good samaritan becoming the saviour of a downtrodden remote village. The plot of Khaleja has nothing new to offer except that Trivikram adds a supernatural tinge to the hackneyed storyline. But barring a few boring moments Khaleja never loses its steam and entertains all the way! Trivikram is a master in giving classy and engrossing look to his movies and Khaleja is no different. Whole movie has a 'desert' visual theme as background and sequences in rajasthan and the barren village are visually nothing short of awesome  credit goes to the brilliant cinematography! . Most of Mahesh's previous successful movies relied a lot on his characterization. Trivikram earns brownie points in this aspect with strong characterization of hero but failed in convincingly developing other characters including heroine! Trivikram is synonymous with his simple yet impactful dialogue writing and he is at his best in Khaleja.He used godavari dialect for hero and it works perfect in making otherwise simple scenes a delight to watch! Action episodes are well choreographed with Manisarma's impeccable background score adding that much needed extra zing.The 'supernatural' element adds impact to the action scenes but thankfully it is not overdone. Songs remain a sore point barring 'sada siva' and to some extent 'piliche' there is nothing much to rave about. Song picturization was alright but I expected a lot more from 'sada siva' song. Its Mahesh's show all the way and he carried his role with aplomb relying heavily on his comedy timing and dialogue delivery. He never looked more handsome  lost quite a few kgs since Athithi  and his costume styling was done with a great taste. All in all he delivers a brilliant overall performance after 3 year hiatus. Anushka's role is limited to being a centre point for majority of comedy episodes and doesn't get much scope.Other actors are nothing to write about with Prakash raj Sunil Ali and co.essaying their usual clichd roles. The actor doing sadhu role is goodespecially in the closing scene. Although lacking a strong storyline Khaleja is an entertaining film with good comedy and exhilarating action sequences.";

	schema:reviewBody "I have just watched Khaleja after months of its original release. Director Trivikram Srinivas joined hands with Mahesh Babu again after the success of Athadu in 2005 and this time they came out with another commercial entertainer. Part of the storyline i.e. people dying mysteriously in a village is similar to the Hollywood film Sahara but it has been packaged in a way that it will be an entertaining commercial flick.Mahesh Babu has done a apt job for his role as Raju. He looks perfect in every situation be it a comical or a serious situation. His body language is excellent. Anushka performed well alongside Mahesh.Prakashraj as the villain has done a decent job and I feel Subbaraju been under utilized in this film.Manisharama's music is good especially Makathika Maya and Boom Shakanaka. BGM is apt for the scenes. The songs are well choreographed especially Sada Shiva is well done.Cinematography by Yash Bhatt and Sunil Patel is good. Action choreography by Peter Hein and RamLaxman deserves a mention although there are some physics defying stunts. Sreekar Prasad's editing is crisp although part of the second half could have been cut short.In a nutshell Khaleja is the usual commercial stuff packed with action romance and comedy but for variety it's laced with environmental issues and a bit of religious beliefs.".

	schema:reviewBody "I firstly must admit that I've never liked Mahesh's acting until this movie and after watching this I can't deny the fact that he is the best entertaining actorI still doubt his movies selection though in Tollywood.The combination of Trivikram and Mahesh is always a highexpectation movieafter their Athaduone of the evergreen movies of Telugu film history and they were able to reach up to the expectations I have to say. Most of the audience might not feel the same because they might not like the idea of a human being treated as GOD they might take it as an exaggeration but in the final moments of the movie Trivikram through the dialogs of Ramesh Rao explains why he chose the character to be considered as GODwhich unfortunately most of the audience do not give a damn about. But for serious movie lovers this is a treat to watch.Mahesh after a long timeor I must say for the very first timeproved himself as an actor. After his last movies Sainikudu Athidhi I just felt that the serious look on his face got glued to his acting. But in this movieBoy did he act...He was simply awesome...Everything about him in this movie was nothing short of PERFECT.Its true that Anushka's role was just like any other Telugu heroine's role in the moviesjust for the purpose of filling in the Songs. But she has done well for her character.Ali Brahmi and the Sunil trio have tried their very best to lead the comedy but its the show stopper Maheshas one of the dialog in the movie saysIf any one is to do comedy here that would be methat rocks the screen with both his comedy and the newly adapted Dialog delivery style which aptly suited for this character.All the other characters were goodShafi Prakash Raj has done justice for their roles.Finally to say about TRIVIKRAM It would be apt to say that he is one of the few THINKING directors in Tollywood today. He has put in a lot of effort both with his dialogs and his direction which has ultimately paid off in making this excellent movie.For the audience this movie if watched with out any expectations and preconceived notions you'll have your heart in your stomach because that's the amount of entertainment this movie has. I'll give this a 710 as it is not definitely for all genres of movie watchers but surely a very good movie to enjoy upon.".

Uninteresting story OK acting below average music and good camera work and occasionally enjoyable comedy. And the movie gives you a feel that it is 500 hours long. First half drags a lot. Second half drags even more thus making the movie seriously bad and boring.Movie starts with few sages building hype about the hero. Then it shifts to a fight which is fought for a jug of water in the desert. There hero meets the 1st comedian and narrates him about the heroine and his story of coming to the desert. Heroine always brings bad luck to the hero. We3ll this looks to be quite interesting but there is nothing more than a bit of curious scenes. Then as the flash back finishes the heroine's dad fixes her marriage with the villain's son. Son takes her to a desert for a so called romantic dinner but accidentally reveals that his intentions are to have sex with her. She runs away and meets the hero again. This leads to few comical scenes which are really enjoyable. First half ends when the hero surviving a stab wound bashes an unknown gang with superhero powers and he meets the guy who roams around the country in search of the hero who he considers as god! Second half begins with the guy curing the hero along with his guru. Then hero gets back to normality and realizes he is a village where everyone considers him as god. Then from nowhere a medical camp is set up in the village. Villain obstructs it. Then why the villain stops him and what happens next forms the rest of the story.Thus this movie is clearly a disappointment and a negative step for mahesh's career.".

The main credit is to director.He proves his excellence but turning every scene into a comedy which keeps us interesting till the end without any bore.

	schema:reviewBody "G. Seetharama Raju shortly called as Raju Mahesh Babu is in Rajasthan searching for a desert village called Girdalpur where in he needs to handover an Insurance check of Rs. 5 Lakhs to the family of Dilawar Singh who was killed by some unknown gang along with a Geology Professor Paranje when both were traveling as passengers in the taxi of Raju. During this hunt for the village Raju meets his old friend cum love interest Subhasini Anushka who is struck up in this desert by a trap of industrialist GK Prakash Raj's son Amit. Subhasini is the daughter of one more industrialist DP Tanikella Bharani who is to get into a one Lakh Crore business contract with GK.When both of them are to reach the village all of the sudden goons attack and try to kill Raju but saved by Siddha Shafi who is in search of a savior or god to save their village Pali in Andhra Pradesh which is attacked by a deadly disease due to contamination of water by industrial waste produced from a near by plastic factory which is owned by none other than GK. When Mahesh reach village Pali with the help of Siddha he was seen as a god Shiva by village head Rao Ramesh and villagers.From here on Raju starts finding out the reasons for the deaths in the village and some deadly reasons come into the fore which are related to Iridium mineral deposits available beneath the village which are eyed upon by GK. How did Raju save the village and its people? is what forms the climax.Values of the Movie Khaleja What makes 'Khaleja' different from Mahesh Babu's earlier movies is the way of Charcterization. Trivikram the gem of a director has attempted this project only with Mahesh Babu's image in view. Mahesh Babu looked handsome with shining face and trendy costumes with a changed body language and dialogue delivery. In action sequences he excelled more than the dances in songs. Mahesh's comic timing has been improved tremendously and the lighter mode of his typical mannerisms attracted vigils and claps. Anushka hasn't got a role to perform. She was just for the sake of songs as usual hot in looks with awesome body maintenance. Shafi has got a role of his life after 'Chatrapathi' and his dialogs were etched with power and emotion. Rao Ramesh has continued his role of 'Magadheera' and he was also okay. If Sunil and Ali shared the comedy part Prakash Raj was at his regular best as villain. Tanikella Bharani Brahmanandam Archana Kota were also okay.Story wise Trivikram has picked a line that was heard and seen many a times in South cinema. But he has come around a different way of projecting it on the screen and here is where Trivikram's extra ordinary script writing skills came into light. Characterization of Mahesh was never tried in Tollywood till now. Trivikram's major fort of dialogs aren't really top rate this time. Not more than three to four scenes Trivikram's pen has literally failed. Mani Sharmaa's music was just okay both back grouped and main score. Picturization of 'Sada Siva' was expected too much but ended to be moderate. Cinematography by Yash Bhatt was superb in dealing the Rajasthan scenes while Editing by Sreekar Prasad was too much cumbersome in second half. Production values of Singanamala Ramesh and C. Kalyan were also A class.Out of The Movie Khaleja The first question that teases your mind after watching 'Khaleja' is what it made Trivikram to take 3 years of time for completion of 'Khaleja'? Excpet Mahesh Babu's characterization we find nothing great from him. With villagers calling Mahesh as God and Mahesh skipping from his duties feared of calling himself as God requires enormous strength to make audience accept the fact that a man who helps the needful is always a God. This is where Trivikram's positive characterization has become confusing for audience. Audience are more taken by Shafi and Rao Ramesh's divine words rather than Mahesh's human powers as a God. Story wise the way Trivikram threaded the characters to catch up the links with passage of main story is a decent attempt. Major setback from Mani Sharmaa and weak Choreography by Ahmed Khan Raju Sundaram and Prem Rakshit haven't helped the movie. Yet Mahesh Babu takes you on a different track with his mannerisms and touch of class. Sunil and Ali helped him in first half while Shafi and Ali helped him in second half. Action sequences by Peter Haines and Ram Lakshman became overt in climax. Good comedy Mahesh's looks unveiling of story love track between lead pair and a bang interval make the first half. Second half is all about how Mahesh becomes a Godly Man for Pali villagers and the remaining story unfolds leading to a lengthy and exhaustive climax. Mahesh Babu's screen presence Anushka's hot looks Rao Ramesh and Shafi's important roles Trivikram's narration comedy in patches are positives for 'Khaleja' while Mani Sharmaa's music too many action episodes lengthy climax confusing GodMan concept heavy content serve too much negative for 'Khaleja.'Opening collections will obviously be scored high because of Mahesh Babu's presence but a long run for the movie is surely doubtful. All it depends upon how audience take up Mahesh Babu and Trivikram in second half.".

	schema:reviewBody "Mahesh Babu is back after a hiatus and the expectations have been high on this 'Khaleja'. Given the title controversy the mileage was sufficient.Story Sitarama Raju Mahesh is a taxi driver who comes to Rajasthan searching for a person's family. He chances upon Gemini TV person Sunil and reveals his story of coming there.This also includes his encounters with Subhashini Anushka whose presence brings in bad luck and loss. On the other hand there is Siddhappa Shafi who is sent by his guru Rao Ramesh in search of a god sent man who can protect the village from a death threat and extinction.One thing happens after the other and Sitarama Raju comes across Siddhappa who believes that Raju is the man. Meanwhile Subhashini's father Tanikella is planning to get her engaged to the son of GK Prakashraj who has got a motive behind it. How are all these people connected and what happens after that forms the rest of the story.Performances Mahesh Babu is a complete show stealer in the film. He is highly energetic and his dialogue delivery stands apart. Unlike his regular mild approach with one liners he rolls out flurry of words and entertains. As for his looks he is handsome as ever and has made his presence felt strongly.Anushka looks gorgeous and special focus has been made on her legs when it comes to dialogs. Her screen chemistry with Mahesh was neat and not much of a skin show from her this time.Prakashraj was brief and he did his bit as required. Perhaps the etching of his character should have been more powerful. That would have given strength to the villain image and good climax.The comedy track of Ali Sunil gave few laughs. Brahmi was funny at few places Tanikella was elegant Subbaraju made his presence felt Rao Ramesh was excellent Shafi was impressive Dharmavarapu and M S were brief. The others did their bit as required.Analysis One who lives for his own self is considered to be dead. One who lives for others with unselfishness and love live forever  Swami VivekanandaThis is the crux of the movie that knocks the doors of every heart.How GK Prakash Raj leads his life with selfishness and how he breathes his last with pain and grief. How the villager Sidhdhappa Shafi holds faith in God and dies a painless death with pride filled eyes. How Raju Mahesh manifests God in himself with unselfishness and true love for others. The above three aspects build the ulterior message in the film. There is a symbolic scene of man's connection with God which holds conviction. When our hero asks for Rs 10 for himself his wish will not be fulfilled. And when he asks the same Rs 10 with a wish to feed a hungry boy the donor gives him Rs 100 and goes. Only unselfishness can see the bountiful God. Mahesh Babu says in a dialogue here I understood God. He is not hiding anywhere. He is there in every heart. He fulfills wishes only when asked for the well being of others. What the hell Rs 100 when asked for Rs 10he will shower even lacks and cores. This message is packaged and delivered with all commercial elements.The interesting part of the film is that hero never fights for his selfish possessiveness on heroine. He never fights to gain supremacy on villains. He fights only for the lives of others. Hence he becomes God.But how Trivikram dealt his narration in bringing this story on to celluloid? How the aspects those really matter for the success of the movie are placed? The music is good but only 'sada Siva' is truly hitting the senses of audiences. That number takes position1 among all the songs. 'Makathika Maya..' is OK to some extent. The song on Lord Krishna sounds good. Others are mundane. Background score is average.First half is dealt with humor and the actual story starts only after 1 and half hours. Mahesh Babu made the movie hilarious with his typical dialogue delivery never seen before. Second half has some real material. Humor element continues here as well. But emotion elements are forced but not convincing enough. Trivikram seems to have inspired by 'Magadheera' with Rao Ramesh's part. Brahmanandam has got very small role. Sunil entertained very well. Anushka's ironbody characterization is also interesting.Coming to screenplay that is a bit complicated. Audiences find it a bit difficult to get connected. The introduction shot of Mahesh Babu is weak. The dialogs are good but here and there missed the grip and not up to the expectation. But on a whole the Trivikramfactor worked for this.To sign off watch the movie at your leisure get entertained and also try to take some message into your life that can bring in some change in you and society.BottomLine Watch it without expectations".

	schema:reviewBody "Surely one of the most entertaining movies of recent years.It began like this between me and Sunil the director of my first short film Babu KosamSunil  Have you seen Khaleja Me  No Sunil  See it its not understood by many but no other movie is so entertaining as this in last year or soThen I went and watched it online pirated version as its DVD was still unavailable when inquired in Music World store and since then this is the most watched Telugu cinema nearly 10 times in TV and online for me in last one year and each time I sit watching I just go till the end. Now what is it that makes it so entertaining it's nothing but dialogs of Trivikram and presentation of the same by Mahesh Babu. Trivikram has proved to be a master in dialog writing and I rate him as the current best Telugu writer after his earlier films like Manmadhudu Athadu etc... Mahesh Babu is a revelation as this is the first movie that he spoke so much in fact his earlier performances were limited dialog oriented ones while in this one he goes full throttle and makes it entertaining just by his presence and dialog delivery. There are for sure flaws in the movie presentation like to tell the whole concept just a simple scene is shown like God is there in every good heart and that makes the connection to the though difficult. Now the silliest thing is if the most powerful business man cannot evacuate a mere 534 people from a village then who else can. Yes barring this if we keep logic out this becomes an enjoyable ride.Dialog as I said earlier are its strong point and I wish this film became a big hit its mostly misinterpreted and Mahesh being portrayed as God while even in climax he repeats he is a mere Taxi Driver Should God come down to kill you I am Seetarama Raju Taxi Driver I am enough had this been understood and scenes have been cut down to focus on main plot line instead of subverting it with romance with heroine and all this was so very good and so very innovative. Songs except one are a big let down though the background score of Mani Sharma is done cinematography is just there and not so impressive and editing though done by Sreekar Prasad a renowned editor is not so great as it prolongs a few scenes. Having said all the above I would love to watch it again and again for Trivikram's Dialog and Mahesh's Dialog delivery. It's a rare 45 for a complete Telugu commercial cinema from me and I say Watch It please.".

Or both?Gorillas In The Mist is the story of this extraordinary woman whose work with Mountain Gorillas in Congo and subsequently Rwanda quite possibly saved these beautiful creatures from extinction.  Her hard work and determination in studying these wonderful animals led to an amazing living arrangement with them.How simply amazing must it be to touch play and hold hands with a silverback Gorilla in the wilds of Africa?  How would it feel to find that same silverback with his head hands and feet cut off by poachers? To be frank these gorillas were Dian Fossey's children  each had a name each had their own unique trait  so it is hardly surprising that she became a little possessive and started treating the animals as her own.  The horrors that she experienced on those mountains would send anyone mad.Sigourney Weaver is simply superb as Fossey portraying her hard work and gradual decline into insanity with that touch that only a few actresses possess.  Her chemistry with costar Bryan Brown adds to the feel of the film and the fact that she was brave enough to go anywhere near real gorillas is fascinating.  To be fair the two hours do drag a little but Weaver is talented enough to carry the film through it.Weaver once said I only get the parts that Meryl Streep passes up but to be honest I couldn't imagine this brilliant woman being played by anyone else but Sigourney.".

	schema:headline " Inspiring moving provoking and educational.";
	schema:reviewBody "Based on Dian Fossey's own autobiography this true life story is inspiring and has helped these amazing animals in many ways by waking us up to their plight. Originally Dian herself was helping to make the film until she was murdered and the production team had to go back and start it all over again several years later in 1988. I am aware she did complete a degree when she returned to the USA in 1980 and wrote her book which was published in 1983 and then revised in 1985. She returned to Africa in to help the gorillas and was murdered in 19841985 I believe near Christmas. She may have done things that weren't ethical according to some though her plight to save the gorilla came first. This movie does give a fairly accurate but slightly toned down version of the events which took place though there were a few changes in details. It would be impossible to fit 13 years of events into just over one and a half hours of footage. So I think Hollywood did a good job.The main alterations leaving out some of the details of horrific animal abuse that would have otherwise pushed the rating up to an R16 and probably left any animal lover in tears. The details they left out as well may have made the film a little to shocking for the chief censors.The special effects makeup I believe done by Rick Baker and real gorilla footage is seamless making it hard to tell which parts were real gorillas and which are very well created costumes.After purchasing the DVD I now realize they had Dian Fossey's original tracker with them to help with the film.All up I think this film gives us just enough drama action and thrills to make it a hit. I think Sigorney Weaver should have won an academy award for this especially considering how brave she was to film on location with real gorilla right next to her.This movie has inspired myself to change my career path and am also reading the book which I would recommend for anyone who wants to see how much more horrific the events were in reality.This movie is a must see who knows it may even change your life.".

	schema:reviewBody "Like most movie buffs I have seen Sigourney Weaver in a variety of roles and genres from Ghostbusters to Alien to A Map Of The World among others and yet I don't think I have ever seen her offer a better performance than in Gorillas In The Mist in which she plays fanatical gorilla researcher and protector Dian Fossey. Fossey's life  and ultimately her tragic and violent death  leaps out from the screen through Weaver as we watch her evolve from the uncertain and inexperienced assistant to the great anthropologist Louis Leakey to the committed expert on these marvelous creatures sometimes going over the top in her quest to save them. Be warned of some possible spoilers ahead.The movie is absolutely heartbreaking in places. The terrified mother gorilla trying to save her baby as the tree they've climbed is cut down by poachers Fossey's anguished cries of I'm sorry I'm sorry to the baby she nursed back to health only to have to turn her over to zookeepers the horrible death of Digit. I have to confess that each of these scenes brought a few tears to my eyes. And yet the basic gentleness and nobility of the gorilla is brought out as well and the movie ends on a sad yet hopeful note. Fossey is murdered  certainly by the poachers she opposed for years  but her body is buried beside her beloved Digit and the gorillas even Digit's group live on and increase in number.The movie contains strong supporting performances from Bryan Brown as National Geographic photographer Bob Campbell with whom Fossey falls in love but for whom she won't leave her gorillas from John Omirah Miluwi as Sembagare Fossey's gentle guide through the African jungles to Iain Cuthbertson who was perfectly believable as Louis Leakey.This is spectacular. From the photography to the acting to the reality behind the story. I honestly can't come up with a flaw.1010".

The performances are first class. Sigourney Weaver is able to project a certain self confidence in the character.The other thing I want to mention is the realism of the gorilla suits. It is hard to tell the difference between the real thing and the suits. It's of the utmost importance because we wouldn't want to be hampered by 'Planet of Apes' retreads.".

She's joined by a local guide Sembagare and a National Geographic photographer Bob Campbell Bryan Brown.It's a well biopic from director Michael Apted of an amazing woman and an amazing life. The performances are first class. Sigourney Weaver is able to project a certain self confidence in the character.The other thing I want to mention is the realism of the gorilla suits. It is hard to tell the difference between the real thing and the suits. It's of the utmost importance because we wouldn't want to be hampered by 'Planet of Apes' retreads.";

There isn't a great deal or depth or moralising here. Instead what you see is what you get  an interesting evocative and sometimes compelling story of mankind's relationship with nature.The film has strengths and weaknesses evenly distributed. Of course the gorillas are the real stars of the show here no disrespect to Sigourney Weaver turning in another Ripleyesque toughasnails performance and whenever they're on screen the film comes to life. The film isn't afraid to tug at the heartstrings when poachers come into the plot but that's fine by me.Where the film doesn't work is in its attempts at Hollywood convention. The real life of Dian Fossey  including her mysterious death  just doesn't tie up neatly into a package. Hence we get the shoehornedin romantic subplot involving an extraneous Bryan Brown. Nonetheless GORILLAS IN THE MIST is worth seeing and far more enlightening than most nature documentaries you see on TV any night of the week.".

I always want to help animals whenever I can so seeing how Fossey fought for the Gorillas sort of inspired me. It is very important to protect all of the endangered species of animals on the planet including the Gorilla.I must say that this film is very sad at parts.

They could have developed the stories tighter along this line.Acting is rather disappointing. I do not see the characters. I merely see those actresses. For example young Mo has same kind of temper as young Li as both are played by Zhang Ziyi and there is no slightest trace of young Mo Zhang Ziyi in the older Mo Joan Chen. In essence they just play themselves natively with a minimal level of pretension.Sets are very unsatisfactory either. Although the color scheme and photography is great and moody lots of dresses and pops used in the movie are out of their times. For example the bag Hua carries on her shoulder in the Rail Station when Zou Jie went to college probably did not appear until 90s'.

Yes the cinematography of the movie is alluring and the art direction decent but the movie story and editing do not strike one as particularly memorable. If you compare this film to that by Gu Changwei done one year later Peacock Jasmine Women would strike you as no more than a passable sophomore effort. The story lacks empathy and development plot or characterwise and Hou directs it like a cyclist on a relentless downhill race. The entire movie appears so rushed for time that none of the characters are decently developed and each scene lasts on the average two minutes. The men are cads or scumbags and the women are not very sympathetically portrayed either. One can say that Hou's film lost it when he casts character actors like Jiang Wen and Lou Ye as heartless spineless scums. Zhang Ziyi's characters appear unduly spoilt and stubborn whereas Joan Chen can't do very much with her dual roles as mothergrandmother.Which brings us to Zhang Ziyi who can be a very good actress yet seems to be badly directed here. She is asked to carry the whole film on her shoulders in three different roles yet she fails to do so.So what remains of Jasmine Women is a rather unmoving uninvolving spectacle of three women going through similar fates as jilted womenwomen who lose their husbands.".

	schema:reviewBody "Zhang Ziyi and Joan Chen give great performances in this unique film from China. It is about the struggles of three separate generations. Ziyi plays the younger roles of Mo during the thirties Young Li in the sixties and young Hua in the eighties. Joan Chen plays Mo's mother in the opening segment then plays the older Mo for the rest of the film. The two women play off of each other very well in this. They are conflicted and are at odds with each other but at the same time have a loving bond between them as a mother and daughter would have. The men in the film play the secondary roles roles very well. Wen Jiang plays the manipulative Mr. Meng who promises the Young Mo the idealistic lifestyle of becoming a famous movie star and having a wonderful life. He impregnates Mo and ends up showing his true colors when the Japanese invade during the beginning of World War 2. The first third of the movie ends with young Mo giving birth to her daughter Li. Li grows up and falls for Zou Jie played by Lu Yi. Zou Jie is a dyed in the wool Mao supporter. He hates the older Mo because of her love for the movies and worldly possessions. Mo warns Li that she will be miserable if she marries Zou Jie. Li's marriage is rocky until they move back in with Mo and decide to adopt a child and call her Hua. Li eventually loses her sanity and the marriage ends in a tragic way.Baby Hua grows up and is played by Ziyi as well. She is educated and she has been raised by her grandmother Mo. Hua secretly marries her boyfriend played by Ye Liu. Ye Liu is like a professional student who does not seem to have found a career path. Hua lives with Mo while he is away in college. Once again there are tragic consequences but with a twinge of upbeat courage honor and simply enduring hardship.Both Ziyi and Joan are tremendous. I think the film is a tribute to the strength of women. A woman's strength does not come so much from the physical strength although the Hua character shows some incredible physical strength at the end but more from the spiritual mental and emotional side. Excellent writing and direction as well. My only complaint was some of the sub titling could have been better.This is not an action movie no swords or people flying around it is a drama and a very good one. Ziyi has given great dramatic performances in 2046 The Road Home Purple Butterfly Memoirs of a Geisha and now Jasmine Women. She is one of my favorite actresses. Joan Chen really impressed me with her performance. She use to be in the television series Twin Peaks and she proves in this film she is a great actress also.".

	schema:headline " this film is working on a number of different levels";
	schema:reviewBody "Look deeper and you will find that this film is working on a number of different levels.The first level being the contrast of the personal versus the political public. As we follow each generation we see the relationship between the personal lives of these women and how they are impacted by the culturalpolitical events of the time. While the political events may occasionally seem tacked on the end result is a subtle analysis of the changing values of Chinese society over the course of fifty turbulent years.No political or social commentary would be complete without recognition of how such events impact women especially when they are taken as symbols of social stability itself. The state of women's lives is a direct reflection of the values which are being espoused by the larger society in which they live and breathe. Thus each generation of women in the film represent in their character the norms and standards of their time.The second level of the film looks at how gender relations have progressed or regressed and how gender relations are related to the evolution of a society. The third level of the film takes viewers through the complexities of motherdaughter relationships and how they can never be separated from society at large. Each motherdaughter relationship has its own life and we are shown how values pass and are altered from one generation to the next.The movie begins with a single mother with a strong noble and graceful personality whose past is not explained to us though we are led to believe it is unconventional and thereby shameful. Her daughter Mo then begins her own unconventional life with a short stint as an actress. The profession of acting is representative of how women of the time were merely viewed as flashy commodities without brains to be used or abused. And so we see Mo become entirely swept away by a fantasy life over which she has no control or more accurately where control never seems to enter awareness as a real possibility. Therefore it is unsurprising that until the end of her life Mo is unable to exercise any real will and is consistently the victim of circumstance and easily overpowered by others.In the next generation we see a willful daughter Li torn between the old China of her mother's generation and the new China of her lover's world during the Communist Revolution. Li is assertive capable but ultimately confused and unsure of what she wants until she is pushed to the edge. She ultimately succumbs to this unresolved tension which plays out through the development of her mental illness and ultimate disappearance.In the final chapter of the story we follow the next daughter Hua and her journey to resolve these historicalemotional conflicts. While the first few years of her life were spent happily in a relatively stable family after her father's suicide and her mother's disappearance she is raised by her grandmother Mo. This part of the story takes place in the 70s and 80s a time of great progress for women's rights and causes. Hua is an educated working girl quite plain and unassuming. She struggles trying to hold on to the role of a traditional wife not quite ready for the independence being pushed upon her by society. Her marriage is doomed merely by circumstance and naivet. She makes the most difficult decision of her life in keeping her child and becoming a single mother. Hua empowers herself by playing games with her soontobe exhusband and learning all she can about pregnancy and motherhood.The suffering and struggles of previous generations culminate in a rather unrealistic but highly symbolic birthing scene in which Hua gives birth to the next daughter. She decides to move away from the family residence and the camera pans slowly over the shiny new suburbia that China is quickly becoming. The final scene leaves us with Hua finally coming to terms with her past and herself. And so after much tribulation a new Woman and a new China is born hence the title literally translated as Jasmine Blossoms.The script sometimes long but engaging is carried quite capably by the principle actors. Sometimes the performances overshadow or distract from the message of the movie but good acting is good acting. Ultimately this is a film ambitious and carefully crafted about the evolution of today's China as embodied in the personal lives of these women who carry within them the collective values of their individual generations.".

	onyx:emotionText "Look deeper and you will find that this film is working on a number of different levels.The first level being the contrast of the personal versus the political public. As we follow each generation we see the relationship between the personal lives of these women and how they are impacted by the culturalpolitical events of the time. While the political events may occasionally seem tacked on the end result is a subtle analysis of the changing values of Chinese society over the course of fifty turbulent years.No political or social commentary would be complete without recognition of how such events impact women especially when they are taken as symbols of social stability itself. The state of women's lives is a direct reflection of the values which are being espoused by the larger society in which they live and breathe. Thus each generation of women in the film represent in their character the norms and standards of their time.The second level of the film looks at how gender relations have progressed or regressed and how gender relations are related to the evolution of a society. The third level of the film takes viewers through the complexities of motherdaughter relationships and how they can never be separated from society at large. Each motherdaughter relationship has its own life and we are shown how values pass and are altered from one generation to the next.The movie begins with a single mother with a strong noble and graceful personality whose past is not explained to us though we are led to believe it is unconventional and thereby shameful. Her daughter Mo then begins her own unconventional life with a short stint as an actress. The profession of acting is representative of how women of the time were merely viewed as flashy commodities without brains to be used or abused. And so we see Mo become entirely swept away by a fantasy life over which she has no control or more accurately where control never seems to enter awareness as a real possibility. Therefore it is unsurprising that until the end of her life Mo is unable to exercise any real will and is consistently the victim of circumstance and easily overpowered by others.In the next generation we see a willful daughter Li torn between the old China of her mother's generation and the new China of her lover's world during the Communist Revolution. Li is assertive capable but ultimately confused and unsure of what she wants until she is pushed to the edge. She ultimately succumbs to this unresolved tension which plays out through the development of her mental illness and ultimate disappearance.In the final chapter of the story we follow the next daughter Hua and her journey to resolve these historicalemotional conflicts.

	schema:reviewBody " The stories in the film are real and they are related with total sincerity. What worries me is that it is precisely a fear of reality and sincerity that has led to the ban on such stories being told.  Tian ZhuangzhuangThe Blue Kite a beautiful and courageous 1993 film by Tian Zhuangzhuang describes the ups and downs in the lives of a young Chinese family from the early 1950's through the Cultural Revolution of 1966. The film which has not been seen in China deals with the social upheavals caused by the Rectification Movement the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution three events in recent Chinese history whose effects for good or ill are still being debated. Narrated by their rambunctious young son Tietou Iron Horse this is a political film about ideological excess but it is also about the strength of family and the love of a mother for her son. Tietou played by three different actors Yi Tian Zhang Wenyao and Chen Xiaoman tells how the swirling tide of political events caused uncertainty and disillusionment among the villagers. Tietou's mother Shujuan brilliantly portrayed by Lu Liping is a tower of strength who must care for her son while coping with the sudden death of three husbands indirectly due to the political turmoil. As the film begins the drafting of citizens for manual labor is shown as part of the party's Rectification Movement publicized through the mass media as an effort to remove bourgeois influences from professional workers. Shujuan's first husband Shaolong Pu Quanxin falls out of favor with the Rectification Committee for his views and because he has to go to the bathroom at an inopportune time. He is sent to a labor camp where he is accidentally killed by a falling tree. Her second husband Uncle Li Xuejian Li dies of liver disease after confessing his role in reporting Shaolong and sending him to the labor camp. Shujuan then accepts marriage from a quiet intellectual named Lao Wu Baochang Guo. During this time 196669 high school students known as the Red Guard or hong wei bing militants were organized to promote revolutionary enthusiasm and political purity by turning against outdated values taught by the teachers in their schools. They soon spread from the classrooms and became roving gangs closing shops and schools and parading errant professors through the streets. Tian depicts the excesses of the Red Guard in bullying and beating those whom they deemed to lack political purity. For example Lao is denounced as reactionary by the Cultural Revolution and is arrested and beaten by Red Guards. Some claim that actual physical violence never occurred during this period. What is certain however is that the campaign led to the emergence of factions that believed they had the right to impose their beliefs on others.The Blue Kite is a powerful and involving film that says much about how ideological selfrighteousness can undermine the things that are most precious  a mother's love for her son the strength and resilience of the family and the right to speak our minds without fear of repression. The enduring values represented by the symbol of the blue kite are contrasted with the red banners and their changing political message. When the kite is caught in a tree Tietou's father promises him  I can make another for you by the end Tietou makes a similar promise to a small child. And so it goes.".

The counterrevolutions that followed the ascendancy of the Chinese Communist government were brutal and senselessdestructive just for the sake of being destructive. So naturally this isn't a feel good movie. I liked how honest the movie was in giving a no holds barred look at this period of timestretching from about 1953 to 1968.The negatives about the movie really depend on your frame of reference. For the Chinese audience much of what was occurring on screen would be easy to follow and keeping track of who is who isn't a problem. However for Western audiences this can be quite a chore. I had an easier time than most because I am a history teacher and was acquainted with what was occurringbut the average viewer will most likely get lost from time to time. And unfortunately MOST Chinese haven't even gotten the chance to view it as it was banned by their government when it premiered in the early 1990s! So apart from those Chinese people living in Taiwan or elsewhere abroad the audience may be rather limited. Because of this I would love to see the movie along with a documentary explaining the time and eventsespecially because ignorance about this traumatic time is partly due to the Chinese government's attempts in the past to hide the counterrevolution's excesses.FYIalthough NOT made clear in the movie the scene where the people were out killing sparrows needs some explanation. Chairman Mao ordered EVERYONE across the nation to beat drums and make a huge racket in order to terrify the birds and keep them flying until they exhausted themselves to death. Perhaps billions of these birds were killed in an attempt to increase crop production aparently the birds were capitalist reactionaries or at least enemies of the state. However the little grain the birds consumed was NOT a real problem but the insects that the birds ate were. So as a result of the destruction of the birds bug populations SKYROCKETED and the crops were decimated. That is why several scenes later people are complaining that there were 3 years of famine.Also it seemed to me that it was implied that the reason the one lady quit the army where she was an actress for propaganda plays was because she was expected to put out for officers. She chose to quit instead and shortly afterwards she was sent to a reeducation camp as punishment for this.".

Basically story is told from the perspective of a young boy Tietou Tian Yi his name literally means iron head growing up in the 1950s and 1960s in Beijing. Chen Shujuan Liping L and Lin Shaolong Cunxin Pu married in 1953 on Dry Well Lane their son Tietou was born a year later. During the Hundred Flowers Campaign Shaolong creates a blue kite for his son Wenyao Zhang a symbol that will remain throughout as a sign of better days he dies in a reform camp. During the Great Leap Forward close family friend Uncle Li Guodong Xuejian Li who protects Shujuan and her son partly out of guilt for lying to authorities about Shaolong succumbs to malnutrition. During the Cultural Revolution teenage Tietou Xiaoman Chen moves in with Lao Wu his Stepfather Guo Baochang Tietou's mother being dragged away by Red Guards and the stepfather dies from heart failure the fate of Tietou is left unknown. Also starring Ping Zong as Chen Shusheng Xiaoying Song as Sis Yanjin Liu as Shujuan's mother and Bin Li as Granny. The story is essentially how careers romances friendships and rivalries are affected by momentous political and historical events based on the memories of the director only the blue kite flying seem to be the happy moments this film was banned by the Chinese authorities the betrayals and brutalities are convincing I remember some family argument scenes it was a little slow at times but it is an interesting drama.

	schema:headline " A dissident perspective of China";
	schema:reviewBody "The film The Blue Kite is a typical example of the informal censorship of alternative opinions in our modern liberal societies especially with regard to the competing bolshevist and Islamic societies. Remember that until the seventies the liberal governments prohibited the travel to China. Films and books in favor of those alternative ideologies are in general not strictly forbidden but nevertheless they are not readily available  except for the products of dissidents. The suppression of the diversity of speech proceeds in two stages at first the liberal media press TV which monopolize the news glorify liberalism and give a distorted view of alternative ideologies. Then after the public is made prejudiced there is no commercial market for the distribution of the alternative films etc. It goes without saying that the distributors themselves are not particularly eager to sell those antagonistic views. The Blue Kite shows a dissident perspective of China and thus is highly acclaimed by the liberal lobby. However in The Blue Kite the critique of Maoism is too onesided and it actually backfires. We see the life of small town folks during the rectification movement the great leap forward and the cultural revolution. Examples of scenes? One of the main characters is present in a meeting of workers that has to identify subversive colleagues. The chairman strives to reach his quota of subversive elements. So when our main character visits the lavatory he is quickly labeled subversive and sent to a labor camp. Another scene a female soldier refuses to return the advances of high party officials and is subsequently sentenced to a long imprisonment. The film is a string of wrongdoings which were probably fairly common at the time. But still they are incidents which could have happened equally well here in the Netherlands. This leaves the viewer with the feeling that The Blue Kite is actually trying to split hairs. I found the critical Chinese film To Live much more humane and credible. An objective judgment should probably call Maoism a twisted ideology but admit that there are worse alternatives. It should be remembered that a century ago China had been invaded and ravaged by western imperialist powers and subsequently Japan continued this terrorist intervention. After WWII there was the civil war with the nationalists which may perhaps be called a peasants revolution. Although it included a restructuring into collectivity this can definitely not be called a socialist reform. The Chinese economy was and is based on primitive agriculture with regularly returning threats of famine. Maoism offered a solution and erected basis health care and educational provisions. In addition it had to reconcile with the former opposition and handle sabotage. The life expectancy under Maoism was always longer than in the democratic India. In fact the cultural revolution is an intriguing phenomenon. A primary aim was to strengthen the bond between the common people and the intelligentsia. Here in Europe this generated admirable examples of selfsacrifice like a student movement into the factories and workingclass quarters albeit only on a sectarian scale. In the very poor China it was a waste of scarce expertise and efficient labor division. It is estimated that over three million people were killed during the Cultural Revolution which nearly transformed into another civil war. On the other hand the equivalent in Afghanistan would be hundred thousand killed which is approximately the factual score due to the Afghan revolution led by Nato. Therefore most Chinese people can still appreciate Mao. And frankly speaking I can not recommend The Blue Kite except perhaps for its portrayal of Chinese village life. I am still waiting for the release in our society of the load of Chinese films with a sympathetic message about Maoism.".

I'm not saying that this movie is not great just that for teenagers the Blue Kite is a bit too slow.With both of these movies I think it is essential to know background information about the periods of history covered. The things that were done in China of those decades are so hard to believe and fathom. If you are interested in China of the 20th century this movie is essential.".

The story plays against the political background of The Rectification Movement The Great Leap Forward and the beginnings of The Cultural Revolution. The movie stays closely focused on the family and how it is affected by the political whims of the times. Lacking a knowledge of Chinese history I was often confused by what was happening to family members. The great strength of the movie in focusing on the relationship between Tietou and his mother and their courage in facing hard times was also for me a weakness since I did not understand the political forces behind what was precipitating the events driving their lives. What seemed like safe behavior at one time was deemed as cause for arrest at others. This may have been one of the points being made but I did not understand the underlying reasons.Another problem I had was reading the subtitles. If you are not a speed reader they will often fly by faster than you can read. Many of them stayed on the screen for less than half a second I counted the frames. Many times I found myself pausing the DVD so I could back it up to read the subtitles. These disruptions obviously diminished my enjoyment of the film.All that being said the movie is nicely filmed with a pacing and score that are quite effective. Many scenes linger on everyday details and are punctuated with subtle music. The historical context that does filter through is of interest.If I spoke Chinese and knew more of the history of that country I think I would have appreciated this film much more.".

The plot sounds trite but Yang Li's excellent direction and the crisp editing along with superb performances in the main roles make this into a twisting horror story and the viewer knows not where the plot is going.Apart from the main role of Bai and the teacher all other actors were actual mountain village people which is startling in the uncompromising look at their culture and the hard lives ingrained into their faces there are also some real now rescued brides playing themselves in the film. Although the film as a good social point to make it's not preaching or forcing the issues on you but rather asking you to examine the situation. To the villagers this is just life and it's always been this way to observers they seem inhumane. Although the film obviously brings up the issue of the one child policy these villages and bride trafficking have been going one since long before that policy was put into affect and still does in many parts of the world not just China.Yang Li was in the audience and took questions at the Hawaii International Film Festival. It was annoying to see the QA get hijacked a little by feminists wanting to make a point and answering their own questions but other than that the director was frank and forthcoming about his film.Excellent.

The village is located deep in the mountains remote and isolated and like many such villages in china in reality has been this way for thousands of years. The script is based on real stories I remember reading about reports on such stories in the early 90's in China and the movie is extremely realistic in its depiction of the village the characters and the logics of its dramatic development. Like another commentator said the movie depicts the oppression of women in China mainly the remote parts of rural China. However it is farfetched to quickly infer that the Chinese government is also complicit with the crime. Women have been sold into households as breeding tools and slaves for thousands of years in China. In urban areas because of the Chinese revolution and Westernization in recent years the status of women has been dramatically improved. However in the remote rural areas the feudal traditions and values still persist. The tragedy of the movie is in the end of movie despite the police efforts nothing  not the strongwills of the main character not the institutionallegal system of the establishment  was able to triumph over the outdated rotten tradition.".

Female foetuses are aborted female babies are killed. Result all those men without a women to take for a wife and to have sons with. This paradox was clearly illustrated in the film where a remote mountain village abducts women to marry its single men while at the same time it is shown that a female newborn has been drowned. The women behind me in the theatre started commenting very indignantly about this if they lack so many women why kill female babies? The film makes a very strong statement the woman is raped by the wouldbe husband with the assistance of his parents the whole village including the government officials is collaborating to prevent the abducted women from escaping. I can imagine that the Chinese authorities are not very happy with the way its cadres are depicted nor with the inability of the authorities to deal with the problem.While the film tells a harsh and cruel story in a very realistic way it is also beautifully shot in a beautiful mountain area in Shanxi and it is well acted. I don't know if this film will be widely seen in China but I hope it will be seen at least by the authorities who have the power to change these things. The very strong preference for male offspring is based on deeprooted traditions sons are responsible for funeral rites and ancestor worship and sons have to take care of the parents in the absence of a social security system. The latter is now slowly being put in place in the cities but is still not in place in the countryside. Also in the cities more and more women are having well paid jobs and are thus able of taking care of their parents. Still China is huge and the catching up that the countryside will need to do will require a lot of time.".

	schema:reviewBody "Blind MountainBlind Mountain is a Chinese film with realistic characteristics. It is acted by Lu He and directed by Yang Li. The film tells a story in the form of documentary. In the film a young university student is abducted by human trafficker and sold to a rural countryside with little legal knowledge as wife. She is trapped in the countryside for years until rescued by police. The film is based on the true story. Unlike other commercial films Blind Mountain adopted unconventional measures. Firstly actors of this film are not professional actors buy ordinary from public. The director of this film is trying to illustrate an atmosphere in a more natural form which makes the scenes more real and close to life. Thanks to actions of unprofessional actors scenes of the film are presented more vividly. Actors are able to interpret their roles by their own understanding. One of actors has reallife experience of being abducted and trafficked. Such experience is lacked in other films. The scenes presented in this film are set to the background of Chinese countryside. In Chinese countryside life in poverty tends to promote peasants to break laws for their own good. Because of the tradition with the typical rural Chinese families family tradition is regarded to overpower laws. The director films this story in the real rural Chinese village in order to construct the atmosphere of such tradition. The film tends a dark art style warm color tone is not found anywhere in the film. Such art style makes the audiences feel miserable life experience of main character and gives a visual impact of depression. The effect is achieved especially when the girl is trafficked to the rural village while nobody helps her. She later understands that she is isolated because the whole village shield each other for human trafficking. Audiences can feel overwhelmingly suffocated because the hope will almost never been expected in the film. The dark style color tone of the film strengthens such feeling. Such technique convinces the audiences that they are watch a dark story. Even in a sunny day the director treats the scenes as it is overcast. The film does not come with background music as supplement although it is able to heighten the atmosphere with plots and scenes. This is another unique characteristic this film carries. Audiences are only able to hear the true noise from the background and the scripts are the actual focus. The film does not try to achieve resonance of audience by music. The only channel of knowing the plot of the film is conversations among actors. Since there is no background music the simple conversations rather bring audiences impact and sense of reality. In China we will hear new about abduction of women and infants from everyday newspapers and TV news. However we have no way to understand what abducted women and babies have experienced. This film tells an ugly truth that even exists in today's China society. In the film the word 'blind' in Blind Mountain includes a lot of meanings. The literal meaning of 'blind' is unable to see. However in the film it represents the life of isolation illiteracy and undercivilizations in Chinese rural countryside. 'Blind' also represents the desperation and hopelessness inside the main character's heart. There is no hope there is no help. Nobody will ever communicate with her and she is trapped in an isolated mountainous village. The film tries to unveil village residents' lack of heart and humanity. The end of the film also brings great impact to audiences that the main character has to give up her own daughter to escape from the village. The film finally gives an impression of abducted women's miserable life that even escaped from the village they have to suffer from the separation from who they love. Because of the Chinese censorship the film comes with two different endings. This essay only elaborates the ending of the version that is publicly shown in China. Blind Mountain is not a commercial film. However it brings even more impacts comparing with other commercial films. The reason is that the director chooses a story that is difficulty to believe and uses a more realistic way to tell the audiences an inconvenient truth. Blind Mountain vividly illustrates image of the bottom side of Chinese society. Overall it is a successful film.".

In fact I'm pretty sure that one of the locations in the city is a location in Not One Less  the broadcast station. I'm wondering whether or not the obvious influences are intentional since this movie seemed to be receiving warm praise. I would hate to learn that the director did not realize the similarities between this and Not One Less since Zhang Yimou's present influence seemed to be somewhat overt to me. The way in which it is shot mostly with wide lenses with a deemphasis on the shot in order to normalize and situate the film as a socialistic commentary on modern day China definitely owes much to the 5th gen directors Zhang Yimou Chen Kaige and others at least in my opinion. I don't think this film is anywhere near the level that those experienced veterans are used to making but it's a good effort. I think the biggest thing that it lacks is fluency between scenes and I think that that is a burden the actors have to carry. It's difficult to direct nonactors imagine being abducted to act for a month i'm surprised they weren't terrified 100 of the time. He actually used real policemen hospital workers and rural villagers and although they don't have to pretend to be anyone other than themselves it can be dangerous if these characters have a presence in the movie because they have to be able to carry on the story in their own way as well. Even minor roles have motivations and emotional arcs but it seems as if these people have lost them and are acting from a shot to shot basis without any idea of how the overall story is like. I'm glad I got to see this film though despite the acting because it gives me a chance to see how important the element of directing your actors are. And I definitely respect the choice of using nonactors. It seems to be a characteristic feature of many of these kinds of international films. Besides these people have a realistic understanding of the microcosmic world of which we so easily play critic from afar. You just have to know how to tap into it.".

This is the story of one young college educated woman who is taken to the far north of Chinadrugged and abandoned to the mercy or lack ofof a much older man. What follows is truly difficult to watch at times. Despite several attempts to escape she is brought back to the farm where she tends to the pigs as well as other chores.

This is the story of one young college educated woman who is taken to the far north of Chinadrugged and abandoned to the mercy or lack ofof a much older man. What follows is truly difficult to watch at times. Despite several attempts to escape she is brought back to the farm where she tends to the pigs as well as other chores.

The cinematography was very good and real and the overall situation was disturbing and interesting but it dragged on and in the end it just did not pay off. There was no resolution like there was in Blind Shaft. Here it just sort of ended without the situation really being solved in any way. It was frustrating. There were also a number of shots that just seemed pointless like a shot of the main character looking off into the distance for about a minute then a cutaway... Okay? I get that she's thinking about stuff but I don't really want to spend my time watching her contemplate. Shots like that and one of the old lady doing the loom over and over just got annoying. I think they were supposed to express a feeling of hopelessness or something along those lines but really it just got frustrating having the plot not advance at all. Basically there is no story here it's just  Wouldn't it be terrible if you were kidnapped and sold to a small Chinese farm community that wouldn't let you go? Yes yes it would. But that's really all there is to this movie. It's an isn't this a terrible situation to be in? kind of thing and it drags on and on with no resolution at the end. I feel a documentary on the subject of human trafficking would be more fitting to the subject.".

This point was made before but what got me was her reaction to her father during the rescue mission when she said it took him a long time to come and get her. This question indicated that she thought that only the last one she had given to the postman had been given to her husband which to me meant she was pretty but very dense. I did not buy into the stopping of the bus either and dragging her off. I have ridden buses in China and they don't stop just like that. I think there was an error in the photography in that I could see two dishes in the distance when there weren't any of those around in the early 1990's. Finally the Chinese people in general obey the police but here we have the police being harangued and even threatened by the villagers. Did it not occur to the leader that more police would show up should anything happen to the two who came with her father?".

Collegeeducated and urban nevertheless Xumei allows herself to be outsmarted by these unschooled peasants with a naivety that strains the film's credibility as a feminist treatise or an anticommunist manifesto. Masquerading as scouts for a pharmaceutical company the young woman and her older male colleague who sells the cashstrapped college grad to the indigent farming family inspires Decheng to ask Xumei How could you have believed those guys? Since the seemingly kind schoolteacher turns out to be complicit towards the girl's forced detainment this inquiry can be construed as a subtle mocking of his intellectual superior whom he envies having flunked his college entrance exams after graduation. This provincialism man at one point confesses to Xumei that he had never seen a train. In spite of her vaunted worldliness in spite of her time spent on trains however this modern woman finds herself on equal terms with the rustic man the very outcome that Mao Tse Tsung envisioned when he implemented his Great Leap Forward plan onto Chinese society during the Cultural Revolution. Over and over again Xumei exhibits a counterintuitive nature about her desperate predicament that's so alarmingly pronounced questions about the filmmaker's attitudes towards women and highereducation need to be raised.For starters the dawning that everybody within her adopted farming village is aligned against bought women from departing their regimented lives crosses Xumei's mind with an extended deliberation that borders on mild mental retardation. After all her own motherinlaw participated in the rape preliminaries for that first night she spent with Degui the rapist her husband a sure indicator that the social norms of civilization don't apply among these people. Befriending men if not for the especial purpose of accruing money from sex lacks the proper psychological motivation which makes Xumei's friendship with Decheng somewhat unlikely. Given the context the counterbalancing effects of romantic love plays out like a fallacy because it suggests that the enslaved woman's bond with the farmer is merely an arranged marriage. Even worse Xumei hands over letters to the postman without any consciousness of her husband's whereabouts when the exchanges are made. At the very least she should look over her shoulder since the correspondences to her father is a prelude for escape. Over time despite having no indication that the letters had ever reached its destination Xumei unceasingly acts without prudence by her continuing trust of the civil servant. Finally a boy that Xumei tutors sees what we already surmised that the postman like the village chief like the other handmaidsechoes of the Margaret Atwood novel abounds like the schoolteacher are all in on the conspiracy. It's beyond belief that a collegeeducated woman could be this dense but the mortified look on Xumei's face upon learning the fate of her letters indicates that she believed her written transmissions were being sent. If escaping on foot proved to be difficultWhy doesn't she escape during the night? Why does she stay near the road? a duplicitous postman should come to her as no surprise. Late in the film Xumei becomes a schoolteacher herself she oversees a group of young boys in her home. If Mang Shan truly sided with the concept of a free China and free women the film would have Xumei teaching these future men something a little more useful than mathematics.".

Hung here plays Butcher Wing' the apprentice in a dojo who constantly finds himself caught up in mischief. Wing gets caught up in a series of events that conspire to make him enemy no.1 and lead to some truly amazing fight sequences that truly have to be seen to be believed.

But from what I've seen from other Hong Kong movies this kind of thing isn't that unusual. At the very least such moments like this just further the ways as to how this movie will be unique to anyone raised on western filmmaking.Don't think this is the cheap kind of martial arts movie you see on Kung Fu Theater or on public domain video labels  give it a try.

	schema:headline " what more could a Kung Fu fan ask for";
	schema:reviewBody "The best place to start signing the praises of this truly magnificent film is to look at the names of all those involved with the movie. A venerable who's who of Kun Fu movies past and present rounds out this film.The film is directed by Yuen Woo Ping who would later become the master of fight scenes in such movies as The Matrix Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon The Once Upon a Time in China series Kung Fu Hustle oh and he also directed some great films such as this film and The Buddhist Fist.The film's screenplay is by Wong Jing who's notorious for his hit or miss HK films. The Legend of Fong SaiYuk and Meltdown stand out in my mind as his best films and from the humor shown throughout this movie it's obvious that Wong Jing had a hand in it he is definitely on in this movie.The Magnificent Butcher stars Sammo Hung who unless you were living under a rock in the 1970s and 1980s you should know as one of the more competent kung fu movie stars of his era. Sammo plays the title character Butcher Wing Lam SaiWing one of the more notable of the real life disciples of Kung Fu hero patriot and Chinese healer Wong FeHung. Butcher Wing getting his niickname as he was a butcher by trade in his day job which often leads to many funny butcher jargon jokes during kung fu scenes in movies in which Buther Wing is a character. While not as funny as some of the double entendre fight dialouge in Once Upon a Time in China 5 there is a humorous scene in Magnificent Butcher where Sammo gets a lesson in cooking mistakenly thinking he's getting a kung fu lesson. Sammo holds his own as Butcher Wing he has the build and demeanor for the part and quite honestly as this is the only movie I know of featuring Butcher Wing as the main character Sammo Hung as a big name actor was a good choice for the Role.TakHing Kwan makes a brief but memorable appearance in his typical role at the time of Master Wong FeiHung. This was THE guy this is who Chinese moviegoers associated as Wong FeiHung before Jet Li revived the role in the Once Upon a Time in China series. TakHing Kwan plays and older queueless Wong FeiHung but a Wong FeiHung who is still a master physician and martial artist nonetheless. Yes this is the movie with the famous scene of Wong FeiHung demonstrating calligraphy as a self defense technique. The movie is worth seeing for this scene alone even if you're not a fan of Sammo Hung you will get a kick out of TakHing Kwan's defensive calligraphy style.Yuen Biao is also in this gem of a film one I highly recommend seeing if only to see what Wong FeiHung films were like prior to Jet Li. The 1970s and 80s were filled with low budget pure crap films and rest assured this film is not one of them. This is a rare gem from that era one that any kung fu fanatic must see.".

Only in Hong Kong would a director attempt to gel these distinctly contrasting scenes and attempt to convey a cohesive story.  And in Magnificent Butcher we have something close to success as Samo effectively conveys emotions of comedy and extreme outrage in the blink of an eye. What is strange is how quickly these charaters forget their injustices and gripes which eventually lead to the climactic fight sequence where everything ends in triumpth as we the viewer dispel with the plot and relish the movies subsequent closing.  Magnificent Butcher or Lin shi rong is part of the era of Hong Kong movie making whereby anything that makes the audience laugh and cry for its duration was deemed a success as the emphasis of movies made in this era was fun twinned with an element of truth and this calloboration between Yuen Woo Ping and Samo sets the precedent for nearly everything that has been great about Hong Kong cinema ever since.Kung fu comedy at its most shameless an undeniable  classic for fans of Hong Kong cinema.".

It starts quickly and from there it feels like there's never 10 minutes go by without a cracking fight scene. And that's just the thing  ALL the fight scenes are cracking... even the ones you would expect to be minor throwaway scuffles are awesomely executed filmed and edited! As a 70s Hong Kong Kung Fu film it still has some fairly broad humour but it feels more hit than miss. The pantomime style farcical elements here don't seem as forced or as protracted as in many movies of this type. It has some genuinely moving moments and the plot although straightforward and formulaic is also refreshing in that it doesn't deviate too much with irrelevances. Nor does it get too tied up in itself. However there is enough plot there to keep interest in the brief bits between fights.And this film IS about the fights. There is some awesome kung fu with just the right mix of realitygrounded martial arts and odd touches wireassisted flair. Sammo as with many of the main players is clearly at his peak and with his input the fights can be pretty brutal at times. They are fast lengthy hard and fast and are just starting to move away from the stilted nature of the 70s films. Yuen Biao gets a great showcase fight too  one that shows his martial arts ability more than his acrobatic prowess. This is a film about the martial arts  there are some impressive acrobatics but they are kind of the run of the mill stuff of these films rather than the jawdropping acrobatics of say Wheels on Meals or Dragons Forever. Sammo pulls out some impressive flips though. As does Beggar So's character.This is my new favourite 70s kungfuer... and I found it more enjoyable even than... dare I say it... Drunken Master!!! Yes  it's that good!".

	schema:headline " Another winner from Sammo Hung";
	schema:reviewBody "THE MAGNIFICENT BUTCHER is a superior kickfest that beats any early Jackie Chan film hands down. With the likes of this THE VICTIM and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE SPOOKY KIND I'm surprised that martial arts supremo Sammo Hung didn't earn more respect and international stardom than his frequent costar. His early offerings provide superior entertainment that do away with the tired clichs and chopsocky action of Jackie Chan's Lo Wei flicks and give the viewer a rollicking good time. THE MAGNIFICENT BUTCHER is an epic kung fu flick which offers everything you could ever want from such a film. There's a complex twistaminute plot plenty of comedy  of the lowbrow grossout variety that is nevertheless ten times funnier than any American PIE movie  drama suspense horror and of course kung fu. As you'd expect from director Yuen Wooping the fights in this flick are outrageously good always fluid and fastmoving and best of all with a minimum of editing you can actually see what's going on and that means this film has an edge to all modernday martial arts films.Sammo Hung is an intensely likable lead and he admirably holds his own amongst the ensemble cast here. He's athletic energetic and willing to take a beating as well as dole one out he's certainly one of the top five martial artists of all time and watching him fight is a real pleasure. Lee Hoi San is also excellent as the fleshedout villain complete with a 'burning palm' technique that has to be seen to be believed really doling out the punishment in this one. The supporting cast is chockablock with familiar faces Fung HarkOn later routinely typecast as a heavy has his best role as the truly dastardly villain of the piece whilst Yuen Biao is briefly on hand to show off his acrobatic style. Stealing the whole show though is Fan Mui Sang cast as a drunken beggar he's a real hoot funnier even than Sam Seed in DRUNKEN MASTER and his sheer presence and OTT acting adds to the film no end.Western audiences are often left feeling bemused or annoyed by eastern films especially on first acquaintance. The eclectic MAGNIFICENT BUTCHER will no doubt confuse some people mixing as it does solid bellylaughs with moments of high drama and tension that wouldn't be out of place in an adult thriller for instance the attempted rape sequence is near the knuckle and pretty shocking. In the end though the comedy wins outright especially with the hilarious sequence in which Hung tries to master the 'Iron Palm' technique  little realising that the instructions he's being fed are for pickling pig's trotters not a new martial arts style! The highlight of this whole film is the ferocious moment when Hung takes his revenge on Fung HarkOn in which the screen feels like it is crackling with energy. Watch out for that 'Weird Cat' guy as well  a real psycho.".

	onyx:emotionText "THE MAGNIFICENT BUTCHER is a superior kickfest that beats any early Jackie Chan film hands down. With the likes of this THE VICTIM and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE SPOOKY KIND I'm surprised that martial arts supremo Sammo Hung didn't earn more respect and international stardom than his frequent costar. His early offerings provide superior entertainment that do away with the tired clichs and chopsocky action of Jackie Chan's Lo Wei flicks and give the viewer a rollicking good time. THE MAGNIFICENT BUTCHER is an epic kung fu flick which offers everything you could ever want from such a film. There's a complex twistaminute plot plenty of comedy  of the lowbrow grossout variety that is nevertheless ten times funnier than any American PIE movie  drama suspense horror and of course kung fu. As you'd expect from director Yuen Wooping the fights in this flick are outrageously good always fluid and fastmoving and best of all with a minimum of editing you can actually see what's going on and that means this film has an edge to all modernday martial arts films.Sammo Hung is an intensely likable lead and he admirably holds his own amongst the ensemble cast here. He's athletic energetic and willing to take a beating as well as dole one out he's certainly one of the top five martial artists of all time and watching him fight is a real pleasure. Lee Hoi San is also excellent as the fleshedout villain complete with a 'burning palm' technique that has to be seen to be believed really doling out the punishment in this one. The supporting cast is chockablock with familiar faces Fung HarkOn later routinely typecast as a heavy has his best role as the truly dastardly villain of the piece whilst Yuen Biao is briefly on hand to show off his acrobatic style. Stealing the whole show though is Fan Mui Sang cast as a drunken beggar he's a real hoot funnier even than Sam Seed in DRUNKEN MASTER and his sheer presence and OTT acting adds to the film no end.Western audiences are often left feeling bemused or annoyed by eastern films especially on first acquaintance.

With that said comparing this to Jackie Chan would be bad because this is another type of fighting. Here they don't use everything around them they only use arms and legs. And this is the type of fighting that seems to be conducted like music. It is in a certain rhythm. It is hard to explain but people familiar with this genre will understand what I mean. This is also kind of a typical martial arts movie when you think of the story. There is always a young innocent man Sammo in this cause who has a problem that he has to solve. And in these movies he has to get help from someone before he is able to do just that. As martial arts movies go this is quite good. I rate this movie 510".

Butchering was made integral to the character. That doesn't happen in this movie. I think we see Sammo carry around a couple of dead pigs in the first few minutes and that's it. Disappointing.

In any even this movie is definitely not perfect or could be better but it is fun for me to watch and funny so I would have to recommend it anyway and regardless of what I consider to be a few flaws in this movie. Pointless fighting pointless deaths and decisions by multiple characters throughout the film that do not make sense for them to make at the time. Like Master Wong leaving when things were getting hot. Crazy Cow holding on to a man with a knife and not properly defending himself. Skinny Pig killing such as such in front of many different witnesses and not being reported to authorities. What gives? Is there no law in that town? And the main antagonist is rich but has no guards that can fight better than him? What? That's like a rich man today being the best shot among his guards and only having 2 guards when he can afford 4 or more. This man is supposedly rich yet almost never has an entourage or at least he does until they get beat up and then all of a sudden they disappear and are never seen again in key parts of the film where he should be protected. It makes no sense. Such a rich man who is a mediocre fighter walking the streets alone and killing alone? It's unlike any other Martial Arts movie in that sense which is both a good thing and a bad thing.
