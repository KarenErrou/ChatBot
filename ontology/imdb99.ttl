	schema:reviewBody "Reading some of the other comments and the reviews at the time it came out I suppose my feeling about this movie must be extremely idiosyncratic. Yet all the people I rope in to watching this film seem to agree with me  so this is to give a counterpoint to the tepid at best comments I've read so far.This is a beautifully photographed film from beginning to end.  It perfectly captures the ambiance and look of the Reno area in 1959 I know because I was there not just in appearance but in the characters as well. Period music is expertly used throughout the film with the final choice of Ella Fitzgerald's I Wished on the Moon a haunting and perfect end.  I can't help but think that because this film was one of the first to spend several uncompromising minutes devoted to lesbian lovemaking that people tended to focus almost exclusively on that scene  and make pronouncements based on their own comfort levels with how it was filmed.  This scene is really quite beautiful but it could be left out and the sex only hinted at without harming the flow of the film.  The two main characters are wellthoughtout and fully realized both fine performances Helen Shaver is near perfect.  All of the supporting characters are interesting and perfectly believable.  The intelligent witty script gives deep insight into the characters with minimal time spent.  The humor is subtle but satisfying. Two examples  1 when the professor comes out of her room after brooding for several days she is asked by another guest what she has been doing in there  the eccentric grizzled ranch manager Audra Lindley  who looks like she has been burned into the Nevada landscapeanswers like a schoolmarm whatever it is it's too deep for us to understand  2  while horseback riding in the desert a Marilyn wannabe in blue jeans gets off her horse and says my girdle is killing me! For me this is a near perfect film.  The only thing close to a criticism I can muster is the Kay character seems a bit too contemporary but his is a very minor point and the role is well played. Unlike the other commentors I think the characters are fascinating each scene stands on its own as a perfect little vignette and not only did I find the film enjoyable when it first came out I have watched it at least 18 times since and it always holds up beautifully. Watch this movie with an open mind void of preconceptions and value judgements and see if you aren't enchanted or at least entertained.".

	schema:reviewBody "It was a really beautiful movie. The director really captures the beauty of 2 women and 2 women finding true love in 1950's in the least expected situation. As you watched the film your emotions just followed the main characters'. It is a very touching tender romantic movie. This is my favorite movie. I have been watching it many times since I got it.Thumbs up for Patricia Charbonneau for her stunning performance esp. this was her first performance on films. She played this young dark haired beautiful free spirited and passionate woman Cay who compelled Helen Shaver to look into her heart and finally allowed herself to admit her feelings for Cay. Patricia is really HOT in this movie. Her beautiful smile her sparkling eyes her sexy voice and every move of hers is really attractive and charming. How can anyone not fall for her? I wonder why she didn't become a star after this movie?! She is absolutely Gorgeous and she can really act. It is a shame that she didn't get enough recognitions for her talents as she deserves in the film industry. Helen Shaver did an excellent job as well. She played a repressed English professor Vivian who went to Reno for a quick divorce. After closing herself up for years meeting and knowing Cay finally forced her to face her true emotions and admitted her feelings for Cay. These 2 characters' personalities are really opposite of each other. One enjoys order and the other is free spirited but somehow they are able to find true love with each other. This movie described really well how Helen Shaver struggled with her own feelings and the society's expectations and the hardship the society and Cay's family gave to the same sex couple. Yet Cay is very courageous facing her true feelings and chasing after who she wants Vivian. Although there was no clear ending for these 2 women it is still hopeful since Patricia got on the train with Helen. One can only hope for the best for these 2 women and May they live happily ever after. The scenery views are quite beautiful. The mountain the lake views and horses running are extra plus. The other characters are quite good such as Frances Parker Cay's step mother. The love scene between these 2 is amazing. You can feel these 2 women's desires for each other. Vivian is initially repressed but once she follows her heart you can feel these 2 women are truly in love and enjoy being intimate with each other. There is Great chemistry between Patricia and Helen which makes this movie very real. The glances they exchanged with each other the way they look at each other and the way they talk to each other are very convincing that they are in love with each other. I love to watch the scenes between them over and over. I think they build up a strong foundation with each other which then leads to a very believable amazing and erotic love making at the end. The director Donna Deitch did an outstanding job. The script is nicely written. The display of emotions is appropriate in 1950's. There are wonderful background musics. Donna Deitch is really successful bringing out the outstanding performance of these 2 lead actresses. It is not easy to direct a film such as this one in 1980's and she had to raise the fund for this movie herself. Overall it is an excellent movie something you can watch over and over. Highly recommended.".

It captures 1950s Reno and environs the biggest little city in the world pretty well great old cars red earth dried twisted windspent driftwood fragrant summer sagebrush the noisy 724 casinos with 99 cent meals suntanned faces rickety ranch motels on the outskirts of town snowveined Sierras and the pop music that is no worse than what we listen to. The story pulls one in. Aura Lindley is the matriarch of the ranch and has bonded with one of her tenants. A new one arrives an Eastern sophisticate who refers to herself as a distinguished author and has a lot of books schlepped into her room. Discord! Helen Shaver the professor is rather neat and in addition to her books carries around a lot of savoirfaire. She doesn't look bad either. The movie also has going for it the presence of Patricia Charbonneau who must have one of the most interesting crania on the planet and the soft parts to match. She is possessed of a sinewy yet feminine figure and carries herself with presence. Her hair and her irises are the color of glowing anthracite. Charbonneau indeed. And those dazzling big choppers appalling and appealing. She outs herself on a walk with Shaver who responds momentarily impulsively. Jealous Lindley throws Shaver out suspecting something more intimate has happened than actually has. The intimacy follows in a later scene when Charbonneau tracks Shaver to her downtown hotel room and initiates a long erotic love scene which isn't at all pornographic or exploitative. The two women love one another but one is after all an uptight distinguished author and the other though equally intelligent goes with the flow as they say and has been kicked out of college for unnatural acts. The film ends ambiguously. Can they get together? Can they compromise their life styles? Can a distinguished author carry on an affair with another woman in the 1950s? Not including Gertrude Stein? Can our desert wildflower find a home as a potted plant surrounded by geraniums on a windowsill on MacDougall Street in the Village? Will an author find happiness with a woman after her marriage to a man has ended in boredom and disaster? Will  I forgot what the original rhetorical question was. This is an easy movie to get through. Nothing in it leaps out at you. It doesn't pound you over the head with its modern sensibilities. We're not invited to condemn those morons back in the 50s for their attitudes towards gays nor are we urged to feel guilty because we are accused of some lingering distaste ourselves. The movie sort of shrugs at these issues and says well that's the way it was. Not exactly a time that embraced gays but at least on the outskirts of Reno not exactly a time of torture either. One wishes Shaver and Charbonneau well as they ride off on the train into the sunset.".

Vivian Bell played by Helen Shaver arrives into 1950's Fresno for a quickie divorce boarding with a friendly momlike landlord and her employees of her ranch. The landlord also has a stepdaughter Cay who Bell is curiously magnetted too and vice versa. Soon Vivian is surprised to find her falling for Cay's advances and are soon lovers. But there is consequences to this after all this is 1950's Fresno we're talking about here.All the cast is great here especially Patricia Charbonneau who has quite a debut here and Audra Linley playing the landlady who I absolutely didn't recognize. She's Mrs Roper on Three's Company fer crying out loud! Amazingly brisk and enjoyable I haven't seen a movie in a long time that I enjoyed without checking the time to see how much was left.".

Unlike a lot of lesbian movies that were made in the 1980's this one isn't all doom and gloom. It's actually a movie that will make you remember being young impulsive and in love. It leaves theviewer feeling hopeful about the future. Vivian Bell is a professor who comes to Nevada in the 1950's for a quickie divorce from her husband. While there shemeets Cay Rivers and Cay opens up a whole new world to her and makesVivian realize there's more to life than her stuffy professional existence in New York. In addition this movie has the most touching intimate erotic and soulful love scene that I have EVER seen between 2 women in a movie.".

It wasn't supposed to be an action flick but it does have a good story though I would have preferred to see it go a little deeper emotionally but you have to understand that this was a period film and given the era the movie was set in the emotions of the characters make perfect sense.  In the 50's and especially in the rural areas people were very conservative and though a character like Cay would've wanted to be open about her lifestyle she certainly would've felt restrained to do so even as freespirited as she was.  And Vivian would certainly have initially felt like a leper as the tug of societal demands and the mores of the era weighed on her.  I think it was filmed and written in exactly the same light as it needed to be no more no less.  A very realistic portrait of the era and a great job no doubt about it and highly recommended for viewing but I would rate it R for about 510 minutes of sex scenes maybe PG13 for content.As for the sex scenes I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it whatever your orientation.  I did and I'm straight as an arrow no pun intended there either!  See how much this outofprint video sells for on the Net and you'll see the demand this movie still creates which is more of a barometer of its success than anything else.  I can't believe that it ever went outofprint given the demand for it.  You don't see that with just any video and as a minor collector of rare videos I can say that for a fact.".

This time around I liked it even more and began to reappreciate how special some of the performances were.Now 15 years later during a purge of video tapes I've rediscovered DESERT HEARTS. I find I like it even more this time. Frankly I couldn't care less about gay politics. I acknowledge that North America the US and Canada anyway hasn't been real great in dealing with minority groups race religion sexual orientation during the past century. But I don't even see this film in terms of sexual politics. It's just a great love story dealing with the painful steps it takes to cross over any barrier. The sexual tension is palpable. Ms. Charbonneau is both gorgeous and a natural actress. The scene in the hotel room where she waits in bed for Helen Shaver is just spectacular. The supporting cast and the settings are also excellent.I like the vintage music when is the last time you heard Johnny Cash sing Get Rhythm on a soundtrack? My one criticism concerns the abrupt fadetoblack style at the end of each brief scene. For me it got in the way of the story telling and continuity.Although I've discounted politics in writing this review I have to admit that DESERT HEARTS was surely a brave film in its time. Maybe in this time too. Kudos to those involved for taking those risks.".

There is a very good soundtrack that is marred by quick and frequent fadeouts.

It is 1959 and strong independent thinking women are an oddity. Frances ParkerAudra Lindleyputs Vivian up at a guest ranch so she can meet her residency requirement for her divorce. The quiet reserved professor meets and falls in love with a young openly lesbian woman CayPatricia Charbonneau ten years her junior.Character development is effortless and the explicit love scenes are tender yet hot. There is a very good soundtrack that is marred by quick and frequent fadeouts. Great music from Patsy Cline Buddy Holly Johnny Cash Gene Vincent Webb Pierce Johnnie Ray and Elvis Presley.Rounding out the cast are Andra Akers Alex McArthur Gwen Welles and Dean Butler. Profanity and the lesbian love scenes garner an R rating. DESERT HEARTS makes Charbonneau a star.";

It shows both sides of the picture the love and friendship of others accepting of a person no matter what and the typical hatred for someone being different. There is no violence whatsoever which is refreshing. And there are no mind games played which is typical in a great deal of alternative lifestyle stories. It shows honest struggle with feelings that have never been known before. The characters selected for their roles were perfect everyone seems quite natural and real with each other. It appears that Helen Shaver seems quite rigid in her role but she truly portrays the clash of her proper orderly world to the new sunrise in her life. Just a slow like a slow dance but beautiful telling of a tale of two very different women meeting as it makes you want them to allow their hearts to feel the joy. Quiet rooting for them is allowed in this movie!".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always heard about this movie but never got around to seeing it until just a couple weeks ago. While watching it the first time I wasn't impressed. I thought the cinematography was odd  some parts were hard to follow. I loved the music but wished it didn't drown out what seemed to be important dialogue. Although I didn't really like it that much the first time certain scenes  lines from the movie stuck with me. I watched again a few days later  LOVED IT. Since I knew the gist of what was going on I was able to follow along a lot better. Now I don't think I could ever tire of watching it.I knew of this movie's reputation as a classic but I didn't realize it was released in 1986 until after I had watched it that first time. That fact floored me. I would've loved to been old enough back then to see it for the first time on screen. I'm sure it was extremely groundbreaking.Some may say the build up of the romance between Cay  Vivian was slow but I thought it really worked. The attraction between the two was immediate. Cay obviously had a crush  Vivian was intrigued. This was apparent when Vivian jumped at the chance to deliver Cay's mail. The whole love story was built around lingering glances shy smiles  building sexual tension.Patricia Charbonneau  Helen Shaver deliver wonderful  believable performances. The chemistry between the two is undeniable. I'm honestly surprised that those two did not have more prosperous acting careers especially Ms Charbonneau. Her sultry  smokey performance of Cay was spot on. Had I seen this movie when I was younger I would've been lusting hardcore over her character.I would've given this 10 stars if the music hadn't drowned out dialogue  some lines would've been more articulate. Helen has an amazing  unique voice but sometimes she would drop her sentences. Also Andra Akers seemed to talk fast  drop her sentences as well in the bathtub w Cay for example. A perfect example of the music drowning out the dialogue is when Cay  Vivian are naked together in the windowsill after the afterdinner fight. Cay says You'll never need me as much as I need you  we can't hear Vivian's response. This may be intentional by the director but it drives me crazy nonetheless.All in all this movie definitely needs to be in every lesbian's video library. Even though it's a movie from 1986 set in the 1950s the story is absolutely timeless.".

The movie was directed by Richard Whorf as a great spectacle one in which the magnificent talent employed by the studio is showcased interpreting Mr. Kern's music.The composer is seen arriving in New York and being referred to a man who is supposed to be the best in arranging songs. The fictitious James Hessler is seen as an influential figure who worked close with Mr. Kern and acted as his mentor and collaborator. By his own admission Mr. Kern was not an exciting figure but he left behind a body of work that still is vital and has survived the passing of time as his songs became standards.The main reason for watching the film is to enjoy the MGM stars doing what they did best singing and dancing for our benefit. In a spectacular and colorful finale we are treated to a wonderful production number involving Jerome Kern's best known songs.Robert Walker's take on the composer makes a bland figure out of Mr. Kern. Van Heflin as Hessler proves to be much better. In the musical numbers we are treated by Lena Horne June Allison Tony Martin Cyd Charisse Lucille Bremen Van Johnson Frank Sinatra Judy Garland Angela Lansbury and others.Although the film doesn't break new ground it's a wonderful way to catch up with the stars in the background in some great renditions of Jerome Kern's beautiful songs.".

The film opens with a lengthy montage from SHOWBOAT Kern's innovative masterpiece that features knockout performances from Lena Horne Katheryn Grayson and Virgina O'Brien and then quickly segues into a series of starsolos that feature June Allyson Gower Champion Cyd Charisse Angela Lansbury Dinah Shore and Frank Sinatra.Along the way we are also treated to an extended cameo by Judy Garland performing Look For The Silver Lining precisely as Marilyn Miller played it on stage and singing Who? to a staircase of chorus boyswhich Garland was said to find most amusing considering that she was pregnant at the time. Also notable is Lucille Bremer in the role of Robert Walker's stagestruck ward although her star quickly faded Bremer is an attractive performer and shows her talent for song and dance here by teaming with Van Johnson for a spirited version of I Won't Dance.

	schema:headline " Fictional Biography of Jerome Kern";
	schema:reviewBody "Back in the day when Hollywood was doing biographical pictures of some of our most famous popular composers it was generally acknowledged that they were nothing more than an excuse to string musical numbers together. Till the Clouds Roll By is the best example of that tradition.Jerome Kern wrote some of the best music ever heard in the world. But he was a pretty dull fellow in real life. He married the love of his life had one daughter and was never linked with any of the famous stars he wrote for. He actually did have two incidents in real life that would have made great screen drama. He had a heart attack that almost took him in 1938 where he was actually dead for several minutes. Kern always claimed after that any music he did write was due to heavenly intervention.When he did die in 1945 he collapsed on the street near Carnegie Hall in late 1945. He was back in New York after several years in Hollywood to negotiate with RodgersHammerstein who were going to produce a musical about Annie Oakley. Of course we know who got that assignment eventually.His wallet must have fallen from his pocket and gotten lifted because Kern remained unidentified for a few days and was in a charity ward at a NYC hospital when he died. Kern in fact died while production plans were being made for Till the Clouds Roll By. Still those two true incidents would have made great cinema.The film opens with a montage of melodies from Show Boat his greatest musical success. In fact that whole sequence could have been released as a short subject. The rest of the film is Kern in taxi giving a fictional flashback of his life up to Show Boat which premiered in 1927. We fast forward through the next several years when in fact he wrote his best music for stage and then the screen. And there is a musical finale.Curiously enough MGM had two guys on their lot at the time who actually had sung Kern songs on the screen Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly and neither of them got in this film. Kathryn Grayson later did full adaptations of Show Boat and Roberta but hadn't sung anything of Kern's up to that point. The only one in the cast actually performing a song he actually was identified with was Tony Martin. He sang Make Believe with Grayson during the Show Boat sequence but also had made a hit record of one of Kern's best songs All the Things You Are which came out in 1939. Martin sang it beautifully during the finale.You certainly can't complain about the vocalizing here though. With such additional folks as Lena Horne Van Johnson June Allyson and Judy Garland contributing their talents who could complain.Caleb Peterson who is a black baritone sang Ol Man River in the Show Boat sequence. During the finale it's sung by Frank Sinatra. Sinatra sings it great but given the song's identification with Paul Robeson it should have been done by him. Of course Mr. Robeson was having blacklist problems then. Still and all the white suited Sinatra was out of place to say the least.If you're a fan of Jerome Kern as I am just put the plot out of your head. Sit back and listen to the music.".

Great Judy Garland sequences and great color. Unfortunately the movie's copyright has lapsed and you can only get inferior versions on DVD. Occasionally TCM will show this film with a good print. Jerome Kern by his own admission was not very exciting so having Robert Walker play him didn't harm the man's reputation. Good job by Van Heflin.

	schema:reviewBody "This is a flawed but underrated biopic on the life of musical genius Jerome Kern who penned some of the best songs in the history of musicals.Although it is two and a quarter hours long its length isn't the problem. For my liking I found the story rather creaky and sometimes pedestrian and while a lot of attention has gone into making the dancing style and singing perfect less is done perfecting the script which felt a little underdeveloped. Also while his final scene with Van Heflin was very touching Robert Walker was a little bland in the title role.All that said though there is a lot to enjoy particularly the truly marvellous songs. Smoke Gets in Your Eyes Ol' Man River Can't help lovin' dat man and How'd you like to spoon me? really do stand out. The choreography is efficient and often dazzling and the colourful sets and costumes are fabulous. With the exception of Walker all the other performances were topnotch though I do think everyone has done better. Van Heflin is great as James Cyd Charise shows off her wonderful dancingand legs to perfection Angela Lansbury is another definite highlight and Judy Garland is a delight. Plus Dinah Shore is sublime in a rare treat. The real surprise though was Frank Sinatra I know some have complained of Ol' Man River not being sung by a black person like in Showboat but Sinatra's crooning and spontaneous charm more than compensates in a knockout performance.All in all has its flaws but it is underrated and worth the look. 7.510 Bethany Cox".

	schema:reviewBody "When MGM in its heyday made socalled biographies of musical figures such as Jerome Kern Rodger  Hart and Sigmund Romberg the story is about as consequential as they were in those early Broadway musicals.  So out with the story and on with the songs.The film opens with a montage of numbers from Show Boat Kathryn Grayson who would later be seen in the 1951 film version sings the role of Magnolia with Tony Martin as Gaylord Ravenal Their rendition of Make Believe is alright Grayson had a more charismatic partner in the film with Howard Keel Martin had little screen presence which weakens the duet in spite of his fine voice.  Virginia O'Brien sings a sassy Life Upn the Wicked Stage in a version I much prefer over the later Marge  Gower Champion version Lena Horne as Julie beautifully sings Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man making one wish the studio had cast her in the later version. Note Gardner wasn't bad but Horne would have brought more sympathy and historical significance in the role. Worst of all in this 15minute montage is Caleb Peterson's offkey rendition of Old Man River which is just unbearable to listen to.Other musical numbers I want to comment on Till the Clouds Roll By with Ray MacDonald is a catchy tune that is well staged and performed.  How'd You Like to Spoon With Me? is also a catchy English music hall number with the wonderful Angela Lansbury Set with girls on swings it is also well staged and if Lansbury sang the song herself she did a good job.  Note She did sound an awful like she did on cast albums of her future Broadway shows.  Pregnant with Liza Minnelli at the time Judy Garland as Ziegfeld diva Marilyn Miller is fist seen singing Look For the Silver Lining with dirt on her fact and hidden by a pile of dishes.  A beautiful song but not a memorable setting for MGM's most memorable musical diva.  Better off for Garland is the circusset Sunny a true campfest which meshes into the showstopping Who?.  Garland has a few dramatic sequences here trying to convince spoiled Lucille Bremer that her songs were taken away from her for the good of the show.  Bremer simply pouted and acted like a bad seed she gave a performance totally lacking sympathy.  Hense when she turns up later singing I Won't Dance with Van Johnson you want him to respond I didn't ask you.I won't make any comments about Robert Walker's performance as Jerome Kern Let's just say he was better than Mickey Rooney as Lorenz Hart in Words and Music. As Walker's mentor and bratty Bremer's father Van Heflin seems to have no reason to be there other than to add a star name.  Fortunately there are enough star performers doing musical numbers to make this interesting.  Let me not forget to mention June Depends Allyson singing Cleopatterer in a sequence from Leave It to Jane.  Allyson never a looker still could sell a song do a dance and make the audience cry. Here she does the first two very well It's nice to see her in a performance not dependant on manipulating audience sympathy.  Add Dinah Shore briefly singing The Last Time I Saw Paris which leads into a finale badly started out by having Bremer's character now a star at MGM singing a tribute to Kern.  At least we get to glimpse Grayson O'Brien and Horne again before Ole' Blue Eyes Frank Sinatra comes on to croon Old Man River. Skinny enough to where he almost fades into the white background Sinatra still knows how to deliver a song.  This was MGM's big Christmas release for 1946 so you can bet it was major box office. For audiences fighting the postwar blues it was the perfect remedy. Today it satisfies but leaves one hungry for more an hour later.".

	schema:headline " Another composer's fictional biopic!";
	schema:reviewBody "In light of my having recently perused the 1978 Kern biography by the British author Michael Freedland I have decided to revise my review Sunday December 30 1007.In this case Jerome Kern's real life story was not very interesting so Guy Bolton and Company simply made another one up. And the real Jerry was nothing to look at so they got Robert Walker to play him. Next year Walker played the muchbetterlooking young Brahms to whom he bore a strong resemblance believe it or not! The character James I. Hessler played by Van Heflin it must be said at the outset is completely fictional. But it gives the fictionalized Jerry someone to play off of and gives us the equally fictional daughter Sally Hessler played as an adult by Lucille Bremer an excuse to provide much of the drama missing in the composer's life. I felt though that this added drama was a bit of a cheat.The section where Kern searches for Sally has some basis in fact. Kern actually did search for someone connected with a British friend and was successful in locating the person.The courtship by Kern of his English wife Eva Leale is however even closer to the truth and the marriage was at least a durable if not entirely a happy one. All the more reason for the invention of Sally. Apparently though it's true that the second time he met the producer Charles Frohman the latter mistook Kern for British and Jerry didn't want to disabuse him as Frohman didn't think much of American songwriters. But when they disembarked in New Yorkan old acquaintance of Kern's gave the game away and Frohman was furious for a time. He said that he hoped Jerry could find his way around the city on his own. The odd story that Kern was supposed to sail with Frohman on the Lusitania in 1915 but missed the sailing is also true except that this was due to his having overslept He had stayed up all hours and had given the longstanding order that no one disturb his sleep. and not the fictional reason that it was his toolate last minute decision to sail with Frohman. Considering what happened to the Lusitania it was sunk by a German submarine and Mr. Frohman died along with many others the missed sailing was a good career move for Kern!Another thing that needs to be said was that the real Kern in common with Irving Berlin and other songwriters was rather of an egomaniac and martinet. And he gave his wife a good deal of grief as an habitual practical joker.Kern passed away before the film was finished and the production shut down at first. But it started up again and the film ends with a concert of excerpts from his music as a tribute. Ol' Man River is presented early on in the selections from Show Boat. There it was sung by Caleb Peterson presumably playing the original Joe Jules Bledsoe. Yes the part was written for Paul Robeson but a conflict prevented him from originating it on Broadway. However in a breathtakingly illadvised decision because of his voice type rather than his ethnic background the film ends with a young Frank Sinatra reprising it. This may have been done to show how universal Kern's music is and it must be admitted that Frank gives an impressive accounting of it with his fabled breath control and firmlyheld long note. In the long run the song belonged to Robeson even if he later mangled the words to fit his political beliefs. Yes I heard Robeson sing it at New York's City College and I can attest to that!Though I didn't think much of the biographical sections of the film I must admit the music was wellserved especially by Angela Lansbury Lena Horne Tony Martin Dinah Shore Judy Garland as Marilyn Miller. and others. It is not likely this cast will ever be equaled.I was wrong about this apparently. Hammerstein A lefty himself! revised the words thus giving credence to the old expression If it ain't broke don't fix it!".

The musical numbers are great. Interesting that Kathryn Grayson sings Magnolia from Show Boat 5 years before she played the film role. Lena Horne is ideal as Julie a pity she couldn't have played her in the 1951 film and Judy Garland is her inimitable self as Marilyn Miller. Angela Lansbury was always on call when a London cockney was needed and the young Frank Sinatra probably impressed everyone with Ol' Man River even if it would have been more appropriate to have a black singer.I watched this on TCM yesterday 24 April 2006 and despite the inevitable datedness of the film the technicolour shone through and the songs are simply immortal.

	schema:reviewBody "This biographical movie about the life and music of Jerome Kern has a number of good sequences that make it worth watching. A great deal of the movie consists simply of recreations of stage numbers from Kern's many musicals and indeed these account for many of the best parts of the movie. It also adds a light and highly stylized account of his career which is often bland but occasionally has some nice moments.It starts with Kern at the height of his popularity attending the opening of Show Boat and it features a lengthy staging of portions of that show. From there it has Kern telling the story of his career up to that point his work with a fictional mentor and later with collaborator Oscar Hammerstein and his marriage. These episodes are frequently interlaced with more musical numbers of varying lengths.The pattern works well enough in general as something of a slight variant of the usual musical format. The main flaw is that it is really a bit too long for the material it contains. Much of it has little real substance as a story and it works better as light entertainment. It does at times touch on some real issues most particularly in following the mentor's daughter as she grows up.Robert Walker is solid as Kern and Van Heflin gets some good moments portraying the wise slightly grouchy mentor. But some of the best moments are provided not by any of the main characters but by stars like Judy Garland Lena Horne and June Allyson who appear in the musical numbers. Most of these are enjoyable and a couple of them are showstoppers. They probably provide the main reason for watching the movie as a whole.".

Most of these are enjoyable and a couple of them are showstoppers. They probably provide the main reason for watching the movie as a whole.";

It could have got another bump by allocating the entire time to performances  there was time for over twice as many songs and there's no problem finding enough good Kern songs to fill the time. Kern wrote well over 1000 songs and though of course not all are memorable finding 50 or 100 good ones is easy.But the choice and arrangements are nearly random. The order in which the songs are presented makes little musical or dramatic sense. They are done by a variety of performers with no consistency. The time after Show Boat is mostly ignored  hey folks Kern was actively writing for another 15 years and did his best work from Show Boat on. So even had the movie contained a full three hours of music the best I could call it would be a haphazard revue with very good performers and memorable songs.The worst as others have pointed out is the story line. To make it clear THIS STORY LINE IS ALMOST ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS. Oh of course the shows mentioned are accurately described. But I own a biography of Kern and the name Hessler does not appear  the character of Jim Hessler is totally fictitious. Kern's wife Eva was British but the circumstances of their meeting do not resemble the movie. It's probably true that Kern just missed sailing on the Lusitania but for totally different reasons Frohman planned the trip for both of them and Kern overslept. Etc etc ad nauseum. Why bother? The movie would have been much improved by letting the music speak for itself.Edward".

	schema:headline " It has its moments but on balance it seems to me to be overproduced and dull in the narrative";
	schema:reviewBody "What an odd insectinamber musical Till the Clouds Roll By a somewhat biographical film about Jerome Kern now seems. It freezes in time all the weaknesses and some of the strengths of an MGM musical style that has long passed from the scene. Kern was one of the giants of American songwriting. It's no exaggeration to say that he was the great bridge between the European operetta style of early Broadway musicals and the completely home grown and energetic style which came from Gershwin Rodgers Berlin and Porter. His and Oscar Hammerstein II's Show Boat in 1927 was a turning point in American theater history. Fittingly enough the movie opens with an 18minute series of songanddance excerpts from Show Boat. It's the best thing about the movie. From there on we're in for a series of largely overproduced Kern production numbers featuring a list of MGM stars interrupted by dull narrative fictional key characters and some terribly corny dialogue. Look down at that city Jerry says Victor Herbert to Kern one night in New York after Kern has been shaken by the death of an important person in his life. It's made up of millions of people Herbert continues and music has played a part in all their lives...lullabies...love songs...hymns...anthems. Kern gazes down at the city. Must be pretty wonderful Mr. Herbert to realize that people you don't even know and never will know are singing your songs and all of them asking for more Victor Herbert music. It makes me feel grateful Jerry Herbert says and very humble. One of these days you'll find out for yourself how it feels. This is the kind of dialogue that tells you the writers don't think much of the audience. Unfortunately and with the exception of Van Heflin in the fictional role of Kern's friend and mentor the actors give in my opinion almost uniformly flat performances in handling the story line. Robert Walker who has to carry the movie as Jerome Kern comes across as so wise understanding and dignified that it's too easy to lose sight of a talented actor. Walker excelled at playing charming almost innocent and often amusingly subversive young men. Later he showed he could play charming and notsoinnocent psychopaths. Here the role gives him no room or air. It's difficult to believe he didn't break out laughing after shooting some of his scenes. The movie features at least 20 production numbers ranging from that 18minute Show Boat excerpt to snippets of Kern's songs. The numbers for me are at their best when they are presented moreorless directly without all those MGM production values. Lena Horne is terrific singing Why Was I Born? Lucille Bremer and Van Johnson have fun with a nightclub number of I Won't Dance. Ray MacDonald and June Allyson do nice jobs with Till the Clouds Roll By Leave It to Jane and Cleopaterer. Angela Lansbury is saucy and smooth doing a Cockney number. Judy Garland playing Marilyn Miller has two major numbers both directed by her thenhusband Vincente Minnelli which are so glossy and powerful they almost bring the movie to a halt. But we also have to endure Kathryn Grayson with her shrill vibrato Tony Martin a hugely skilled singer but in my view mannered and selfaware and Gower Champion looking frozen and almost grim as he dances with Cyd Charisse. In between these extremes are a variety of other numbers most of which are worth watching. Kern died before the movie was completed so Arthur Freed and company shot a kind of tribute to Kern to close the movie. Many of the stars who had appeared earlier in the film shot parts of Kern's songs that he wrote after Show Boat. Freed put these together in a sort of staged medley. The sequence seems awkward to me. Everyone is dressed in white. The male singers and dancers wear red bow ties with their white tuxes. The set is a kind of white weddingcake tower that floats. The sequence and the movie ends with a skinny young Frank Sinatra in a white tux standing on a white pillar in front of a whitegarbed orchestra singing Ol' Man River. Till the Clouds Roll By has some virtues but on balance it suffers greatly from two things. The narrative storyline is far too reverential and cloying. Second as with all the other filmed musical biographies of the great American songwriters  such as Rodgers  Hart Gershwin and Cole Porter  great chunks of the story are false. How good it would have been if the studios had trusted the audience enough to eliminate the false drama in these biographies and used the time to put in more examples of the composers' great songs.".

Maybe Robert Walker is no more convincing as Jerome Kern but it hardly matters. After all at least MGM's greatest interest in the presentation of the spectacular musical numbers did avert the possible deadly insignificance of overwhelming life detail of the great composer a huge financial risk due to the big budget and the public ever hungry for a spectacular musical from MGM.  Jerome Kern died during the production of the film so in all it became a tribute to his life and his impact on music for four decades rather than the supposed dramatic life story. However with romance tragedy and plenty of glamour colour songs and anyone contract star with a reasonably minor name not already involved in more than two projects at the studios MGM proved as the king of the Hollywood musical they could get any story to boot.As with the majority of musicals the actual story was the second priority. Despite knowing nothing about Jerome Kern other than his great music contribution the most part of it is not believable other than the creation of fictional conflict and all in the controlled environment of the studio. Yet the songs musical direction and all the other elements are first rate. Perhaps the only complaint could be that Gene Kelly is missing.And in the grand MGM manner the musical highlights make up for it all and there are plenty of them. Beginning with the opening of the first 'real' musical of the American theatre SHOW BOAT Kathryn Grayson Tony Martin Virginia O'Brien Caleb Peterson and Lena Horne perform the superb musical within the musical also allowing a glimpse of the superb Lena Horne as Julie had she not lost the role to an unconvincing Ava Gardner in the actual 1951 film remake.Judy Garland as the legendary Marilyn Miller performs her two numbers Who? and Look for the Silver Lining brilliantly. Frank Sinatra Dinah Shore and June Allyson are also memorable performers within the musical.With the inclusion of approximately two dozen musical numbers and additional dancing sequences TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY despite its faults with the facts of the concerned subject matter is a prime example of MGM's creative musical grandeur and brilliance.TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY is extremely likeable viewing entertainment similar to sitting down at a soda fountain for a couple of hours with Judy Garland Robert Walker Frank Sinatra Lena Horne Tony Martin Kathryn Grayson June Allyson Cyd Charisse Virginia O'Brien Gower Champion Lucille Bremer Van Johnson Angela Lansbury Van Heflin and in short any employee at the MGM studios and enjoying the sight.

	schema:reviewBody "A lavish multistar MGM tribute to the music of Jerome Kern produced by the legendary Arthur Freed. Notably absent are MGM luminaries Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly who could have been used to good effect.Musical performances are interspersed by dramatic scenes relating to Kern's life. The musical performances begin with highlights from Kern's masterpiece Showboat with Tony Martin Kathryn Grayson Virginia O'Brien Lena Horne and Caleb Peterson as lead singers backed up by large gaudy choruses.Horne's rendition of Can't Help Loving Dat Man of Mine is especially notable. The middle part of the film features other songs from Kern's preHollywood period. Highlights include 3 energetic song and dance numbers inluding the title song led by winsome June Allyson along with Ray McDonald as her beau. I especially liked the Cleopatterer number. Judy Garland is excellent as Marilyn Miller singing a somber Look For the Silver Lining followed by an exuberant circuslocated rendition of Sunny then another exuberant production to Who?. Lucille Bremer a dance specialist now also appears initially as a rival to Garland later as a nightclub performer solo and with Van Johnson. Dina Shore's solo renditions of They'll Never Believe Me and The Last Time I Saw Paris seem datedly tame.The last part of the film features a string of hit songs from Kern's later years composing for Hollywood productions mostly sung by various Showboat leads. The stage setup is the same for all involving singing without dancing. All costumes and the background and props are white very unusual for a Technicolor film! Initially Bremer singsdubbedwith a chorus symbolizing that she finally made it to the top of her profession without Kern's explicit backing. Sinatra encores Ol' Man River as the finale. Many think it incongruous that he sing this in an all white outfit atop a pedicel. Perhaps but I don't think you have to be splattered with Mississippi mud to do a credible rendition.Especially the last portion was sung with great gusto making a great ending to the film.I was surprised by the inclusion of 'Frozen Face' Virginia O'Brien whose trademark deadpan singing style may have endeared audiences of the time as a novelty but I found disconcerting. Each singer is on a tall pedicel at various heights. In the fade out the camera gradually changes from a closeup of Sinatra to a wideangle view of the whole stage which we now see resembles a Neuchwansteinlike castle with the pedicels representing various towers and which appears to be floating in the sky presumably symbolizing Hollywood as a pristine fastasyland a very clever ending!The cinematography was outstanding throughout.Now as to the nonmusical portions of the film which many reviewers find less than enthralling and of little biographical accuracy Actually I found the dramatic portions generally entertaining although a greater comedic element would have been useful. Robert Walker is fine by me as Kern as is Van Heflin as his fictional song composing buddy who fills in for Kern's various lyricists. His young daughter Sally serves to lighten some of the drama portions. We could have used an additional musical buddy with greater comedic input such as Gene Kelly or Van Johnson for example. ..Lucille Bremer's lovehatelove relationship with Walker's Kern playing Sally as a young woman largely substitutes for the all too common romantic and professional ups and downs between the main characters in musicals of this period. Although little known today Bremer served as Astaire's main dancing partner in several films or revues but was essentially dropped by MGM after her last film with Astaire bombed at the box office. Dorothy Patrick plays Kern's wife initially reluctant to commit as his instantaneous girlfriend discovered in the English countryside quite a different environment than Kern's familiar Manhattan world.As to historical accuracy Although the details are wrong Kern did meet his future wife on an excursion into the English countryside feeling an immediate attraction. Charles Frohman was a kingpin of NY legitimate theater in the early 20th century and did die in the Lusitania sinking. Kern was supposed to sail with Frohman but overslept missing the boat probably saving his life. Paul Maxey makes a convincing lookalike for Victor Herbert during his brief appearance. It was Kern who tried to interest Hammerstein and Zeigfeld in Showboat not the other way around as depicted in the film. The film tries but not too successfully to convey the revolutionary contributions of Kern to the nature of American musical theater. It completely fails to convey the truly revolutionary nature of the subject matter of Showboat for American musical theater. This very risky show was produced by Ziegfeld and opened at the Zeigfeld theater.Five years later Kathryn Grayson would reprise her role as Magnolia in the Technicolor remake of Showboat. Howard Keel replaced Tony Martin as Gaylord. I prefer Kathryn's limited performance here as she looks much more credible in playing a supposed 18 year old. Lena Horne probably should have been cast as the mulatto Julie in place of the nonmulatto Ava Gardner giving her a chance to repeat her more spirited Can't Help Loving Dat Man of Mine.".

Horne of course was performing the role of torch singer Julie and was approached by the writers themselves to perform in a stage revival of the show possibly making history as the first ever lightskinned woman of color to play a fictional lightskinned woman of color but could not due to her contract with MGM. Since she never got the actual film of SHOW BOAT either this 3 minutes of her essaying Can't Help Lovin' That Man in a lavender gown with tears in her eyes makes one wonder what might have been. Also sleek is Gower Champion not yet teamed with wife Marge dancing Smoke Gets In your Eyes with Cyd Charisse for about 45 seconds.

If you don't find it all that fascinating you can always fastforward through some of the songs you may not like.What it is simplyput is a biography of Broadway pioneer Jerome Kern. Robert Walker does a fine job playing him and Van Heflin plays Kern's likable friend. The two guys never argue they just help each other out. That's also nice to see and is rare in a film. The only person who acts badly is the grownup version of Heflin's little girl played by Lucille Bremer and she gets scolded for her selfish temper tantrums and then turns for the good in the end.Most review books and reviewers here just emphasize the singing talent in this film and the fact that so many of Kern's songs are performed by famous entertainers but I liked the story better than the musical numbers most of which I just found as fair. However it was nice to see a young Dinah Shore Angela Lansbury Lena Horne Frank Sinatra among others. The talent in this movie is prestigious. The only thing missing was a great dancer someone like Fred Astaire.The first 19 minutes features a stage version of Show Boat and that too was just fair. Then the story settles in and songs follow here and there. This is one of those 1940s Technicolor films so you know the colors and bright and impressive. When I wrote this there wasn't a goodquality DVD or tape of this but apparently there is now. That's good news.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just finished watching Tuya's marriage at the Berlin Film Festival and would rate it 810. The movie deals with a herder woman in Inner Mongolia who decides to divorce because her husband is sick and unable to care for her and the family. Since she still loves him any prospective new husband must promise to care for her and the kids as well as for her old husband.The plot may sound a bit constructed but it actually works remarkably well. The pictures are great and after D. Byambasuren's rather static movies this is finally a drama set in the steppes. The most important thing is probably that the movie takes its subjects seriously. Maybe a bit too seriously at times but not that seriously that it disturbs the movie.So why not giving it 1010? I missed the Mongolian language. Of course language isn't everything see Mongolian Pingpong or Apocalypto but when even the drinking habits are dealt with in greatest detail why didn't they bother to find a cast that can speak Mongolian? I asked the director about why they used Chinese that's what you go on film festivals for but his answer was not really convincing. I suppose some opportunistic reason like the main actress can't speak Mongolian. Anyway this only means that you can as well enjoy this movie in a dubbed version.In short Definitely recommended.".

The story like that in each of these other films is very simple  a woman's husband is incapacitated and she seeks a new man who will support the old.The cinematography is beautiful with the harshness of the inner Mongolian landscape captured aesthetically. Dialogue is sparse and the film is very observational documenting a way of life that is gradually receding into the past. The herding and riding of animals the digging of wells the visits from potential suitors and other aspects of rural life are nicely captured and contrast against the oncoming tide of modernity.Thematically the film has more in common with Breaking the Waves 1996 my favourite Lars von Trier film. There is both humour and heartbreak as the story unfolds. I didn't find the film quite as effective as Weeping Camel but a nice bit of cultural diversity that's worth seeing.".

	schema:headline " Tuya's Marriage A rare window into rural China";
	schema:reviewBody "An unexpected gem in the middle of the desert this quiet drama proves itself fully deserving of its Golden Bear at the 2007 Berlin annual film festival.Sixth generation Mainland Chinese film director Wang Quanan once again bands with actor and expartner of ten years Nan Yu to turn his attention to the rural side of life in China a focal point of his 2004 film The Story of Ermei which told the story of a young Shaanxi peasant girl. This time 'Tuya's Marriage' takes us into the depths of the vast and arid grasslands of Inner Mongolia. Though its plot is fairly straight forward and dialogue simple this quiet and understated film stands strong in its realistic portrayal of rural life natural acting style and breath taking landscape. Her husband crippled after digging a well strong and persevering Tuya must labour herding sheep and lugging water from a faraway waterhole to keep her husband and two young children alive. But the young and still beautiful Tuya can no longer be the sole carrier of her family's burden she is suffering from lumbar fatigue caused by over exhaustion and faces possible lower body paralysis. Her husband agrees that she must find a new suitor to marry. This doesn't prove to be so easy though as Tuya still faithful to her old husband is resolute that whoever wishes to marry her must also be prepared to care for him too. Mainland Chinese born actor Nan Yu is well fitted in her role as the independent Tuya. The fact that Nan Yu spent several months living in rural Mongolia prior to filming has given her a great understanding and confidence in the role and comes off as a genuine Inner Mongolian grasslands shepherdess. Tuya's costume potentially could have swallowed many actors whole she is swathed in numerous bulky layers of clothing and wrapped tightly in a head scarf but Nan Yu's expressive face works to bring Tuya to life. Tuya is an independent incredibly strong woman. She is a shepard to the men around her her disabled husband Baotoer her likable but foolish friend Shenge who always falls on bad luck and even her younger son. She has an incredibly strong loyalty towards her husband The only way I'd leave him is if I became worse than him and for his sake turns down many suitors who could have been a way out of poverty for her. But there are a few times when we get to see another side of Tuya's tough exterior. My favourite scene is when we see her taken away from the farm and work sitting together with her friend Shenge in his brand new truck. Orange light shines on them from the setting sun and as they look forward into the distance Shenge speaks of the uncertainties of the future. For a moment we see a fragile young woman no different from ourselves who is lost in a big and changing world.If Nan Yu is the star of the movie then the landscape would have to be her costar. Absolutely stunning with it's never ending barren desert and clear blue skies the long shots show the vastness of the land and isolation of the characters. The women in the film wear brightly coloured head scarves pink red purple green as a way of expressing them selves and these headscarves are a striking contrast against the often dust coloured backdrop.The use of music in this film is also truly effective. Traditional string instruments are often used along with woman singing. The music is only used at the saddest times in the film and is combined with long enduring shots of the wild and desolate landscape. This creates a haunting feeling of loneliness and forlornness. Both landscape and music become symbolic of Tuya's situation she is stranded with no solution in sight. Tuya's Marriage generally fits into the drama genre. The film deals with realistic and totally believable characters and explores how social issues such as poverty and alcoholism bring these characters into conflict with themselves and the others around them. Poverty makes rural farm life in China tough and relatively simple tasks such as watering the sheep become difficult because lack of adequate equipment Tuya must travel 30miles a day just to fetch sufficient water. The question of day to day survival forces characters to make decisions that go against every part of their beingit becomes a cruelly ironic when the only way for Tuya to care for her disabled husband Baotoer who she loves is to divorce him. Several of the characters look to alcohol to numb the pain. An older chainsmoking woman worn out by life's trials says I'm raising six by myself with no man if I didn't drink I don't know what I'd do. In a sense Tuya's Marriage also becomes a documentary of Mongolian culture and traditional ceremonies often putting a lot of focus on the landscape the traditional ceremonies and dress the music and traditional foods such as headtotail lamb and milk tea. This makes the film a fascinating experience but my only possible complaint is that this overtakes the films over focus on showing intimate interactions between the characters. Beautiful and affecting and often scattered with moments of humour and tenderness Tuya's Wedding gives us a window into a seldom travelled world through the struggles of one young woman.".

An older chainsmoking woman worn out by life's trials says I'm raising six by myself with no man if I didn't drink I don't know what I'd do. In a sense Tuya's Marriage also becomes a documentary of Mongolian culture and traditional ceremonies often putting a lot of focus on the landscape the traditional ceremonies and dress the music and traditional foods such as headtotail lamb and milk tea. This makes the film a fascinating experience but my only possible complaint is that this overtakes the films over focus on showing intimate interactions between the characters. Beautiful and affecting and often scattered with moments of humour and tenderness Tuya's Wedding gives us a window into a seldom travelled world through the struggles of one young woman.";

But the way this picture filmed Tuya's story Tuya's camel compared to Sen'ge's motorcycle and truck and the rich suitor's Benz and the trip from the desert to the hotel closer to the city viewers can see what China is really like now.I believe that besides telling Tuya's story which is based on an actual story the director also wants to show viewers how the semimodern Chinese society works and how it has an impact on the lives of people living in different parts of China. Tradition and landscape really isn't the point in this movie there are many details in here regarding to the characters' daily lives that viewers can compare to themselves which I believe would be interesting to do.

The story is interesting womancentered Yu Nan's acting is excellent the social commentary is interesting the non urban setting is a refreshing change from the usual stuff without making a travel guide of the film at all. It also combines drama and humor in a nice way. It doesn't become melodramatic thank God. The end of the story is poised between happy and sad which is how life is in the majority of the cases. Now some specific negative pointsI would prefer the film to be in the Mongolian language too.The family looks very poor they only have a small herd of sheep yet they own a camel a horse and a donkey. I'm not an expert on this but it looks as too much to me compared with the number of the incomegenerating sheep.The scene where Shenge catches up with the Mercedes on the highway by riding on a horse is absurd. What's more Shenge didn't even know the whereabouts of Tuya and her prospective husband at that moment.When Tuya Shenge Maoter and the kids return home from the above failed matching Tuya starts again herding her sheep and all. But since they had previously left their home supposedly forever they should have sold everything sheep camel house etc. So that's absurd too.At the final wedding scene it's impossible that Maoter the exhusband would disrupt the proper procedure of the ceremony by starting to sing his own tune. Why? Well because first he himself had prodded Tuya since the beginning to find a new husband second he later actively approved of this specific husband namely Shenge third earlier in the film this Shenge had practically saved his life after his suicide attempt in the asylum and then he had even brought his wife back. And Maoter is a very good quiet logical person. So his reaction is illogical and unbelievable even allowing for the effect of the additional cup of alcohol  too much is at stake. The screenwriters should have found here another idea to convey their message that even after this happy ending life will not be cloudless within the new household. Tuya's boy fighting with a neighbor boy because the latter scolded him for having two fathers is on the contrary a much more successful idea that serves the same purpose.".

In Mongolia the child needs to do a lot of work that I did not even try before and they are lacking water resource. Also their transportation is poor. Tuya's Marriage also shows their attitude of living they do not give up they still want to stay at their home instead of going to the city. Tuya is a strong woman his husband is paralytic so she needs to take care of her family by herself she goes thousands of miles to get water and depasture sheeps every day even she has physical problems. She divorced her husband in order to give a better condition to her family she says everyone wants to marry me needs also need to support her exhusband.

It is bad enough that it has no action or comedy but when you add in the factors of it being so long and repetitive it becomes almost unbearable. All the suitors who hear that Tuya needs another man in her life have little to offer in the category of love. They don't seem to like Tuya for who she is it looks like there just there to get a wife. This is really all I have to say about the movie i don't recommend it.".

	schema:reviewBody "The film Tuya's Marriage is not a happy one. The movie begins and ends with the same scene of her eventual wedding day with her youngest son fighting with another boy who sneers at him for having two fathers. Tuya's marriage portrays a world that apart from its hardship is thoroughly recognizable. Its characters are motivated by the same needs for companionship and material wellbeing. And the same wants of greed lust jealousy and despair  that drive most people. Tuya after breaking up the fight retreats from the celebration to reflect. Tuya protagonist is physically disabled and married to and in love with a disabled peasant Ba'toer. Tuya Yu Nan is financially forced to divorce him and find a new husband to support herself her 'ex' husband and their two children. She is called upon by suitors from near and far when word spreads of her decision to remarry. The film observes the fascinating rites of courtship and the unsentimental deal making by Tuya who knows what she wants and what she has to do to get it. After a series of men refuse to look after Ba'toer Tuya finds herself torn between a Baolier a divorced childhood schoolmate of Tuya who is newly wealthy having struck oil or a friend who promises to marry her once he finds and divorces his wife. Baolier's money and lust may represents the forces of technological change that is consuming the region. In Baolier's marriage proposal he agrees to take care of Bater by putting him in a nursing home and Tuya agrees. However it's not a good enough deal for Bater. Soon after arriving at his new him he starts feeling abandoned then pitifully gets drunk and slashes his wrists. The ending like I said is not a happy one. Nonetheless I'd recommend it to another friend or teacher.".

The plot followed the title character a shepherd named Tuya who is married to her husband Batoer. Batoer who is disabled is unable to work as a shepherd and when an injury also leaves Tuya unable to work she is forced to divorce Batoer and remarry someone who can provide for him. After numerous men refuse to look after him Tuya is torn between Baolier a wealthy recentlydivorced man who works for an oil company and Shenge her neighbor whose wife has recently left him. Baolier proves to not be as good of a man as he seems as Batoer tries to commit suicide and Baolier doesn't tell Tuya about it. Shenge also seems to not be who he seems at first but turns out to have been digging the well as a source of income for Tuya even if it meant hurting himself in the process. However the relationship between Shenge and Tuya instead of easily coming together was made difficult by Tuya rejecting him then accepting his advances then rejecting him again. I feel like it would've had a bit more closure if the audience knew who she decided to marry but it was never made clear. I'd only give this movie 3 out of 5 starsit was okay but it wasn't amazing by any means.".

These films have almost a documentary approach to them. As far as the cinematography goes they resemble each other a lot in my mind. There were a lot of scenes that were just very zoomed out and captured a lot of the bleak landscape that their countries contained. I can't remember much of the storyline of Ixcanul but this movie similarly followed the life of a female farmer named Tuya. Her husband ha sheen crippled and can't help her support their family. Tuya herself is later injured and is advised to stay away from intense manual labor to avoid further injury. Her husband divorces her and allows her to look for a husband that can surely support everyone in the family. She is caught between two suitors and the movie ends with both of them fighting and her leaving the scene. If I can remember correctly in Ixcanul the main character is also injured and later hospitalized. she is stuck with one suitor and is forced to marry him with no choice whereas Tuya has some freedom in that she can select between two.".

I think watching it again would give me a better understanding of what I have sees and possibly catch more funny moments.Something I found interesting is how Tuya is able to arrange her own marriage. Usually when you think of an arranged marriage it is the parents not the persons getting married who sets up the marriage. Not only does she have control of who she marries but she also discusses terms and agreements within the marriage. The ending is also interesting because it is unclear and keeps you guessing.

	schema:reviewBody "Tuya's Marriage is very interesting as it looks at the life of Mongolian life in today's lifestyle. The story started with the ending and then they all started to tell the beginning. I do not know much about the Mongolian lifestyle but it seems like a very rural experience that is met by the need for water. The main character Tuya is a herder of sheep and they sell the sheep to make their money. One problem the family has is there is never any water around them so they need to go and get it with their camel. That is quite the nuisance as they have to only use a certain amount and once they are out they have to go and get more water. To solve this problem her first husband tried to build a well outside of the house yet injures himself throughout the process. The well is not finished and now Tuya has to do all of the work and take care of her two kids and her husband as he is crippled now and can not work. Tuya goes and finds many suitors once she finds the first one it does not go well. The next suitor is named Shenge and is very close with the family as he tries to build a well outside of the house too. I will not get into too much detail as you should see the movie to find out but then it ends with no one knowing who Tuya really marries. It is the day of her wedding and her first husband gets in a fight with Shenge and no one truly knows who she marries. I believe she marries Shenge but no one knows for sure. I would recommend seeing this movie to someone if they are interested in the rural life of Mongolians.".

It also made me think about the various issues that people face in different regions of the world. Tuya's issue was that her husband was crippled and she was at risk of becoming crippled so she needed to marry another man in order to support her family however this proved to be very emotional for Tuya and her husband Bater. It was a slower paced movie but the visuals were very beautiful and intriguing. The director did a good job of portraying the landscape of Mongolia and setting up the scene so the viewer got a sense of the typical way of life in Mongolia.

This movie is just so fascinating to me for those fun aspects and qualities it contains that I could enjoy it on any watch. It has the right amount of funny that kept my eyes on the TV the whole time and my mouth wide open with laughter and it seems many people forget that sometimes that's all we need from a movie to truly love and enjoy it.With Bette Midler and Sarah Jessica Parker being some of my favorite actresses I decided that this was going to be a great Halloween flick to begin with and it certainly turned out to be for all the three witches put smiles on my faces and even though this movie had some humorous features without the main three women casted in the film they really were the most enjoyable and lovable of the film and most of the reason it is as enjoyable and lovable as it is honestly. After watching this movie Kathy Najimy actually turned out to be my favorite character though because she was just plain out hilarious as her ditsy self like when she flew on a vacuum. All the Sanderson Sisters turned out to be funny and special in their own way and like I said Midler Parker and Najimy's portrayal of them is really what makes this film for me even though the story and other characters are just as entertaining and fun. Hocus Pocus is one of the movies that people just have to see at least once if they haven't because after they see it they will want to watch it again and again because it really is one of my favorite movies in general and I hope more people will discover it and view it as greatly as I do. This movie is a magnificent entertaining really great and laughable adventure that will leave you in awe. I recommend it to everyone.".

I really hope that Disney or some company rereleases the DVD version of this great movie.".

And some say the actors aren't good at being witches because they're not scary either again not supposed to be. Winnie Midler Mary Najimy and Sarah Parker are supposed to be villains that make people laugh not frighten people.The three witches themselves are so well developed. Winnie is the leader who is seriously evil and wants to steal the lives of children to redeem her own.Mary is the suck up of the three She is always trying to please Winnie and make sure that Sarah doesn't ruin Winnie's happiness. She is always making sure that Winnie is please with herself and whenever she is upset she offers Winne to allow her to hit her to see if that will make her feel better.And finally the youngestditsy spidereating Sister Sarah. She is always getting herself side tracked. In the party when she is supposed to be looking for Max Allison and Danni Winnie catches her making out with one of the boys at the party. She never has a clue and is always caught wondering what is going on the whole time when she is turned young at the beginning her first words are Oh boys will love me! So in the long run this movie in my opinion will always be a Halloween classic. All the Halloween movies are either too scary too corny or too gory. During the Halloween season this movie is one of few movies that you'll see on TV Besides the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown.. that doesn't involve blood and gore in it.".

Bette Midler Kathy Najimy and Sarah Jessica Parker all team up here as the Sanderson sisters 3 witch sisters raised from the dead from on of the teenagers. This Disney movie is honestly one of my absolute favorites by Disney! Hocus Pocus is a great entertaining and family friendly movie for all ages to enjoy. You'll laugh your ass off watching this fun flick. Also the special effects are very good and cool to see lots of flying on brooms shooting lightning and more..... The plot is well constructed as well it'll make u laugh cry and just have a lot of fun! All the actors do a great job with the film Bette midler in particular! She was amazing as the lead sister Winnifred Sanderson. So families at Halloween time I've got a good one for you! And there isn't really anything inappropriate in it the word virgin is used a few times it's kinda integral to the plot. And Danny's mom is dressed up as Madonna wearing big pointed shells on her breasts. Other than that you should be all set!! 1010 for Hocus Pocus flawless Halloween film!".

As sad as this is I use to remember EVERY single word in this movie when I was a little whipper snapper and I use to speak along with the cast! This movie sparked up those memories!! It's a classic film for anyone I would say. I love how it still makes me laugh and I love singing along to the classic numbers I put a spell on you and come little children.An awesome awesome film about 3 witches who come back to life after 300 years of being dead. If I have children when I get abit older I will Definitely be showing this one to them as this is NOT a film to miss! And I didn't actually realise that the little girl in the movie is Thora Birch well I did I just didn't pay attention to the fact. She's a great actress and even then at such a young age! Just go ahead and watch it...doesn't need to be saved for halloween it's a great film that can be watched all year round ".

There is nothing deep or complicated but a tale of legends and children who dare to play with forbidden objects. The line  I told you so is probably one that one could hear over and over. Instead we just tag along and enjoy the various episodes dealing with black cats vengeful witches and adventurous children.Back in the time of Salem three witches are executed leaving enough proof of their existence and becoming the heart of the many legends in a small Northeastern town. There's nothing really scary or threatening here. Yes the witches are back for revenge and speak of having people for dinner. However as the lines are delivered by Midler with a twinkle in her eyes and her sisters ham it up for the camera Najimi being more successful than Parker the comedy is broad the type that children will enjoy the most and adults can be willing participants to feel like kids again.I was mostly impressed by the quality of the production obviously filmed in a studio yet good enough to give the illusion of a Halloween fairy tale. You will see witches flying some double entendre for the adults and a hint of zombies. Just tune in get some pop corn and enjoy a bit of magic.".

	schema:headline " A tone of improbable goofiness";
	schema:reviewBody "If you grew up in the nineties you've probably seen Hocus Pocus a few hundred times. I think most every generation gets their own kidfriendly horrorlite Halloween movie. Gremlins probably filled that role for a lot of eighties kids and hopefully Coraline is the pick for the modern 610 crowd. Hocus Pocus is nowhere near as good as either of those movies but I've seen it a bunch anyway. Probably more since my Mom has long been a Bette Midler fan.Of course even goofy kid's flicks like this have new information to reveal. I had no idea that Mick Garris veteran horror screenwriter cowrote this one. Nor did I know that Doug Jones probably the most famous creature actor today played the zombie in this. Was there any other new information waiting me? The movie actually holds up alright. The decent premise is classic horror stuff. Set in Salem of course the childstealing Sarandon sisters were executed but not before doing a few things Turning a local teen into an immortal black cat draining his little sister's life force and more pressingly placing a curse on the town. Should a virgin ever light the black candle they will return. Of course this happens. Recently relocated teen Max dragging his little sister and high school crush with him lights that candle revives the witch sisters and leads to a bunch of wacky antics.The cast and characters make the film far more likable then it would have been otherwise. Bette Midler goes far over the top as lead witch Winnifred. Her makeup is cartoonish including frizzy red hair perpetually pursed lips and comically exaggerated buckteeth. Midler's acting is on the same level. She hoots hollers squeals and delivers every line with comicstripe panache. Even her facial expressions and body language are calculated for goofiness. She plays off the other two sisters nicely. Sarah Jackson Parker before everyone started calling her a horse brings a manic energy to the part. She jumps around repeats dialogue and actually conveys a wacky sexiness. Kathy Najimi is similarly silly acting like an overgrown dofus.Much of the humor comes from typical fish out of water shenanigans. The witches are baffled and occasionally delighted by asphalt a bus TV remotes and the concept of Halloween. Some of this is more entertaining then others. The interaction with a horny bus driver or Garry Marshall dressed as the Devil get genuine laughs. The trio constantly being fooled by fire sprinklers or headlights proves less so. Some of the overly goofy gags prove better then others. The witches having their brooms snatched by young lookalikes is amusing. Them jumping on mops and vacuums are the sorts of goofy kid's movie jokes you'd hope the movie would avoid. Midler and crew deliver their frequently corny dialogue like pros never loosing that ridiculous cartoon tone.It's not uncommon for the kids in the kids' movies to be punchworthy. Hocus Pocus mostly avoids that too. The movie's theme boils down to one of sibling love. Surprisingly this is incorporated organically into the story. Binx the talking cat lost his sister and is driven by the hope of being reunited with her. Max comes to appreciate and love his sister over the course of the story. It fits in and isn't overdone. The improbably named Ormi Katz finds a decent balance between grouchy angsty teenager and proactive protagonist. A tiny Thora Birch also comes close to annoying. Her emotional interactions with the brother and the talking cat make the character relatively real. Vanessa Shaw is lovely and shows some genuinely comedic skills as Max's love interest. Only the ridiculous bully characters overdo it.The movie couldn't cast Bette Midler in the lead without getting her to sing. The whole movie's tone of improbable goofiness is best summed up when a threehundred yearold witch walks onstage and sings a choreographed songanddance number. Yet that's probably the most memorable moment in the film. The zombie antics with his head and fingers getting knocked off are nicely gruesome for a kid's flick. Hocus Pocus even has a moment of eerie beauty when Parker lures the children of the town away with a siren song. The music is ethereal and the image of hundreds of kids some still in their Halloween costumes walking the streets at night sticks with you. The special effects don't hold up and the whole movie is a goofy trifle. As far as nineties nostalgia go? Hocus Pocus is one of the better examples from my childhood.".

Of course I don't think her work after this film really could be deemed as high quality but she was so funny in this movie that I think she squandered a career of playing sexyditsy roles that would have been spellbinding.".

I don't think Leonard Di Caprio could have outdone Omri Katz and Sex In The City's Sarah Jessica Parker was fantastic playing the dim witted sister Sarah. And who doesn't love Mary Sanderson played by Kathy Najimy? And we can't forget darling little Thora Birch as Dani Dennison! My how she's grown since then.

I have never purchased it because they play it nearly a dozen f!ing times during the month of October. At the same time this film is great year round. I chose this as my first review because I just watched it and feel that the film in underappreciated. This is a charming little film about three Salem witches resurrected from the dead by a teenage virgin whom lights a black flame candle. Max must stop these witched from stealing the souls of children. He does so with the help of his adorable little sister Allison whom he pines over at night and a helpful talking cursed cat called Binx. The casting is absolutely perfect right down to Omri Katz as Max. Bette Midler does a fantastic job as the evil scheming mastermind Winnie. Sarah Jessica Parker plays the flighty dumb and playfully flirty Sarah. She goes back and forth between a hypnotic come hither persona and then will burst into random chants and fits of joy over disturbing things such fresh dead man's toes. Kathy Najimy plays Mary the chubby witch with sometimes wrongfully placed optimism. There are two musical numbers in the film most notably Bette Midler's rendition of I Put a Spell on You which is both humorous and pleasing to the ear. When you watch this film you cannot take it too seriously in fact don't take it seriously at all. You will have a much better viewing experience this way. This film is absurd and clich that's the beauty of it! It is also very comical with laughs for children and adults alike. There is a point in the film where Mary Kathy Najimy's character is flying on a vacuum cleaner. This is just one example that stands out because it has had me cracking up since I was six years  old. Ignore what others say about Hocus Pocus the critics reviews are baloney. I couldn't find something similar to the phrase Hocus Pocus that would be witty and fitting to describe their reviews. Sorry. Baloney it is.This film is marvelous and entertaining for all ages all year round. If you haven't seen it yet go watch it. Then you too will consider it a quirky classic.810".

The plot is interesting because through out the movie three children are going against three witches and they steal their spell book. The low key lighting in the scene before the children enter the school at night creates suspense and a nerveracking image. The part where the witches and the children are inside the movie gets because you can hear the lightning outside and again there's low key lighting but there's a little bit of light from the candles. You can also hear the chandelier squeaky noise and swinging back and forth constantly from the wind. The special effects of the spell casting is cool to see because of the colors that appear on the screen and it has some sort of like lighting sound to it. There's really only medium lighting in the beginning but it makes sense sense it is a Halloween movie. Hocus Pocus is also a comedy. Mostly for children but I still watch it because it's not to scary and just a fun movie to watch with anyone.".

	schema:reviewBody "In the years since its release in 1993 thanks to annual showings on television Hocus Pocus has become something of a Halloween classic. I didn't grow up with the movie and I don't think it is an especially wellcrafted work so I can't necessarily vouch for Hocus Pocus' classic status but what I can vouch for is the movie's wholesome family spirit. This is a lovable little movie the kind that renders any faults moot by the sheer charm of the production. I guess it's not a very good film but its black magic worked on me.I'll keep the summary short. Three witches Bette Midler Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy are resurrected in Salem Massachusetts and they wreak havoc on Halloween night. A small band of kids try to stop them. That's really all the plot you need to know. What's important to consider is that the movie takes place on Halloween and it makes the most of that setting. I've always had a soft spot for Halloween and Halloweenrelated accoutrement Monsters ghouls jackolanterns and the like. So Hocus Pocus appeals to me on the basis of simply being about the holiday and relishing in the spirit of Halloween. It is also one of the few Halloween movies to capture that specific spooky but not scary feeling Halloween night had as a kid. For someone who has long outgrown trickortreating it's an inviting bit of nostalgia.Let's talk about the cast. Has there ever been a more likable bunch of actresses than the three witches here? Midler Parker and Najimy show no pretenses. They are just out there goofing around and having fun. Their performances aren't anything special of course but you can't tell me they didn't add more than their share of cute energy to the proceedings. Speaking of cute energy I have to give a special shoutout to Thora Birch as the young sister who gushes with charm. She's the heart of the movie she's got screen presence and she's a good little actress.Not everyone will see Hocus Pocus the way I do. I have a pesky habit of rooting for movies because they are silly and innocent rather than in spite of. Others find that sort of thing unbearable. In this case Hocus Pocus has two things that distract me from its formulaic kids savetheday plot A lovable cast and Halloween spirit. As dumb as it is I still get the urge to revisit it every October. You could say I fell under its spell.66100".

	schema:reviewBody "The proof is in the pudding! I need to always remind myself of this line. Too many times I have not watched certain movies due to the premise not appealing to me or having seen terrible reviews. Then I have to remind myself of 2 things 1 Most movies nowadays pretty much suck out of the gate AND 2 Many movies of yesteryear actually hold up because they by default have so much going for them genuine dialogue more practical effects better and original stories. There are films that I never dared watch as a kid that I have since revisited that have become personal faves.This Halloween treat HOCUS POCUS 1993 has become a holiday favorite of mine having seen it for the first time marathoning a slew of Halloweenthemed movies. While it's definitely flawed it's funnier than 99.9 of the comedies now. Hell let's just for the even 100! Hocus Pocus is the tale of 3 Salem witch siblings who were persecuted in the 17th century but are revived 300 years later on All Hallows Eve 1993 by the opening of their book of spells by an unwitting teenager named Max skillfully played by Omri Katz of Dallas fame he played the character John Ross Ewing for the longest time frame in the original series. Katz does a commendable job carrying the kid portion of the film but it's the witches themselves who steal the show!The 3 witches are hilariously realized by Bette Midler Winifred Kathy Najimy Mary and Sarah Jessica Parker Sarah. Midler Najimy and Parker are a laugh riot throughout with Midler the crafty witty wisecracking oldest sister Najimy the goofy middle sister and Parker the ditzy youngest sister. I even dare say that as hilarious as Midler and Najimy were it was Parker who stole the show perfectly playing the brainless blonde bombshell! Parker is so effortlessy ditzy and sexy in this I'm surprised she never really played another role like this at any other time in her career. She's almost unrecognizable. Also this is perhaps my favorite of all of Midler's comic performances. She really lets loose here as this is probably her most broad comic role. Midler also makes the best most funny facial expressions. And Najimy's acting choice of making her character slur her speech totally works and would have sunk in the hands of a lesser comedic talent. And I love the way the 3 actresses show the symbiotic relationship of the witches and do things in sync throughout the fim.The kid cast isn't half bad either. The aforementioned Katz is all in and exudes charisma as the putupon teenage newcomer to Salem as his family has just moved from LA to put down roots in the infamous historical town. Katz gets great support from thenchild actress and scenestealer Thora Birch playing Max's precocious younger sister Dani and fashionmodelactress Vinessa Shaw as Max's love interest Allison. Shaw is kind of the weak link among the kids as she is obviously more mature than Katz and it's somewhat of a stretch at times she'd be attracted to Max's clutzy innocent character. Although it's always nice when the nerd gets the girl! Also there are a few memorable minor characters most notably the zombified Billy Butcherson played memorably by Doug Jones and also the 2 teen bullies who harass Max and steal candy from the trickortreaters the bus driver who has the hots for the witches the cop who doesn't believe the kids story about the witches and none other than Garry and Penny Marshall who play a rather creepy married couple. Also there's Thackery the cat! Can't forget his contribution.There are even a couple of musical numbers as Midler gets to show off her singing prowess with a memorable number I Put a Spell on You. Also Parker gets to show off her singing chops with a spellbinding rendition of Come Little Children during the film's climax. The movie boasts an upbeat and fast pace nonstop laughs and 3 iconic comic performances from Midler Najimy and Parker. The actresses comedic chemistry and timing is something to behold. I really enjoyed how Winifred was the brains and her younger sisters Mary and Sarah spent virtually the entire film mimicking her. It was like they were all sharing Winifred's brain! LOL I will say that the kid's storyline kind of lacked the humor when they were on their own and really amped up when they were in the presence of the 3 witches which makes sense as the 3 actresses were noticeably more adept and skilled at comedy and comic timing than the younger ones. But trust me I've seen a lot worse child actors a LOT worse! This is one of those movies that further supports my theory that film critics know jack squat about entertaining movies. Last time I looked comedies were supposed to be FUNNY! If they don't pass that test they fail completely. Thankfully Hocus Pocus succeeds!".

It was a little scary at first but it is just a funny interesting movie now. My favorite character is Winifred because I love the way she acts talks and treats her sisters. This movie is about three witches who died in 1693 and on Halloween night 1993 Max a teenager new to Salem lights the Black Flame Candle which resurrects the three witches. They have to suck the life out of children in order to stay young and survive when the sun comes up the next morning. The entire night Max his sister Dani and his crush Allison try to stop the witches. It's very funny to see the three sisters Winifred Mary and Sarah react to the new world. Best part of the movie Pretty much anything with the witches.Worst part of the movie When Billy is chasing the kids.Recommended for Everyone.Overall I give this movie a 9 out of 10 which in my ratings book is Amazing.".

	schema:reviewBody "For his next to last film Joseph Mankiewicz did his only western and it ain't the west of John Ford or Howard Hawks. There Was A Crooked Man starts with the proposition that every man if given sufficient reason will turn dishonest.Kirk Douglas has never been afraid to appear as evil but next to his performance in The List of Adrian Messenger the screen's never seen him as diabolically evil as Paris Pittman Jr. in There Was A Crooked Man. And it's clear from the start just how bad he is when he shoots the only other gang member after robbing miserly Arthur O'Connell of his half a million dollar fortune that he keeps in the house because of distrust of banks.So nothing that he does after this should surprise us. But Kirk Douglas is a player of incredible charm never more so when used for evil intentions. Eventually he's caught and sent to Territorial prison from where he collects a gang of sorts and plots an escape.A year after the Stonewall Riots homosexuality finally comes to the west and its depicted in two ways. First John Randolph and Hume Cronyn are a pair of aging gay con men who've pulled one con too many and are in the prison with Douglas in the same cell. Randolph's the flighty one but Cronyn as it turns out has more talent and more common sense than just about everyone else in the film. That fact saves their lives.And that's quite a look of lust that repressed prison guard Bert Freed has for young Michael Blodgett who admittedly is quite something to lust after. Blodgett is scheduled to hang at an undetermined date but Freed's willing to give him some special consideration for special favors. Which Blodgett is unwilling to give him.Blodgett's story is the most tragic one of the lot. He's a 17 year old kid who's caught by a most flirtatious girl's father who cries rape. As the father aims his shotgun Blodgett throws a billiard ball and the blow is a fatal one. I've always thought if the kid had a good lawyer he could have gotten off it was self defense. He's really the only innocent in this film.The great moral figure in this is Henry Fonda who's a lawman shot in the performance of his duty and now given the job of prison warden. He's another repressed individual doesn't smoke or drink and looks with particular disdain on sexual promiscuity. Without giving away exactly what Fonda does in the end it seems he has no other choice. Douglas in pulling off the jail break has made a total fool of him. They'll be all kinds of inquiries so for Fonda the self righteous his duty is clear unless he wants to kill himself. Which in some cultures would have been the answer.But There Was A Crooked Man should be seen for what happens to Kirk Douglas. It is one of the most priceless comeuppances ever delivered on screen. Besides Douglas Fonda and others I've mentioned look also for good performances from Warren Oates and Burgess Meredith as another two convicts that Douglas takes into his confidence.Just as man can rise to noble heights on some occasions with a little temptation he can fall. That's the unvarnished message of There Was A Crooked Man.".

	schema:headline " The Judgment of Paris";
	schema:reviewBody "This is an interesting black comedy from Joseph Mankiewicz about the gullibility of man and how greed can corrupt anyone. Henry Fonda is a lawman in typical Fondastyle before WARLOCK and the spaghetti westerns changed his image. He is a firm support for law and order. However he has been shot and left lame by Warren Oates a drunken outlaw. He may have to retire as a result sooner than he expected. At the start of the film we watch how Kirk Douglas Paris Pitman has robbed the home of Arthur O'Connor with his gang. They are killed off in one way or another. Pitman escapes with the money and hides it in a hole full of rattlesnakes. But later he is captured. Pitman is sent to territorial prison where he meets Oates Burgess Meredith as the legendary Missouri Kid Hume Cronym and John Randolph a pair of swindlers who are also a gay couple and others. The warden is Martin Gabel who soon makes it clear that if Douglas wants to be out sooner he needs the warden as a partner. But in a riot Gabel is killed and Fonda is appointed the new warden.Fonda tries to reform the prison improving facilities and setting up an honor system. Douglas the total cynic sneers at all this and makes his own plans. He is not going to rot for two decades or so in prison while a fortune awaits for him. So he starts plotting to get out and Fonda keeps watching to counter his plotting.I won't add anything else but in the end one wonders if Paris Pitman's view of mankind is the truth of us all or not. The film has wonderful sharp comedy including the comic putdowns of Cronyn when undercutting the pompous Randolph and when one sees scenes like Burgess Meredith taking his first bath. I strongly recommend this film to fans of unusual westerns.".

	schema:reviewBody "How could someone not like a western full of genial and persuasive cynicism full of improbable piety and stuffed with vivid characters from the two leads Kirk Douglas and Henry Fonda down to just about everyone else. And look at the pedigree Directed by Joseph Mankiewicz who gave us All About Eve Letter to Three Wives and that most elegant of cynical films Five Fingers and with a screenplay by David Newman and Robert Benton just after their first effort Bonnie and Clyde made their bones for them in Hollywood. Well the answer is an awful lot of people didn't like it and even more ignored it...including the studio executives. There Was a Crooked Man was buried after it finally was released with almost no marketing dollars devoted to it. I think the studio had no idea what to do with the film. Not only is it a witty and cynical western it has a climax which is mordantly violent and unexpectedly ruthless especially if you weren't paying attention to a brief scene at the start of the film. Not just that we wind up with one of the leads dead snake bite to the throat guaranteed to make you flinch and the other...well you may find yourself pondering just who is the crooked man all the fuss was about. Me I like the movie a lot. It's not perfect it's too long there are a couple of subthemes that could have been established faster. Still for an amusing sardonic look at human nature There Was a Crooked Man is hard to beat. Paris Pitman and don't forget the Jr. please Kirk Douglas is a charming eyeglass wearing rogue. He could talk a coyote out of a chicken one character says. He's a natural leader smart and calculating. He's also a robber and a killer. He stole a whole lot of money and we begin to notice his gang one by one doesn't make it far. Paris does but eventually is caught because of his fondness for easy women. Woodward Lopeman Henry Fonda is an upright lawman who doesn't drink take bribes or as far as we can tell consort with easy women. The two meet at a desolate territorial prison set in the middle of nothing but desert scrub and blistering heat. Pitman is doing time for the robbery. However he hid his loot before he was captured and he plans to find a way to escape. Lopeman is the new warden determined to rehabilitate the prisoners when he can and at least be fair to them when he can't. Before long Pitman has recruited his cellmates on a carefully organized breakout. They're an odd bunch but Pitman has a role for each one. The Missouri Kid Burgess Meredith is an aged coot who a long time ago was a skilled bank robber. Dudley Whinner Hume Cronyn and Cyrus McNutt John Randolph are failed con artists just a bickering old married couple with Whinner the shrewd one. Floyd Moon Warren Oates is a backstabber from way back who has never had a friend. He begins to think Paris is one. Coy Cavendish Michael Blodgett is a dumb but eager teenager who is scheduled to hang for inadvertently killing the father of the girl he was about to know too well. AhPing C. K. Yang is a big tough silent Chinese who decides to follow Pitman. We spend a lot of time in that sweltering prison observing how Lopeman tries to improve things and how Pitman step by step organizes the breakout. There will be explosions misdirection food fights with fried chicken and mashed potatoes stolen dynamite...and deliberate killings coldblooded and murderous setups and sacrifices those doing the sacrificing hadn't planned on. You can't help grinning at the cynicism or being a little revolted at some of the coldblooded murders. Pitman of course escapes and heads for the place he hid his loot a natural cave with an opening just small enough to reach down and snag the bags stuffed with cash. Did I mentioned Pitman chose the place because it was a nesting ground for rattlers. After we have experienced the coldblooded cynicism of one of the two leads it's nice to report that the movie ends with a satisfyingly bit of goodnatured cynicism on the part of the other.".

Pitman of course escapes and heads for the place he hid his loot a natural cave with an opening just small enough to reach down and snag the bags stuffed with cash. Did I mentioned Pitman chose the place because it was a nesting ground for rattlers. After we have experienced the coldblooded cynicism of one of the two leads it's nice to report that the movie ends with a satisfyingly bit of goodnatured cynicism on the part of the other.";

It seems the only way to earn Fonda's enmity as warden is to draw lascivious pictures of scantily clad women as all other crimes are forgivable and reformable in Fonda' eyes.While Fonda is trying to teach the prisoners selfrespect Douglas is luring them into his aid with promises of sharing the money he stole in the crime for which he was convicted and sentenced to the prison.

	schema:reviewBody "A unique entry among the golden age of westerns this is a combination of dark comedy with classic prison drama. In fact this could be called the Grand Hotel of Prison Movies with its eclectic group of characters in a desert prison where bandit Kirk Douglas ends up after he robs a respectable house during their respectable dinner. You know you're going down a different territory when you see the black cook veteran actress Virginia Capers quietly bemoaning the fact that she has to work for snooty white folks then putting on airs when she brings their supper into the dining room. Douglas is soon caught and sent to prison where a sudden change brings in new warden Henry Fonda who wants to establish prison reform. Fonda is actually out to discover where Douglas hid the loot he stole in a pair of bloomers and befriends him in order to gain some clues. One thing leads to another the prisoners plan an escape attempt and the stage is set for Fonda to follow Douglas in order to find out what he's been hired for.This starts off on just the right note with the robbery and never lets up following Douglas to a brothel with The Young and the Restless's Jeanne Cooper as a hooker! then to prison where the variety of fellow prisoners are introduced. There's the ancient Missouri Kid Burgess Meredith a grizzled con Warren Oates a young hothead Michael Blodgett a mute giant C.K. Yang and most memorably an obvious gay couple Hume Cronyn and John Randolph who argue like an old married couple. Then there's the skipper Alan Hale Jr. as one of the guards a jovial type who gets a surprisingly gruesome ending.This is a bawdy comedy with tons of sexual overtones that at first seem gratuitous but really fill out the cheek that some writer's tongue was obviously in. Not only is there the brothel sequence but a beautiful visitor to the prison veteran actress Barbara Rhodes literally gets her dress blown off of her when an explosion in the prison occurs. The violence of the prison is not at all pretty and Douglas's character is a villain you can't help but like even though he's about as trustworthy as a rattle snake. As for Fonda there's a crooked smile to his supposedly law abiding citizen that is quite a contrast to the sparkle in Douglas's eye. It says to the audience that these two opposites are more alike than they think and even if they are on the opposite sides of the law three's an unspoken respect that indicates they knew there's more to each other than what really meets the eye. There's also an ironic conclusion that is truly sardonic and extremely amusing. Some exciting cameos by Arthur O'Connell and Ann Doran as the robbed white folks in the opening Martin Gabel as the original warden and Lee Grant fill out the cast. Veteran director Joseph L. Mankiewicz provides an exciting atmosphere that never lets up with excellent photography and outstanding production values. Especially because of its cynicism this holds up just as well today as it did back in 1970.".

You know you're going down a different territory when you see the black cook veteran actress Virginia Capers quietly bemoaning the fact that she has to work for snooty white folks then putting on airs when she brings their supper into the dining room. Douglas is soon caught and sent to prison where a sudden change brings in new warden Henry Fonda who wants to establish prison reform. Fonda is actually out to discover where Douglas hid the loot he stole in a pair of bloomers and befriends him in order to gain some clues. One thing leads to another the prisoners plan an escape attempt and the stage is set for Fonda to follow Douglas in order to find out what he's been hired for.This starts off on just the right note with the robbery and never lets up following Douglas to a brothel with The Young and the Restless's Jeanne Cooper as a hooker! then to prison where the variety of fellow prisoners are introduced. There's the ancient Missouri Kid Burgess Meredith a grizzled con Warren Oates a young hothead Michael Blodgett a mute giant C.K. Yang and most memorably an obvious gay couple Hume Cronyn and John Randolph who argue like an old married couple. Then there's the skipper Alan Hale Jr. as one of the guards a jovial type who gets a surprisingly gruesome ending.This is a bawdy comedy with tons of sexual overtones that at first seem gratuitous but really fill out the cheek that some writer's tongue was obviously in. Not only is there the brothel sequence but a beautiful visitor to the prison veteran actress Barbara Rhodes literally gets her dress blown off of her when an explosion in the prison occurs. The violence of the prison is not at all pretty and Douglas's character is a villain you can't help but like even though he's about as trustworthy as a rattle snake. As for Fonda there's a crooked smile to his supposedly law abiding citizen that is quite a contrast to the sparkle in Douglas's eye. It says to the audience that these two opposites are more alike than they think and even if they are on the opposite sides of the law three's an unspoken respect that indicates they knew there's more to each other than what really meets the eye. There's also an ironic conclusion that is truly sardonic and extremely amusing. Some exciting cameos by Arthur O'Connell and Ann Doran as the robbed white folks in the opening Martin Gabel as the original warden and Lee Grant fill out the cast. Veteran director Joseph L. Mankiewicz provides an exciting atmosphere that never lets up with excellent photography and outstanding production values. Especially because of its cynicism this holds up just as well today as it did back in 1970.";

It's a bit long but is helped considerably by an excellent cast and witty script.Kirk Douglas gives a good performance as a feisty outlaw in a territorial prison who squirreled away 500000 in cash before being caught. Before long he's using the unrecovered loot to gather around him a group of cons to help in his escape.The film is marred though by Douglas' treacherous turn in the last act. He goes from lovable rogue to murderous backstabber at the drop of a hat cold bloodily murdering friend and foe alike during his food fight turned riot turned escape attempt. Although his murderous streak is revealed at the beginning of the film it's still quite unsettling to watch him kill people that the audience thought he bonded with.It's especially hard to watch Kirk doublecross the teenage boy played by Michael Blodgett as he's really the only essentially good person in the entire film.Overall it's a bit overrated but still somewhat entertaining.".

The bank robber Paris superbly played by Kirk Douglas had hidden 500000 after the robbery. Paris keeps scheming to escape offering a cut of the money to his fellow prisoners for help in escaping. Paris is a real con man and a charmer. However he is foiled at nearly every turn by the new Warden Lopeman played by the great Henry Fonda. The Warden seems to have seen it before with everything that Paris tries. Excellent in supporting roles are Hume Cronyn Warren Oates Alan Hale and Burgess Meredith. There are a couple of real surprises at the end of the film. I truly enjoyed this and think it's well worth a watch.".

	schema:reviewBody "There is so much to like and appreciate about this film that while it's an enjoyable experience it isn't the great film it should have been.Firstly the script is largely excellent. It has a good plot and characters backed up by interesting dialogue. It has a topnotch cast delivering almost universally quality performances. As well it has some interesting themes and issues to explore especially in the central battle between Fonda's warden and Douglas' prisoner. The scene where Douglas confronts Fonda in the just built eating hall and exposes his selfserving interests and hypocrisy is a great example of topclass screen writing.All the elements are there for a classic or at least semiclassic Western but it doesn't quite reach that. Why? I think a big problem for this is Joseph L. Mankiewicz's direction. As other users have commented the tone of the film is jerky and erratic and he has to take prime blame for that. But even in pure cinematic terms it isn't well directed. Scenes that should have been highlights such as the robbery that opens the film lack punch because they're ineptly handled.I think another major problem is the cinematography. The glossy bright and flashy look of TWACM seems more in tune for a jovial knockabout straightforward Western. For a film full of cynicism complexity as well as its share of humour and some rather depressing elements it's a distracting and misjudged look. The much more realistic style that was to become much more common in films as the 1970s progressed e.g. 'McCabe and Mrs. Miller' would have been much more apt.Overall an underappreciated and underrated film worth seeking out. But also a bit of a missed opportunity.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've always loved westerns and am a sucker for a good prison break story so of course I am a fan of THERE WAS A CROOKED MAN... a cynical and revisionist western which for some reason was released at Christmas of 1970. It is the only western in the long career of Joseph L. Mankiewicz a director better known for the Academy Awards he won for A LETTER TO THREE WIVES and ALL ABOUT EVE a pair of sophisticated dramas. It's also the first movie written by David Newman and Robert Benton after they won an Oscar for BONNIE AND CLYDE. So there was no lack of talent behind the camera yet CROOKED MAN... was not a big hit.Maybe that was because it was marketed as a traditional western drama with a cast of old pros the trailer posted on Youtube sells THERE WAS A CROOKED MAN... as an adventure wherein a charming rogue played by Kirk Douglas schemes and plots a daring break from an isolated Arizona prison so he can collect 500.000 in stolen money he has hidden away. But what moviegoers got was a story filled with ruthless hypocritical and calculating characters gritty detail a fistfight takes place in an open latrineand open homosexuality hardly John Ford territory. The screenplay seems to say that greed and larceny can be found in the hearts of even the best of men and that given half a chance and the right motivation everyone is a criminal.

	onyx:emotionText "I've always loved westerns and am a sucker for a good prison break story so of course I am a fan of THERE WAS A CROOKED MAN... a cynical and revisionist western which for some reason was released at Christmas of 1970. It is the only western in the long career of Joseph L. Mankiewicz a director better known for the Academy Awards he won for A LETTER TO THREE WIVES and ALL ABOUT EVE a pair of sophisticated dramas. It's also the first movie written by David Newman and Robert Benton after they won an Oscar for BONNIE AND CLYDE. So there was no lack of talent behind the camera yet CROOKED MAN... was not a big hit.Maybe that was because it was marketed as a traditional western drama with a cast of old pros the trailer posted on Youtube sells THERE WAS A CROOKED MAN... as an adventure wherein a charming rogue played by Kirk Douglas schemes and plots a daring break from an isolated Arizona prison so he can collect 500.000 in stolen money he has hidden away. But what moviegoers got was a story filled with ruthless hypocritical and calculating characters gritty detail a fistfight takes place in an open latrineand open homosexuality hardly John Ford territory. The screenplay seems to say that greed and larceny can be found in the hearts of even the best of men and that given half a chance and the right motivation everyone is a criminal. It's a potent theme and one audiences of the Nixon era would find acceptable but THERE WAS A CROOKED MAN... simply did not find its own audience.Which is a shame since CROOKED MAN... is very entertaining and the main reason is the two leads played by Douglas and Henry Fonda portraying devious criminal Paris Pittman Jr. and honest Warden Woodward Lopeman respectively.

Curate's Egg is as good a description as any for while it is definitely good in parts ultimately it fails to satisfy. Hume Cronyn working for a third and final time with Mank may well have relished the return to at least half the genre where he made his name  at least as a film actor  as the brutal warder in Brute Force playing someone diametrically opposite in the form of a gay con. I didn't note that much chemistry between the two leads Douglas and Fonda unlike say Douglas and Lancaster but the film does benefit from a rich assortment of support in the shape of John Randolph Warren Oates Arthur O'Connell Burgess Meredith and Lee Grant.

	schema:reviewBody "We've seen this film many times beforea villain double crosses his partners one by one and ultimately meets his deserved demise. What doesn't work here is that we are expected to be sympathetic toward the Kirk Douglas character who is the most unrepentant antihero I can think of.Sure Douglas plays him at the height of his career when his charm looks and charisma were legendary but even though he plays him upbeat and humorous the weight of his treachery upsets any balance that might have us liking the guy.Conversely the score is typical upbeat Western fare of that era and would sound quite at home on an old episode of Bonanza. We're assailed with swelling harmonica riffs followed by the bright orchestrals that are a hallmark of that period. When the final body count is tallied it becomes very clear that a score like this doesn't belong in a movie like this.What does work well in this film is the performances of the secondary figures who make up an almost who's who of great 1970s character actors. Not an ensemble piece but hardly a face goes by including some extras that you don't recognize. There's an old lifer played by Burgess Meridith a turnkey played by Alan Hale Skipper from Gilligan's Island Hume Cronyn and that Carl Reiner lookalike John Randolph play a couple of con men and even one background character is played by the great Jack Elam.In one entertaining vignette Burgess Meridith hams it up as very reluctant recipient of a much needed bath. Apparently he hasn't taken off his union suit in thirtyfive years. However such light moments are offset by dark ones later on in the film during the jailbreak Meridith's character gut shoots Hale's character despite the fact that two seem to be old chums.The ending of this movie is anticlimacticits a foregone conclusion that Douglas'character will pay but its more an act of serendipity than the expected confrontation between he and his pursuer a prison warden played by Henry Fonda. The moral of the story that even a stand up fellow like Fonda can be lured by greed seems tacked on.Sadly had this film been shot with the same actors but by a director like Sergio Leone who would matched the tone of the movie particularly the score to the darkness of the movie's content it might have worked. As it stands it is flawed and it fails.".

What could be more clich than prisoners ogling a woman who is there to perform good works? The musical theme was abrasive and repeated itself until I was tempted to smash the DVD. Most of all Douglas's character is repellent right from the beginning and it seems surprising that the characters within the movie could be taken in by him or find him attractive. Even the cheap dye job was patently false. I felt uncomfortable then appalled as the movie went from bad to worse. The nudity surprised me as it seemed to serve little purpose. My advice would be to skip this one. I do admire Kirk Douglas for other movies I've seen him in notably Lonely are the Brave. I also enjoyed Spartacus. As I said great actors lousy story.".

	schema:headline " Tarantino's sleeper. An underrated gem of a movie.";
	schema:reviewBody "Many people were disappointed with 'Jackie Brown' when it was first released as it didn't live up to their expectations created by the more flamboyant 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction'. I admit that I was one of those disappointed fans. But as the years have gone by I have come to appreciate this movie more and more and if you deal with what it IS and not what you thought it was going to be you'll see that it is an underrated gem of a movie. 'Jackie Brown' is much more character driven and leisurely plotted than Tarantino's previous two movies. I haven't read the Elmore Leonard novel on which it was based so I can't tell whether this was a conscious decision by Tarantino himself or it's because of the source material but it might be a stumbling block for those with MTVstyle attention spans. 1970s crime movie buffs will find it much easier going. The big names in the cast like De Niro Jackson and Fonda are all very good but the real standout performances in this movie are by 70s blaxploitation icon Pam Grier 'Coffy' 'Foxy Brown' 'Black Mama White Mama'etc.etc. and a revelatory one from Robert Forster. Forster back in the day showed plenty of promise in movies like 'Medium Cool' but quickly found himself stuck in bgrade exploitation movies like 'Vigilante' and 'Alligator'. Fun stuff but hardly Oscar material. Max Cherry is the best role he has ever been given and he is superb in it. The fascinating thing about 'Jackie Brown' for me is that Tarantino's critics accuse him of making shallow and violent selfconsciously hip crime films but the central story of this movie concerns an interracial Middle Aged romance something I haven't seen done in a believable or realistic fashion by Hollywood before. By doing this so well Tarantino shows he has much more depth and is a much more interesting and braver film maker than his more acclaimed contemporaries. 'Jackie Brown' is a fine movie that hopefully one day will get the kudos it deserves. Don't overlook this one just because it isn't 'Pulp Fiction The Next Generation'!".

	schema:headline " Personally I find it to be Quentin Tarantino's Masterpiece";
	schema:reviewBody "Sometimes a movie requires more than one viewing. The first time I sat down to watch Jackie Brown I wasn't so impressed. I didn't hate the movie but I didn't love it either. I thought it was decent. The second time I watched it I knew the plot already so I really got to indulge in the characters of the film. And thats exactly what the film is it's a character piece.Those of you who expect an energetic stylized violent comic bookesque film like Pulp Fiction will not get that from this movie. Its a lot more tamed and to say the least realistic. I love Pulp Fiction its one of my all time favorite movies. But I doubt in the real world there would be two hit men in matching black and white suits. The scenarios of that movie while fun and totally entertaining aren't too realistic. Jackie Brown on the other hand has totally real characters that don't come off as too over the top.All the actors in the movie are superb.The lead is played by actress Pam Grier who nails the role. Tarantino again shows you don't need an alist actor to carry a movie. Grier plays Jackie Brown an airline stuartess in her 40s. Samuel L. Jackson plays Ordell Robbie a gun dealer who uses Jackie to bring him in money from Mexico. Robert DeNiro in a smaller role for such a big actor plays Louis Ordell's friend who recent got out of jail. Bridget Fonda plays Melanie a blonde haired surfer girl who lives with Ordell. Michael Keaton my all time favorite actorplays ATF agent Ray Nicollette who wants to take down Ordell. And Robert Forster plays Max Cherry a bail bonds man. Without giving too much away all of these characters in one way or another are all after 500000 of Ordell's money. Every character in this movie is great and unique in their own way. But for me Robert Forster steals the show. Max Cherry is without a doubt my favorite character in all of Quentin Tarantino's movies.To some people this movie is just a crimeheist movie. But to me there is something quite beautiful to this movie. After a few viewings of the film you will notice that underneath it all this movie is really about two people. Jackie Brown and Max Cherry. Two people who are middle aged lonely and tired of their dead end jobs. Two people that meet in a very unlikely way. Two people that together figure out a way to steal 500000 and get away with it. Take this movie however you want it. But to me thats the heart of the movie and thats why the movie works so well.In conclusion Jackie Brown is not a graphic crime story like Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction that preceded it. Nor is it a stylized revenge saga like Kill Bill vol. 1  2 that followed it. Instead it is a stand alone film. A wonderfully acted character study. And for me an absolute gem of a film. It's Quentin Tarantino's underrated MASTERPIECE.".

When one of Ordell's other employee's is caught he is forced to kill him however before he can get to him the employee tells the police about Jackie and they pick her up.  With Jackie facing jail or being killed by Ordell she strikes a deal with both the police and him to bring in a large stash of money.  However to help her retirement she plans to play the game to her own ends.Coming as a follow up to both Dogs and Pulp this film was going to be the greatest movie ever made' or it was going to be met with a critical response that seems to be a bit negative.  It was the hype and hyperbole around anything baring the name Tarantino that perhaps was giving every film he did higher and higher standards to meet it is wasn't Jackie Brown that was met in this way it would have been the next film or the next one. However the reviews were mostly good but it did get some unfair reviews from critics who expected this to continue the upward trend.  In a way I believe that this film did show Tarantino's growth as a director.Where Pulp Fiction was dizzying in it's style and pace Jackie Brown is much more of a mature balanced film that is satisfying in a more traditional sense that the design of Pulp.  Developed from a Leonard novel the plot is a solid crime thriller with a good plot that still gives room for Tarantino to do some time shifting as he reveals some key scenes from different perspectives to allow us to see the bigger picture.  As a story it fills the rather generous running time pretty well and is enjoyable throughout.The film is still full of Tarantinoisms for the fans  the heavy soundtrack the pop culture references the witty slick dialogue.  However where the film stands out is that the characters are actually better than in his previous films where they never really went beyond the story and dialogue. Here not only are they better but they also include wellwritten female parts!  While some of the characters are as good as they need to be within the confines of the basic crime story it is in Jackie and Max where Tarantino has grown up a bit  although in fairness this was an adaptation rather than his own script but he still manages them better than some of his own thin characters.Following the praise for Pulp and Tarantino's ability to rejuvenate careers he must have had no problem cherry picking for this role.  Grier gives a great performance and should be grateful for the role in an industry that generally ignores middleaged women not to mention black women!.  The only thing surprising about her is how poorly she has taken this big lead role and used it to take her career on.  Her performance embraces her age and uses it well but it is Forster who gives the standout performance here. Not an actor many will be aware of apart from this film he got an Oscar nomination for this and I think he deserved it.  His performance is very lowkey and quite moving  I think I will appreciate his work here more as I get older.  Jackson does what is expected of him and has no real character but his energy and skill are there to see.  De Niro plays a little against type and is an interesting but underused character.  Fonda is really really sexy and has some good lines while the rest of the cast do good work in small roles with people like Keaton Tucker and Bowen in there.Overall I enjoy this film and can understand why it will never be loved to the extent that Pulp was and is.  However to me this is a more satisfying film with an enjoyable plot and a more traditional delivery.  The development of actual good characters beyond snappy dialogue is what impressed me the most and it sadden me to see him regress about a decade into style without substance with Kill Bill Vol. One.".

Where it lacks in violence however the film makes up for in language earning it an R rating in the US. In certain scenes I thought it Tarantino went to far with the explicit language and it seemed awkward and artificial but that does not cast a shadow of over what I thought was an otherwise fantastic film. The editing and directing is excellent. There is good character development of the main characters yet there is not one scene where the movie drags throughout its entire 150 minutes. I couldn't tear myself away from this movie until the very end.Especially enjoyable is the performance by Robert Forster whose character I thought was outstanding. Max Cherry played by Forster is a tempered bail bondsman who cautiously handles his unscrupulous clients. One day he is approached by Ordell Robbie played by Samuel L. Jackson to post a bond for Jackie Brown a middle aged flight attendant for a low cost airline who gets caught smuggling Ordell's fortune in Mexico into the US. The initial meeting between Jackie and Max sets up a relationship between these two characters on both professional and personal level and that changes Max from a methodical and business man to almost an innocent young boy with a crush. The last scene in the movie between these two characters is absolutely brilliant.I highly recommend this film and it's fun to watch Tarantino mature as a director. The little extras littered throughout the film such as Chick with Guns the fabulous locations such as the Cockatoo Inn and the excellent characters make this film well worth a view.".

This is more of a slow crime story that focuses more on being cool than being shocking. I think this movie works very well despite the slow pace which seems to put a lot of people off. Mainly i think it works because the actors are all giving it their best the casting is also excellent while Tarantino seems to handle the whole story more gently than in Pulp Fiction. He doesn't stress it he doesn't run the risk of overdoing the cool parts. The end result is enjoyable but a lot more somber than what you're used to from Tarantino.All in all i feel this movie is underrated. It's enjoyable well made and stylish.

A fantastic revival for Robert Forster who'd never been awarded the shot he deserved as Max Cherry our star and hero of this film. Robert's been historically type cast as a gumshoe cop in numerous roles Mulholland Drive South Beach Rear Window Me Myself Irene but really breaks out in this opportunity to portray a character with actual personalityintegrity wit and passions. Hail to Robert! Fantastic deliveries from Michael Keaton who revives the Ray Nicolette character seen in Out of Sight Bridget Fonda's transformation as the stoner surfer girl DeNiro as the shifty excon Samuel J as the untrustworthy Ordell and most impressively the one scene delivery of Chris Tucker with the famous improvised line 'You sneak up on a Nigga with this sht!'... The screen translation of Elmore Leonard's Florida based Rum Punch is very interesting from the blonde bimboish Jackie Burke to the sexy 40ish black Jackie Brown worked very nicely.

Hail to Robert! Fantastic deliveries from Michael Keaton who revives the Ray Nicolette character seen in Out of Sight Bridget Fonda's transformation as the stoner surfer girl DeNiro as the shifty excon Samuel J as the untrustworthy Ordell and most impressively the one scene delivery of Chris Tucker with the famous improvised line 'You sneak up on a Nigga with this sht!'... The screen translation of Elmore Leonard's Florida based Rum Punch is very interesting from the blonde bimboish Jackie Burke to the sexy 40ish black Jackie Brown worked very nicely. Q hits another home run as expected!";

The movie's quite well made and enjoyable.Don't misinterpret what I'm saying. This is no Reservoir Dogs nor does it want to be. It's not in the same vein as Tarantino's other movies at least not at a superficial level. However it is extremely entertaining helped along by a great cast and a terrific script. The only difference here is that Tarantino did not come up with everything by himself. He adapted the screenplay from another source something he usually doesn't do. But there's also a littleknown fact that Roger Avary cowrote some of Dogs and Fiction with Tarantino as well as sparked the idea for some of his films. Here Quentin adapts Leonard's novel and does justice.

A geek working at a comic book store falls in love and goes off of an adventure into a new realm  in Tarantino's own case it was filmmaking. For Clarence from True Romance it was drugs and murder.Tarantino has a flair for raw energy in all of his films and Jackie Brown is no exception. The movie is bursting at its edges packed with wild antics and the occasional fierce brutality. The movie was criticized by Tarantino's diehard fans for being too different from his other films. However the mistake of many directors is to repeat the same formulas over and over again. One must at least give Tarantino credit for trying new things in each of his films. If anything the only thing that Tarantino likes to insert into all his films is a large source of energy. And is that a bad thing?4.55 stars.".

When Jackie is tagged by the feds played by Keaton and Michael Bowen she is willing to give up Ordell because she has a plan of her own. Meanwhile Ordell has proved himself to be a pretty nasty character killing associates without even a hint of betrayal so to say that Jackie is walking a tightrope is an understatement. Rounding out the cast is Robert Forster as Max Cherry Jackie's bail bondsman hired by Ordell when Jackie is initially arrested by the feds and eventual love interest Robert DeNiro as Louis an associate of Ordell's who is fresh out of jail and about to buy in on one of Ordell's gun selling schemes and Bridget Fonda as Melanie one of Ordell's women and object of both fascination and irritation for Louis.Jackie Brown features many Tarantinoisms that we have come to expect from his films slick cinematography a soundtrack that is perfect for the film in this case 1970's RB a rich cast of eccentric characters a solid amount of violence and even more profanity. If there was a Tarantino film that DIDN'T include these elements I would be disappointed. As John Travolta was dug up to star in Pulp Fiction Tarantino resurrects two 1970's actors Robert Forster and Pam Grier and both prove once again that there are few contemporary directors around who have better gut instincts and an eye for casting than he. Although there could have been many other bigger name safer choices that would have jumped to be in Tarantino's perceived followup to Fiction the film geek once again proves that he knows best. Grier is absolutely luminous and looks at least 10 years younger than her actual age. Better than that she is sexy spunky and knows what she wants. The supporting cast is also excellent and while it's definitely film geeky to admit it like the actors who appear in the ensemble films of Paul Thomas Anderson or Wes Anderson I always admire the cast of Tarantino's film because while they may not have a large or prestigious role in the film they are always juicy characters that are sometimes played against type. I loved seeing Michael Keaton as a hardfaced leather jacket clad fed and Robert DeNiro who can chew scenery better than a lot is fantastic as the quiet shlubby and slobby sidekick.Anyone who approached Jackie Brown looking for a Pulp Fiction sequel was probably either somewhat disappointed or like me encouraged that Tarantino can not only do flashy but can spin a good story as well. And perhaps even more importantly he wasn't a twotrick pony with the inspired films Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. While I have mixed feelings about Tarantino the man I am endeared to his almost autisticknowledge of film and his inherent film geekiness but I am both fascinated and repelled by his almost constant hysteria and particularly in the infancy of his fame his inability to turn down an acting job or engage in ceaseless selfpromotion I certainly count him among my favorite directors and anytime he releases a film it's an event. Before seeing his latest releases Kill Bill Vol. 1  Vol. 2 I lamented that he possibly took too much time off between projects but after seeing Vol. 1 I quickly reconsidered saying that if he is going to consistently put out superior product he can take as much time as he wants.And that is why I look at Jackie Brown a film that wasn't quite as stellar or lauded as his others with a certain amount of fondness because it is a great piece of work without all of the flash bells and whistles of its predecessor. Knowing that a Pulp Fiction 2 would be an instant hit Tarantino decided to go in a different direction and it's that willingness to take a chance even if it's not a huge leap that makes me appreciate it that much more. It's probably my least favorite Tarantino film but even my least favorite Tarantino film garners a better rating than 80 of contemporary cinema. Even Tarantino fans that I know let this film go under their radar so if you are in the same boat seek this one out it is well worth it. 710 Shelly".

	schema:reviewBody "What a film! Amazing ensemble serpentine plot all based on an Elmore Leonard novel. I enjoyed the film when it first came out but I didn't appreciate its complexity and the caliber of its acting as I did when I saw it the other day. A tired airline stewardess Pam Grier as the eponymous character sees a slim window through which she could escape to a more leisurely life. However she will have to steal money from a nasty smalltime arms dealer and convince the Feds she is trying to help them get the dealer. Can she make it work? On her side is bail bondsman Max Cherry Robert Forster who we think might want to squeeze out that window with her. However she has to outwit the venal Ordell Robbie Sam Jackson who we see is not the nicest guy in the world. Robbie is assisted by the dimwitted pothead excon Louis Robert DeNiro and his possiblysmarterthanshelooks snow bunny Melanie Bridge Fonda. On the other is the law in the person of Mark Dargus Michael Bowen and Ray Nicolette Michael Keaton. She has to convince the Feds she is complying with the terms of her agreement with them and she has to convince Ordell that she is not scamming him. It's a hell of a balance. Can she do it? Great music typically abittooclever dialogue as one might expect from Tarantino. Tarantino features LA's grittiness in a way that those of us Angelenos who know that the Southland isn't all Beverly Hills and Hollywood really appreciate. The acting is fantastic. You've never seen Robert DeNiro act like this. He's dopey with a lot of repressed anger. DeNiro gets the essence of a conflicted excon. Robert Forster is competent and confident. The chemistry he has with Grier is smoldering. Sam Jackson eats up the screen in his scenes. It's like shooting fish in a barrel for him. Pam Grier is phenomenal as Jackie Brown. You don't know just how honest Jackie is but you have sympathy for her from the getgo. Grier makes her gorgeous smart hardworking sexy confident and diligent. It really is a shame that she hasn't had another role even APPROACHING one of this richness. It truly is a great role though and Pam Grier delivers in spades.".

In the six years since then this is the only time that he has returned to the directors chair.  Jackie Brown  his difficult third film  seems to be his response to criticism of his first two films that he could only make movies about other movies but not real life.  He cleverly anticipates the backlash by adapting a tightly plotted character driven Elmore Leonard novel still set in his familiar world of LA lowlives but keeping to a minimum his trademark comicbook violence and popculture references while emphasising the novels more mature themes  such as ageing and the feeling of time running out for the middleaged characters.  The result is a slick interesting if slightly draggy thriller which ultimately lacks the freshness and audaciousness of those earlier films.Tarantino still has his maverick streak though as displayed in his trusting of Pam Grier to carry the entire movie.  The casting of a middleaged black actress with no boxoffice clout in the lead role can't have been easy in an industry notorious for it's scant regard for actresses after they reach 30. You can bet that the studios would have at least insisted on the safety of a Sharon Stone or a Demi Moore.  But Tarantino as he did when casting Travolta stuck to his gutinstinct and once again it proved an inspired choice.  Grier bringing with her the memories of her 70's blackploitation movies gives a convincingly tough wise and sympathetic performance.Actors love to work with Tarantino because the roles he gives them will be invariably jucier than usual.  That is once again the case here although the casting isn't quite as inspired as it was in Dogs or Pulp or True Romance.  Samuel L.

Jackson's brutal offscreen dispatching of Chris Tucker in the boot of a car as the camera slowly cranes up into the sky is masterfully conceived and a scene which is subtly built up to involving a teasing Fonda and a poff De Niro is as unexpected and as shocking as anything Tarantino has done before.

	schema:headline " A Great Heist Film That Is Currently UnderAppreciated";
	schema:reviewBody "I see Tarantino's three films in the 90's not including Four Rooms as a crime trilogy of sorts and Jackie Brown is the one that is considered to be the most underrated or by others as the weakest of Tarantino's catalog. I never really had high hopes for this film because for one it just doesn't have that wit and charm that Pulp Fiction has or the unique style that was demonstrated with Reservoir Dogs. I have now seen this film a couple of times and even from my first viewing I thought this film was great and got even better the subsequent times I came around to it.Jackie Brown is definitely a left turn from Tarantino's films as it wasn't an original idea but rather he adapted Elmore Leonard's novel other notable work include Out Of Sight and 310 To Yuma. This choice of not adapting an original story is strange but it doesn't matter anymore after you have seen it because it's still an entertaining film. I haven't read the source material but I have read reports that this film adapts the novel accurately and that Leonard's novel is filled with dialogue. This film indeed has that element which works in favor of Tarantino as he has a complete understanding of how to make dialogue look and sound interesting. This may be dismissed by many due to the fact that it lacks the style and charm that was found on his previous two films the film instead takes a conventional approach to it's storytelling but personally this isn't really an issue for me as the story is still entertaining to watch unfold and Tarantino doesn't completely lose his touch with this film. True the film relies on the story in developing it's characters rather than having them spill out words that collectively will shape their personalities but Tarantino's dialogue and style isn't the star of the film but rather the motivations and intentions of the characters.Looking at Quentin Tarantino's career his films differ from one another and the director is starting to walk the same lines as Kubrick in not repeating oneself. Jackie Brown is the director's heist film and he has achieved in not grounding the film on the same style and level as the other heist films it is now compared to. The film may not scream out Tarantino but it does at the very least experiment. The heist itself was a genius in execution how difficult it must be to have us see the same heist and not feel repetitive and tiresome. There are also moments in the film where it uses a split screen showing two moments at the same time and the film also has unusual choices of transitions. This is the first time we get to see Tarantino's ability to let the audience gain introspection of the characters.In order to get that dark and gritty style that the film needed Tarantino opted for a change in cinematographer and hired Guillermo Navarro. Navarro is now known as a frequent collaborator with Guillermo Del Toro and those films usually have this murky black tone to it and the credit goes to Navarro's photography. This is also one of the main reasons that it doesn't have that look that is prevalent on the director's previous two films. Jackie Brown's look is definitely one of the reasons that the film has personality and it does allow us to perceive the story with seriousness that it demands. The film's dark tone does lose that humor that Tarantino was known for but that aspect isn't truly necessary here to engage the audience though there are moments where it does get you laughing.Again Tarantino stays away from the traditional film score and fills the film up with musical nuggets that works perfectly with the scene. The previous two films touches on tracks within the Rock N' Roll and Pop genre while here he chooses tracks within RB genre. These tracks have so much soul in them and it does in a way throwback to the classic films that Pam Grier was in. Though I do wonder if the film would be improved using an original score even if it retains that quality that the soundtracks give but I guess we'll never know.The film's cast includes a return of Samuel L. Jackson and a number of stars who are known to have lost their touch in particular Pam Grier. Honestly I have yet to see a film that Grier is in but after this film it proves that she has acting chops and that she brings great personality in a role that it's hard to not keep your eyes off her. Grier should have been nominated for Best Leading Actress at the Oscars that year but that is just my personal opinion. The rest of the cast were great with notable stand outs like Robert Forster and Bridget Fonda. Forster plays it more casually but not being near the borderline of laziness while Fonda brings the sex to the role and she was able to bring the immaturity and bratiness that the role needed. Keaton and De Niro are a bit underused and their characters doesn't really have more to them that I could grasp on to. Jackson on the other hand still brings his usual style that was also found on Pulp Fiction but he changes it enough that it doesn't feel like he is repeating himself.Jackie Brown is an entertaining crimeheist film that definitely needs much more attention. I personally felt that this film is much stronger than Reservoir Dogs but it doesn't capture the greatness that Pulp Fiction was able to give off regardless of it's stellar cast amazing music excellent cinematography and a story that had me locked on to until the end of the film.".

	onyx:emotionText "I see Tarantino's three films in the 90's not including Four Rooms as a crime trilogy of sorts and Jackie Brown is the one that is considered to be the most underrated or by others as the weakest of Tarantino's catalog. I never really had high hopes for this film because for one it just doesn't have that wit and charm that Pulp Fiction has or the unique style that was demonstrated with Reservoir Dogs. I have now seen this film a couple of times and even from my first viewing I thought this film was great and got even better the subsequent times I came around to it.Jackie Brown is definitely a left turn from Tarantino's films as it wasn't an original idea but rather he adapted Elmore Leonard's novel other notable work include Out Of Sight and 310 To Yuma. This choice of not adapting an original story is strange but it doesn't matter anymore after you have seen it because it's still an entertaining film. I haven't read the source material but I have read reports that this film adapts the novel accurately and that Leonard's novel is filled with dialogue. This film indeed has that element which works in favor of Tarantino as he has a complete understanding of how to make dialogue look and sound interesting. This may be dismissed by many due to the fact that it lacks the style and charm that was found on his previous two films the film instead takes a conventional approach to it's storytelling but personally this isn't really an issue for me as the story is still entertaining to watch unfold and Tarantino doesn't completely lose his touch with this film. True the film relies on the story in developing it's characters rather than having them spill out words that collectively will shape their personalities but Tarantino's dialogue and style isn't the star of the film but rather the motivations and intentions of the characters.Looking at Quentin Tarantino's career his films differ from one another and the director is starting to walk the same lines as Kubrick in not repeating oneself. Jackie Brown is the director's heist film and he has achieved in not grounding the film on the same style and level as the other heist films it is now compared to. The film may not scream out Tarantino but it does at the very least experiment. The heist itself was a genius in execution how difficult it must be to have us see the same heist and not feel repetitive and tiresome. There are also moments in the film where it uses a split screen showing two moments at the same time and the film also has unusual choices of transitions.

But in some ways this is a shame as there's a lot to enjoy in 'Jackie Brown' particularly in the universally first rate performances the director manages to get out of his distinguished cast. Robert Forster is wise and weary as a middleaged bail bondsman Samuel L. Jackson plays a criminal with all of the menace and none of the charm of his character in 'Pulp Fiction' while Bridget Fonda and a cast against type Robert de Niro are entertaining as a pair of useless crackheads. Best of all is former blaxploitation star Pam Grier in the title role combining human warmth and coolness under fire with considerable charm. The generic Ellmore Leanard plot is ultimately not quite as clever as it promises to be and as as ever with Tarantino both tone and taste are sometimes questionable the early sequence 'Women Who Love Guns' is very funny but it's quite unclear whether it's intended as satire or celebration. Nonetheless once one adds in a typically splendid soundtrack everything adds up to a movie far above the average crime thriller and for all the breathtaking invention of his other movies it's enough to make one wish that Tarantino didn't usually feel the need to try so very hard.".

	schema:reviewBody "Quentin Tarantino takes on Elmore Leonard? At first look not such a good idea but coming to Jackie Brown several years after its more or less lukewarm initial reception released after socalled masterpiece Reservoir Dogs and the inventive and infectious Pulp Fiction Jackie Brown was seen as something of a disappointment and being able to assess it without putting in context of Tarantino's filmography Jackie Brown is surprising.It is without question Tarantino's most mature and complete work to date as a director. Mature in the sense that Tarantino here is not preoccupied with 'homages' references style not too much at least or indulging himself in his fantasies. Tarantino for once is primarily a storyteller and the approach works stunningly well. Jackie Brown is a fantastically entertaining crime thriller that not only does justice to Leonard's source material but in some senses improves on it admittedly the novel this is based on is hardly his best work. The cast is a dream for this sort of movie and contains what is as of 2008 Robert De Niro's last truly memorable performance the music fits perfectly the atmosphere created is the sort you can lose yourself in for the running time of the film which feels significantly shorter than it is and the screenplay with its witty exchanges striking characters and plentiful plot twists keeps the viewer more than entertained. This is a truly engaging film.Tarantino movies do it for me. I don't think he's one of the greatest directors of all time or anything but he is a talented director with the capacity to make tremendously entertaining films. While many would prefer him to do films like Kill Bill I think Jackie Brown is a far better representation of his talent. He's certainly not completely out of his element here there's plenty of 70's retro cool in this film but thankfully it is contained and kept from going overboard.Expect another Pulp Fiction and disappointment is an understandable reaction but if you go into this with an open mind and expect nothing in particular you might just find that Jackie Brown is not only Tarantino's best but one of the most entertaining films of the 90's.9.510".

	schema:reviewBody "I first saw this movie on opening night and was somewhat disappointed. I think in retrospect that I was expecting too much the same thing I got from Pulp Fiction. Specifically I was disappointed that Sam Jackson and Robert Deniro's characters were such small time criminals and just not badass enough. I thought it was kind of a waste of their talents. Thinking about it now I realize why would you want to see Deniro and Jackson repeat previous performances? Tarantino did something new with them in this film and they both turned in very interesting performances that are better than the vast majority of their work in film since.Just in general I really think this is the best Tarantino film I've seen except Reservoir Dogs. Why? Because the characters are more real and the plotstory is more focused. I love the performances he got out of Pam Grier and Robert Forster. Both of them are fantastic actors who really were wasted through most of the 80s and 90s until Quentin came along and basically rescued him like he did for Travolta. Except Forster and Grier are way better than Travolta and turn in excellent and nuanced performances here. The chemistry between them is perfect.A few tangential comments. The music is good as usual the first time I saw it I felt it was a bit forced. But I realize now that it was part of the verite effect he was going after. Having the characters interact with the music makes the music seem a bit more obtrusive but it also makes the film seem more real.There is a lot of good character work in this film too. Keaton is great as a youngish cop the nice guy in the routine. Fonda shines as a slutty stoner the type of girl who makes fun of her boyfriend to his friends when he's not there as if that would make them seem more appealing or sophisticated. In fact there is a very nice kind of dovetailing effect where you really don't notice the difference between the performances of the stars and the character actors. The stars Forster Grier Jackson get to do basically just an expanded version of character work and it makes for an even more seamless film than Pulp Fiction which at times feels bogged down by the weight of its stars.All in all a good story with good actors makes for a good film if a bit slow in the end when we have to see the heist from multiple viewpoints despite its predictability.".

Ordell RobbieJackson is an illegal arms seller. One of his aquaintences Beaumont LivingstonTucker was put in jail for carrying a machine gun that he bought from Ordell.

Later.....while walking in the airport parking lot from her job as a stewardess Jackie BrownGrier is stopped by two FBI agents Mark DargasBowen and Ray NicholetteKeaton. They check her bags and we soon figure out that Beaumont told everything to get out of going to jail. Jackie is Ordell's money runner for the guns he sells. Unfortunately in the money bag for him the buyer had slipped in some cocaine for Ordell and Jackie goes to jail. Ordell goes back to Max and has him move the 10000 dollars from Beaumont to Jackie. Max drives her to her house and is beginning to fall for her. Ordell goes to Jackies house to try to kill her but Jackie stole Max's gun and protects herself. This all spirals into fooling Ordell out of 40000 dollars.My review 9 out of 10. Robert Deniro and Bridget Fonda were excellent together as Ordell's friend and girlfriend. Keaton has a gem role that's small but important. Grier and Forester are in their best roles ever and Jackson is good as always. This movie is not fast paced but has so much interesting dialogue that makes up for it. Tarantino knew what he was doing.R for language some brief bloody violence drug content and a brief scene of sexualitybetween Deniro and Fonda".

Fantastic use of the camera and a great song to go along with it but then once you get to the movie beyond the stylized and interesting opening the film starts to slow down and goes on for 2 12 it didn't need to.The thing that defines the film from Tarantino's other work is that is not his own creation or his own ripoff of someone else's creation but a legitimate adaption of a novel. Tarantino's style was never that conventional and when you see him working within conventional cofines which is sort of what this is despite being a vibrantfeeling piece his whole style just doesn't work and he can't acomodate proper pacing. Tarantino's style is suited to fastpased thrillers or just things told of out of sequence. When he tells a characterdriven crime story in a rather linear matter his very superfluous direction and writing ends up chugging the whole thing down when it should be either speeding the thing up or directing more so its focus. The opening is more in line with his type of films but once it gets into relationships and more complex elements of story and character the thing just kind of drags.It's got so much good in it with great acting and great dialouge but Tarantino just doesn't pace it right cause he can't handle a story of this type and the movie ends up feeling a bit boring by the time you're finished. Still though it's got so much good in it that it's not necessarily a bad way to spend an afternoon but maybe there'll be a point where you wish it were it over when there's probably still a good amount to go.".

Tarantino had a lot to live up to get this movie to compare with the other two and although he fails Jackie Brown is still an above average movie.Jackie Brown is Tarantino Light and avoids much of the flash and violence of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. This isn't a bad thing because the movie decides to exchange flash and flair for character development. This wouldn't be a bad thing if anyone outside of the two main characters were very interesting. Jackie and Max are both well fleshed out real characters who the audience feels they get to know and care for.Grier and Forster bring great skill to their performances of Jackie and Max and the rest of the cast is acceptable as well. The one possible exception is DeNiro gasp! although his character really has nothing to go with. That brings me to one of the films faults it spends too much time with Samuel L Jackson Robert DeNiro and Bridget Fonda especially in the first half hour. There characters are one note and not very funny even though they seem to be there mostly for comic relief. Jacksons character is interesting but his shtick tires on you after the first great scene with the women who love guns.Tarantino's direction in the movie is quite good. Its easily the best thing in the movie. There is an interesting mix of trademark Tarantino shots long takes and some nice long shots and tracking shots. Unfortunately some of the shots seem to be more so for the sake of being cool than anything else.Overall the film is an above average film that seemed to get ripped apart because it was under extreme scrutiny.

She works out a deal with the police to help them catch her boss Ordell Robbie Samuel L. Jackson in return from her freedom. Ordell has 500000 in Mexico that Jackie is to bring to him. But there are a lot of people who want that money  the police Ordell Ordell's girlfriend and even Jackie. Who is going to scam who to get their hands on the money? Until I saw Jackie Brown I had a hard time believing that any Tarantino film could top Kill Bill. Now I'm not so sure. I need to revisit Kill Bill to be sure. Jackie Brown is a more grownup film than most of his other works. It doesn't try as hard to be cool like Pulp Fiction and it doesn't try to be as violent as Kill Bill. Oh the coolness and violence is there but Jackie Brown is more about the story and characters than either of those films. It's a more subdued film that is a nice change of pace from what I had expected from Tarantino.For me Jackie Brown works because of two things  a good script and excellent acting. I'll start with the script. Tarantino may be one of the most selfabsorbed jerks on the planet but he certainly can write a script. The characters in Jackie Brown talk like real people. They're not like a lot of movie characters that seem so unreal you are unable imagine beyond the confines of the movie. These people are smart clever and capable of showing real emotion. It doesn't hurt any that Tarantino had good source material in the form of Elmore Leonard's Rum Punch.As for the acting Pam Grier is AWESOME. I've seen a few of her movies from the 70s but now I'm inspired to track them all down. She's cool tough vulnerable and afraid  all at the same time. Kudos to Tarantino for taking a chance on an actress without the big Hollywood name. When you add Robert De Niro Samuel L. Jackson Robert Forster Michael Keaton Bridget Fonda and the rest you've got an allstar cast that for once lives up to the hype.Another thing I've always enjoyed about Tarantino's movies is the music. The soundtrack to Jackie Brown may be the best.".

Why? I'll tell you.I don't enjoy Tarantino's work for his OTT violence which this film lacks. I enjoy his work because it always clearly screams a love and passion for the cinema and because of the tremendous dialogue and characters he uses to construct this world. This movie has all of this in spades with amazingly fleshed out characters such as the bored middle aged and directionless two central characters who form a silent romantic bond with each other Jackie Brown and Max Cherry the sleazy cowardly cunning drug dealer Ordell his smartass girl Melanie his excon friend Lewis whose laidback characteristics conceal a fearsome dark side and troublesome detective Ray.The dialogue again works wonders throughout the movie the acting is pitchperfect across the board with Pam Grier Samuel L Jackson and Robert De Niro being as great as you'd expect them to be and Robert Forster and Bridget Fonda delivering career best performances and the movie has some amazing sequences my favourite being the sequence filmed from three different viewpoints followed by the sequence that involves a promise of waffles and chicken and a car boot no spoilers for either. And the plot also builds to an fantastic and logical conclusion.In conclusion let me sum it up for you. If you like Tarantino movies for their OTT violence and OTT characters you probably won't like this movie. However if you like Tarantino movies for their wonderfully realistic dialogue and amazingly charming or detestable characters then you'll love this movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "1965's Boeing Boeing is a dated but mildly amusing film starring Tony Curtis Thelma Ritter Jerry Lewis and Dany Saval. Curtis is a swinging bachelor living in Paris who is juggling three flight attendants at one time all of whom live with him and all of them are his fiancees. He's able to do this with the help of his able housekeeper Ritter and his carefully workedout airline schedules. Unfortunately the new fast planes are goofing up the schedules. Adding to the confusion is a visit by his friend Robert Lewis a reporter.

He's able to do this with the help of his able housekeeper Ritter and his carefully workedout airline schedules. Unfortunately the new fast planes are goofing up the schedules.

	schema:reviewBody "Farce is tricky  you need a good cast who are directed to be fast at split second timing so that the appearance of people just missing each other add to the hilarity. It also depends on translation or state of the script. BOEING 707 BOEING 707 is a French farce that became a hit there and then in Great Britain in the 1960s. It was brought to Broadway but flopped. Still a movie version was made which is unique because it was the only pairing of Tony Curtis and Jerry Lewis with Lewis playing a more subdued character than in other films. The film's plot is about how Curtis a foreign correspondent in Paris has an apartment which he sets up as a private harem with three girlfriends  all flight attendants back then stewardesses one English Suzanne Leigh one French Dany Saval and one German Christiane Schmidtmereach from their own nation's airlines Schmidtmer is frequently referred to as Lufthansa. The only person who is aware that Curtis has this harem is his maid Berthe Thelma Ritter. The ladies don't because Curtis has timed their arrivals and departures to the minute so that as two are gone the third is arriving.Two disasters destroy the perfect love system Curtis has made  first the announcement of a more powerful airliner all the airlines will be switching to soon. That speeds up the arrivals and departures of the three women. Secondly Curtis finds that he is being imposed on by a fellow journalist Lewis who needs a room for a few days before he can rent an apartment. Curtis and Lewis have a halffriendly and halfunfriendly relationship due to being rival correspondents and rivals with women. But Lewis discovers about the various ladies all of whom claim they are Curtis's fianc and basically blackmails Curtis into putting him up.The problems of the earlier arrivals of the three ladies perplex Curtis and Lewis as their rivalry for the ladies mount. At the same time the one person stuck in the apartment all the time Thelma Ritter is getting more and more upset about the setup which is tiring and thankless...and not as well paid as Ritter would like.Curtis was always an adept farceur but Lewis comes across as an accomplished one too  no geek like Nutty Professor or accident prone Errand Boy or Disorderly Orderly here. Instead we have a smooth operator  a cousin to Buddy the alter ego of the Nutty Professor. The three ladies are good particularly the German Ms Schmidtmer who is lovely but formidable and a lady who dislikes French souffls and prefers knockwurst and sauerkraut  much to the disgust of Ritter who hates the smell. All the ladies love national styles of food. Ms Saval enjoys souffls and detests knockwurst and sauerkraut. As for Ms Leigh she loves deviled kidneys in their own juice the juice she mentions is good for the complexion. Ritter dislikes the kidneys too but always make extra ones for Leigh  she knows Leigh wants seconds.BOEING BOEING was a mediocre film at the box office. But it is amusing enough to most viewers. Right now the original play is on Broadway with Bradley Whitford in the Curtis role and Christine Baransky as Berthe. It seems to be a better production than the original one. Baransky has a hard job in her role but she is one of our finest female comics. The reason is that the best of the performers in the film was Ritter who gets more and more confused and irritated by the goings on she is witnessing. In the ends she wonders if she really would ever stand for it under any circumstances. For watching Ritter alone the film is worth while. Knowing Ms Baransky from past performances she is certainly worthy to take on the same role.".

Thelma Ritter of course is terrific as the maid.One thing that some of the other reviewers seem to have missed is that Robert Jerry Lewis actually helped Bernard Tony Curtis manage the crisis rather than contribute to the crisis as some have suggested. The sole cause of the unraveling of the perfect crime had nothing to do with Robert's arrival it was the sudden change in airline schedules due to the faster jets which caused Bernard's house of cards to start falling in. Robert clearly in awe of the situation was fully committed to helping Bernard keep the charade going. Yes as a subplot Robert quickly became interested in siphoning off some of the action for himself something that he had apparently done to Bernard before. However Robert was not a total heel. Initially he had no intention of going after Vicky British United when he thought that she was Bernard's fiance. It was only after he learned that Bernard had two no make that three fiances that Robert started making some moves of his own. However in no way did Robert's presence and move making jeopardize the operation as some have suggested. Rather his help oftentimes on his own initiative turned out to be desperately needed by Bernard as the chaos unfolded. As the new schedules kicked in and one by one each fiance arrived home sooner than expected Robert played a vital role in keeping them separated and he also kept an increasingly beleaguered Bernard informed of the latest developments. In fact even before Robert arrived Bernard was using him as an excuse for why there were kidneys left over from breakfast. Robert and Bernard were at once both rivals and partners a complicated relationship that in my opinion Jerry Lewis played brilliantly. I refer to Boeing Boeing as being a farce because of one minor and one major problem with the plot that makes it totally unbelievable. The minor one is the aircraft references. In the late 50's and early 60's the introduction of jet passenger planes did in fact dramatically alter airline schedules as the average speed jumped from around 325 mph for piston engine propeller airplanes to around 550 mph for jet airliners. In many cases what were previously overnight trips for the crew were now one day roundtrips. However in the movie the drastic schedule changes were due not to the transition from propeller planes to jets but a transition from existing jets to newer models with higher thrust. In reality in spite of much higher thrust jet airliners today fly at roughly the same speed as the original Boeing 707 that was introduced in 1958. Advances in jet engine technology sometimes resulted in increased range which meant fewer stops on some routes and it is true that there are some minor speed differences between different models of jets not counting the nowretired Concorde but neither of these would have resulted in the drastic effect on crew schedules as portrayed in the movie. The original French play which debuted in 1960 was more realistic as it was based on the transition from props to jets which would have been going on at that time. However I can guess that in 1965 when the movie was produced the writers probably desired to modernize the script by having the plot revolve around new models of jets even though technically this wasn't very realistic. The good news is that the airplane references were pretty accurate i.e. British United actually flew VC10's Air France flew Caravelles etc. One goof was when Robert informed Bernard that Vicky British United has arrived early Bernard says But the Super Boeing isn't due until midnight to which Robert replies Boeing Boeing. However it had already been established that the new British United plane that Vicky was on was a VC10. The VC10 was built by VickersArmstrongs of England not by U.S. based Boeing. Aircraft inaccuracies in a movie are to be expected and can be forgiven but the much larger and perhaps unforgivable plot issue has to do with the fact that each of the three flight attendants lived in Bernard's apartment. That arrangement wouldn't last a week. I could believe that Bernard could juggle three girlfriends by meticulously tracking their schedules and then coming up with excuses as needed as to why he couldn't see them or have them over when they were in town. However since all three lived in his apartment which each had a key to this meant that they would always go there when they were in town even if he was at work. It would be impossible for Bernard to keep coming up with excuses why they couldn't go home to their apartment. Bernard couldn't control their schedules only track them so in no time an unavoidable collision would have occurred. Maybe if they all worked for the same airline and he was a crew scheduler or he could bribe one it could have worked however they each worked for different airlines and he was a newspaper reporter with no control over their comings and goings. Allowing them to live in his apartment doesn't work even in a movie without total suspension of disbelief. If the writers had fixed this one thing the plot would have been much more believable. Would it have been funnier? I doubt it. So I have no real issue with the plot I'm just pointing out the facts. And actually now that I think about Christiane Schmidtmer being repeatedly dragged and carried unconscious around the apartment all is forgiven.".

Still this is a difficult movie to critique even taking into consideration the period and accepting the mindset when this movie was filmed.Clearly this falls into the farcical light comedies of the late 50'searlymid 60's. Exemplfying the male 'heaven' where a dashing global man of means has several beautiful women airline hostesses no less plugged into his sexual carnival. But even taking this into account  'Boeing Boeing' fails to deliver the barrel full of expected suggestive laughs. Levity is there of course but very sporadic and uneven. How and Where specifically?Difficult to define. As both Curtis and Lewis bring their talents to bear I can only point to the director John Rich. He tries to capture the 'martini' energy of similar films of the period  'Some Like It Hot' or 'The Love God?'  but lacked the skill to mesh the cast and material together. not surprising to discover that he's a TV director and this was his one and only directorial attempt at a feature film But equally at fault is a script clearly written for the rambling open stage  forced into the constrained demands of film. The harried and frenetic pace reflects a haphazard adaptation of the stage production material.Rule of thumb to filmmakers If your viewing audience needs a scorecard to keep track of the players and plot directions  your film needs new a edit maybe even a new editor.And scenes that should create sexual tension fall flat as they compete against and not blend into or with the slapstick. Conversely slapstick scenes which should've brought the skills of Curtis andor Lewis to the forefront dribble because they're competing against the sexual energy the scenes actually calls for. An example When Jerry is ordered to massage Ms. Lufthansa  the scene itself isn't filmed nor is Tony's natural reaction when this event is discovered. Both missing scenes would've led to hilarity. Can you imagine Lewis oiling up and slippingsliding over Ms. Lufthansa who is curtly directing where he should put his hands or how hard he should push? Or Curtis confronting Lewis while still covered in oil? Opportunity lost. Instead the film cuts to Lewis wiping down his hands still completely dressed in suit and tie! He then snidely comments It was like oiling down a baby whale. So is he supposed to be lusting after Ms. Lufthansa as presented throughout the first half of the film? Or is he disgusted that she's a large woman and he did it only to fulfill her demands as suggested in the second half? Indecision on the part of the director  no laughs.The entire film is a bunch of similar setups with mishandled deliveries. Imagine simultaneously being told ten jokes but the punchlines are delivered out of order and left for you to decide what fits best and when. Others have noted the incredible anchor of this film Thelma Ritter. Cast into the role of 'straight man' against the wackiness of her male costars her character steals this film. Notably scenes with her in it are where the laughs can be found. This is both enjoyable and sad. So much potential and missed opportunities. It was all 'there'  if only this movie had the right director at its helm.Because there's not enough laughs to justify purchasing this film at current market prices which is considerable given it's OOP or LOOP status this one is only for true devotees of the genre  or for dedicated fans of Tony Curtis andor Jerry Lewis.".

Despite the everchanging roster of activity Thelma Ritter supplies much of the film's humor with her usual delivery of witty oneliners. She does add a degree of respectability to this film that without her would probably feel a bit sleazy. For a nonstop parade of young ladies in Tony Curtis' pad check out Boeing Boeing and see if he and Jerry Lewis ever settle down!";

You know take the Doris DayRock Hudson stuff throw in the Matt Helm irresistible to women device and release to a target audience of Hugh Hefner lifestyle wannabe's.No wonder the HaightAsbury counterculture freespeech movement got such traction at the time from films like Bonnie and Clyde 1967 and Easy Rider 1969. Judging from the content of Boeing Boeing the movement simply filled a cultural vacuum in which the highest aspiration of an American male was to be playboy with a cool pad and a harem of gullible but gorgeous and adoring women then again there is a simplistic superficial charm to this notion. In Boeing Boeing Bernard Lawrence Tony Curtis has a multibedroom apartment in Paris which he shares with his three flight attendant fiancs Vicky Suzanna Leigh Jacqueline Dany Saval and Lise Christiane Schmidtmer. None of the three actresses were particularly talented or successful but their characters are not intended to be anything more than superficial eye candy although even in this they are not especially notable. Bernard his friend Robert Jerry Lewis in a relatively straight role and his housekeeper Bertha Thelma Ritter who is responsible for the film's meager moments of actual comedy spend the film trying to keep the three fiancs from finding about each other. This arrangement is possible because the three work for different airlines and fly at times.The awkward thing for contemporary viewers and apparently for viewers in 1965 as the film was not well received is that Bernard has no sincere feelings for any of the three nor any intention of marrying one of them. He has practiced this kind of scam in the past with other women and is realistic enough to know that he will eventually be exposed. At which time he will move on and set up shop somewhere else. Now I'm normally willing to suspend disbelief about the entire premise and just go with along with the storyline even finding some unintended humor in how they dance around and never directly confront the fact that Bernard is sleeping with three women. But I found it troubling that the three women are portrayed as sincere and likable. If they had been golddigging schemers or if Bernard was simply indecisive and using the setup as a means to make a decision about which one to marry the film would not seem so meanspirited. The flipside of this basic premise was the subject of several Three Stooges shorts with the boys eventually getting megarevenge on the threetiming woman. These were considerably more humorous than Boeing Boeing with Larry Curly and Moe generally behaving more intelligently that anyone in this film. I would neither avoid nor seek out this film. It does provide some interesting clues about the prehippie culture of America or at least what Hollywood thought would attract film viewers during that period. Then again what do I know? I'm only a child.".

This became the code to refer to each stewardess by the airline she flew for.There would be one bad moment in the restaurant when Jerry would talk about another stewardess returning and one not leaving yet and he would proclaim Boeing Boeing as tho to say 'boing boing' and this made for a very unnecessary inclusion of the title in the movie.But hands down the stewardesses and Thelma Ritter were the stars.The British Vicky played by Suzanna Leigh liked kidneys. We began with her and she said everytime she was ready to go out Thelma Ritter would get hostile toward her. She didn't know that Ritter now had to make way for the incoming flight.Air France's Jacqueline played by bobbed Dany Saval was a tiny wisp of a girl who liked soufflets.

And the big reveal  between all three girls finding each other in the same room with Curtis and Lewis stuttering their way through explanations  is ridiculously infuriating.Actually Jerry Lewis does a great job as a semistraight man.

A comedy always leans on society as it is with no ambition of changing anything of it. The farce or impertinence of say Laurel and Hardy is quite different. These guys made fun of whole constitutions and they were never better than when Hardy had a high position in society and Laurel comes and spoils it all. Also their destructiveness as in Tit for Tat or Big Business has a certain edge to it and we never walk away from a Laurel and Hardy film with more respect for society and instead always with less. In fact when you look at those two as on insults to society then you start to grasp their comedy which is just the opposite of usual comedy.This film is a usual comedy. This film is fluff with piff and puff. Still for Tony Curtis sake it is still watchable. He plays it for what it is worth with a shrug like OK I was bought and I'm just a slave like all you others.".

Also their destructiveness as in Tit for Tat or Big Business has a certain edge to it and we never walk away from a Laurel and Hardy film with more respect for society and instead always with less. In fact when you look at those two as on insults to society then you start to grasp their comedy which is just the opposite of usual comedy.This film is a usual comedy. This film is fluff with piff and puff. Still for Tony Curtis sake it is still watchable. He plays it for what it is worth with a shrug like OK I was bought and I'm just a slave like all you others.";

Murphy wants to reform her and make her a typical middle class American housewife Redgrave accepts her inability to formulate or retain a political ideal and while promising her no real future he objects to Murphy's attempts to change her.

	schema:reviewBody "The Quiet American 1958I think this is an extraordinary film. At the time Americans didn't like it because it made them look bad and the writer of the book it is based on Graham Greene didn't like it because it changed too much of his antiAmerican plot. But as a film whatever its blurring of truth to history is true about human nature. The credit for this goes not only to Greene the enormously gifted writer and coscreenwriter but also to the director one of the lesser known American masters at telling a romantic story Joseph L. Mankiewicz who also helped with the screenplay. The two are a perfect match really because both are all about subtlety and observation. Greene in particular has a way of bringing up the biggest issues in the most intimate and delicate ways never grandiose always psychologically sharp. And that is carried forward here in Vietnam a decade before the American War of the 1960s. The Communists are already fighting in the north the French are getting ready to abandon the country to the Americans and a British reporter is the center of our attention not quite on anyone's side.There are two key characters the reporter played with astonishing depth and acumen by Michael Redgrave and the American played toward a caricature by Audie Murphy with enough twists to his character to avoid overstereotyping.Greene's observations of American dogood naivet are fascinating and the way this gets mixed poisoned with American meddling and military subversion is way ahead of its time. Or is it? It might be simply observant of the facts in 1950s Vietnam. Greene was a reporter himself there then and after this book was published he was followed by American Intelligence until his death in 1991. One of the brilliant aspects of this movie is how it is not simply a love story but has a trenchant disturbing comment to make about world affairs from the inside.Still love intrudes and the crossed loves of the two men for the same young Vietnamese woman is less clichd than you might expect. The story is moving without being sentimental. And all of this is layered up with the actual ImperialistColonialist facts of the time. The conflicting sides of a war that few really understood it seems until twenty years later are here in their full formed germinations. Unlike the Michael Caine version of the same story from 2002 this one was made before history had unfolded. It's endlessly almost chillingly fascinating even though Greene's antiwar and somewhat antiAmerican tone was largely removed. The later movie might be closer to the book but it feels like a movie made about history not one that predicts it. There are some scenes here priceless ones shot in Vietnam in 1958 the rest is done with terrific light and set design in an Italian film studio. Greene was British and the production Italian but Mankiewicz was American and fully steeped in American filmmaking and myth making. It's this last aspect that is keythe movie is made to the highest standards of 1940s American melodramas even having an echo in terms of light and drama and style of William Wyler's The Letter also set in Southeast Asia. The filming is astonishingthe photography is in the hands of Robert Krasker who shot The Third Man and Brief Encounter to give you an idea of the moody richness of his style. And as a melodrama it comes down to the crumbling personal world of Fowler. At the end in the busy night streets of a chaotic Saigon he says I wish there was someone to whom I could say I'm sorry. I found it the final moving beautiful strain of truth and pathos in a very special movie.".

However it is a very well made and literate film which manages to make a reasonable stab at living up to the forbidding reputation of its source material. Audie Murphy gives a careerbest performance as the title character an American living in Vietnam during the French incursion into the country. He believes that he can make a difference by providing funding for arms but his political and economic beliefs often lead to death and destruction. A British journalist named Fowler Michael Redgrave befriends him but soon their friendship is damaged when the young American has an affair with Fowler's Vietnamese mistress. In the end Fowler ponders whether to betray the American to his enemies as an act of revenge for what the American has done to his lovelife. The film is powerful absorbing and wellacted. It perhaps could be criticised for the extraordinarily high amount of dialogue it's one of those films where if you stop listening for 30 seconds you'll lose the plot but that is probably the only true weakness. The themes of betrayal colonialism and the wisdom of interfering in the affairs of other nations are handled thoughtprovokingly and the moral dilemma facing the characters at the end are emotionally shattering. Redgrave gives a great performance conveying the pain of his dilemma with aching conviction.".

Not quite what Greene had in mind but relevant to events in the USA during the McCarthy era when this film was made 1958.Phuong has not been given the importance she demands in the novel. The way in which she is 'colonised' by first Fowler and then the American Pyle in the novel but not named in this film is a comment on the way in which the foreign landscape is depicted and also on how the country has been colonised. Despite this she is also manipulative.However having said some negative things about this production of The Quiet American it is a MUST view for the portrayal of tensions in the cold war era and the USA's twist to events as they unfold. Remember that Audie Murphy and Joseph L. Mankiewicz testified for HUAC against their fellow actors and colleagues at the height of McCarthyism.This film is totally relevant to events unfolding today and for all those interested in the effects of colonialism and the rise of the Vietnam War. What is interesting about this film is the different take on events portrayed in Greene's superb novel unfortunately some of which were omitted or subverted in the 1958 film.This film should be followed by the Philip Noyce version of The Quiet American 2001 with Michael Caine as Thomas Fowler and Brendan Fraser as Pyle the American in the Mankiewicz version. There is a good opportunity to contrast and compare the two versions which are very different given that the Noyce Quiet American is closer to the novel.I would also recommend for light relief that viewers watch the Mash Season 2 TV series in which we see Colonel Flag of the CIA raising a few loud laughs.".

	schema:reviewBody "I just saw this film on Turner Classic Movies. When it was over I was reminded of Hemingway's comment when he was asked his opinion of the film version of The Snows of Kilimanjaro it was okay except for one difference in my story the protagonist dies and in the film he lives. This film is as much a distortion of Greene as the other film was of Hemingway in Greene's novel the title character was intended to be a villain but in this film he is a hero.It is not a spoiler to tell you that the title character dies because the film begins with his death and tells what leads up to it in flashback. In Greene's novel the seemingly naive idealistic American who is in then French Indochina for vaguely idealistic operative is in fact a sinister undercover CIA operative in cahoots with an unscrupulous general. Together with the general he plans and executes bombings in public places that result in the deaths of dozens of innocent people then leaves evidence making it appear that the Communists carried out the bombing. His purpose is to turn the Vietnamese people against both the French and the Communists leaving them open to intervention by the US who will of course put the renegade general in charge. The American is seen as so evil by Fowler the pathetic English journalist who is his rival in love that Fowler goes along with a plot to have him killed. The novel is intensely antiAmerican as was Greene.By contrast this film released in 1958 at the height of the cold war and just after the McCarthy era could not afford to appear antiAmerican. The title character is therefore made to appear like a good guy who was indeed hoping for a USbacked third force to intervene in Vietnam. He is never identified as a CIA operative and his complicity in the bombings is revealed as a Communist fabrication intended to dupe the naive Fowler and others. Fowler collaborates in the American's murder because he is a rival in love and not because he is evil. Greene was reportedly outraged at this change and denounced the film. There was some poetic justice the film was both a commercial and critical failure.There are some merits to the film. It was filmed on location in Saigon very unusual for the time when most films like this were filmed in the studio. Consequently we get to see what Saigon was like in a more innocent time before large scale US intervention. There are several Asian actors and actresses in minor roles but not in the key role of Phuong the Vietnamese prostitute with whom both Fowler and the American fall in love. Phuong is played by a Caucasian actress with poor makeup a continuation of a lamentable Hollywood practice that lasted until the 1960s. There is a superb performance by Michael Redgrave as Fowler. Audie Murphy sleepwalks through his portrayal of the American.This film is an interesting period curiosity that is worth watching but the 2002 film with Michael Caine and Brendan Frasier is much better and much truer to Greene's novel. That version is highly recommended.".

I had seen the 2002 with a terrific Michael Caine but the film  a more faithful version of Greene's novel according to the critics and it may be true but the 2002 version left me pleased but unmoved while the 1958 version is much more unsettling in spite of some hard to understand choices by the filmmakers. Audie Murphy plays the quiet American and he is very quiet. Good looking a real life American war hero but he is not an actor and here he is sharing the frame with Michael Redgrave. Michael Redgrave! The other oddity is the casting of Italian Actress Giorgia Moll as the Vietnamese girlinthemiddle. She's lovely but I repeat she's Italian. No the power force here is Michael Redgrave A marvelous fearless performance and that alone makes The Quiet American an absolute must.".

I knew about the existence of this 1958 version written and directed by Joseph L Mankiewicz but I had never seen it until now thank you TCM. I had seen the 2002 with a terrific Michael Caine but the film  a more faithful version of Greene's novel according to the critics and it may be true but the 2002 version left me pleased but unmoved while the 1958 version is much more unsettling in spite of some hard to understand choices by the filmmakers. Audie Murphy plays the quiet American and he is very quiet. Good looking a real life American war hero but he is not an actor and here he is sharing the frame with Michael Redgrave. Michael Redgrave! The other oddity is the casting of Italian Actress Giorgia Moll as the Vietnamese girlinthemiddle. She's lovely but I repeat she's Italian. No the power force here is Michael Redgrave A marvelous fearless performance and that alone makes The Quiet American an absolute must.";

The novel by Graham Greene is set in French IndoChina in 1952 and this version is prophetic. The other one surely has the advantage of a whole lot of hindsight. This film done in 1958 has a lot of foresight.I don't know what to make of Audie Murphy's character it's never brought out but he seems to be a CIA man. In the novel he's from the Ivy League but due to Murphy's speech pattern his character is from Texas. He's bringing in plastic for industrial purposes purportedly but we see how the 'plastic' is really used.The political picture of IndoChina in 1952 has the United States already seeing the French won't hold on and they're getting ready to put in their own surrogate in when the French do fall. Murphy is forever talking about a 'third force' who will bring western style democracy.Murphy also becomes romantically involved with Giorgia Moll who is also the mistress of British newspaper correspondent Michael Redgrave. The rivalry between the two prevents either from acting coherently though Redgrave has a much better idea of what's really happening.Interestingly enough the United Kingdom was also fighting to hold on in Malaya the same way that the French were trying to hold on to IndoChina next door. The British were far more successful though.The Quiet American should have been seen by policy makers in Washington through six administrations in America. A lot of valuable lessons could have been learned and a lot of valuable lives might never have been lost.".

Mank himself has referred to it as a bad film but any film with Michael Redgrave can't be totally bad and had Mank been able as he wanted to sign Monty Clift for the role of Pyle it would have been several degrees better than it is Redgrave versus Audie Murphy is not unlike Federer versus John Lloyd. Graham Greene produced his best fiction in the thirties and early forties so that The Quiet American dates from th years he was phoning it in so the fact that he was dissatisfied with the film is neither here nor there.

	schema:headline " Comparing the 1958 version with the 2002 version";
	schema:reviewBody "I've now seen the two versions of this movie based on this Graham Greene's novel. Though the 2002 version with Michael Cain and Brendan Fraser is supposed to be more faithful to Green's novel I much prefer the story that is presented in this 1958 version. On TCM Ben Mankiewicz said that for marketing reasons the story in this version directed by his uncle had to be toned down to make it less antiAmerican than the novel. He also said that Audie Murphy was probably chosen for the title role because he was a wellknown actorwar hero a Congressional Metal of Honor winner who played himself in the autobiographical war movie To Hell and Back. Though this widescreen blackandwhite movie about two men in faroff place called Vietnam then failed at the box office the locale of its story would come back to haunt us for decades to come.Neither Audie Murphy nor Brendan Fraser stand out as actors that we tend to think of a 'topnotch.' But ironically the acting of the movie's title character doesn't need to be particularly great just adequate. Both versions of this movie are more about THE MYSTERY of quiet American Alden Pyle and what he is doing in Vietnam in 1952 than they are about the characters themselves. So Audie Murphy and Brendan Fraser in the 2002 version only had to basically 'show up' in the movie to have the story work well. BUT FIRST let's consider the plot of the 1958 movie with crossreferences to the actors that played the same characters in the boring 2002 version. As the movie opens the people of Saigon are in the streets celebrating the Chinese New Year Tet with parades of noise makers masks and paper dragons. During the celebration a Vietnamese man discovers the body of a white man lying face down in the river. The body is that of Alden Pyle Audie MurphyBrendan Fraser in 2002 version. Police Inspector Vigot Claude DauphinRade Serbedzija in 2002 version calls in a British journalist Thomas Fowler Michael RedgraveMicheal Caine in 2002 version to identify the body. Fowler is also questioned about HIS whereabouts at the time of the suspected murder. At this point there is a flashback that takes Fowler's recollections back to when and how he first met Pyle and what their relationship had been like during their acquaintance...Basically they met since they were both white men working in an Asian country and they tended to go to the same social clubs and restaurants to relax with other Englishspeaking people. When Pyle first meets Fowler Fowler is accompanied by his livein Vietnamese girlfriend Phuong Giorgia MollDoThi Hai Yen in the 2002 version. While dancing with Phuong at one of the European clubs Pyle is taken with her. When Pyle learns from Fowler that he is separated from his wife who still lives in England and refuses to give him a divorce he honorably tells Fowler that he wants to openly court Phuong. Fowler reluctantly offers to translate English to French Pyle's intentions to Phuong. Pyle tells Phunog that he loves her and wants to marry her and take her back to the US he wants to offer her a future away from Vietnam. This is something that Fowleras a married mancan't do. But Fowler deeply loves Phuong and wants to continue to life with her in Vietnam. The tension of the love triangle is heightened because Phunong's older sister is trying to look out for Phunong's future by hooking her up with the idealized 'rich American man from New York.' The fact that Pyle is neither rich nor from New York is only a minor problem for Phunong and her controlling sister. So Phunong does leave Fowler for Pyle respectfully living apart while courting.As a journalist looking for a story to keep his job in Vietnam Fowler travels to Hanoi in the North. There there is a Communist offensive against the French. When he arrives in the embattled North he is surprised to find Pyle there too. But why would Pyle there when his business is plastics? What do plastics have to do with an offensive in the North? Pyle tells Fowler that he just came up to see him and see the action for himself but why? As the two return home in a jeep they breakdown on the road and are attacked by Communist forces. Pyle then saves Fowler's life and they return safely to Saigon. While Fowler is ready to believe the worst about Pyle's third force a fellow British reporter puts him in contact with a Vietnamese friend. The friend leads him to think the worst about Pyle and his reason for being in Vietnam. Plastics are used in toys but they are also use in explosives. When circumstantial evidence confirms the Vietnamese contact's incriminating evidence against Pyle Fowler's ideas only seem more solid. The final outcome of this movie reveals more about Fowler and Pyle and it has a quirky twist to it. In spite of what other reviewers and critics have said about THIS version of Green's novel I find it far superior to the later more truetothenovel 2002 version with the 2020 hindsight epilogue. To me there is nothing whatsoever corny about the ending of this version. In fact I think that it is very ingenious!! It weaves political intrigue and a murder mystery together and shows how even an objective investigative journalist can be duped when his own ego is involved.".

They buy the story and change it completelyand in the process that pretty much make it into a film saying the opposite of Greene in his novel!!! Not surprisingly the author and many others were ticked and ended up hating the film. So as a retired history teacher I could not help but automatically hate the film because of its dishonesty.

A summary of the major ones follows.First the casting of a European actress as Phuong was deadly. Every time she came on camera I winced. The fact that Phuong and her Asian upbringing and character are central to the plot only served to highlight the fact that this woman did not look act or sound Asian in the least. Think of casting Sylvester Stallone for the lead in Ali. Second Audie Murphy was not up to the role. Murphy's acting credentials were not strong but in the right spots he was capable of being effective. Here however Murphy spouts the dialog in much the same manner as a gradeschool child reciting poetry they don't really comprehend. By god he's memorized every word of it and it is going to come out.Third and most egregious are the liberties taken with the plot. Apparently because of the political pressures permeating the industry at this time the decision was made to make Murphy's death a Communist plot. It is never explained why the Communists would have gone to such great lengths to kill someone who could have just been laughed off and who was being kicked out of Indochina in any event. Regardless this choice had the effect of stripping both male leads of any complexity or richness of character. Murphy comes across as a overage boy scout of almost unbelievable naivety. Fowler assists with the Communist plot clearly to eliminate his rival for Phuong and not to save Vietnamese lives. Denuded of any moral ambiguity he is merely pathetic.I had expected more in a Mankiewicz movie but apparently I failed to take into account the political climate during which it was made. Watch this movie as a curiosity but for entertainment see the 2002 version or better yet read the book.".

He wants to help the Vietnamese but he doesn't know the game there. The British journalist is married to a woman in England but lives with a beautiful Vietnamese woman Phuong. I had to read this book for my 20th Century American History Class. The American played by Audie Murphy did a fantastic job against Redgrave. The love triangle for Phuong is believable yet understated and tame. There is plenty of intrigue and suspicion. Life before the Vietnam war is uncertain and there are clues to the upcoming conflict. This film was done before the Vietnam War and is telling about international relations especially American's fear of communism ruling the world.

	schema:reviewBody "While I'm familiar with the name Graham Greene I've never read one of his books. Of his works the only one I've ever seen was THE THIRD MAN for which he wrote the screenplay based on his own novella. So when I took to watching this movie I was interested to see what I'd make of it.The story is more romance than spy story though it has elements of both. It takes place in the midfifties in Vietnam a country poised on the brink of war and being tugged at both ends by different political factions. The tale is told through the eyes of British foreign correspondent Thomas Fowler Michael Redgrave a world weary reporter who's seen it all and has little hope for peaceful solutions.Fowler lives in an apartment with his companion Phuong Giorgia Moll a young Vietnamese girl who hopes to accompany him when he returns home. Fowler has told her that when he does so he will divorce his wife and the two of them will live together but the reality is that his wife a devout Catholic is unwilling to give him a divorce.Into their lives enters Alden Pyle Audie Murphy. Pyle is unnamed in the movie but named in the book. Pyle supposedly works for an importexport business in town but in reality is an agent of the CIA. Dedicated to his job and believing that there is a solution to the problems in the country he befriends first Fowler to learn more and then becomes enamored with Phuong. While Fowler has no real intention of taking Phuong with him he finds himself insanely jealous of the attention Pyle shows her.Parts of this are interesting to watch as the two men discuss their intentions and Phuong not necessarily as a human being but as something they can barter over. Both have different beliefs about her Fowler that she will just go along with the political climate offered here and Pyle that she can become an American with a sympathetic lifestyle. Her attitude towards it all is simple she just wants to leave the country and go somewhere that has more opportunity. Eventually the romantic triangle must find a solution.Just how far Fowler is willing to go to put an end to his potential rival becomes a big part of the third act of the film. Midway through the pair find themselves stuck in a watchtower and have time to discuss their differing political views. Ever the cynic Fowler finds Pyle to be nave rather than informed. None of it bodes well for Pyle.The film was supposed to be an antiwar piece but was twisted during production. Much of that revolved around the fact that this was during the blacklist period of Hollywood and the fear was it would be construed as a proCommunist film. One thing it did so was predict the difficulties that would take place in Vietnam in years to follow. While a critical success it wasn't a huge hit at the box office.I think part of the reason for this was the structure of the film. It plays like a book and at times can be overly wordy. With little action to be found the movie crawls at a snail's pace while we wait to see what happens. Murphy was a star by this time a decorated WWII hero who was known to play in westerns. This was a change of pace and it may have confused movie goers at the time. Still it makes for an interesting look at a topic rarely covered this way when it comes to Vietnam.Twilight Time provides the standard great looking picture with this release but few extras. All you will find here are an isolated music track with some effects and the theatrical trailer. But if interested make sure you pick one up before they're gone as the standard 3000 copies have been made for release.".

Both have different beliefs about her Fowler that she will just go along with the political climate offered here and Pyle that she can become an American with a sympathetic lifestyle. Her attitude towards it all is simple she just wants to leave the country and go somewhere that has more opportunity. Eventually the romantic triangle must find a solution.Just how far Fowler is willing to go to put an end to his potential rival becomes a big part of the third act of the film. Midway through the pair find themselves stuck in a watchtower and have time to discuss their differing political views. Ever the cynic Fowler finds Pyle to be nave rather than informed. None of it bodes well for Pyle.The film was supposed to be an antiwar piece but was twisted during production. Much of that revolved around the fact that this was during the blacklist period of Hollywood and the fear was it would be construed as a proCommunist film. One thing it did so was predict the difficulties that would take place in Vietnam in years to follow. While a critical success it wasn't a huge hit at the box office.I think part of the reason for this was the structure of the film. It plays like a book and at times can be overly wordy. With little action to be found the movie crawls at a snail's pace while we wait to see what happens. Murphy was a star by this time a decorated WWII hero who was known to play in westerns. This was a change of pace and it may have confused movie goers at the time. Still it makes for an interesting look at a topic rarely covered this way when it comes to Vietnam.Twilight Time provides the standard great looking picture with this release but few extras. All you will find here are an isolated music track with some effects and the theatrical trailer. But if interested make sure you pick one up before they're gone as the standard 3000 copies have been made for release.";

	schema:reviewBody "Personally I thought this movie never really found its direction. One of the advantages of a novel this is based on one by Graham Greene is that it can go in many different directions successfully and work very well because the written word allows for a much fuller depiction of what's happening. If you translate the novel into a movie though you're dealing with a more limited medium and it's a lot harder to make multiple story lines work. So  what was this? Part Cold War thriller part murder mystery part romance with various other things thrown in mixed together and ending up as mush.There were parts of this that I enjoyed. Generally I thought that Peter Redgrave as Fowler a middle aged jaded British journalist and Audie Murphy as The American put on pretty decent performances I appreciated the look somewhat limited but still present at Vietnamese culture and I also appreciated the portrayal of the very early years of the Vietnam War when it was still the French dealing with a Communist insurgency in what was then an integral part of their Empire. It was an interesting look at that aspect of the Cold War. Not really antiCommunist as one might expect from the era but somewhat antieverything. In that sense the movie took on Fowler's jaded personality. Starting with the American's murder the story revolves around the search for the killer and I didn't find that part to be particularly interesting. Unfortunately that's the bulk of the movie. Woefully underused and underappreciated I thought was Giorgia Moll as Phuong the young Vietnamese girl who becomes a love interest to both Fowler and the American. One wonders why an Italian born actress was cast as a Vietnamese not a single Asian actress was around in 1958? but more disappointing was that she had little to do except sip her everpresent milkshakes.Frankly I found most of this dreadfully boring. 310".

I'd have to say that I was pleasantly surprised on how good this movie actually was.Michelle Pfeiffer and Pual Rudd have great chemistry throughout the whole movie. Jon Lovitz appears in the film also and adds a great comedic experience to the film. He stars as Michelle's exhusband in the movie and I laughed every time the both of them were on screen together.Pual Rudd was fantastic in this movie and it shows what he can do when given cotop billing in a comedy. He was great in 40year old virgin and in this he is no different.The movie has the same type of feel of Clueless as it should their both directed by the same person. Give this movie a chance it was funny and kept you entertained throughout the whole movie.I didn't give too much detail as you can tell i just wanted to let you know a little bit of what to expect and how well the actorsactress's come together in this movie.Great date movieor a movie to take your significant other. I promise you'll both have lots of laughs.".

Who can forget Love Actually which basically has some of the all time funniest moments in cinema. I could never be your woman unfortunately does not hit these highs but you will laugh and the characters have a certain warmth.The film really focuses on the relationship between Pfeiffer and her daughter which is unusual in the fact the most of the good comedy moments arise from the daughters relationship with her mother and her mothers personal life. You have to love Jon Lovitz the guy is a genius. He is barely in the movie but his dead pan matter of fact character is a perfect foil to Pfieffers Character.On the whole i would say watch this probably wait for DVD but its certainly worth a rental. The film had the potential to be both funnier and also some pointless Scenes especially with Mother Nature.On a final note i know this is only a film and it was 90 minutes long but if i have children in the future i would like to be a parent like Pfieffers Character. Honest open with a great relationship with her daughter.".

	schema:reviewBody "Amy Heckerling's latest romantic comedy I Could Never Be Your Woman got to use a proverbial word shafted. It was meant for theatrical release and went straight to DVD due to some bad deals done with one of the producers. It's a shame despite the fact that Heckerling's comedy was far from being topshelf work. It certainly stands a good chance at ranking well enough alongside and probably better than many of the tripe conventional marketstuffers that are out in cineplexes. Her film posits that a middleaged TV writer Michelle Pfieffer has some angst and insecurities in dating one of the new stars of her TV show Paud Rudd and it's not a bad premise. This is also thrown in a quasi plot thread involving her daughter Atonement's Saoirse Ronan couldn't tell it was the same girl she's that good as she tries to navigate her first possible boyfriend.A lot of this isn't delivered with all of the best execution certainly it's hard to figure on what exactly makes the Tracy Ullman bits funny as they're slipped in with some awkward softfocus and at illtiming and there's something kind of fishy about putting such an actress like Michelle Pfieffer who is still incredibly beautiful for any age in the role of an insecure woman who can't see herself with such a younger man after such a long break from being with a man. At the same time there is a good deal that does work to Heckerling's advantage such as the bond between the mother and daughter in the story that doesn't ring as being sappy or trite like in other romcoms or flicks with motherdaughter talks and such. And almost in spite of the bright lighting Paul Rudd lays on the same charm and wit carried over from the Judd Apatow comedies if of course nowhere near as funny in the sensibility of crudeness. And who can't love Jon Lovitz or Fred Willard? So with I Could Never Be Your Woman it's good for a rental but that's not really the point with the release issue. It's the kind of movie as with Heckerling's others that play for laughs with a big audience and are perfect for a certain niche of female viewers and diehard romcom afficionados. It's light and slight and not too terrible if not much memorable either.".

	schema:reviewBody "This movie is very disturbing on many levels. Paul Rudd and Michelle Pfeiffer look like lovable people and decent actors. However at the time of filming she was 49 he was 38 and I just do not understand why they have to play respectively 40 and 29. I am sure there must be plenty of actors of the right age who can be even more convincing at being 40 and 29. It seems totally unnecessary to start with such a stupid lie.The plot revolves around the Paul and Michelle characters Adam and Rosie falling for each other and her insecurities about being too old for the guy. Given that they live and work in Hollywood a city where human relationships are based on appearance and people take extraordinary good care of themselves it seems strange that somebody like Michelle Pfeiffer could be so insecure about her looks. Unless her character has the selfesteem of a doormat she must be pretty sure she looks great for her age and all the grieving about being old sound phony and hypocrite. But this is just a minor detail in a vulgar and onedimensional plot. Not only the lives of all the characters are based on appearance and shallow relationships they all seem convinced that youth is the only value and consequently do their best to regress as far as possible into their adolescence. Some of scenes Michelle playing with Barbies and jumping on a bed are cringe inducing. She is a mature professional woman whose only desire is to behave as foolishly as a teenager.Some stupid behavior can be accepted from teenagers because they do not better yet but it is pathetic to see this grownup woman doing her best to regress to her daughter's level. Not that adults have to behave always in wise and boring ways but this movies implies that only way to live a satisfactory life is to remain juvenile throughout one's life. To top up this widespread refusal to grow up and accept responsibilities in one scene Rosie insults her daughter's teacher because he is not giving her good marks. This sounds aggressive and foolish but I am sure nowadays most parents find it perfectly normal to blame the teachers for their children's ignorance and bad marks.In the end this is a sad pathetic but also worrying portrait of how our society is evolving or rather deevolving on the way to eternal mindless shallow youth real and fake and refusal to accept any responsibility. And Jon Lovitz in a small supporting role is one of the most unbearable actors on the market.".

	schema:reviewBody "Amy Heckerling brings forth a delightful romantic comedy centred around the romance between a younger man and older woman. But what makes this one different is the director's treatment. Heckerling's 'I Could Never Be Your Woman' follows the same style of her 'Clueless'. What I liked about the comedy is that the humour is quite dry and that goes very well with the mood and situations of the film. Unlike most recent movies of this genre it does not heavily rely on slapstick or vulgarity. It is pretty much comprised of all kinds of comedy like satire a bit of slapstick innuendos symbolism visual jokes and wit. The whimsical soundtrack gives the movie an upbeat feel. Heckerling gently presents themes like people's obsession with youth plastic surgery looks mattering more than personality and talent.Heckerling's exceptional cast The eternally gorgeous Michelle Pfeiffer takes a break from the negative roles and delivers a splendid performance. I liked her chemistry with her costars. It's as though even after being a big movie star she really enjoyed working with the actors. Likewise Paul Rudd gives a natural and hilarious performance. Everything he does is funny. Saoirse Ronan does an excellent job too. I liked her performance here more than what she did in 'Atonement'. The eternally hot Stacey Dash plays the bimbo very effectively I can't believe she's actually 40 and yet she so right for the part. Jon Lovitz and Tracey Ullman are brilliant respectively as the image obsessed ex and the angry Mother Nature. It was great to see familiar British faces like Graham Norton and Sarah Alexander who superbly plays the passive aggressive unsuccessful seductress.I also liked how Heckerling and the actors portrayed the relationships between the characters. It really comes across as authentic natural and sincere. For example the scene where Rosie and her daughter play with Barbies Adam 'acting around' with everyone Nathan's obsession with looking young Rosie arguing with Mother Nature. Izzie's versions of 'Ironic'...these are all very genuine clever and funny ideas and it is these little things that make 'I Could Never Be Your Woman' a unique gem.".

Even Ephron's average work is much better than I Could Never Be Your Woman.The movie achieves to feel contrived in almost every area from the script to the musical score. The script is so stale that Michelle Pfeiffer can be seen plodding through her lines. She does her best but even though she's perfect for the role it's obvious she will not be lingering on this movie as one of her favourite.The musical score is a happygolucky assortment of eighties hits and try as it might the nostalgia just doesn't appear. The set the people on it and the music just don't match. This is especially evident when the song I Could Never Be Your Woman from White Town is played. This ambiguous song could not be further removed from the neurotically happy Hollywood dwellers atmosphere painted in the movie of the same name. The result of the juxtaposition is that you feel grossed out.I don't feel like wasting any more time on criticizing this sorry little mishap of a film it doesn't deserve even that.

The relationship between the mother Pfieffer and her daughter Roan was equally important and delightful. Enjoyed how much of the Mother's career was involved. And the antihero goofy charm of Rudd was fun. Lots of good lines and funny scenes. However there was a lot of odd stuff that did not fit together. Though I enjoyed Lovitz role as the exhusbandfather I could not imagine him married to MP. I love quirky Tracey Ullman but her role as Mother Nature was awkward and just confused the theme of the movie. Was the motto that you can fight Mother Nature while at the same time the movie mocked all our attempts to do so? In the end it seemed to glorify youth after all. The script gave little attention to the falling in love part of the romance between Pfeiffer and Rudd what made him hit on her right out of the box? They always seemed a little awkward together to me. The best part was the role of the daughter. Ronan hit it right on the mark and was delightful. It is worth it just to hear her version of Ironic near the end of the movie.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is one of the most underrated romantic comedies ever I don't think it even came out in theaters. I caught it on HBO and was hooked. It follows a divorced woman in her forty's who meets a guy in his late twenties through work she's a producer on a fictitious teen sitcom while her teenage daughter falls in love for the first time. This movie works for a lot of different reasons. The first being the undeniable chemistry between Michelle Pfeiffer and Paul Rudd. This I think is one of Paul Rudd's best movies ever. He plays the kind of guy that any girl at any age could fall for. Even more than his charm is his relentless persistence of Michelle Pfeiffer's character not caring about the age difference at all and trying to convince her she should either Adam I'm planning on getting older.Rosie Well I'm not planning on getting younger.Adam That's just being stubborn. The next part is Pfeiffer's film daughter Izzie played spectacularly by Saoirse Ronan who is able to be funny and cute without trying to be too hip seeming like a real kid. From her ex husband who keeps trying to take things he thinks are his to her past aggressive secretary who tries to break them up for no reason to Tracey Ullman as Mother Nature. The movie starts with a monologue from Mother Nature about how she can't stand what the baby boomers have done and Pfeiffer frequently has arguments with mother Nature over the different relationship. Overall it's a great little movie that shouldn't be missed.".

	schema:reviewBody "I love romantic comedy movies. When we say romantic comedies we could imagine 'Pretty Girl' 'There's something about Mary' Something's gotta give' and recently i've seen 'Beause I said so' and so on. Those of movies are my favorite. Most romantic comedy films have in common in main poster. Smile Face of leading Characters and bright and vivid color no gloomy and dark face of people. So i just could guess if it's romantic comedy. I've never heard this movie before i went to go to DVD shop. When i notice this DVD I thought this is just what i want to see. The scenario is so simple and funny. somebody could say it's so clich and banal. But as a 30something woman this kind of story makes me so serious. 40something comedy TVshow producer Michelle Pfeiffer falls in love with a young comedian who is 20s. Even if she really loves him she can't express honestly to him for their age gap. She said that because i'm older than you all of things are my responsibility. We used to say that American society is so opened and sometimes too much uncontrolled and disordered Through this movie we could know there are still selfcontrol conception eventually they became lover though. Even though the story is so simple and look goofy but the actors playing is great. We even could enjoy Michell Pfeiffer's great body line even if she's 50 around. Let's be cool like this movie.The most impressive scene is the relationship between Michell Pfeiffer and her daughter. Michell is divorced but the daughter is still so cool to Mom. Michell doesn't try to control her daughter as well and hope her daughter's romantic love. The daughter even asks to mom 'how to have sex?' Michell's answer is 'Maybe after getting Master degree? or after 18 college student? ' such an openminded mom. i love it. i would like to be like this family. could i be? i'm too much conservative and traditional...i'm not confident...".

But what struck me was the complete suspension of disbelief  fairly standard in a Bollywood flick but this one was trying to be more.Lets take the plot. A gang of pizza delivery boys use soupedup bikes to hijack armored bank trucks and carry out incredible heists. Would a accompanying police escort stop at a traffic light?  hello its the police they would switch on their siren and move to keep pace with the armored truck. Secondly Where are these deserted highways close to BombayMumbai where one can speed at 260kmph 150 miles per hour and also find no other traffic? Third the greatest strength of the police is their organization  numbers skilled specialists etc. However the hero who vacillates between incompetence and retardation works alone with a garage mechanicmotorcycle aficionado who is more hindrance than help. The rest of the police squad seem to be very nonchalant about the stakeouts  treating them more like some chore than the urgent action they are supposed to be. Fourth after a warning is received why would the Chief Minister's charity organizers hold up the collection box with the money in full view of the publicand robbers? Fifth where do the robbers emerge from suddenly?  Why wouldn't a large trailer truck be suspected and searched as a reasonable place to stow away bikes? Finally what sort of moronic investigator reveals all his plans to the arrested suspect while taking a walk as if they were sauntering in Lodhi Gardens? Why didn't he cuff the suspectswhen he had them on camera? No complaints about skin and sex but realistically where does one find fishnet stocking clad girls in the hundreds rooting for bikerider racers in Bombay? I mean if the theme is total fantasy then why have a plot at all  just a series of music videos with a few dollops of sex would have sufficed  oops thats what it was anyway right? I tend to be harsher on movies that pretend to have a plot or be different. I daresay for large numbers of people Dhoom is a first in terms of action cinematography plot etc. It is highly different from the girlmarriesboy with weddingspectacle of 3000 dancers. A tighter plot and some intelligence from the scriptwriters would have made this into a firstrate film.I think everyone acted well  and Abhishek seems fairly similar to his father 30 years ago. Uday Chopra played the nitwit pretty well though again why cast an imbecile as a crucial player? Surely the police can find motorcycle specialists with moderately higher intelligence levels AND humor?".

The film is quite amusing it has some decent action sequences the songs are likable and the pace is fastmoving.The cast are excellent. Abhishek Bachchan plays the cop Jai Dixit on the trail of professional thieves lead by John Abraham. Dixit is aided by Ali Akbar Uday Chopra a thief who provides the comic element to proceedings. Abraham is a superb baddie and provides a great foil to Bachchan's character.The female cast are beautiful but provide little substance to the plot.Although one action sequence borrows heavily from The Matrix Reloaded the film is an enjoyable roller coaster and a great way to pass 2 hours on a rainy day.8 out of 10.

Abraham is a superb baddie and provides a great foil to Bachchan's character.The female cast are beautiful but provide little substance to the plot.Although one action sequence borrows heavily from The Matrix Reloaded the film is an enjoyable roller coaster and a great way to pass 2 hours on a rainy day.8 out of 10. A fun popcorn movie.";

I was amazed and definitely shocked how bollywood could create something exciting for once by imitating a bunch of Hollywood movies.A gang have created a sophisticated way of robbing banks with bikes they are led by Kabir a confident and clever robber who likes a challenge. Kabir uses the highway as a getaway only robbing places that have a slip road next to them onto the highway so he can hide in a lorry and then he works in pizza parlour were no one would ever suspect him of robbing a bank. Jai Dixit a police officer at the top of his game enlists the help of Ali a champion racer into catching these criminals. Soon a game of cat and mouse ensues as Jai and Kabir become FREINDS.I was a fan of The Fast and the Furious so I was excited to see how bollywood could adapt that theme into the plot they used many different themes OCEANS ELEVEN TORQUE and made a great movie. The action was okay although it was fantasy most of it.The songs catching and were really cool and fun to watch and sing along..... especially the remixed version with Tata Young.Easha Deol looked extremely hot in this film I didn't notice her much in the previous films simple because she wasn't very attractive but this film definitely has changed her look and approach.Dhoom has opened my mind to other films of the Hollywood genre but I have since been disappointed I was looking forward to Krrish but that was a waste of time only the fight in the warehouse was worth it And Dhoom 2 wasn't as good as 1 simple because they tried to cash in on the success of 1.Only if John Abraham returned.But all in all DHOOM IS A WILD EMOTION.".

Instead of going on and on about movie let me list the good the bad and the ugly THE GOOD Music is good Background music needs a special mention. Jon Abraham is terrific. The girls look good too. Rimi didn't have anything but 2 songs and she doesn't disappoint. Esha redeemed herself with the beach scene and who can deny that Tata Young is hot. Action on bikes is really cool and makes you wanna buy one of those machines.THE BAD Comedy is awful. I don't know why people in India liked the comedy. Abhishek and Uday try to outdo each other in bad acting. Whole first half of the movie Abhishek keeps asking Uday Chashma Utaroon Kya? I felt like asking Chappal Maroon Kya? Climax fight was bad. Boat on the road? Uday and Abhishek chatting in the middle of a fight? terrible stuff.THE UGLY Abhishek and Uday both look awful in the movie. Cant they get someone good with better aesthetic sense to design something for them.All in all movie was good fun to watch specially because the last movie I watched was Asambhav I would watch Dhoom again just for Jon Abraham. I didn't like the guy when he first started acting in movies but he has not given a single performance I haven't liked. Even in duds like Lakeer he stands out as the best thing. Earlier I didn't like Esha either but as I said she redeemed herself with her beach walk. Mallika and Neha can step aside we have a Jatti on prowl.810".

	schema:reviewBody "The film starts with a bang and ends with one.I was really impressed by the fast paced nature of this film.It was like watching The Fast  The Furious. It's not the most realistic movie I have seen but I believe the objective was not realism but entertainment when it comes to entertainment Dhoom really delivers. The bikes were the stars of this film and I believe this movie made the careers of Esha Deol and Rimi Sen not to mention the exposure it bought for actors such as Abhishek Bachchan Uday Chopraand John Abraham who really impressed with the portrayal of the smart and smarmy thief you love to hate.I think Dhoom is a turning point in Indian cinema. It is a reversal to a style of movie making which saw the making of cult classics such as Sholay Namak Halaal and Don. Movies that have memorable characters and well crafted plot lines. Even though the abovementioned films and Dhoom are not necessarily in the same genre Dhoom will be a cult classic in the future. The beginning of the true Indian Action Film which has fast paced vehicles cool and insightful criminals and daring intelligent yet entertaining law enforcement.There are no overblown sentiments. No revenge plot and no long lost MotherFatherSister Childhood sweetheart etc. The film concentrates on the moment it is in and only involves people that need to be there. The story is executed with great economy. Nothing is superfluous. The dialog was appropriate and amusing. The music catchy and memorable. No unnecessary songs and the dance sequences where well choreographed.You can always rely on Yash Raj Films to come up with the goods when it comes to production quality.The acting was good. Uday Chopra's character Ali stole the show with his comic lines. The misadventures that he finds himself in the middle of create a range of comic situations. The most touching scene he was in was the one where he asks Esha's character if she could really shoot him? No jokes in sight Ali is deadly serious for one moment in the film. Abhishek was great as the very serious and slightly anal detective Jai Dixit.Jai is a man who first and foremost loves his job.The only exception to this is his wife Sweety.He can't stand to loose and this is what motivates him in his relentless pursuit of Kabir and his gang. John Abraham was cool and sexy as Kabir.He's very disciplined and goal orientated and he expects the same from the people around him and will not suffer fools gladly. In this sense he and Jai are the same. Possibly the reason that they start enjoying the Cat and Mouse game that they indulge in throughout the film. The girls where good too.But served more as Eye candy than aything else!Who on earth knew that Esha could look like that?She's really come a long way since her first few filmsand she brings glamor to the role of sexy female thief.Newcomer Rimi is cuteand really suits the character Sweety.Her constant reversal to her native Bengali whenever she is emotionally disturbed made her character even funnier and more memorable.All in all this movie is a 10 for entertainment value! Highly recommend it to anyone who loves action or even comedy because this movie has both in spades. It's the fine balance between the two that has made Dhoom this successful and having some sexy beautiful people and damn fine looking bikes don't hurt! Can't wait for the sequel!".

I generally don't like those movies and not knowing what I was getting to see I was hoping to see a real Indian movie. Instead it was this weird culturalcrashmovie. But that's not the reason I didn't like Dhoom.It's because the whole movie is so bad it's laughable. The dialogs are tacky Thank you mummy. Yes very okay very okay etc the story is predictable and boring the actors are extremely bad and the cutting and special effects or whatever you want to call it are simple and pretentious. They have tried to make it cool but they fail so much it's almost as sad and funny as watching Jackie Chan in City Hunter.".

	schema:reviewBody "I've seen it all before. The hero cop the comic sidekick the sexy girls that serve as movie decorations the villainous but sexy villain and lots of slick beautiful cars or motorcycles things blowing up and a rather simple and predictable storyline. This is a pretty good Bollywood B movie.What lifts it from total mediocrity are the actors the one who played the hero cop Abshishek and the villain John Abraham. Both men are gorgeous both play off each other well in the few scenes they have together in the movie. I must point out an unusual scene that I've never seen done before The cop Jai Dixit has finally captured Kabir the leader of the notorious gang of motorcycle thieves. The two men who have been doing a cat and mouse dance throughout the whole movie finally meet. The cop has arrested Kabir. They are walking up the stairs of the hotel and I assume to the waiting arms of the police. The two men act like good friends as they chatted amicably. What they are talking about is how they were able to outwit each other. One scene the two men are talking the next scene you see the men reacting to each other as they realized how they were so easily duped by each other.It's hard to explain the scene until you see the movie. I thought it was very unusual in that the two tough men would not show their reactions in front of each other but in the other scene they clearly show their reactions. It's like the director of the movie wanted to show the thought processes of both men. I like that device though it was a little awkward because the viewer doesn't catch on immediately.I felt I had to point that out because I like what the director did.John Abraham John Abraham John Abraham! My goodness is this guy GORGEOUS! I actually paused the DVD for a few minutes just to gaze at this beautiful man! Just feasting my eyes on John Abraham was reward enough to sit through this entertaining but predictable action movie! Worth watching definitely!".

The acting by Abhishek and John Abraham was okay good enough for their first hit movie. Obviously Uday Chopra was horrible and annoying to the core. He tries way too hard to be funny and cool. The music was good though. There was some comedy but some of it was not really that funny. The only thing I really remember this movie for was the cheesy action sequences and the repeated Dhoom Machale music and tune. Overall the movie is okay and I mean it isn't horrible but it isn't great. It still entertains though. I would rate it like a 6.3 out of 10.".

As we thought here comes a dashing and daring action film directed by sanjay. As it's theatrical trailer failed to create an impression upon us as well it's the first action film from yash raj films most of us were not quite sure about dhoom. Upon it's release i felt that it deserves more than we anticipated. Dhoom is an action thriller film which tells about the story of kabir a calm and arrogant man attempts to loot a casino in goa and how his progess is retarded by a super cop jai and his fellow side kick Ali a mechanic took from slums in order to associate jai in his case. Throughout the entire film action scenes were well shot as well tunic musics. Story of this film succeeds to keep us in edge by it's gripping screen play and thrilling background music by salim. In my point of view i personally felt that rimi sen shouldn't be in this film since her character in this movie is good though and in addition to that movie could have been even longer as action scenes and plot are very pleasing. In conclusion i would like to say that dhoom shouldn't be missed for any reason and it has all variety of entertainment as well as brilliant acting all over it. So go for it guys and have fun........Acting  Except abhishekh and rimi for john it's 910 Songs  810 StoryPlot 910".

It had more style than most stylish Hollywood movies actually and has set the bar really high for anyone trying to emulate style. They could have done without mentioning the word style. The idea of a heist in the casino may have been repeated in several BHollywood movies however this one has a refreshing twist to it.Noticeable 1. Esha Deol's unlimited exposure! This was new... I've only seen her in the Aayudha Ezhuthu style. Here she reveals her shape and a pinch of tan does her no harm. She has also danced nicely to the tunes. The jet ski scene is heights of exposure for even a Bipasha or Mallika. Rimi Sen adds her skin component to make it a large skin show.. but that's not all in the movie...2. Uday Chopra's acting talent and comic timing. This guy ought to have been more famous. But maybe because he acts selectively is why he looks cool. A filmfare for best comedian award on the cards?3. Aby Baby has done a very good job in this movie as a follow up to his role in Yuva.4. Last but certainly not the least... John Abraham was WONDERFUL!!! Super style super bod and great acting.

I know it has features which many will 'bag' such as predictability stereotypical characterization and holes in the plot you could drive a truck through. BUT I went to see this movie wanting to be entertained and I was so entertained that I went back and saw it a second time. It has action romance the wonderful dance sequences that Bollywood is famous for colour music and general excitement. I just loved Uday Chopra's character who combines both tough guy and fully man so effectively. The main lead 'Jai' is a little flat at times but he mainly provides the opportunity for others to 'do their thing'.Rimii Sen as his wife delightfully named Sweety is gorgeous and I love the way she controls some of the details of Jai's life and Esha Deol as the mystery woman I won't throw in any spoilers! is also beautiful and engaging  her dance in the rain when her car breaks down is absolutely delicious and the director hasn't wasted any opportunity to make the most of Esha's physical charms! The music is a highlight and the credits track Dhoom Dhoom by ThaiAmerican Tata Young who has just released her first English language album is fast and hot with the added advantage that while the song is playing and the credits are showing what I presume is the video clip showing a ravishing Tata Young gyrating her way through various sexy situations is a lovely bonus. Overall it's a great bit of fun not to be taken too seriously!".

	schema:reviewBody "GODZILLA FINAL WARS may not please Godzilla purists but it delivers the goods for everybody elseat least those with some knowledge of Godzilla lore. I saw it with a packed house of G fans at Subway Cinema's annual New York Asian Film Festival and it was the perfect audience for a film as steeped in the kaiju mythos as this one. Every time a new monster appeared on screen the crowd applauded or rather they applauded once that monster became recognizable since the director often teases us with quick cuts and blurry motion before giving us a good steady fullbody shot. There are 15 monsters in all many friendly old faces and some obscure ones but all recognizable to longtime Godzilla fans.The other real pleasure for G fans is the starstudded cast. Three venerable stars of older kaiju films turn up two in major roles. Akira Takarada star of the original GODZILLA 1954 plays the UN Secretary General and Kumi Mizuno the gorgeous leading lady from MONSTER ZERO FRANKENSTEIN CONQUERS THE WORLD WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS and more plays the Commander of the Earth Defense Force. In a smaller role Kenji Sahara turns up in a lab coat assisting the attractive young female biologist Rei Kikukawa assigned to investigate the monster attacks. Also on hand are Jun Kunimura Boss Tanaka in KILL BILL VOL. 1 Kane Kosugi a martial arts star in his own right and son of ninja star Sho Kosugi and one other gorgeous actress Maki Mizuno who plays the biologist's newscaster sister. Masahiro Matsuoka plays Ozaki the lead mutant hero who uses MATRIXstyle martial arts to fight the alien invaders. Don Frye plays the tough American captain who pilots the Gotengo the flying burrowing ship from ATRAGON and stands up to the aliens in several memorable confrontations. A martial artistwrestlerextreme fighter known primarily in Japan Frye speaks all his lines in English in the Japanese print I saw while everyone else speaks Japanese to him.The film's allstar monster cast and alien invasion plot seem derived chiefly from DESTROY ALL MONSTERS 1968 but with everything pumped up to hyper speed. The film is incredibly fastpaced and filled with action either in the form of battles between monsters or martial arts fightsraygun shootouts between the human and mutant defenders and the alien invaders. Since the monsters attack numerous cities around the world including New York Paris Shanghai Tokyoof courseand even Vancouver! there turns out to be more mass destruction in this film than in all other G films combined.One can argue that the whole production is sheer lunacy but it's lunacy done with conviction and affection. The director clearly knows and loves Godzilla films and he conveys that love while also adding new twists and imaginative touches e.g. Anguirus the spikecovered ankylosaurus curling up into a spiked ball to launch a rolling attack. One's overall reaction depends on any number of factors but this should definitely be seen by all kaiju fans.".

	schema:reviewBody "Somewhere between 1954 and today Godzilla lost his meaning. Originally a symbol of nuclear destruction foreboding and terrifying Godzilla has played a number of roles such as hero villain father and everything in between. So it's only fitting that on his 50th birthday and his retirement party he gets to be a little of everything and pretend he's nothing all at the same time.This is said to be Godzilla's final theatrical appearance and like any big star stepping out of the limelight his presence will be felt long after he's gone. But instead of one last curtain call or final bow the King of all monsters isn't walking away with grace and dignity he's throwing the biggest monsterfilled party you could possibly imagine. Now to be fair if you're a huge fan of Godzilla movies there's a huge chance you won't like this film. However as a devoted and loyal Gfan for the last two decades I can only say this WHAT A WAY TO GO OUT! Helming the film is the amazing director Ryuhei Kitamura director of such great cult classics as Versus and Azumi. And while he may seem an odd choice for a kaijudirector he makes the best of everything he's got to use. His cast is excellent especially Kazuki Kitamura as the XAlien leader who damn near stole the show or rather he would have if he didn't have to compete with the worst but greatest actor ever Don Frye. The clichd action hero of the group Frye rocked out loud delivering such great oneliners as Listen Kid there are two things you didn't know about the Earth. One's me and the other's...Godzilla!. Sure all his lines are delivered terribly but that didn't matter. He was just a coolasice presence on the screen.For the first since 1968's classic Destroy All Monsters the human characters actually seemed to matter in the film doing more than just tracking monsters or building weapons. But what about the monsters? Well first of all Kitamura breaks the most monsters in a single movie record set back in 1968 over 12! and brings back some of the fan favorites you've been dying to see again King Caesar Anguirus Kumonga and of course the awesome cyberkaiju Gigan. The visuals in this movie are great and the action is nonstop. The monster fights are stunning and cool yet cheesy and campy at the same time. The suits with the exception of maybe Caesar are incredible and Godzilla finally gets to trash monsters in the way we only imagined he could. Even Godzilla's adopted son Minilla you know the little aborted Godzilla fetus gets some screen time that really makes you like the ugly little monster. The story is simple Aliens try to take over the world with giant monsters. But it's executed with such style and raw power that the old clichd story works so well and even takes the liberty to poke fun of itself when it doesn't the word somehow seems to get tossed around a lot!. Think of it as a going away party for a friend you invite everyone you know they bring their friends and they bring even more friends things get a little out of control and in the end you're not really sure what happened but you know it was an awesome onceinalifetime ride. That pretty much sums the film up.All in all I've never had more fun watching a Godzilla movie in my entire life. I don't know if Mr. Kitamura set out to make a great movie but if his goal was to make the most entertaining film ever then he succeeded and then some! Long live the King!".

It takes a very similar scifi angle to Godzilla vs. Monster Zero and adds a dash of Matrix stylization while constantly bombarding you with fantastic Kaiju fight scenes.I am not sure that Final Wars will see the same shelflife as some of the older classic Godzilla flicks due to the fact that it is so actionoriented. This film is definitely not going to get the camp appreciation that so many older films do.

	schema:headline " Great but Overkill";
	schema:reviewBody "My favorite Godzilla movie since TERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA Toho 1975! Since 2000 I felt the series was a string of indistinguishable films. I was also never impressed by the 'heisei' or postGODZILLA 1985 series. So for better or worse GODZILLA FINAL WARS stands out. It tends to emulate the more overthetop Godzilla movies of the 1970s which I certainly don't mind. Instead of following the exact same pattern as all of GODZILLA 2000's Toho 2000 predecessors GODZILLA FINAL WARS takes a more creative approach and swipes ideas from THE MATRIX Silver Pictures 1999 all them XMen comic books and spatterings of typical Japanese TV hero stuff. While all these mixed genres may not play off each other perfectly and we have a mess of a film at times at least we've finally got a Godzilla movie that actually stands out from the rest I think the only other stand out film is 1971's GODZILLA VS. THE SMOG MONSTER.However its overthetop approach was headacheinducing The fast pace is overkill in sharp contrast to every movie in the series starting with GODZILLA 1985 and reminded me of crazy Hong Kong fantasies of the 1980s or 1990s specifically Tsui Hark farces like ZU WARRIORS OF THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN Golden Harvest 1983. It got frustrating trying to keep up amid all the quick edits and flashy gimmicks which hide a fairly simple story we've seen before space invaders attack Earth and control giant monsters. Yet despite all this I still like the movie a lot and consider it an improvement over everything to come out of the series in the 1980s and 1990s. The human characters at least offer old timers like Kumi Mizuno and Akira Takarada some interesting roles and I didn't recognize Akira Takarada right away. The younger actors are interesting too better than the generic boring soldiers of the last few movies at any rate. The main villain in his typical postMATRIX black cape has this eerie makeup but is so emotional and bumbling that he's more clownlike than scary. Many Godzilla fans dislike the movie but with me you're seeing it from the pointofview of a fan of superheroes  martial arts. So I think this puts me in a position to evaluate  appreciate the overall movie on another level. When the heroes and villains clash it's fairly exciting action but being a postTHE MATRIX movie everything is overenhanced with CGI junk. Their plight is diminished because we know there's really no thrilling stunt work. I met action choreographer  stuntman Tsutomu Kitagawa last year and we did some comical martial arts moves for video cameras. His karate skills are first rate having studied at Sonny Chiba's Japan Action Club and made his debut in superhero programs such as the classic AKUMAIZER 3 Toei 1974 series.

	onyx:emotionText "My favorite Godzilla movie since TERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA Toho 1975! Since 2000 I felt the series was a string of indistinguishable films. I was also never impressed by the 'heisei' or postGODZILLA 1985 series. So for better or worse GODZILLA FINAL WARS stands out. It tends to emulate the more overthetop Godzilla movies of the 1970s which I certainly don't mind. Instead of following the exact same pattern as all of GODZILLA 2000's Toho 2000 predecessors GODZILLA FINAL WARS takes a more creative approach and swipes ideas from THE MATRIX Silver Pictures 1999 all them XMen comic books and spatterings of typical Japanese TV hero stuff. While all these mixed genres may not play off each other perfectly and we have a mess of a film at times at least we've finally got a Godzilla movie that actually stands out from the rest I think the only other stand out film is 1971's GODZILLA VS. THE SMOG MONSTER.However its overthetop approach was headacheinducing The fast pace is overkill in sharp contrast to every movie in the series starting with GODZILLA 1985 and reminded me of crazy Hong Kong fantasies of the 1980s or 1990s specifically Tsui Hark farces like ZU WARRIORS OF THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN Golden Harvest 1983. It got frustrating trying to keep up amid all the quick edits and flashy gimmicks which hide a fairly simple story we've seen before space invaders attack Earth and control giant monsters. Yet despite all this I still like the movie a lot and consider it an improvement over everything to come out of the series in the 1980s and 1990s. The human characters at least offer old timers like Kumi Mizuno and Akira Takarada some interesting roles and I didn't recognize Akira Takarada right away. The younger actors are interesting too better than the generic boring soldiers of the last few movies at any rate. The main villain in his typical postMATRIX black cape has this eerie makeup but is so emotional and bumbling that he's more clownlike than scary. Many Godzilla fans dislike the movie but with me you're seeing it from the pointofview of a fan of superheroes  martial arts. So I think this puts me in a position to evaluate  appreciate the overall movie on another level. When the heroes and villains clash it's fairly exciting action but being a postTHE MATRIX movie everything is overenhanced with CGI junk. Their plight is diminished because we know there's really no thrilling stunt work. I met action choreographer  stuntman Tsutomu Kitagawa last year and we did some comical martial arts moves for video cameras. His karate skills are first rate having studied at Sonny Chiba's Japan Action Club and made his debut in superhero programs such as the classic AKUMAIZER 3 Toei 1974 series. Unfortunately his work is diminished because of the CGI 'enhancements' which give all the choreography  stunts an artificial feel. What's the point of a highspeed motorcycle chase that isn't real? It's like a radio ventriloquist simply defeating the purpose. While it might not impress the average daikaiju fan there are fans of superheroes  martial arts who will find fun in GFW. Though the typical Godzilla fans might hate GFW the typical Kamen Rider fans will like it.There's an impressive list of nostalgic names on hand Not just Godzilla and Ghidrah but Rodan Mothra Atragon King Seesar Minya Manda Angilas Hedorah Gino Spiga Gimantis and Ebirah all make appearances.

This is a hard core action film that never lets up and leaves you drained.The main negative is that it cribs way too much from the film The Matrix.

	schema:reviewBody "First before my review I have address two points of contention about this film. For starters the hero Ozaki besides having short black hair black clothes and martial arts skills no more resembles Keanu Reeves than a brick resembles a primemover. His clothes may have similar pigmentation to the Matrix's Neo but in this film Ozaki is actually wearing white plastic body armour and his military coat is dark green. Both he and Neo might share martialarts knowledge. At least Ozaki is from the country that invented a large portion of it! Besides I thought he looked MUCH more like Noah Wyle. If his coat had been white perhaps people would say the film was ripping off ER.The second issue is about the 'Matrix style'. Since even the creators of those films admit that their style harvests greatly from manga anime and HK action movies it would be fair to say that Final War's director Ryuhei Kitamura is more influenced by his own culture than three blockbuster popcorn flicks. Stopping bullets with telepathy psychic battles gravity defying fights and slow motion have been enjoyed in Japan and mainland Asia for a VERY long time. Unfortunately many aspects of their fiction have been somewhat hijacked by Hollywood.The director shows many influences in this film and it would foolish to deny that the Matrix did not play a part in shaping his approach. However many film goers are simply unaware of the depth of The Matrix's own influences and shouldn't attribute too much to them. Anyway on to the review.Well if you are seriously wanting to get anything out of this film you should probably become a fan of Godzilla and Kaiju genre. Anyone else would probably mistake this film's style steeped in Kaiju tradition for faults. It is true that the special effects are mostly 'analogue' and that the monsters are NOT CGI usually. Yes they are men in suits wrestling in model cities but is it a flaw? Heck no! This film is great entertainment and even a little touching!The story is simple a new force threatens the earth and sends monsters to destroy cities and crush humanity. What else? Luckily the defenders of earth a collection of mutants themselves strive to combat the threat and restore peace. Godzilla herself may just be the only weapon left to mankind that could save the human race.And so stylistically this film is very SF. The human forces wear futuristic body armour and sport hightech weapons. There are flying battleships and alien spacecraft. This may be an angle that some fans don't agree with but atleasy the monsters are all here. I forget how many but quite a few from the Godzilla bestiary return to wreak havoc and there are some fantastic clashes between them.However Final Wars is as much a human story as it is one of mass destruction at the hands of giants. Yes that was a little difficult to say. But there is quite a lot of focus placed on the human protagonists this time. They are fighting a new and mysterious new foe. Many of the action sequences and in fact often the longest ones involve humans in handtohand.Even if this raises the hackles of a few Kaiju fans I can understand bring on the rubbersuited titans and all that. Yet I think that this dual focus adds an engaging dramatic quotient to the film. The action sequences may also draw a few comparisons to a certain fizzled out scifi trilogy and all I can I say to that is written above. And the words get over and it.The acting skill of the players varies between that of a seasoned performer to that of a prowrestler grapling with his lines. Oh wait I think he is a prowrestler. I feel though that if viewers are looking at acting skill in a film like this they missing out on the bigger picture. Rest assured however that this is definitely not like Devilman where storefront manikins could have acted better.Reportably Final Wars is an anniversary film and it is though doubtfully the last in the Godzilla series. For that reason regardless if it remains that way I was very happy to see the film stay true to the heritage it is a part of. It provides a fitting farewell. There is something refreshing watching rubbersuited actors trample miniature sets  actors pretending to be monsters waving their claws about. Sure the such things are cheesy and yes the rest is overly stylised but the film makes no excuses for that and it shouldn't.Bring it on!".

The titles were not easy to read as they literally flashed on and off of the screen on top of distracting clips from classic Godzilla films.The film's script was as confusing and scattered. The film started with a good deliberate pace but quickly degenerated into an orgy of images and scenes spliced together in such quick succession as one person I talked to put it it was like you were channel surfing between several scifi and kaiju films playing at the same time.The special effects were at times spectacular and beautiful...at other times they looked as if they had been executed in a rather hasty fashion. Some notable effects sequences the Earth Defense Force's battle with Ebirah Rodan's attack on New York Godzilla's battle with Kumonga in New Guinea. Deserving special recognition is Zilla's daytime attack and night time fight with Godzilla in Sydney Australia. Zilla's CGI was very well executed. There were a handful of effects shots that were not totally bad but could have used some fine tuning. Manda attacking Atragon could have used some more work for example.Keith Emerson's electronic and pulsating music must be the most unique ever heard in a Godzilla film but well done and intriguing.As mentioned earlier the pace of the film is so fast and erratic it is hard to keep up with. Without giving away specifics this must be one of the most outofcontrol if not THE most outofcontrol script in the series.It will take me a few days to figure out my true feelings about this film but I imagine with its high points and its flaws this will be one of the most controversial films in the series among fans.".

	schema:headline " Big loud and cheesy as hell...I wouldn't change a thing.";
	schema:reviewBody "Fifty years ago Toho made their first Godzilla movie. It was a very dark and symbolic movie. Despite its age the film still has an eerie quality to it. Godzilla slowly marching through Tokyo leaving nothing but death and destruction to this day sends shivers down my spine. This fantastic film was the first of 28 movies to feature the monster Godzilla. The thing is over the years Godzilla movies have become a genre of their own. No longer are they dark or violent rather they are fun and cheesy. This has somehow worked for fifty years and Godzilla is now cemented as a cultural icon.That brings me to Godzilla Final Wars. This movie is meant to be Godzilla's last film for at least ten years. Toho has never spent so much on a film and they have never allowed so much madness to make the final cut. This film is essentially a best of Godzilla finale. Toho took everything they thought was cool about Godzilla and crammed it into two hours of almost nonstop action.I'll say right now that this movie is not well made. It's never going to win any awards for acting or originality. Heck I doubt it will ever amount to anything other than being one hell of a good time. This film has city destruction martial arts monster battles aliens motorcycle chases aerial dogfights shootouts and even gratuitous gore.Does it have a plot? No not really. Do I care? Not one bit. Godzilla Final Wars is all about fun and it succeeds in every way. The monster battles are however the main highlight here. They are extremely short but their spectacle can't be denied. I was shaking with excitement each time Godzilla met face to face with one of his foes. Each battle presented a different type of fighting and they all wind up being extremely memorable.The sheer brilliance of the battles is perhaps amplified by the fact that many of these monsters haven't appeared since the 60's yet here they are in all their redesigned glory. Gigan's redesign is especially impressive since he's always been one of my favorites.Another factor that contributes to the spectacle would be the visuals. They're not necessarily the best around but are top notch as far as Godzilla movies go. What we have here is a combination of CGI and monster suits that works extremely well together. The power beams death rays and flames created by these monsters have never looked better.Monster battles have always proved to be the highlights of past Godzilla films however the best movies were the ones that struck a balance between cool monster fights and interesting human scenes. Final Wars delivers what may be the best human scenes around. These scenes are essentially uninspired Matrix rips the main character even bears more than a passing resemblance to Mr.Reeves but they work so well with the movie's mood. They're cheesy fun and I even found a few of them to be genuinely well thought out. These are entertaining scenes and couldn't have been better even if they were taken seriously.So basically what I'm stressing here is that Godzilla Final Wars is not a good movie by Hollywood standards however when watched in the right state of mind you'll find yourself having as much fun as you possibly can with a movie. If this is the last Godzilla movie I can proudly say the big G went out in style. If not well all I can say is bring it on.My review from Frider Waves. httpfriderwaves.comindex.php?pagegodzillafinal".

Godzilla slowly marching through Tokyo leaving nothing but death and destruction to this day sends shivers down my spine. This fantastic film was the first of 28 movies to feature the monster Godzilla. The thing is over the years Godzilla movies have become a genre of their own. No longer are they dark or violent rather they are fun and cheesy. This has somehow worked for fifty years and Godzilla is now cemented as a cultural icon.That brings me to Godzilla Final Wars. This movie is meant to be Godzilla's last film for at least ten years. Toho has never spent so much on a film and they have never allowed so much madness to make the final cut. This film is essentially a best of Godzilla finale. Toho took everything they thought was cool about Godzilla and crammed it into two hours of almost nonstop action.I'll say right now that this movie is not well made. It's never going to win any awards for acting or originality. Heck I doubt it will ever amount to anything other than being one hell of a good time. This film has city destruction martial arts monster battles aliens motorcycle chases aerial dogfights shootouts and even gratuitous gore.Does it have a plot? No not really. Do I care? Not one bit. Godzilla Final Wars is all about fun and it succeeds in every way. The monster battles are however the main highlight here. They are extremely short but their spectacle can't be denied. I was shaking with excitement each time Godzilla met face to face with one of his foes. Each battle presented a different type of fighting and they all wind up being extremely memorable.The sheer brilliance of the battles is perhaps amplified by the fact that many of these monsters haven't appeared since the 60's yet here they are in all their redesigned glory. Gigan's redesign is especially impressive since he's always been one of my favorites.Another factor that contributes to the spectacle would be the visuals. They're not necessarily the best around but are top notch as far as Godzilla movies go. What we have here is a combination of CGI and monster suits that works extremely well together. The power beams death rays and flames created by these monsters have never looked better.Monster battles have always proved to be the highlights of past Godzilla films however the best movies were the ones that struck a balance between cool monster fights and interesting human scenes. Final Wars delivers what may be the best human scenes around. These scenes are essentially uninspired Matrix rips the main character even bears more than a passing resemblance to Mr.Reeves but they work so well with the movie's mood. They're cheesy fun and I even found a few of them to be genuinely well thought out. These are entertaining scenes and couldn't have been better even if they were taken seriously.So basically what I'm stressing here is that Godzilla Final Wars is not a good movie by Hollywood standards however when watched in the right state of mind you'll find yourself having as much fun as you possibly can with a movie. If this is the last Godzilla movie I can proudly say the big G went out in style. If not well all I can say is bring it on.My review from Frider Waves. httpfriderwaves.comindex.php?pagegodzillafinal";

	schema:reviewBody "Welcome to Godzilla Final Wars. Now this is what a Japanese kaijueiga film should be. The plot is utterly ridiculous taking its cues from literally hundreds of martial arts movies 1999's The Matrix past Gfilms and even the maligned American version of Godzilla and rolls it all into one big monster bash. It's a party where everybody is invited even those here in America can be in on the fun.2004 marked the Big Guy's 50th anniversary and this film was released to commemorate it. Godzilla Final Wars isn't a call for the end of Godzilla but is a cause for celebration. Many monsters who haven't been seen in over 30 years make their cameos here and they all get dealt with appropriately by the Big Green Guy. This latest and presumably last entry for a decade or so is directed by Ryuhei Kitamura whose work on 2000's Versus has not gone completely unnoticed here in the United States which explains the frenzied kungfu fighting and allout monster mayhem. But is it worth it? The answer yesThis time out aliens in a plot that more than resembles 1965's Godzilla vs. Monster Zero have come to our planet promising us a stay from an impending apocalypse. We unwisely accept their offer without a whole lot of contemplation but a few individuals due a little investigating and uncover a secret plot to destroy the world. Led by the unnamed and hyperactive adolescent Controller of Planet X Kazuki Kitamura they manage to fool us good.These aliens known as the Xilians have secretly captured all of earth's mightiest and most destructive monsters and are using them to decimate the world's major cities. The M Organization a team of hitech mutant humans is put on the case along with an American captain named Gordon Don Frye and an elite M soldier named Ozaki Masahiro Matsuoka. Realizing they haven't got long before the monsters have won they conclude they have only one option free Godzilla from his icy South Pole prison a spectacular opening sequence highlights this feat and he will singlehandedly deal with the monsters and the Xilians.I've been watching Godzilla since I was old enough to collect memorabilia and stage spectacular imaginary scenes of Japan's or some other choice city's destruction. I have also been highly critical of the third generation of Godzilla movies being that the special effects quality has been lacking and the appearance of many unappealing new foes Megaguirus anyone?. Here the filmmakers have made the brilliant choice of going back and searching the annals of Godzilla's history and raiding the baddies from there. I am a little unnerved however to see Godzilla battling some of his old allies but I dismiss this criticism with a wave of the hand  different generation different monsters different cause.Each new monster is given a wickedcool image makeover the upgraded cybermonster Gigan is especially more terrifying and one may not need to be a buff to know who each monster is. Frenzied martial arts action scenes and monster destruction thrusts the film along at a rapid pace but pick up significantly in the second half sadly though the Big Guy doesn't make his big appearance for at least a good hour and you've got to sit through plot and minor monsters leveling major cities. In one hardtograsp sequence M team members manage to take on Ebirah using only rockets and lasers.Acting is okay an achievement in itself for this kind of movie and dubbing is not a problem anymore since the DVD I watched came with optional English and Japanese audio tracks Japanese does suffice. The dialogue is somewhat cheesy but I didn't care I actually respected some of the human characters particularly the stoic Captain Gordon another amazing feat for this presumed last entry.Lastly the monsters don't disappoint. I can spot them the Kamacuras giant praying mantis the Kumonga giant spider King Caesar Anguirus Rodan Mothra King Ghidorah Hedorah Minilla Manda and even the American Godzilla named Zilla has a brief showdown with Godzilla and is dealt with properly.Godzilla Final Wars is a proper way for the Big Guy to retire. It's a monster mash all right and I wasn't disappointed one bit. For this fond Gfan Final Wars is Godzilla seen as he's meant to be in a monster mash. I'm hesitant about recommending most Godzilla movies to those that don't understand Godzilla or Japanese monster movies as a whole I don't blame them. However this is in a category of its own. It may be a movie for anyone with an open mind about them even if they know nothing about Godzilla. For those with an already dense interest in Godzilla it's the monster bash they've been waiting for.1010".

	schema:reviewBody "If this is the last Godzilla as said then I can say the series had a good run and ended on a high note. Perhaps not the highest note possible this is a very flawed film. However it is the second best in the Millennium series next to Megaguiras.If you read my Godzilla Mothra Mechagodzilla review than you can easily see why i say so. Many of this series have had this annoying habit of having about thirty minutes of plot then an hour of monster combat. This one gives equal time to storyline and action sequences.No matter how short the monster battles are always entertaining the high point being a fight between Mothra and Gigan. This battle is relatively quick but still very entertaining. Gigan is one of the most powerful foes in the movie and it was good to see Mothra getting to fight the second most important monster.Monster X looked like something that would be creepy if it was human size or maybe a little taller and crept around in the shadows of a space station. However it didn't matter when he was easily the most powerful monster in the film or at least could transform into it.The human battles were all done very well accept for an annoying motorcycle chase which had the dumbest use of Matrix style special effects I have ever seen. However many disappointed fans exaggerate the Matrix influence. It is clearly there in the action scenes don't get me wrong but other than the one I mentioned they are well crafted fight scenes.I rather not talk about the film's flaws after all when they are flaws you find in any action film what are you going to get from going over them. And that in itself is a flaw This is an action film. Don't expect a monster movie it is an action film that happens to have a lot of the action being done by monsters.With an ending that could bring a tear to one's eye. So the Godzilla series presumably ends on a good note much better than Godzilla vs. Destroyah Terror of Mechagodzilla was not an ending in my opinion. This is a film to be enjoyed and should have a place in your collection. Its the movie that every now and then you might just want to pop in the DVD player just because. stars".

	schema:reviewBody "The King of Monsters much like an emperor without clothes is pretty much an embarrassment to this GFan. Such a sad farewell to an old friend made by possibly the worst director that Toho could have chosen for this type of film Ryuhei Kitamura.Many folks will say well what do you expect? its a Godzilla film! To them i'd say lets look at the last 3 g flicks to come out... GMK GxMG  GMMG Tokyo SOS. All three have 1.An excellent story 2.Amazing effects 3.More monster action per scene. And while some scenes are brilliant the vast majority of GFW is rather dull and laughable yes even for a Godzilla film especially after seeing the 3 afore mentioned films. While I will agree the three films that come before final wars aren't perfect. They outshine final wars by leaps and bounds.Let me lay it out for you all. The movie is over 2hrs long... of that 2hrs only 35min or less deals with any monster action at all...and what do you get for your trouble of 85 minutes of seemingly random human drama? Big G blasting his way through every monster without so much as breaking a sweat. The final battle between Monster X and big G is constantly interrupted and when Kaiser Ghiddorah arrives on the scene and things get interesting its all over. The ending theme music for the farewell before the credits roll just kill anything that might have been going on in the climatic final battle. Its a down right shame.See it because as a fan you must. Yet as far as this fan is concerned it is by far the worst gflick ever made. The poor lighting hides the details of Big G and becomes annoying. Especially after being used to the fine work from GMK and Tokyo SOS it always tickled me to see Godzilla snarl or pull a WTF face when something happened...or even smirk like in GMK. From the overly dark scenes to the rip off scenes and plot devices from such films as Xmen Matrix ID4 and countless other films... Other disappointments include Gigan...such a cool new look... and a total waste...TWICE!!! Hedora I mean Kitamura shouldn't have even bothered putting him in... and yes people there is a deleted scene of Godzilla battling Hedora it was cut out in the interest of time...a monster movie with more human drama than monster drama... People who love this movie will also love G98... they can have it... Tokyo SOS is a better end to the legacy anyhow...Damn you Ryhei Kitamura.... damn you to hell... and before you even start...Kitamura is not a Godzilla fan he said so himself".

	schema:headline " A Return to Form for Godzilla A Depature For The Series";
	schema:reviewBody "For those who love to see Godzilla as the true unstoppable King of Monsters GFW is a true return to form. Godzilla has never seemed stronger or been portrayed as more of a force to be reckoned with. However it is this and only this that seems to find familiar ground with the rest of the series.GodzillaFinal Wars is a drastic and puzzling step in a different direction for the Godzilla franchise. While TOHO should be given credit for being willing to take their creation and franchise in a different direction they should also be more careful in the manner to which they do so.Godzilla Final Wars feels like many different movies in one and by this I do not mean any of the films to which it owes it's inspiration. At times the film feels like it is a pure action take on the King of Monsters. At other times it feels like it is an exercise in camp excess. But it is these two varying points that makes Godzilla Final Wars both hard to classify and hard to comprehend. The film suffers from not having a set mood or set atmosphere for the viewer to really settle into. The plot and atmosphere simply take too many turns too many times for the viewer to get comfortable with the film.I won't go into too many plot details as I don't want to ruin the film or any of it's points for those who have yet to see it. But briefly this film takes a cue from the Godzilla films of the Showa era and brings back the Xilians once again bent on world domination.GFW features a huge all star cast of kaiju. However the shear number of kaiju may be impressive their appearances are not always of the same result. Kaiju such as Hedorah King Seesar and yes Minilla are sorely out of place in this film or if nothing else sorely misused. While I applaud Ryuhei Kitamura for casting a kaiju all star cast I feel that fewer monsters would have sufficed had they been given more screen time and stayed a little truer to form.However some of the films kaiju make truly great returns most notably Rodan Angillas and most importantly..Gigan. These three monsters are my personal favorites in Godzilla Final Wars. Rodan looks better than ever and while the monsters screen time and fight time are limited it makes a fantastic impact during a scene in NYC. Angillas a long time favorite of so many GFAN's is given his respect in GFW. The monsters new design is fantastic and the kaiju maintains its beloved fighting spirit and comes complete with some new tricks to boot. However it is Gigan that steals the show. Gigan returns to the Godzilla franchise and in many respects does so in the wrong forum. This Gigan deserved a chance to face Godzilla in it's own movie. The new design is amazing sleek and deadly with new weapons and old weapons never before seen.Overall Godzilla Final Wars is an entertaining film but it is certainly not the best of the Millennium Series nor the best movie it could have been given the talent and resources at it's disposal. The film is an interesting take on the Godzilla franchise but note the farewell that the Big G deserves. If TOHO were smart they would allow Godzilla his time away from the screen and take some of their newly revamped kaiju and give them their chances at real screen time in some new adventures.".

The monsters new design is fantastic and the kaiju maintains its beloved fighting spirit and comes complete with some new tricks to boot. However it is Gigan that steals the show. Gigan returns to the Godzilla franchise and in many respects does so in the wrong forum. This Gigan deserved a chance to face Godzilla in it's own movie. The new design is amazing sleek and deadly with new weapons and old weapons never before seen.Overall Godzilla Final Wars is an entertaining film but it is certainly not the best of the Millennium Series nor the best movie it could have been given the talent and resources at it's disposal. The film is an interesting take on the Godzilla franchise but note the farewell that the Big G deserves. If TOHO were smart they would allow Godzilla his time away from the screen and take some of their newly revamped kaiju and give them their chances at real screen time in some new adventures.";

	schema:reviewBody "I remember growing up watching monster movies on the SciFi channel as I'm too young to have seen them in the Creature DoubleFeatures in the old days. I laughed at the rubber suits the model cities and the overused stock footage from previous Godzilla movies. When it moved from the Showa Era to the Millennium Era though and the costumes and stories actually got a bit more intricate I still mostly watched them just for a cheap laugh. This movie I have to say caught me a bit by surprise. I first saw it on Fear.net and actually went out to buy it it's the only time it's ever happened to me too so I guess that's saying something. There's no doubt there are definite pros and cons about the movie so let me just mention a few of them.One pro is that the movie actually looks like it had a budget. There were decent special and computer affects for the type of flick especially the parts showing the alien star fighters. There were computer generated scenes for the monsters too that made them a bit more believable such as Rodan flying over New York and Anguirus rolling over Shanghai but they didn't neglect the idea of guys crawling around on their hands and knees to imitate a quadruped. There's a con to this though as some diehard fans of the franchise might look at it as a bad representation of a series built solely on model airplanes and rubber monster suits. We all know how the 1998 Godzilla remake starring Matthew Broderick was received though I might be the only one who defends it anymore. Another con would be that the special affects might've made the writers feel they could write anything and make it a masterpiece such as the aliens declaring their home planet was unpronounceable to humans but we could call them Xiliens well then shouldn't they have called their planet Xilia if that was the case? Another pro for this movie is that there was a decent story and premise. The idea of mutanthuman hybrids actually standing up to Ebirah and winning shows that humanity really isn't as helpless as we seem. Reviving the classic Kaitei Gunkan submarine the Gotengo was also a good idea for the writers as it helps establish a link for this movie to the rest of Showa era Toho. The con though is that the story of aliens coming to Earth and unleashing monsters against us has been done a few times already. It was funny to watch how people were so open to the concept of welcoming aliens to Earth as though they've never been tricked or attacked by them before.Unfortunately there is another con to the story concept. Because of there being something other than giant monsters rampaging through Tokyo the actors must've thought they could just half ass it through most scenes. They showed more interest in shouting their lungs out and trying to force their skulls out of their skin as though they had taken acting lessons from JeanClaude Van Damme. To make up for this though the score composer included a decent soundtrack despite the only time March of the Monsters the Godzilla theme is heard is in the very beginning. The music has a touch of symphony laced into a mostly synthesized score that helps add to the computer animation showed from time to time and to give the giant monsters including Godzilla a feeling of unlocked power and rage. Don Frye Capt. Gordon had one of the few developed characters throughout the whole movie too. He also did one of the best jobs acting his sarcasm and indifference seeming almost straight out of a Douglas Adams book.Back to the actual story the movie itself is like putting bits of Independence Day and the Matrix in a blender and dripping the bits over a reel for Destroy All Monsters. Masahiro Matsuoka zaki looked enough like Keanu Reeves when he spontaneously unlocked his unlimited power ability as though he could do it the whole time and decided to do it then for no good reason that he could've posed as Reeves's stunt double for the Matrix I think something to do with the hair and cheek bones.Aside from all I've said I can't help give this movie such a high vote. Yes the cons seem to outweigh the pros in some cases but look at it this way  It's a Godzilla movie! What were you expecting? Sometimes when I watch this movie I get the feeling the cons were included purposefully just so I could laugh and heckle it just like all the other ones.The only real thing that bothered me about the movie was the ending but it wasn't really the fact that Godzilla walks off into the ocean like he usually does. It had to do with the fact that there was that symbolism of the younger generation teaching the older generation to forgive grave mistakes. Every time I watch that and see the kid standing in front of his grandfather who by the way is aiming at something that stands about two hundred times taller than the kid to keep the guy from shooting Godzilla. I guess it isn't too bad since it influenced Milla to do the same against Godzilla though his angle was a bit more affective against beings twenty times smaller. The one thing that got me though was the last line of the movie about how it wasn't an ending but just a new beginning.I'll be waiting for the next installment which will probably be due in about twenty years.".

However the film is reasonably entertaining even when the world isn't being trashed by the monsters so all is far from lost.The subtitling is also pretty good with only a few dubious translations here and there.I can't say I was pleased to see Minilla though. Not having seen all the Godzilla movies and not the ones that explain his presence for sure my only exposure to this minigodzilla was from the cartoon Godzilla series where it was called Godzuki. I never liked it there and here it is just too cute and annoying to be of much use. Less Minilla and more Godzilla would have been nice.Anyway I can't see any but the real diehard fans being disappointed by this. Them and the current generation of people that expect to see nothing but CGI in every film they watch. For them I suspect the best thing to do would be to give it a miss.

	schema:headline " My Favorite Godzilla Film";
	schema:reviewBody "After having trudged through a handful of Godzilla movies and only really finding enjoyment in one TOKYO S.O.S. I think I've finally found what is safe to say my favorite FINAL WARS. Based on the mixed critical and audiences reactions as compared to some of the other classics I might be totally offbase and my opinion is probably skewed as I've only seen five or six movies in the franchise at this point. Regardless this movie was more fun despite its flaws than any of the others I've seen. It was released on the 50th anniversary of the Godzilla franchise and as I understand it is touted as the last in the series. I assume this movie is just the same as any other with the word 'final' in the title and if there haven't been more released yet I'm sure we'll see more eventually not including the 2014 American reimagining. The film opens with a battle against Godzilla in Antarctica where the military manages to trap him beneath a layer of rubble and ice. For a while the world prospers as mankind has shifted its focus off of war and pollution. Everything's groovy until the world comes under attack from every major kaijuat once! Anguirus is in Shanghai! Rodan's in New York City! The monster from that horrible 1998 GODZILLA film starring Matthew Broderick is in Sydney Australia! But wait! A race of aliens from outer space I hate how the film always feels the need to refer to it as 'outer' spaceit sounds juvenile known as the Xiliens have arrived to save us and a new era of prosperity is upon us when they make quick work of the world's most dangerous monsters and offer to assist us in destroying a rogue planetoid on a collision course with Earth. It all sounds too perfect and the world welcomes the Xiliens with open arms but there is something more sinister going on behind the scenes and mankind's survivors might need to awaken the world's most dangerous foe to save us Godzilla.I'm not sure why reactions to FINAL WARS were so unimpressive. This movie fixed a lot of the problems I've had with the previous Godzilla movies I've watched. If I was going to complain about something I suppose the most glaring offense is that the movie runs on a longer than necessary. At two hours it overstays it's welcome by thirty minutes or so and my interest starts to struggle. It's never that the movie gets too boring though it isn't to say it doesn't try but it's just overwhelming. There is just so much going on and it rarely lets up from the action. FINAL WARS utilizes the common Godzilla movie trope of an extensive final battle dominating half the film's running time. Where the other films just hammer you over the head with men in rubber suits duking it out for an uncomfortable amount of time FINAL WARS is gracious enough to break it up a bit by ensuring that the humans in the film do more than stand aside helplessly watching the battle ensue. The humans in FINAL WARS aren't ready to settle with the sidelines they're ready to kick some alien butt. In the future society of the movie the humans have discovered a segment of their society with mutant capabilities and trained them in the art of battle calling it M Organization. And the Earth Defense Force has created a series of battleships to help fend off monster attacks. While Godzilla does battle with an army of giant monsters the humans led by Captain Douglas Gordon Don Frye the film's token white man and the mutant Shinichi Ozaki Masahiro Matsuoka bring the battle to Xiliens. As a result we get a healthy dose of martial arts and stunt wirework to add some extra action flavor.I found a lot to like in GODZILLA FINAL WARS and it'll be hard to rave about it all in the limited space I've got here but I'll try and sum it all up. I loved the inclusion of the original GOJIRA theme in the film's opening as the 50th anniversary film it's a nice throwback to where it all began. I love the stereotypes the film embraces. To be clear I'm not referring to stereotypes of the Japanese. I mean everyone else. In New York City we see a pimp complete with pink pimpmobile being harassed by a foulmouthed cop while a drunken homeless man laughs at them both before Rodan arrives an obliterates them all. It was like a scene out of an 80's film except FINAL WARS was released in 2004. We even get a slide whistle sound effect when the wind gusts from Rodan's wings knocks all their hats off. I loved that the crappy 1998 Godzilla now known as Zilla has an appearance as a fullyCG monster terrorizing Australia before the real Godzilla arrives and defeats him in less than thirty seconds. I really liked that the filmmakers used CG to enhance a lot of the monsters giving them a wider range of movement than a rubber suit would generally allow. And I love that the movie introduced me to a wide range of monsters I've never encountered before. For example King Caesarwhat the? No idea what he is but now I'm going to have to watch GODZILLA VS. MECHAGODZILLA to see more.GODZILLA FINAL WARS is far from perfect but I doubt I'll find a giant monster film that will be as fun as this. I never cared much to follow these movies and only started watching some of them to get some context before going to see the 2014 Gareth Edwards film and because my daughter fell in love with the monster after watching some battle clips on YouTube. After a string of disappointments with the exception of TOKYO S.O.S. I was excited to find a Godzilla movie that I wouldn't mind watching again or recommending to others.".

	onyx:emotionText "After having trudged through a handful of Godzilla movies and only really finding enjoyment in one TOKYO S.O.S. I think I've finally found what is safe to say my favorite FINAL WARS. Based on the mixed critical and audiences reactions as compared to some of the other classics I might be totally offbase and my opinion is probably skewed as I've only seen five or six movies in the franchise at this point. Regardless this movie was more fun despite its flaws than any of the others I've seen. It was released on the 50th anniversary of the Godzilla franchise and as I understand it is touted as the last in the series. I assume this movie is just the same as any other with the word 'final' in the title and if there haven't been more released yet I'm sure we'll see more eventually not including the 2014 American reimagining. The film opens with a battle against Godzilla in Antarctica where the military manages to trap him beneath a layer of rubble and ice. For a while the world prospers as mankind has shifted its focus off of war and pollution. Everything's groovy until the world comes under attack from every major kaijuat once! Anguirus is in Shanghai! Rodan's in New York City! The monster from that horrible 1998 GODZILLA film starring Matthew Broderick is in Sydney Australia! But wait! A race of aliens from outer space I hate how the film always feels the need to refer to it as 'outer' spaceit sounds juvenile known as the Xiliens have arrived to save us and a new era of prosperity is upon us when they make quick work of the world's most dangerous monsters and offer to assist us in destroying a rogue planetoid on a collision course with Earth. It all sounds too perfect and the world welcomes the Xiliens with open arms but there is something more sinister going on behind the scenes and mankind's survivors might need to awaken the world's most dangerous foe to save us Godzilla.I'm not sure why reactions to FINAL WARS were so unimpressive. This movie fixed a lot of the problems I've had with the previous Godzilla movies I've watched.

	schema:reviewBody "I've been a fan of the TOHO Godzilla franchise since childhood and that is now more than 30 years ago. Having seen all of the films made in the big G's first two decades 19541974 and most of the Godzilla films made since then I had somewhat a mixed reaction to Final Wars.Many people have criticized this film for being too much of a departure from the traditional format. I'm not sure if that is really valid. There have been many G films that represent departures from format in the past. The first one that comes to mind is Godzilla vs The Sea Monster. Made in the mid 60s when James Bond films were raking in the money it was heavy on human action featuring many 'spy story intrigue' type elements and featured little footage of Godzilla. Then there was the children's fantasy Godzilla's Revenge which was a huge departure from TOHO's usual format for this series. And then the early 1970s pollutionprotest film Godzilla vs the Smog Monster was way out there stylistically. Portions of that film almost seem like a stylized drug trip!So to say Godzilla Final Wars is a departure from the usual format is really not saying it was any better or worse than previous departures. Here is a quick recap of what worked for me in Final Wars versus what did not work as well for this viewerWhat I liked loved the BW clips from prior Toho monster movies at the beginning. Once the 'new' film got rolling I loved seeing so many monsters that had not appeared on film for many years. Some of the kaijus really never looked better. The Anguilas and King Seesar suits were coolerlooking than the originals. I liked how they brought Rodan back to his original look rather than the Pteranodanonsteroids he had become in the 1990s movies. I liked the mutant earth defenders kinda like Xmen and the idea that they were the offspring of aliens who had mated with humans. I liked the parallel that was drawn between the indoor humanalien fist fight and the outside earth monsterspace monster battle that was raging simultaneously. I liked the fact that there was an American character who was both a badass and a main hero. Most of the Toho Godzilla movies I have seen from the 1990s feature Americans only as either villains or as bozos who make idiotic triggerhappy decisions. It was nice to see an American get some respect in a modern TOHO film  even if he was drawn as a caricature.What I didn't like Minya or Manilla is always a bad idea in any film but was particularly out of place in this one. I didn't care for the rock instrumental score instead of a normal orchestral score. The rock score worked OK for the human fight scenes but it took away from a feeling of awe during the monster battles.Big monsters look impressively real when their movements are slow and ponderous. I thought a lot of the highspeed fight sequences didn't look right for creatures so large. Also the way the fights with Gigan were done using quasimartial arts moves made me feel like I was watching a bigbudget episode of Ultraman or Zone Fighter...rather than a thaetrical TOHO movie. Varan was almost entirely CGI which doesn't do much for me personally. Ghidrah did not look or sound as alive as he did back in...say...1964!So a mixed bag for me but still wellworth watching!".

He was designed to look more like a hero rather than a monster. My thing here is if your going to change godzilla into a rugged looking monster then at least do the same for his son. The second you will understand once you watch the movie but for purpose of not spoiling things i will not give detail to that one...Overall Godzilla Final Wars was a MASTERPIECE and if TOHO is deciding not forbid the production or seize the production of godzilla temporarly then i have one thing to say...GODZILLA FINAL WARS was able to finally define GODZILLA as the KING OF MONSTERS.".

	schema:headline " Very underrated film";
	schema:reviewBody "This film is nearly 20 years old but still rates as one of the best movies I've ever seen.Following the title sequence which sets the violent scene of car crime which forms the backdrop for this film Peter Werner opens the film with a fairly protracted scene featuring the central character 22yearold rookie cop Benjy in his home environment. This marks the start of some brilliant characterisation which underpins the whole film causing the viewer not to perceive that there is a villain of the piece. As an enviable friendship between Bengy and the police target suspected ringleader and businessman Ted Varrick Charlie Sheen develops the viewer yearns to be in ether's shoes as Ted welcomes Bengy to his world of the rich and aimless. This envy is part based on the complex hedonistic and idealistic relationships between all the characters that evolves but ultimately everything relies for its roots on Bengy and Teds crime sprees something that ultimately must end.The deterioration is palpable and when ultimately the reckoning comes it does so in series of twists that drive the two friends together something very much cunningly engineered by Ted himself. The end represents a self fulfilling prophesy that left me craving for more yet knowing there could be no sequel.The contrast between the pair is very much a focal point the only commonality being their devotion to their own goals  goals which for Bengy at least become very blurred as Ted gives him the Porsche and the lifestyle that form the focus of his own existence. The domestic opening scene is a stark contrast for the remote empty but undeniabley plush and palacial house that Ted visits rather than truly lives in with its stunning view from the hills over the city. The film is bolstered by some spectacular car chase sequences that are plausible in a way that modern sequences rarely are. They all involve Porsche 911's and if there is ever any incredulity it comes from these sequences only. Could an Oldsmobile ever keep pace with a works Porsche? How could an Iroc Z ever hope to keep up and if it did and crashed into the lightweight Porsche how on earth does it fail to leave a scratch?Romantic interest is enticingly present as Ted encourages the relationship between Bengy and his own sister Anne Lara Harris but it never manages to rival nor is intended to rival the strength of the bond between Ted and Bengy. Utterly brilliant for the most part I've now watched this film 8 times.Thoroughly recommended.".

It's no wonder since its director and writer Peter Werner and Dick Wolf are veterans of the medium. Ron Howard is listed as a producer.No Man's Land is worth a look because in spite of its flaws because it shows an interesting aspect of the complex relationship between a police undercover cop and the young man who is the master mind in the car stealing robberies plaguing the city. The interaction between these two opposites is well played by the two leading actors B. D. Sweeney and Charlie Sheen.Charlie Sheen gives a restrained performance here. In fact this actor tends to go for intensity without the proper guidance of a good director. As the slick Ted Varrick Mr. Sheen shows a subtle side that we don't see too often. B.D. Sweeney is also effective as the undercover man who falls for Ann who happens to be Ted's sister. Mr. Sweeney has that clean look about him that makes him perfectly suited for the good natured Bill the mechanic he pretends to be.Others faces in the film includes Lara Harris who plays Ann the woman in love with the man hunting her own brother. Randy Quaid is seen briefly as Lt. Bracey who is responsible for getting one of his men infiltrate the car stealing ring.No Man's Land has the ubiquitous car chases and visual effects of pictures of this genre. The cinematography of Hiro Narita shows us a lot of Los Angeles shopping malls and high priced stores where the car thieves love to steal the Porsches.".

I know that's a clich by now but it applies.You know the plot from the other reviews. Boyish undercover cop infiltrates a mechanic shop and befriends the owner whom he is assigned to tail. That's because he is a suspected car thief and murderer.Think Point Break here only 4 years earlier. A charismatic bad boy sucks a peer into his criminal world and the peer is actually in law enforcement.If you love 80s movies set amidst the glitz of 80s L.A. with fancy cars and classic obscure 80s dance tunes thrown in you will love this one.I couldn't help envying the adventure that the D.B. Sweeney character was having. Nothing exciting ever happens to me. He gets introduced to the world of the rich and aimless gets a brotherlike best friend who gives him money and lavish gifts and he falls in love with a beautiful rich girl.There were a couple of authenticity problems I have to mention. The Sweeney character was supposed to be a 22 year old rookie yet he was working undercover. Wouldn't that be a bit advanced for him? He was not a detective. But I guess they had to use him because of his mechanical acumen with Porsches.Also in order to get hired as a Porsche mechanic wouldn't he have to show that he passed certification classes? Having just worked on some old cars in his driveway would he really be skilled enough to work with professional foreign car mechanics without taking any courses?The Randy Quaid character was a little comicbookie or overthetop angry but I guess they had to establish the tension between him and the rookie.The final showdown will again remind you of Point Break. Enjoy it. This is definitely a guy's movie.".

This was a truly good movie with a fantastic storyline great acting and a lot of style. Charlie Sheen turns in a terrific understated performance which makes you sadly recall that at one time he was a gifted young actor with a promising future ahead of him and not an out of control bipolar freak of nature. This movie actually fell right in the middle of his golden period shortly after 'Platoon' and just before 'Wall Street' and 'Young Guns'. He was pretty clearly at the top of his game. The rest of the cast did wonderfully as well especially D.B. Sweeney who handled the lead role admirably and the incredibly beautiful and talented Lara Harris who deserves far more work in Hollywood than she's gotten. The only character who seemed out of place was Randy Quaid as the nononsense lieutenant but that's only because I've become so used to seeing him in goofball roles that it's now a bit jarring when he's serious.I definitely enjoyed this film and any fan of the policethriller genre will surely enjoy it as well as will fans of the time period in general. I'm glad I didn't pass this one over.".

	schema:headline " Sleek and stylish eighties action flick...before Fast and The Furious there was....THIS";
	schema:reviewBody "The eighties might be considered a fairly relaxed era for movies. So many classic films come out of the eighties and they are ripe with sex materialistic lust violence bad language and the ultimate in cool. No Man's Land despite a rather dull title is exactly what the eighties genre is all about. Sleek cars the Porsche fast women cool guys guns suits and basically chock full of testosterone. This film is exactly what Fast and The Furious or Gone In Sixty Seconds was years later. Although No Man's Land has a fairly stereotypical storyline the cop goes undercover to bust a car thieving ring and becomes entranced with the sweet lifestyle something makes this different. It might be the cast who all work really well together without really giving any truly outstanding performances it's a fast paced action film with an incredible car chase scene right at the climax and it's just a good time. It's not that will rake in the Oscars but at the same time you'll just feel pumped up watching it.Charlie Sheen...king of The Brat Pack some might say. He was at the top of his game going into No Man's Land following Platoon and shortly thereafter Wall Street and Young Guns and Major League. The guy was big in his day. In this film he plays bad guy smooth talking businessman Ted Varrick. Varrick is so cool that you barely notice his illegal activities. Sheen is slick and easy to watch and commands a screen presence for his young age. And he's actually playing a grown up which is always a good move for a young actor trying to break into adult roles. He is very good as Varrick. D.B. Sweeney plays undercover rookie cop Benjy Taylor. Now Sweeney has done a bit of character acting although he was fairly new out of the gate when he filmed this one but I didn't think he was quite as good as someone stronger could have been in the role but he does alright. He tries to come across as the bad boy and never quite gets there. He's too soft but still he's likable and you can relate to him as the hero who gets too deep in with Varrick. Sheen and Sweeney do share some decent chemistry on screen together which makes for some truly likable scenes and a killer ending. Lara Harris is Sweeney's love interest and Varrick's younger sister. She does a decent job although a little quiet for her role and her and Sheen seem to have too much sexual chemistry to be brother and sister which comes across as creepy at times but she also has decent chemistry with Sweeney although again he's not much of a bad boy like they try to portray him. Randy Quaid plays a small role as Sweeney's boss who sends him undercover. Quaid plays a tough as nails Lieutenant who seems to only yell and scream most of the time which is unfortunate because Quaid could have added a lot to the cast.As I mentioned before one of the absolute highlights of the film is the car chase scenes one in particular at the height of the film. Sweeney behind the wheel Sheen in the car with him and rival mobsters on their heels but there is plenty of action surrounding that chase. Gun fights violent beatings and an intriguing underworld look at the parties the women the drugs and the stealing of the cars. I can't believe this film doesn't get more credit for being a classic eighties film because it truly is very entertaining and I only happened to come across it in my local video store and I thought it looked a little like a buddy cop film so I went for it and at times it does have that feel despite being on the other side of the law. Sheen and Sweeney hold their own and hold your attention and a decent story to go along with it. Moonlighting director Peter Werner establishes a deep friendship between them making the climax all the more thrilling. This one is a sure fire eighties hit!! 810".

In fact I have NEVER seen this movie broadcast on television  I had to rent this over the Internet to see it.Before seeing it I thought that maybe since the movie was rated R that's why I had never seen it on television. But to my surprise the R rating for this movie seems a bit harsh. There's no nudity no onscreen sex there are only a few utterances of the harshest swear words which could easily be overdubbed and the limited violence on display could easily be shown on a television drama. The movie feels more like a PG13.The above is a big clue as to why I felt this movie didn't work. It's lacking grit  it feels bland and without passion. At times it feels like it was made for television. It's not only with the direction but with the performances as well  none of the actors here seem to be very enthusiastic and the only thing colorful about them is Randy Quaid's weird hairstyle.One positive thing I can say about the movie is that unlike other '80s movies this one hasn't dated that much. But that is not enough to save the movie.P.S.  MGM's DVD of the movie is pretty bad. Not only is the movie presented fullframe and using what seems to be an older print not made especially for this DVD the colors frequently seem off somewhat.".

It's not only with the direction but with the performances as well  none of the actors here seem to be very enthusiastic and the only thing colorful about them is Randy Quaid's weird hairstyle.One positive thing I can say about the movie is that unlike other '80s movies this one hasn't dated that much. But that is not enough to save the movie.P.S.  MGM's DVD of the movie is pretty bad. Not only is the movie presented fullframe and using what seems to be an older print not made especially for this DVD the colors frequently seem off somewhat.";

But whereas before he was a cop here he plays one the primary villain a wealthy Porsche thief who proves to go too far to protect his interests. A young D.B. Sweeny is Billy Isle a rookie cop hired by a Lieutenant Randy Quaid to work undercover at a suspected chop shop that deals exclusively in Porsches. His assignement is to track Ted Varrick Sheen the wealthy hot shot behind the business who the Lieutenant suspects is guilty of murdering a cop. However Billy after befirending Varrick and often forgetting he is a cop as he embraces the fast times of Porsche stealing and wealthy parties and carefree lifestyle Varrick introduces him to clouding his judgment of Varrick who he claims could not possibly be responsible for the cop's death let alone anyone else's. But Billy begans to realize Varrick places no limits on how far he's willing to go to protect himself when the undercover operation is jeopardized exposing highlevel police corruption. And after Varrick gets wind of it the body count starts mounting. Billy's trust of Varrick is tested when he becomes Varrick's next target. Billy's just got to wake up and get real when it comes to Ted.   It is a pretty good story though initially slow moving. That is until the Ted Varrick character enters the scene. D.B. Sweeny does a good job with the lead as the impressionable young cop and Sheen plays his usually monotonous toned hot shot. Often it is the lengthy bigaction car chase scenes that propels through the repetition. Good stuff highly recommended for 80s action fans.".

It's like a well stored vintage wine more tasty for having been locked away. Sheen as a Deanlike forerunner of his over the top real life and TV sitcom persona is excellent. Sweeney is like Duchovny brilliant in his understatedness. Even the listless sister adds to the increasing and uneasy chemistry that develops between the 3. I bought it.Needless to say the action is tight and gripping. I've cruised Mulholland in a Porsche and take out of town relatives there to sightsee so I may be biased heheh... The HD transfer was luminous and filmlike perfection. A plus was the 80's soundtrack featuring a live appearance by The Untouchables an early Ska local band! What more can I say? Yes the movie does has Law and Order written all over itbut ah what a episode! If you enjoy the slower paced movies of the golden era this one won't disappoint.".

Operating out of an auto repair shop a front Sweeney's character is also an ace mechanic. Fancy that? No that's why he was chosen but also being a rookie he as his hardarse cop boss Quaid says doesn't act like a cop but act is something Sweeney does well. It's a pity we didn't see more of him in stuff as only a score of films he did spring to mind. He's befriended by cool dressing rich kidthief Ted Varrick Sheen who's hot Porsche breaks down on Mulholland and from here it's like another Point Break scenario this came out three and a half years earlier but who's counting. Sheen really impresses here with just the right measure of cool and suave cockiness. This actor despite his bad habits can really surprise you. He did with me after coming to view it again. He owns thw role and works it wonderfully. Of course there's rival competitor thieves that push the story forward where we seem to have a few bad apple cops around. Lara Harris as Sheen's sister who doesn't know of his illegal doings and who apparently can whip out killer crepes is just a utterly gorgeous picture of beauty. This is one of those real cool movie treats I like but it's not without it's faults and I feel that every time I see it. For instance revenge driven Sheen can apparently take out a rival competitor on a dance floor with strobing lights and no one notices not even the competitor's much younger date. They just keep dancing. Fault. But this is a movie you can forgive these kind of things. There's some good chases and a humbly tragic climax a shootout that is inevitable where at the end we aren't quite sure if Quaid's character was dirty. Ironically both him and Sheen did another car movie The Wraith exactly nine months earlier on release date here this of course a better movie. Too we learn a lot about our three characters Sheen I almost feel sorry for. Him and Sweeney it's a mutual friendship you don't want to end. For some reason a thinner George Dzundza appears unbilled as Sweeney's Uncle. Seriously though Sweeney needs to change professions regarding car stealing and stop hesitating for one here. Cool hip movie with well utilized locations one of course used so many times in night shots. One surprising attribute Sheen's top geared performance and a wonderful line including following dialogue lifestyles of the rich and aimless.".

	schema:headline " Passable 80s action drama.";
	schema:reviewBody "'Law and Order' creator Dick Wolf is the writer and coproducer of this reasonably entertaining movie that gets by thanks to good performances and well done action scenes. At its core is the relationship between a cop and his target as the former goes undercover in the latter's garage to try to obtain any sort of proof that his new buddy is responsible for the murder of a detective. The trouble Benjy Taylor D.B. Sweeney the cop realizes that he enjoys stealing cars and likes his target Ted Varrick Charlie Sheen just a little too much. What's more he finds himself falling for the friends' sister Lara Harris.The age of the protagonist 22 does add an interesting wrinkle into the plot not really that mature Benjy is young enough that he allows his focus to be blurred and has to be reminded by an angry supervisor Vincent Bracey Randy Quaid what his mission is supposed to be. Also what worked best for this viewer was the fact that Benjy and Ted become good enough friends that even faced with knowledge about the other they don't want to believe the worst.Wolf and director Peter Werner take their time telling this story but viewers should still take delight in the pulse pounding action scenes and the cars on display Ted and his crew are especially fond of Porsches. The two stars do fine work. Sweeney has the right amount of likability and naivety in his role and Sheen does nice understated work as a guy whom the audience themselves may like enough to have doubts as to Ted being a killer. Quaid delivers an intense performance as the hard driving Bracey. An excellent supporting cast helps matters a lot although the movie makes an awful waste of M.

	onyx:emotionText "'Law and Order' creator Dick Wolf is the writer and coproducer of this reasonably entertaining movie that gets by thanks to good performances and well done action scenes. At its core is the relationship between a cop and his target as the former goes undercover in the latter's garage to try to obtain any sort of proof that his new buddy is responsible for the murder of a detective. The trouble Benjy Taylor D.B. Sweeney the cop realizes that he enjoys stealing cars and likes his target Ted Varrick Charlie Sheen just a little too much. What's more he finds himself falling for the friends' sister Lara Harris.The age of the protagonist 22 does add an interesting wrinkle into the plot not really that mature Benjy is young enough that he allows his focus to be blurred and has to be reminded by an angry supervisor Vincent Bracey Randy Quaid what his mission is supposed to be. Also what worked best for this viewer was the fact that Benjy and Ted become good enough friends that even faced with knowledge about the other they don't want to believe the worst.Wolf and director Peter Werner take their time telling this story but viewers should still take delight in the pulse pounding action scenes and the cars on display Ted and his crew are especially fond of Porsches. The two stars do fine work. Sweeney has the right amount of likability and naivety in his role and Sheen does nice understated work as a guy whom the audience themselves may like enough to have doubts as to Ted being a killer. Quaid delivers an intense performance as the hard driving Bracey. An excellent supporting cast helps matters a lot although the movie makes an awful waste of M. Emmet Walsh who only turns up towards the end. Jenny Gago too barely appears despite her prominent billing. But Bill Duke is good as is Arlen Dean Snyder as a crooked detective and R.D. Call as a thuggish competitor. Other familiar faces that appear include Linda Shayne Claude Earl Jones Florence Schauffler Guy Boyd Henry G. Sanders and Gary Riley.

Both actors are fresh0faced though Sheen has the swagger to pull off the bored rich kid who steals cars act. Sweeney on the other hand is so babyfaced that he looks more like the starting high school quarterback than any police officer. What's peculiar about Sheen's side of the story is that Sweeney is almost welcomed into his family with open arms. In no time they're great friends going clothes shopping and Sheen practically gives his sister away to this grease monkey he didn't know three weeks ago. I dunno maybe I've seen too many copwhocagilyburrowsintotheenemy's camp but this just seemed deceptively easy.

They spend all their time examining about their whole lives thinking about what would be different if they had chosen a different life.In this case they are easily melancholic because of not satisfying with their lives wishing for companies to talk to or be with when they are alone but have no solution to find a way out.Therefore this is a story about repression desire morality cowardice the pain of waiting heart breaking pretending one's self being happy and tough and having the domination of power and money but actually most lonely and wanted being love. Besides all these complicated emotion there is still brightness of true love shown in this movie.This is certainly not a sweet story like the Notebook which hardly accepted when I was under the mood of losing my 6year lover and never have faith of eternal love and being loved. The bittersweet of Tokyo Tower resonates the experiences of those hard time in love relationship. If a girl is old enough to experience a long term completely dedicating true love and then find out she was being fooled or the love is finally gone or spoiled. Then she shall be a good viewer of this movie because she can definitely understand the dynamic power or conflict emotion of the characters in the movie.We find out the unstable essential of love in this movie. We are not naive anymore to believe that love should be eternal. We find out ways to solve these love problems too. In marriages even if both husbands and wives are not happy about their relationships they can still endure it and pretend that there are nothing wrong. Or one can be brave enough to let go and make some great changes to one's life.I am not yet 35 but only 25. I can still feel so many kinds of different emotions in this movie while stepping in different characters's shoes both men and women mother or child.By the way if you know better about Japanese culture you will get closer to the situation happened in this movie. Firstly many people blame Matsumoto's acting in this film but the hilarious acting is from the original novel which the couple of Matsumoto is a contrast between the couple of the main characters. Therefore it was the dramatical reason for him to act like this a hilarious character.Secondly women in Japan don't have high social status and they are often dominate by their husbands and seniors. And a good woman should be shy and pure just like the little girl in the movie who always wears her clothes quickly after making love. It is conceivable that they can finally get their feeling of domination of love when they are with younger boys. It would be a release for their long term repression of passion under social rules.".

	schema:reviewBody "First off let me say that I'm an Okada Junichi fan. That being said this movie was average if not below average. The plot has no commendable twist or turn the motif old and not creative at all and there's not much to learn from this movie that makes you go Ahhh. Like other reviews on this board I have to agree What is this movie trying to say?. For me the theme of loneliness of a 35 year old woman was way better portrayed through the character of Kimiko and her relationship with Koji. I have no idea how the main couple could carry the 35yearold lonely woman theme. The interaction between her and her husband plus her loneliness is just not seen nearly enough! One would think Toru and Shifumi love each other because they both are very goodlooking! Um so this movie is not that good in my opinion. However every one completed their part very well. Kuroki Hitomisan was very beautiful and classy Okada Junichi is expressive with his eyes and voice as usual but my favorite will have to be Terajima Shinobusan who plays Kimiko. Not only does her character has depth but her acting was good on its own. Through her and her only I see the possible loneliness of a woman who's trapped in a boring life with a husband she doesn't love or has grown out of love for him and who yearns for something more than just the everyday life cooking in the kitchen and doing housework from dawn to dusk.".

	schema:reviewBody "I have only caught up with two of Sayles' directorial works Limbo and Passion Fish. Though the subjects of the two films are quite dissimilar Sayles penchant for building interesting character profiles is unmistakable in both. Both films have an interesting screenplay developing anecdotes that seem to be strung together like beads on a necklace. In Passion Fish a somewhat successful actress watches TV soaps and makes comments. Zoom out of the situation and you realize that situation itself is close to a TV soap opera. Now directors like Robert Altman and Paul Mazursky have done similar themes with considerable success. European cinema Claude Sautet for one has numerous examples of what Sayles did in the US a decade before in Europe. Yet Sayles like Mazursky An Unmarried WomanHarry and Tonto etc. is able to instill humor and pathos into his celluloid essays with considerable felicity.What makes Passion Fish tick? At a very obvious level there is a remarkable performance by Mary MacDonnell. You need to be a stage actress to have done justice to the demanding role of a paraplegicperhaps Billie Whitelaw or Anne Bancroft or Joanne Woodward would have fared as well as Mary. Much of Mary's acting is limited to voice modulation and restricted body movements.Two other performers stand out Alfre Woodard and David Strathairn. I have watched Strathairn perform in other movies but he is just superb when working for Sayles.Passion Fish like Limbo has a strong musical selection. Sayles like Michael Mann and Peter Weir has a good ear for music and sound editing. Yet Limbo outclasses Passion Fish by a mile in this department thanks mainly to the song sung by lead actress herself.  Finally the film Passion Fish survives on a strong screenplay and above average direction. The screenplay is loaded with social comments expressed in a documentary style comments on a business manager who never appears race relationships religion she took to it after the second child.. etc. The film expects us to follow the obvious childhood sweetheartsmeetagain route but interestingly does not.This is the stamp of Saylesa filmmaker who makes a sudden twist towards the end that makes all what preceded look better than it did. He did this in Limbo with aplomb but Passion fish seems to anticipate the more accomplished storytelling of Limbothe dark swamp metaphor of Passion Fish seems to be heralding the cloudy sky of Limbo. One thing is certainSayles is an important screenplay writer comparable to David Mamet and Terrence Malick. As a director one could argue that his work is not new in style Limbo harks back to The Oxbow Incident yet he cannot be dismissedhis work stands out amongst contemporary American movies especially independent cinema.".

Where MayAlice relapses into a daze of misery and alcoholinduced mist of selfcenteredness Chantelle struggles alone towards her selfrehabilitation  two unlikely individuals who are connected at a very obvious level by the conflict of their motivations for existence but at a deeper plane related not by conflict but by identification of a shared identity.Named after a Cajun superstition about finding love the movie opens with a closeup of MayAlice's eyes as she lays on a hospital bed victim of a freak accident and now very meantempered inheritor of a crippled body. Her soap acting rendered futile and raging at the seeming dithering uselessness of all hospice personnel in uniform nurses physical therapists doctors psychiatrists MayAlice moves back to the family home by a Louisiana bayou in a clear attempt at drinking herself into oblivion. Bound to a wheelchair and perennially in front of the television with a wine bottle as an unshakeable appendage she has an attendant nurse in the form of a feisty black nurse Chantelle  who takes up this work for far more substantial reasons than what initially appear.MayAlice's curmudgeonly selfindulgence in wine and TV collide with the blunt denials and admonitions of Chantelle with decidedly unnursey approaches. This conflict of wills between two strong and set women lies at the heart of this film a conflict which does not get manifested in typical conventionally hoarse and piquant scenes. What interested me immensely are the numerous tiny battles which emerge in the course of this war of wills  a tug here a pull there followed by a push. Several times in the movie I expected the dam of unresolved and unsatisfied emotions to burst into a torrent of screams and the inevitable firing of the nurse. It never came.Passion Fish intensely resists the easy transition of such a story into a likely tale of maudlin sentimentalism and spiritual upliftment. When I think of it the movie is less of a motif for human tragedy or that of people who have suffered mentally or physically coming out of the ordeal as veritable angels. Then there is the Louisiana landscape and the comic portraits of an assortment of AliceMay's visitors and a repressed but tender romance which materializes with an old acquaintance. To the back of the house there are verdant and soothing wetlands teeming with herons alligators and snakes while towards the front the track which leads to it is dusty and decidedly unphotogenic with what I can only presume to be factories pumping affluents into this seemingly serene lake. This twotinged sepia is present everywhere in the movie. This manylayered portrayal of a story of two women is marked by engaging performances allround and a screenplay which does not veer into the realm of the tearjerker. One more thing I love the I didn't ask for the anal probe monologue for its intensity and the sheer range of emotions it seeks to explore  from thrill to determination to anticipation to frustration to dismay and finally resignation.".

As brilliant a filmmaker as he remains every one of his films has its own shortcomings that leave it in the nearperfect category. In a way it feels as though he purposely leaves something unnecessary in each time out. For this reason among others Sayles' films are an acquired taste. His 1992 film Passion Fish struts along at a very selfassured yet slow paced gait much like the population of its Southern Gothic location.The main focus of the film is put on two women one who returns to the place she left to dwell upon her current challenges and another who comes there for refuge from her troubles elsewhere. The women's paths intersect at a precarious point in their lives leading to some very interesting results. Mary McDonnell stars as MayAlice a feisty soap actress forced into early retirement by a car accident. It's a challenging role and she brings a certain bravado that hasn't been shown by her previously. Alfre Woodard gives a highly nuanced performance as the nurse who has been hired to help the reluctant MayAlice.Like in many of Sayles' films given his immense prowess as a writer the true pleasure comes not from watching the main storyline but the local and supporting flavor chewing up scenery throughout. One such gem involves an outdoor luncheon with McDonnell's character attempting to keep her composure and a tactful face with two Southern Belle types she hates. It's moments like this that add texture to Sayles' films but also tend to keep them loosely edited and occasionally overwrought.".

Overall it is a beautifully written and well crafted film. John Sayles does an amazing job directing writing and editing. He extracts memorable performances from Mary McDonnell and Alfre Woodard and never once shows an unnecessary scene or line. Look out for a supporting role from David Straithairn and the subtle yet poignant cinematography that drives the film to its end. The Louisiana Bayous never looked so good!".

My friend and I constantly informed a friend of ours of the horror of this movie to the point that he needed to see it just to understand how bad it was. Over the holiday season this year I watched it with him because he didn't want to watch it alone. This was my next horrible mistake because as I watched I just became angry. I began to yell at the movie and I'm not one to talk to movies period. Everyone I know that has even glimpsed this movie has agreed its the worst they've ever seen. My sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends but that could not save this movie even. The fact that this movie is not on the bottom 100 list on IMDb is astounding.

	schema:headline " Please please please please do not see this movie!";
	schema:reviewBody "And I repeat please do not see this movie! This is more than a review. This is a warning. This sets the record for the worst most effortless comedy ever made. At least with most of the recent comedies nowadays the gags are crude and flat but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny. I never get tired of repeating one of my favorite mottos Everyone thinks they can do comedy and only 10 percent of them are right. Comedy is hard! This is not some genre any fool can play around with. I think it's atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to Kentucky Fried Movie. Basically these bozos are comparing their socalled comic talents to those of the brilliant Jim Abrahams and the Zucker Brothers. Come on I've seen Pauly Shore movies that are 10 times funnier than The Underground Comedy Movie. Here's a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie One sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named Dkman. The whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen. That's it. That's the whole joke. Wow. This is enough to make Carrot Top roll his eyes. Another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie. And in another sketch there's a bag lady beauty contest in which we're exposed to the horrible sights of bikiniclad middleaged women with beer guts and stretch marks. Plus making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny. It's a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped. The whole movie is supposed to be a satire. I think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire...is TRUTH!!! For anybody who actually enjoyed this crap explain to me what is truthful about ANY of these gags! Some of the sketches might've sounded funny on paper but anybody who's taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper it probably won't be funny on screen. If I tell someone about a big black muscular gay virgin who's saving himself for the right man he or she would probably laugh. But watching the premise played out on screen for about 10 minutes is a complete drag. I hate how whenever people criticize a lowbrow comedy like this for not being funny they're regarded as stuckup squares. I just saw White Chicks recently. That's another lowbrow politically incorrect comedy but I laughed my head off. The most offensive thing about The Underground Comedy Movie is it's not funny! What the writers and directors don't understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless doesn't work. There has to be more! Just think of the famous scene from There's Something About Mary ironically enough the bozo filmmakers put the Farrellys on their special thanks list. The joke about the semen wasn't just funny because it involved bodily fluids. There was a buildup. Ben Stiller was masturbating in the bathroom to make sure he didn't go out on a date with a loaded gun. Then he looked around to see where all the semen went after it was released. A knock is on the door and he has to answer it. His date Mary is at the door and that's when it's revealed that the semen is hanging off Ben's ear. In this movie there are multiple gags involving characters squirting loads of semen at people with no buildup whatsoever. As Jay Leno always says This comedy thing's not so easy is it? Keep that in mind Vince Offer 'cause you weren't cut out for this genre!! The only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip. Let's face it nowadays it's hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect. I know comedy is subjective...but this movie shouldn't be funny to anybody except maybe the filmmakers themselves. As a side note the movie had to have been made before Michael Clarke Duncan's fame in movies like Armageddon and The Green Mile. There can't be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show. All the others in the cast are either nonactors hasbeen actors or Bmovie stars. Karen Black made a good impression in Five Easy Pieces but I don't think she's done anything of value ever since. Slash was probably drugged into being in this film. Gina Lee Nolin is nothing without Baywatch. Angelyne is the film's biggest star keeping in mind Duncan wasn't famous at the time and there are still probably a ton of people who haven't heard of herfor good reason. Usually I'm in support of extremely lowbudget flicks but this one deserves to drift into obscurity. I hope to Lord this doesn't become a cult classic! Shouldn't there be a law against distributing crap like this?".

	onyx:emotionText "And I repeat please do not see this movie! This is more than a review. This is a warning. This sets the record for the worst most effortless comedy ever made. At least with most of the recent comedies nowadays the gags are crude and flat but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny. I never get tired of repeating one of my favorite mottos Everyone thinks they can do comedy and only 10 percent of them are right. Comedy is hard! This is not some genre any fool can play around with. I think it's atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to Kentucky Fried Movie. Basically these bozos are comparing their socalled comic talents to those of the brilliant Jim Abrahams and the Zucker Brothers. Come on I've seen Pauly Shore movies that are 10 times funnier than The Underground Comedy Movie. Here's a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie One sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named Dkman. The whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen. That's it. That's the whole joke. Wow. This is enough to make Carrot Top roll his eyes. Another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie. And in another sketch there's a bag lady beauty contest in which we're exposed to the horrible sights of bikiniclad middleaged women with beer guts and stretch marks. Plus making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny. It's a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped. The whole movie is supposed to be a satire. I think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire...is TRUTH!!! For anybody who actually enjoyed this crap explain to me what is truthful about ANY of these gags! Some of the sketches might've sounded funny on paper but anybody who's taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper it probably won't be funny on screen. If I tell someone about a big black muscular gay virgin who's saving himself for the right man he or she would probably laugh. But watching the premise played out on screen for about 10 minutes is a complete drag. I hate how whenever people criticize a lowbrow comedy like this for not being funny they're regarded as stuckup squares. I just saw White Chicks recently.

This movie is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen .It has no redeemable qualities .I just sat through this movie and it was a struggle.It failed to get even a single smile on my face.I find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film. I felt that this movie was a failed attempt at distasteful humor. The only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack I'm pretty sure thats the reason I wanted to see this movie in the first place.I will wrap this up as I am going to try and forget the time I just wasted with this piece of crap. I will leave you with this warning. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM IT SUCKS.";

	schema:reviewBody "It's one thing when you're offensive to be funny but when you are offensive just to be offensive it's not funny and overly stupid. The Underground Comedy Movie has became a recent discussion seeing as it is soon to be rereleased in theaters with the same old scenes just some redone with Lindsay Lohan and Joanna Krupa. Doesn't that defeat the purpose of Underground? If Lohan and Krupa are in the film and they're both pretty well known actresses and underground refers to something lower budget and not as mainstream does having two big namers defeat the purpose of the name. Maybe it should be The Comedy Movie? Too generic? Vince Offer directed this aka The Shamwow Guy who will need a Shamwow to clean up this mess. This movie is just skit after skit of bad jokes lame music poor production values shaky camera movement things you'll never see that don't interest me or amuse me in anyway stock music and a load of other things. I laugh how in the beginning of the film they explain to you what satire is as if you've never seen a comedy before and this is your first time. I think the producers need to be explained what satire comedy and humor is because the title claims there is comedy but none hits the screen.I will say that the movie had me laughing a little at the intro with The Batman skit mainly The Rhymer stood out and the I Hate L.A. skit had it's moments. Though a small continuity error can be noted because of the amount of Orange Juice in the glass gets smaller before Vince takes a sip. I can also excuse the film's low production factor and just let that be what it is. But don't tell me you didn't have a stand or tripod to put the camera on. In the Virgin Hunter skit you can clearly see the camera shaking multiple times. It gets annoying. Every movie I've seen up until this one no matter how minuscule the budgetproduction values the camera doesn't tilt up and down and shake. A tripod goes a long way.This film is very reminiscent to a skit on SNL or the infamous MAD TV though much dirtier and lower class. I Hate L.A. could've been fit for MAD TV and Bobby Lee's skit as well. Though like I said before no skit stands out and all are forgettable thrown together clips. It seems like Offer had intentions of making a real movie but couldn't decide what he wanted to focus on. So he wrote down a bunch of ideas and figured that he could mash them up together and The Underground Comedy Movie was born.I have no intentions to see the 2010 recut especially when from the trailer it looks to be just another release of this with two bigger actresses who's roles would play a very minor role if that's the case. Maybe Vince ran out of Shamwows and Slap Chops and needed to rerelease it in theaters but whatever the case may be this can be said I wasn't offended by the movie just the 93 minute running time it took from my life.Starring Vince Offer Slash Gena Lee Nolin Karen Black Angelyne and Joey Buttafuoco.

	schema:reviewBody "Lon Chaney Jr lived under the shadow of his famous father but in 'The Wolf Man' he helped create a horror icon that has lasted for over sixty years. Chaney had already shown that he could act in 'Of Mice And Men'1939. In 'The Wolf Man' he gives another excellent performance but this movie was both a blessing and a curse to his career I think. It forever labeled him a horror actor and frankly he made a lot of lousy movies after this. Some good ones too don't get me wrong but too often he was given bgrade material to work with. Maybe his drinking problem had a lot to do with it I don't know but apart from a strong cameo in 'The Defiant Ones'1958 and a great performance in Jack Hill's cult classic 'Spider Baby'1964 he rarely was given a role as good as Larry Talbot in this movie. Chaney is surrounded by a very strong supporting cast including horror legends Claude Rains 'The Invisible Man' and Bela Lugosi sadly only a cameo Ralph Bellamy 'His Girl Friday' and frequent costar Evelyn Ankers she and Chaney made a great on screen couple but apparently hated each other off screen. Such is Hollywood!. Many people complain about the casting of Rains and Chaney as father and son. I agree it's totally unrealistic but I don't think it hurts the movie at all. The lack of Lugosi is a bigger problem. There was more footage of him but unfortunately it wasn't used in the final cut. It's too bad as more scenes between Lugosi and Chaney would have been a treat. Of course they worked together a few times after this but mostly in lesser movies. The real scene stealer in 'The Wolf Man' is Maria Ouspenskaya who plays the gypsy woman Maleva. She's just terrific and gives the most memorable performance after Chaney. 'The Wolf Man' has had an enormous influence on just about every subsequent werewolf movie. Much of the lore seen on screen here isn't in fact traditional as many people assume but created by the talented Curt Siodmak 'Donovan's Brain' who subsequently wrote the horror classics 'I Walked With A Zombie'1943 and 'The Beast With Five Fingers'1946. 'The Wolf Man' is an undisputed horror classic and just as entertaining and interesting as it ever was.".

	schema:reviewBody "Universal Studios had an impressive list of successes in the horror genre starting in 1931 with Tod Browning's Dracula. The myth of the werewolf was firstly adapted in 1935 in Werewolf of London but the movie failed to get the public's attention in the same way as the Dracula and Frankenstein series of movies. However the moon shined for the wolf in 1941 when a second attempt was done with a completely new story. The Wolf Man had a great reception and soon was considered among the finest of the Universal Studios' movies of that era and it is probably the last of the Classics as the horror movies of the 40s started to have lower budget and production values.The Wolf Man is a classic tragedy where a man becomes a beast that must kill every time the full moon shines on the sky. Lon Chaney Jr. is Larry Talbot who returns home to Wales after spending years in the U.S.. Not only he'll have to adapt to the life in countryside and improve his relationship with his father Claude Rains now he'll face the curse of the werewolf after been bitten by the gypsy Bela Bela Lugosi.I have always thought that the previous Werewolf of London was a vastly superior film in terms of acting direction and even makeup however the film's plot is not captivating and in the end not very attractive. On the other hand Curt Siodmack's script for The Wolf Man is a brilliant masterpiece of horror and fantasy. So perfect that it makes up for all the film's other flaws as it has an unnatural charm that is simply mesmerizing.Like a Greek tragedy the saga of Larry Talbot and his curse works in so many levels that is no surprise that it is the film that not only typecasted Chaney but also serve as basis for all the future werewolf films. Siodmack basically creates the Werewolf myths out of thin air and gives them form with masterful care. Who can forget Maleva's Maria Ouspenskaya words? The Wolf Man rhyme is now one of the most famous quotes in film history.Claude Rains is superb as Sir John Talbot and gives the role the dignity that requires. Probably Lon Chaney Jr. had a limited range as an actor but he was the perfect Larry Talbot with his sad looks and overall tragic appearance. Against all odds Chaney embodied the wolf man and made the part almost mythical. The rest of the cast was definitely not as convincing as those great actors however Maria Ouspenskaya and Bela Lugosi are terrific as the gypsies who will play an important part in Talbot's future.Jack Pierce's makeup is definitely the other star in this movie. The legendary monster maker created a piece that is now considered legendary. The wolf man's makeup is more beastlike and primal than the subtle one that Henry Hull used in Werewolf of London but that is because both werewolves are very different between them. While Hull's character was the darkest side of his persona Chaney's wolf man is a beast that posses his body and Jack Pierce captured that essence with the limited technology of his time creating an immortal masterpiece in makeup history.The Wolf Man may not be a perfect film but the captivating storyline and the mystique surrounding it definitely have earned this movie a huge reputation as one of the best of the Universal Studios films of the 30s40s era. While there may be better werewolf movies out there this one will always be remembered as THE definitive werewolf classic. 810".

	schema:reviewBody "As werewolf movies go The Wolf Man is probably the best. It was written by Curt Siodmak and directed by George Waggner. The script though it gets the job done has altogether too many wolf and dog references in it for comfort many in the first fifteen minutes. A horror movie should never at the outset tell you that it is a horror movie. The title and and cast often give this away anyway I grant not to mention lobby cards and reviews. But the idea is or should be to draw the viewer in slowly enabling him to acclimatize himself to the people and atmosphere so that the horror can as it were creep up on him. For all its excellent qualities The Wolf Man does not do this. Otherwise it works fairly nicely.A thoroughly Americanized Larry Talbot arrives at the estate of his British father Sir John A baronet? I wish they'd made this clear. Aside from the fact that he is three times larger than his father and altogether different in temperament shy and fumbling as opposed to assertive and incisive the two hit it off well enough. Larry has returned from the States due to the death of his brother and Sir John clearly wants Larry to take his place whatever it is in the village. Larry spies on a young woman through a telescope Sir John is an astronomer and goes to her shop where he buys a cane with a wolf's head and asks her for a date. She agrees but when they meet later on she brings a friend just in case Larry gets too well wolfish. It is autumn and the gypsies are in town. Larry his girl and her friend go to a fortune teller to get their palms read. The palmreader sees death in the friend's hand and urges her to go. Later on in the form of a wolf he attacks and kills the girl and is in turn killed by Larry with his cane but Larry is bitten by the wolf which guarantees that he will become one too. In time Larry does indeed become a werewolf but as with everything else in his life only goes halfway. While the animal that attacked him was a wolf Larry becomes only partly wolf in appearance though when the transformation occurs he is wholly wolf in spirit yet walks on two human albeit furry legs. He is more or less adopted by the dead Gypsy fortune teller's mother who looks after him and has a way of turning up in her wagon at appropriate moments. She also recites a poem about werewolfery or lycanthropy if you will which I shall not repeat here and which everyone in the village seems to know by heart. Sir John being a man of science does not believe that his son is a true werewolf but suffering from some form of mental illness. Yet when the moon rises Larry turns into a werewolf and goes on rampages.The Wolf Man is quite well made on what appears to be for its studio a generous budget fog swirls everywhere and the landscape is dominated by gnarled leafless trees. It's tone is evocative of the Sherlock Holmes films though not of course the content. There are so many good and bad things in the picture they're difficult to enumerate and are often jumbled together. Of the bad the casting of Americans Evelyn Ankers and Ralph Bellamy as Brits. Neither give a bad performance but they don't belong in this film. It's difficult enough to keep one's disbelief in suspension with Lon Chaney on hand but the addition of these two is a bit too much. Claude Rains as Sir John is a great asset to the movie giving it a touch class and gravitas. His occasionally supercilious manner is in keeping in with the part he plays and though he doesn't look at all like Chaney's father he acts it. Maria Ouspenskaya and Bela Lugosi make marvelous gypsies and they play their parts sincerely with none of the hamming one might expect. Chaney's Larry Talbot became after his Lennie in Of Mice and Men his most famous role. He is sincere if somewhat phlegmatic in his 'normal' scenes and early on before the wolfbite lacks the joi de vivre he ought to have as he is supposed to be a carefree young man. Chaney never seemed carefree. On the other hand his tragic deeply lined face sad eyes and prematurely middleaged appearance suggests a troubled soulnot an easy thing to fakeand in this regard he is magnificent in the part. His worry over the prospect of another werewolf transformation and the damage it will cause appears genuine and to a degree seems to come at times from outside the character he is playing which as we know Chaney had serious personal problems is a case of art imitating life and the result is a kind of sad serendipity.".

	schema:reviewBody "Out of Universal Pictures comes The Wolf Man directed by George Waggner and written by Curt Siodmak. It stars Lon Chaney Jr Claude Rains Warren William Ralph Bellamy Bela Lugosi Patric Knowles Maria Ouspenskaya  Evelyn Ankers.Even a man who is pure in heartand says his prayers by nightmay become a wolf when the wolfbane bloomsand the autumn moon is brightLarry Talbot Chaney returns to his ancestral home in Britain after learning of the death of his brother. Looking to solidify his relationship with his father Sir John Rains Larry also starts to fall for local antique shop girl Gwen Conliffe Ankers. While purchasing a silver wolf headed walking stick from her he hears of the werewolf legend about how a man turns into a wolf at certain times of the year. Later that night Larry takes Gwen and her friend Jenny Fay Helm to a gypsy fte out in the countryside from where Jenny then gets separated from the other two and is attacked by a wolf. Hearing her cries Larry comes to her aid and kills the animal but during the mle he was bitten and soon he finds that the legend of the werewolf is not merely hearsay.In 1935 Universal Pictures were still on a crest of a wave with their forays into horror. However their release of Werewolf Of London was met with poor box office returns and critical indifference. Rightly seen as a fine film now it was back then deemed too similar to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde 1931 Paramount Pictures and some way away from the tone of Frankenstein Dracula  The Mummy. It seemed that there was no cinematic life in some poor lycanthrope. Forward 6 years then and springing from the brain of Curt Siodmak Wolf Man has no direct literary source a legacy was about to be born.The Wolf Man the character in the pantheon of Univeral Monsters is as iconic as his stable mates who blazed the trail 10 years previously. The film itself is a classic of sorts but a long way from being a truly great movie. Good? Yes of course. Just not as awe inspiring as the legacy would have us believe. Waggner's movie is shot on a B movie budget with himself only being a modest studio director lets be honest here he wasn't for example fit to shine the boots of Messrs Whale  Browning. His direction is competent here but devoid of any visual flourishes or boldness of vision. There's also many flaws to be found on revisits not just the continuity errors that scream out that a rush edit happened but also in instances within the story. Notably we are first asked to believe that the small in stature Claude Rains has sired the oak like Lon Chaney then the big question of how come when Lugosi's wolf attacks Jenny it is actually a wolf but Chaney's is actually a wolfman? Yes indeed.But The Wolf Man is adored by many in spite of its flaws. And not just by people like me who after viewing the film as a child was too scared to look out into the garden at nighttime for fear of some hirsute beastie coming to get me! As noted the budget was B level but there's nothing B level about the cast here. Rains Bellamy  Ouspenskaya were class acts. Lugosi  respect and Chaney with his slick transformation from amiable gent to tortured soul put a marker down in horror cinema that is still remembered fondly today. The sets too belie the budget where the Universal crew come up with a Gothic cobblestoned village bordered by a moonlit and misty forest where the gloom is only punctured by the glow of shotgun bearing villagers flaming torches. Now that's classic Universal alright atmosphere goes a long way and The Wolf Man has it in spades. Credit too has to go to Siodmak two fold in fact. Most tellingly on why we forgive Wolf Man its problems is that the story is such a good one so good in fact that most of it has been believed to be based on archetypal legend. Then there's the fact that our protagonist here is an average Joe not an ignorant scientist or a cursed creature with dodgy family ties an affable guy who whilst committing an act of bravery is doomed for his trouble. It's a nice veer from the norm of Universal Monsters.Also impressive is the makeup by Jack Pierce and the lap dissolve effects by John P. Fulton. Dated now for sure but the artistry shown by these guys back then is nothing short of amazing. Another point of reference to Chaney's eagerness to deliver was that he went all in for Pierce to work his magic. Henry Hull in Werewolf Of London six years earlier refused to succumb to the full makeup treatment. Chaney did and immortality was secured as he turned into a horror star overnight. The Wolf Man was a big hit with audiences so much so that the character would appear in 4 further movies as part of a creature feature ensembles House Of Frankenstein et al with Chaney playing himit every time. Odd that such an iconic monster never actually had his own sequel really! Just one of the many strange and interesting things attached to this flawed but truly enjoyable movie. 810".

Hearing her cries Larry comes to her aid and kills the animal but during the mle he was bitten and soon he finds that the legend of the werewolf is not merely hearsay.In 1935 Universal Pictures were still on a crest of a wave with their forays into horror. However their release of Werewolf Of London was met with poor box office returns and critical indifference. Rightly seen as a fine film now it was back then deemed too similar to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde 1931 Paramount Pictures and some way away from the tone of Frankenstein Dracula  The Mummy. It seemed that there was no cinematic life in some poor lycanthrope. Forward 6 years then and springing from the brain of Curt Siodmak Wolf Man has no direct literary source a legacy was about to be born.The Wolf Man the character in the pantheon of Univeral Monsters is as iconic as his stable mates who blazed the trail 10 years previously. The film itself is a classic of sorts but a long way from being a truly great movie. Good? Yes of course. Just not as awe inspiring as the legacy would have us believe. Waggner's movie is shot on a B movie budget with himself only being a modest studio director lets be honest here he wasn't for example fit to shine the boots of Messrs Whale  Browning. His direction is competent here but devoid of any visual flourishes or boldness of vision. There's also many flaws to be found on revisits not just the continuity errors that scream out that a rush edit happened but also in instances within the story. Notably we are first asked to believe that the small in stature Claude Rains has sired the oak like Lon Chaney then the big question of how come when Lugosi's wolf attacks Jenny it is actually a wolf but Chaney's is actually a wolfman? Yes indeed.But The Wolf Man is adored by many in spite of its flaws. And not just by people like me who after viewing the film as a child was too scared to look out into the garden at nighttime for fear of some hirsute beastie coming to get me! As noted the budget was B level but there's nothing B level about the cast here. Rains Bellamy  Ouspenskaya were class acts. Lugosi  respect and Chaney with his slick transformation from amiable gent to tortured soul put a marker down in horror cinema that is still remembered fondly today. The sets too belie the budget where the Universal crew come up with a Gothic cobblestoned village bordered by a moonlit and misty forest where the gloom is only punctured by the glow of shotgun bearing villagers flaming torches. Now that's classic Universal alright atmosphere goes a long way and The Wolf Man has it in spades. Credit too has to go to Siodmak two fold in fact. Most tellingly on why we forgive Wolf Man its problems is that the story is such a good one so good in fact that most of it has been believed to be based on archetypal legend. Then there's the fact that our protagonist here is an average Joe not an ignorant scientist or a cursed creature with dodgy family ties an affable guy who whilst committing an act of bravery is doomed for his trouble. It's a nice veer from the norm of Universal Monsters.Also impressive is the makeup by Jack Pierce and the lap dissolve effects by John P. Fulton. Dated now for sure but the artistry shown by these guys back then is nothing short of amazing. Another point of reference to Chaney's eagerness to deliver was that he went all in for Pierce to work his magic. Henry Hull in Werewolf Of London six years earlier refused to succumb to the full makeup treatment. Chaney did and immortality was secured as he turned into a horror star overnight. The Wolf Man was a big hit with audiences so much so that the character would appear in 4 further movies as part of a creature feature ensembles House Of Frankenstein et al with Chaney playing himit every time. Odd that such an iconic monster never actually had his own sequel really! Just one of the many strange and interesting things attached to this flawed but truly enjoyable movie. 810";

Lon Chaney turns in an outstanding credible performance worthy of his father the legendary man of a thousand faces actually the entire cast is outstanding Claude Rains Maria Ouspenskaya and Bela Lugosi.The script by Curt Siodmak is marvellous borrowing from genuine werewolf folklore and adding its own. The plot device of having the werewolf see the pentagram on the palm of it's next victim is truly ingenious and I don't know why it was never utilised in any of the sequels or any other werewolf films for that matter.The score by Frank Skinner and Han J Salter is so haunting and has a nice rich romantic sound to it especially the cues used in the gypsy camp if only The Wolf Man weren't a b movie it probably would have won an Oscar.Lastly it must be said that Jack Pierce's make up and John P Faulton's werewolf transformations really go along way in making this film who could ever forget the image of the wolf man walking through the fog shrouded forest in search of fresh victims.".

It lays down the basic laws concerning werewolves gives you a history of lycanthropy and leaves the rest to your imagination. While the effects left a lot to be desired they are forgiven due to the incredible age of this classic masterpiece.Lon Chaney was the veritable epitome of lovable honorable sweet and intelligent Americanized man who is open and endearing lending these qualities to his character and making you love him even as he becomes this horrible monstrous killer.Through no fault of your own..This movie is more than a classic. It is an absolute masterpiece of drama horror legend and melancholy sweetness.

Good.Many people I know say that of the classic Universal monster movies that movies such as Bela Lugosi's Dracula the original Boris Karloff Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein are the best of the classic monster movies. I must politely say that they're missing out one of the best horror movies from the 1940s The Wolf Man.The story seems simple enough after being away in California for eighteen years Larry Talbot the great Lon Chaney Jr. returns home to learn to eventually take over the family estate currently handled by his father Sir John Claude Rains. While back in his hometown Larry falls for Gwen Conliffe Evelyn Ankers the daughter of a shop owner and engaged to a member of Talbot's estate Frank Andrews Patrick Knowles. After buying a silvertopped walking cane from Gwen in the shop Larry accompanies her and her friend Jenny Fay Helm to get their fortunes told by a band of visiting Gypsies.Unfortunately the fortune teller Bela Lugosi turns into a werewolf murders Jenny and attacks Larry when he comes to help. Larry is bitten by the wolf before he kills it only to have his wound heal the next morning and learn he's suspected of killing Bela with his cane by the police the next morning. While attending a festival the night after Bela's funeral Bela's mother Maleva Maria Ouspenskaya warns him he's been given the curse of the werewolf by her late son's bite and gives Larry a silver pentagram charm to keep from changing into the beast within him. Larry instead gives the charm to Gwen to keep her safe but when the moon rises Larry changes into the Wolf Man and starts murdering any who comes in his path. But when Gwen is his next target Larry must find a way to get away to keep from hurting those he loves  which may just cost him his life.Of the pros the cast works very well with their roles. While Lugosi Ouspenskaya Ankers and Rains highlight the supporting roles it is  naturally  Chaney who gives the best performance. Unlike other monsters Chaney's Talbot is kindhearted man who turns into a creature against his will and happens to sever people's jugular veins by biting their necks. You gain sympathy for Talbot in the movie and his character became popular enough to be resurrected and appear in four other films following this.The writing is brilliant balancing character development with the scares and chills the movie gives off. The sets work fairly well and the musical score done by the uncredited team of Charles Previn Hans Salter and Frank Skinner works well setting the right moods for the scenes. The music is often beautiful including a nice pulsing sound like a musical heartbeat when Larry first finds himself changing into a wolf or heartbreaking such as the theme heard when Maleva visits Bela at his coffin or when Sir John learns the identity of the wolf he's stopped.On the negative side though we get some rather puzzling aspects. If Maleva had a charm to keep a person from becoming a werewolf why didn't she give it to her own son Bela? Or if she got it later when and did she get it? Why does Bela even meet Jenny and tell her fortune shortly before he becomes a werewolf? How exactly did Maleva know how to return Larry from a werewolf back to human for a short time when she finds the Wolf Man and again not do it to Bela? And how do werewolves manage to dress themselves anyway? Larry wears an undershirt when he changes into a werewolf but suddenly is wearing a dark shirt when he first becomes the Wolf Man. Oy.Still despite the flaws The Wolf Man is one of the best horror movies or movies in general that Universal has ever done. It may not be a perfect movie but it's a certainly excellent nevertheless.".

Oy.Still despite the flaws The Wolf Man is one of the best horror movies or movies in general that Universal has ever done. It may not be a perfect movie but it's a certainly excellent nevertheless.";

Good music creepy sets good pacing excellent cast and acting believable storyline transformations and makeup that DIDN'T have or rely on a computer to make them look good.  Yes computers have enhanced our viewing pleasures with better special effects but have they really replaced the Wolf Man's work or for that fact have they really replaced Willis O'Brien's work on King Kong.

A poem recited all too often in The Wolf ManThe Wolf Man is the darkest Universal monster film thus far dealing with heavy subject matter such as man vs. superstition the lost of individualism and the dark spiritual transformation from a man into a creature of the night. Such traits also make it one of the best monster films Universal churned out. The film is almost a werewolf in itself creepy unpredictable difficult to define often beautiful and misunderstood and hard to forget.The film stars Lon Chaney Jr. in the careermaking performance of Larry Talbot who experiences a strange transformation cycle after being bit by a werewolf while defending a woman during an attack. The film begins with Talbot returning home to Llanwelly Wales to reconnect with his estranged father Claude Rains. Larry then meets Gwen Evelyn Ankers a beautiful woman who runs a local antique shop. In the process of getting to know her he impulsively buys a silverheaded walking stick which is said to represent the almighty werewolf.After rescuing Gwen's friend from a late night wolf attack which as stated led to him being bit he talks with a gypsy fortuneteller Maria Ouspenskaya who states the person who bit him was her son Bela Lugosi of Universal's earliest monster movie Dracula from 1931 in wolf form. With this realization in mind Larry is informed he will soon turn into a werewolf to live a dual life between man and superstition.From the first frame of the film you know what your in for with The Wolf Man. A film of many gripping scenes of suspense careful performances and beautiful makeup effects done by industry legend Jack Pierce. Consider Larry's transition from man to monster. The scene lasts mere seconds but makeupapplication and costume fitting took roughly ten hours to complete. The transition looks easy but as always the process was one of rigor and painstaking craft.Lon Chaney Jr.'s terrifically straightlaced performance only elevates the believability of the film. Despite the strangeness of the concept particularly at the time Chaney Jr. chooses to assume a personality of seriousness and one predicated off of subtleties. It's easily one of the best performances in Universal's lengthy line of monster flicks and deserves a mention alongside Karloff's Frankenstein and Lugosi's suave Dracula.In addition this is one of the few Universal monster films not directed by James Whale but rather George Waggner who went on to direct Universal's color adaption of Phantom of the Opera just two years after the release of The Wolf Man. While I was consistently wowed by Whale's inclusion of massive and detailed sets and his infusion of wit to his material I doubt he could've made The Wolf Man as well as Waggner. Waggner is concerned with atmosphere and tone two things that weren't always in the forefront in American cinema. The Wolf Man serves as another film that makes it difficult to decide which monster film I enjoy the best.Starring Lon Chaney Jr. Claude Rains Evelyn Ankers and Maria Ouspenskaya. Directed by George Waggner.".

In fact the iconic Chaney may be the weak link. Evelyn Ankers is solid as the target of Talbot's affection. Maria Ouspenskaya steals every scene in which she appears with her understated performance. Claude Rains was a fourtime Oscarnominated actor. Bela Lugosi gives a nice although too brief performance as the gypsy Bela.

	schema:headline " A werewolf movie that's a lot more intellectual than you might expect";
	schema:reviewBody "There are some serious flaws in Universal Studios' The Wolf Man but it's an enjoyable film whose influence still lasts to this day. The film stars Lon Chaney Jr. As Larry Talbot. He returns to his ancestral home in Llanwelly Wales after learning of his brother's death. Larry and his estranged father do not get along very well and it's quite the grim visit. Things take a turn for the better though when he notices the beautiful Gwen Conliffe Evelyn Ankers. When Larry is attacked by a wolf he manages to fight it off but the creature has made it's mark. Having sustained a bite from the beast Larry soon begins transforming into a werewolf at night.The biggest problem with the movie is that it features numerous continuity and editing errors. There are scenes where doors are opened twice or objects moved twice scenes Larry's clothing changes between him being a man and being fully transformed and the inexplicable biggie why is it that the first wolf man we see took on the appearance of a wolf but Larry turns into a wolfman hybrid? One or two mistakes you can overlook as just simple gaffes but there are a lot of these and other strange inconsistencies in the film that are genuinely distracting. Because of everything that's actually really good in the movie these mistakes are particularly disappointing. It could have been a great film if the script had been polished up a bit and the editing had been better.This movie would have been forgotten as a film trying to ride on the coat tails of Dracula and Frankenstein if it hadn't been for the protagonist Larry and the aspect of the werewolf curse. He's a sympathetic character that comes to a strange place and is taken aback by the town's weird obsession with werewolf legends a legend that prior to the film was not very well known to American audiences. He's a charmer and when he gets afflicted with the werewolf curse more on that in a second you really see and feel the internal conflict he's faced with. Our character is literally and figuratively afflicted with a curse. The town's people do not know that it is only a matter of time before he turns into a raging beast and attacks but they still ostracize Larry because of a tragedy that happened while he was out with a young woman on the night he was bitten. The girl's mother blames him for what happened. Her logic is that Larry had no business taking out a woman who is engaged to be married in the first place She has a point and that he is the reason her daughter was out that night. He's already shunned by the town but it gets worse. Half the people that surround him think that Larry's gone mad. Once that wolf that attacked him died it reverted back to its normal human form. Larry isn't really blamed for the death it's ruled as accidental but still. During the scuffle they assume Larry and the man exchanged a few unintentional blows with themselves as well as with the animal. He may be cleared of any wrongdoing as far as the law is concerned but this doesn't mean that the people around him don't suspect his mental instability not only because of the accidental death but also because of the psychological effect that the death has on Larry.All of this is purely from a coincidental aspect because in reality Larry is genuinely cursed. Not only does he turn into a monster by moonlight but he also knows ahead of time who he will attack next. On top of being responsible for the murders Larry also has the added pain of wanting to warn his wouldbe victims but is unable to do so because everyone thinks he's basically nuts. While I always look to the transformation sequences as the highlight of any werewolf film this whodunit aspect is a terrific element I wish was more present in these stories because the beast is able to blend in with the rest of us during the day and this film takes that idea and puts a whole new twist on it.The film is very iconic. The design of the wolf man is still recognizable over sixty years after the film's release and looks pretty good too. The film has some nice special effects with the transformation though because this one predates a lot of modern effects they are kept to a minimum and I love the atmospheric setting of the action. It's set in these terrific woodland sets full of mist. Even the script has its share of good quotes. The best is easily the poem that is repeated multiple times by the people of Llanwelly Even a man who is pure in heartand says his prayers by nightmay become a wolf when the wolf bane bloomsand the autumn moon is bright. That's some good stuff right there. It's interesting too to see a werewolf movie that SURPRISE! does away with all of that nonsense about the full moon. A full moon never appears during this movie Larry just transforms at night time.For its historical importance and the interesting drama present I do recommend you see The Wolf Man. The recommendation is stronger still if you are a fan of horror films and for lovers of the old Universal Monsters it's an absolute must. Granted it has not aged as well as some of the other blackandwhite horror films of the time and by today's film standards you're unlikely to get scared. It also has a lot of technical problems but there's a lot more good here than bad. You may believe you know all there is to know about this classic but there's a lot more going on here than you think. Theatrical version on DVD November 2 2013".

	onyx:emotionText "There are some serious flaws in Universal Studios' The Wolf Man but it's an enjoyable film whose influence still lasts to this day. The film stars Lon Chaney Jr. As Larry Talbot. He returns to his ancestral home in Llanwelly Wales after learning of his brother's death. Larry and his estranged father do not get along very well and it's quite the grim visit. Things take a turn for the better though when he notices the beautiful Gwen Conliffe Evelyn Ankers. When Larry is attacked by a wolf he manages to fight it off but the creature has made it's mark. Having sustained a bite from the beast Larry soon begins transforming into a werewolf at night.The biggest problem with the movie is that it features numerous continuity and editing errors. There are scenes where doors are opened twice or objects moved twice scenes Larry's clothing changes between him being a man and being fully transformed and the inexplicable biggie why is it that the first wolf man we see took on the appearance of a wolf but Larry turns into a wolfman hybrid? One or two mistakes you can overlook as just simple gaffes but there are a lot of these and other strange inconsistencies in the film that are genuinely distracting. Because of everything that's actually really good in the movie these mistakes are particularly disappointing. It could have been a great film if the script had been polished up a bit and the editing had been better.This movie would have been forgotten as a film trying to ride on the coat tails of Dracula and Frankenstein if it hadn't been for the protagonist Larry and the aspect of the werewolf curse. He's a sympathetic character that comes to a strange place and is taken aback by the town's weird obsession with werewolf legends a legend that prior to the film was not very well known to American audiences. He's a charmer and when he gets afflicted with the werewolf curse more on that in a second you really see and feel the internal conflict he's faced with. Our character is literally and figuratively afflicted with a curse. The town's people do not know that it is only a matter of time before he turns into a raging beast and attacks but they still ostracize Larry because of a tragedy that happened while he was out with a young woman on the night he was bitten.

This internal conflict makes Larry a character that is easy to empathize with as we all have had moments in our lives when we believe we see or hear something that in reality is nothing but a figment of our overactive imaginations. The scenes that do include the monster although few and far between are well done and feature impressive visual effects for he time.

He's a likable guy when not in his wolfman form yet it is in fact his wolfform that is the most attractive part of the film.The story is good  it's not flimsy like some werewolf movies I have seen. I'm not saying it is perfect but I am saying it's far from being a cheesy brated story plot.And I love these old special effects I like the transformation from human to wolf and back to human.

Not bad for an immigrant from Nazi Germany Mr. Siodmak had said that much of the horror in the film was derived from the horrors he witnessed in his homeland before emigrating to the USA.Contrary to other reviews the very talented Lon Chaney Jr. gives a performance as the cursed Larry Talbot equal to or superior to his role of Lenny in Of Mice and Men. The scenes between he and Claude Rains portraying his father Sir John Talbot are given real emotional heft by the two actors even though I've never known a father and son who discuss their being stiffnecked and undemonstrative types who vow never to have any more such reserve with only a handshake. The later scenes clearly show Chaney playing Talbot as a man who thinks he's going nuts while his father being stiffnecked and undemonstrative grasps at straws to help him fight his demons.The supporting players are just as luminous especially Evelyn Ankers Ankers Away!! as Gwen Conliffe the proprietor of the antique shop who is engaged but who falls for Larry just the same. Bela Lugosi being thrown a crumb at Universal after starting the horror cycle with Dracula in 1931 plays Bela the Gypsy Fortune Teller the one who visits the curse upon our Larry. Mme.

	schema:reviewBody "If you're looking for real comedy and humor this is the movie to watch. Especially if you like the previous movie JallaJalla! by the same director and many of the same actors this one is a must.

	schema:headline " Good Cops? Bad Cops? Kopps was alright cops. This police farce movie was somewhat funny.";
	schema:reviewBody "For the vast majority of police sitting in his or her patrol car and stopping motorists for traffic violations would really be a slow day. For the police force of the Swedish town of Hgsbotrsk it's every day  it's starting to be a problem. Crime to so low that their station is in danger of being closed. Fearing closure a few good cops started to do a few bad things in order to prevent that. However an out of the city superior Jessica Lindblad Eva Rse is starting to become suspicious. Can the small town cops be able to get away with the crimes and preserve their jobs or will the outsider chief inspector catch up with them? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the comedy film too much I have to say while the movie does have some flaws. I wouldn't call the movie awful. It wasn't police brutality of any kind. This movie directed by Josef Fares was watchable for the most part. Somewhat enjoyable. Nevertheless the movie is not as funny as it should had been due to odd mixer of having dry long drawn out adult driven filler scenes intermingle with quick cut outrageous childish slapstick daydreaming comedy. It made the movie more jarring and confusing than anything else. A good example is the opening to 'Cops'. Instead of starting the film with the crew on patrol. This Swedish film instead opens with the main character Jacob Fares Fares on a blind date answering question. Not once during this date did he mention what he does for a living nor establish how quiet the town was. The dialogue was little to nothing to work with and it just ends with abruptly with nothing really much said. It's so strange why that scene was even there!? Honestly when I think deep about it that scene was not needed due to the fact that bitter couple cops Lasse Gran Ragnerstam  Agneta Sissela Kyle bring up his horrible skills in building relationships a few scenes later. So why does Josef Fares felt like he needed to open with that!? Also what the deal with the cop out ending. Without spoiling too much of it. It was disappointing and weak. It also seem very unrealistic seeing how other agencies was involved yet none of them reported it. Also the whole pizza business that one of the cops came up with comes out of nowhere. It kinda ruins the whole driving force why they want to protect their jobs. Honestly I would love to see an ending similar to 2001's 'Super Trooper' instead. Anyways the comedy quickly spirals more out of control when they introduce Benny Torkel Petersson whom daydreaming sequences are a mixed bag for me. While some of these silly super cop fantasy set pieces were extremely amusing like the reasons why the hotdog stand was burned to the ground AKA 1995's 'Die Hard with a Vengeance'  the notorious 'dick gun' sequence. Others jokes fall flat for me like Benny dreaming of himself driving a DeLorean like 1985's 'Back to the Future' or him doing slow motion flips like 1999's 'the Matrix'. It was all over the place. Its things like the examples I mention are the reasons why you shouldn't hired four screenwriters to beef your script. They all have different ideas of where the story should be steered at with none of their jokes really connecting. Despite that the movie does have some positive things about it. For a foreign international film where the main language is in Swedish. The dialogue is easy to understand with English subtitles. There isn't a lot of deep Swedish cultural references or slang in this film so I didn't get as confused on what they meant like other foreign language comedies. Honestly with the look of the film. The story could had pass as something that came from the Great White North. It's just that transparent with its American influences. Also most of the Cops were pretty likable  relatable even if some of their characteristic were one note. Still if I have to nitpick I felt the cops in the film should had target on people that kinda deserved their property being damaged rather than them targeting innocent good people like Kent Svenke Gustavsson  Janne Viktor Friberg just because one of them always cook sausages. I felt like the town needed more jerks. It would had made me feel a little more sympathetic to the cops cause if the cops targeted them. Overall While on the surface level this film might seem like it's just another parody with cops that we had seen before like 1984's Police Academy'  2003's 'Reno 911'. Kopps' did surprised me by twisting the clichs comedy script by having the bumbling cops do the crime in order to save their jobs. Because of that I can say it's a film worth watching at least once because how unique the premise was. I just wish some of the gun kata fantasy sequence were more imaginative. Don't know if the Adam Sandler's version will ever be made but at least we have this to look back on. So do your duty and check it out!".

This movie is above all accomplished by the excellent acting. It tells a pure and convincing story about struggling to be true to oneself in a world of not only prejudice and firm standards but even serious legal sanctions. I think Maurice' is far more romantic and sexy than most heterosexual love stories I have seen. The love and longing of these men seems so real and pure especially by the fact that they are consistently being told that their inclination is unspeakable' and their futures and careers are at stake.It is great to see Hugh Grant in an early role his first real movie role? that is so different from the mainstream comedy entertainer he has become. The ending is stunning. I love that the movie ended exactly where it did although it is a dread to acknowledge that the war would break out soon after. The music score is enthralling. And Alec Scudder is so beautiful that it hurts.".

	schema:reviewBody "The filmmakers did an incredible job of bringing E.M. Forster's touching novel to life  and I suspect that was no easy task because so much of the novel involves the main character's innermost thoughts and feelings. However Merchant and Ivory did a beautiful job conveying the loneliness fear and desperation of the main character Maurice Hall.The movie follows Maurice James Wilby down his road of selfdiscovery from his embarrassing teen years to Cambridge where he gets his first exhilarating taste of love to his postcollegiate years as a young man struggling to come to terms with his sexuality in a time when homosexuals were mercilessly persecuted.The movie is also very much about class struggle. Maurice is a gentleman born and bred with a penchant for snobbery. As he comes to terms with his sexuality he is forced to deal with differences in class when he realizes he is in love with someone from the serving class.Readers of the novel will be delighted as much of the wonderful dialogue from the book appears in the film.The characters were perfectly cast with Hugh Grant before he was a mega star as Clive Durham the perfect young gentleman from Cambridge and Maurice's first love Rupert Graves as the smoldering lower class hunk who wins Maurice's heart and Ben Kingsley in a hilarious turn as Maurice's junkpsychologist. James Wilby was spoton in the title role and he perfectly captures the isolation sadness and ultimate joy of the conflicted Maurice.Maurice is a touching love story that anyone  straight or gay  can enjoy. Romance knows neither of these terms. And the movie is unabashedly romantic and optimistic  your heart will soar when Maurice finally gives in casts societal conventions aside and visits his beloved at the boathouse. The hopeful ending is inspiring though the closeup of Clive at the window at the end of the movie will break your heart.Beautifully filmed superbly acted  a mustsee film.".

The gaffe is surprising because even here in America it was a rule that a man never offered his hand to a woman unless she extended hers first. Maurice seems not to know this for he extends his hand to Clive's mother even though she has not offered hers. We see a flash of surprise on her face as she tepidly accepts and shakes his hand. It's funny and a little painful if you understand what's happening.That little bit of business shows us that the gulf between upper class Clive and middle class Maurice is every bit as wide as that between Maurice and working class Alec. If we take it as a matter of fact that Maurice could survive in Clive's worldand we see him doing sowhy should we be any less willing to admit that Alec could survive in Maurice's?We shouldn't. Maurice expects Clive to treat him as an equal just as Alec expects Maurice to treat him as an equal. In fact Alec demonstrates repeatedly that he IS Maurice's equal and he even tells Maurice so to his face. After they've shared Alec drops some of his deference to Maurice but not entirely after all some of it is just automatic from habit but he talks to him as an equal Ordering me about againyou would! and My people wouldn't take to you either and I wouldn't blame them and most effectively What does your engagement matter?And too a lot of what might be thought of as their class difference is perhaps more about the differences in their environments. Alec is a country boy and Maurice is a suburbanurban boy. These are lifestyles that are very different but they are lifestyles that can become familiar even comfortable with exposure.Alec would make the relationship work. Alec has initiative he climbs in the window and stays and determination he goes to London. We need to remember that when we express apprehension about the happy couple's future.Overall I had the impression that Alec would be a quick study adapting easily to whatever joint lifestyle he chooses for them. After all Alec will be the boss of the relationship as made apparent when he delivers what is probably THE most romantic line in all of gay cinema Now we shan't never be parted. It's finished.I too think they would have emigrated to Canada or the U.S. or anyplace where the differences in their accents would not be so obvious. They would live someplace where they would be perceived as two Englishmen rather than as two different kinds of Englishmen.After a couple years Alec's eye would wander and he would stray.

I didn't feel uneasy about homosexuality at all but it was with that movie that I finally realized it was only love no matter whether it involved a man and a woman or two men or two women.... The set is magnificent the actors at their best a great Hugh Grant who was so great as to show how Mr E.M.Forster had become tired with Clive... and I must say that Mr Ivory did a pretty good job with his version of the story very well adapted. In fact I do believe the book is superior in many moments but on the other hand the film is far far superior in many other moments and you can't really say this all the times. I suggest everybody should watch it and enjoy it no matter what your sexual preferences are. A masterpiece indeed!".

It is a tightrope to walk for the freewheeling independent thinker in this society he who steps outside the bounds of regularity is subject to scorn and persecution.  That the drama's heros do not fall into the mode of socalled normalcy leave them open to a lifestyle of tension and risk.

	schema:reviewBody "I saw MAURICE when it first appeared in theaters in the mid80s and enjoyed it. I was surprised on a second viewing on DVD last night at how much I had forgotten about this film. This story of a thwarted love affair between two upper class men during their years at Cambridge is a deeply absorbing and entertaining adaptation of Forster's posthumously published novel which I read at in 1971. I thought the book rather dull. The movie seems anything but which makes me wonder if I shouldn't pull it off my library shelves and give it another go. Though James Wilby's Maurice Hall is the main character it is Hugh Grant young aristocrat that is most intriguing here. Clive Durham Grant is a spoiled and deeply entrenched member of Britain's snobbish ruling class. It is Durham who pursues Wilby not the other way around as some of these reviews would have you believe. Initially spooked by Durham's admission of his love for Maurice he pursues Durham with a naive passion. But that passion is ruined when a fellow classmate from Cambridge is set up by a soldier in a bar and arrested by the police. This young man's future in politics and society is ruined horrified Durham says no to him when he asks to testify on his behalf and he is found guilty and sentenced to six months in jail and hard labor. His picture is splashed across the headlines of London's tabloids. The realization that this could happen to him forces Durham to reject Maurice pursue and marry a young girl from his class and move himself deeply into the closet. So much for the politics of homosexuality in Britain circa 1912. Maurice is devastated by his friend's rejection of him. Miserable he seeks every avenue he can to reverse and cure his own homosexual longings. He even subjects himself to the quackery of a hypnotisttherapist Ben Kinsley in a hilarious turn. Maurice finally gives in to his feelings when he finally falls deeply in love with the gamekeeper of Durham's estate well played by the young and very handsome Rupert Graves. This MerchantIvory film is typically gorgeous to look at its pacing is novelistic and deeply rewarding. Hugh Grant showed early star appeal as the superficial and ultimately defeated victim of his class and society. He would rarely get the chance at so fine a part in the future despite his great success as a light comedian in a string of international hit movies ABOUT A BOY being one such terrific film performance from this very appealing actor. James Wilby is pitch perfect as the perplexed and emotional Maurice. The expert supporting cast under the commanding direction of James Ivory delivers this period piece superbly. It's period look is typical of MerchantIvory productionsdetailed richly appointed and very beautiful. Kudos also to Kit HeskethHarvey's excellent screenplay.One viewer here complained that ending was far too upbeat and unrealistic for its time but I really didn't see it that way. There were many men and women who set up housekeeping in both London and New York living their lives in discreet harmony under the noses of hostile societies. Still others preferred to move abroad to live their lives in discrete peace and tranquility. I prefer to think this is just what Maurice and Scudder do. If Maurice were as much of a snob as Durham this might not have worked. But we see Maurice's slow understanding of the hypocrisy of his class in the aftermath of his affair with Durham and he comes to realize that even he is somewhat constrained by his own upperclass upbringing in his initial interactions with Scudder's far lower standing. This is a deeply affecting movie and holds up superbly. Highly recommended.".

This story of a thwarted love affair between two upper class men during their years at Cambridge is a deeply absorbing and entertaining adaptation of Forster's posthumously published novel which I read at in 1971. I thought the book rather dull. The movie seems anything but which makes me wonder if I shouldn't pull it off my library shelves and give it another go. Though James Wilby's Maurice Hall is the main character it is Hugh Grant young aristocrat that is most intriguing here. Clive Durham Grant is a spoiled and deeply entrenched member of Britain's snobbish ruling class. It is Durham who pursues Wilby not the other way around as some of these reviews would have you believe. Initially spooked by Durham's admission of his love for Maurice he pursues Durham with a naive passion. But that passion is ruined when a fellow classmate from Cambridge is set up by a soldier in a bar and arrested by the police. This young man's future in politics and society is ruined horrified Durham says no to him when he asks to testify on his behalf and he is found guilty and sentenced to six months in jail and hard labor. His picture is splashed across the headlines of London's tabloids. The realization that this could happen to him forces Durham to reject Maurice pursue and marry a young girl from his class and move himself deeply into the closet. So much for the politics of homosexuality in Britain circa 1912. Maurice is devastated by his friend's rejection of him. Miserable he seeks every avenue he can to reverse and cure his own homosexual longings. He even subjects himself to the quackery of a hypnotisttherapist Ben Kinsley in a hilarious turn. Maurice finally gives in to his feelings when he finally falls deeply in love with the gamekeeper of Durham's estate well played by the young and very handsome Rupert Graves. This MerchantIvory film is typically gorgeous to look at its pacing is novelistic and deeply rewarding. Hugh Grant showed early star appeal as the superficial and ultimately defeated victim of his class and society. He would rarely get the chance at so fine a part in the future despite his great success as a light comedian in a string of international hit movies ABOUT A BOY being one such terrific film performance from this very appealing actor. James Wilby is pitch perfect as the perplexed and emotional Maurice. The expert supporting cast under the commanding direction of James Ivory delivers this period piece superbly. It's period look is typical of MerchantIvory productionsdetailed richly appointed and very beautiful. Kudos also to Kit HeskethHarvey's excellent screenplay.One viewer here complained that ending was far too upbeat and unrealistic for its time but I really didn't see it that way. There were many men and women who set up housekeeping in both London and New York living their lives in discreet harmony under the noses of hostile societies. Still others preferred to move abroad to live their lives in discrete peace and tranquility. I prefer to think this is just what Maurice and Scudder do. If Maurice were as much of a snob as Durham this might not have worked. But we see Maurice's slow understanding of the hypocrisy of his class in the aftermath of his affair with Durham and he comes to realize that even he is somewhat constrained by his own upperclass upbringing in his initial interactions with Scudder's far lower standing. This is a deeply affecting movie and holds up superbly. Highly recommended.";

	schema:reviewBody "Before I watch Maurice I almost had no idea of the life of gays. I used to hold the notion that homosexuality was unacceptable and disgusting which was under the influence of some socalled orthodox thinking. As the time goes by I gradually realized that you can't make a judgment before truly knowing something about it. Truth is not told by everybody but explored and medicated by yourself. And the movie Maurice has provided me with a good chance to have a better look at the true life of gays to perceive their pure and pristine affections towards the same sex to feel their struggle and desperation under public prejudice and pressure. Though my life is a far cry from that of Maurice and Clive portrayed in the movie it seems that I can understand them perfectly and are quite empathetic with them. I think that is because what is expressed in the movie is undoubtedly part of human nature which can strike a chord in the depth of every human being's heart. For that reason one line in the movie stroke me deeply. When Maurice's psychological doctor advised him to emigrate to countries such as France and Italy where homosexuality was no longer criminal he said England has always been disinclined to accept human nature.A great movie!".

After all an upper class and working class man could never live as a couple in Edwardian England? In fact E.M.

He had visited Carpenter and Merrill at Millthorpe in Derbyshire on several occasions once in 1913 Merrill touched my backside  gently and just above the buttocks. I believe he touched most people's. The sensation was unusual and I still remember it as I remember the position of a long vanished tooth.

	schema:reviewBody "E.M. Forster 18791970 as a gay man lived long enough to see the Stonewall Rebellion happen across the pond the year before his death at the age of 91. Though close friends knew he was gay as prescribed by the mores of the times Forster led a quiet discreet and circumspect life. He was not a political person first and foremost he was a novelist though in his writings you can some trenchant comments about the political never more so in his A Passage To India.My guess is that if Stonewall didn't happen here and other developments such as the Wolfenden report recommending decriminalization of homosexuality in the United Kingdom hadn't happened Maurice might never have seen the light of day. My guess is that Forster would have opted for a time capsule hoping this novel of young same sex love would see the light of day in more enlightened times. He got to see those enlightened times come before he died so Forster's novel Maurice was published in 1971 and came to the screen in 1987. Forster's protagonist is Maurice Hall a young man with some unwanted gay feelings unwanted because at the time those things were not discussed. Young Maurice forms an attachment with school chum Clive Durham. To put it in more modern terms they're the British boarding school equivalent of Ennis Delmar and Jack Twist. And they view their relationship differently as did Jack and Ennis. Maurice truly hates the stifling conformity of Edwardian Great Britain but Clive wants to put it behind him get married and do as proper British society demands of him. James Wilby is Maurice and Hugh Grant in one of his earliest roles is the shallow Clive. Maurice takes a path that E.M. Forster took in life as a gay man as open as he could be but most discreet. I do wonder who the Clive character was based on. I also wonder if in the future the proper Mr. Clive might have been giving the toe tapping signal in some bathroom stall looking to satisfy his real and closeted lusts.There is also a great performance by Rupert Graves as Alec Scudder the stablehand at Clive's estate who Maurice eventually does establish a relationship and some measure of happiness. It will be a tough road for them not very many places on the earth will be that hospitable in the years just before World War I.Maurice was written around 1910 a decade or so after the Oscar Wilde scandal and six years before Roger Casement's diaries were opened to the public to justify hanging him as a traitor in the Easter Rebellion. The gay baiting there was a deliberate tactic by the British government to shake popular support away from the rebels in Ireland. These were not good times for GayLesbianBisexualTransgendered people. E.M. Forster wrote the novel and tucked it away. It's a beautiful work and a beautiful film made from same. I'm glad in the final couple of years of life Forster saw the more enlightened times come so we could have a glimpse of what life was like for a young gay male in Edwardian Great Britain.".

	schema:reviewBody "I really liked this movie when I first saw it in 1987. I like it even more today. This is the story of two gay men in the early 20th Century how they fall in love how they fall apart and how they eventually take very different paths. One that leads to a life of sadness and regret. The other to acceptance love and fulfillment. James Wilby gives a powerful performance as Maurice a middle class gentleman who discovers his homosexuality while away for college at Cambridge University. It is there he meets and falls in love with Clive Durham played brilliantly by Hugh Grant an upper class gentleman who lives in a decaying English manor called Pendersligh Park that was built by his grandfather's grandfather. They enter into a passionate albeit sexless relationship that most viewers will see as doomed from the start. Maurice once he overcomes his internal conflict over who and what he actually is is drowning in love for Clive. Clive on the other hand though he is in love with Maurice is perhaps more in love with the idea of Maurice than Maurice himself. When outside circumstances intervene their world together comes crashing down and the results are painful for both. One of the plot devices that I found intriguing and not having read the book I don't know if it is part of the original story is Simcox Clive's butler played menacingly and effectively by Patrick Godfrey. He informs the viewer of the disapproval and judgment directed at Maurice and Clive that IS Edwardian England. Simcox delivers even the most banal lines with an almost imperceptible sneer. Even when he has no lines he is lurking in the background of the scene with a stone cold gaze that says I know what you're up to. He is the warden. Edwardian England is the prison. And Pendersleigh Park is Clives cell.I missed many of the finer points of this film the first time I saw it in 1987. Back then the ending disappointed me because I identified with Maurice and I felt like he waked away with the second prize Alec Scudder. And Clive caved to the pressures of Edwardian England and entered into a marriage he was never suited for. All of that was true then and is still true today. However with 20 plus years of maturation behind me I now understand that when the credits role at the end of this film Clive is as deeply in love with Maurice as he ever was. The finale of the film is a window into the lifeless hopeless longing that is Clive's future contrasted with that of the fulfillment and joy that will be Maurice's. After Clive and Maurice have their final words Clive returns to his waiting wife inside Pendersleigh. Simcox asks will there will be anything else sir? and then proceeds to close the house shutters for the night. You can almost hear the sound of cell doors closing for lights out in a penitentiary. Clive approaches his wife who is seated in front of her vanity mirror. He leans in to kiss her cheek and they look up together into the mirror in front of them. They expect to see a happy couple. They don't. There is a sadness in Clive's eyes that they are both unprepared for. It is more shocking to Clive because now he is no longer fooling even himself. He pulls uncomfortably away from his wife and like a prisoner resigned to his confinement he finishes closing the shutters the cell doors of Pendersleigh one by one. As he comes to the last one he takes a final look out the window at freedom. Clive has chosen to accept society and turn its turmoil toward him inward where he will always be conflicted and never know a moment of peace. Maurice has decided to accept who he is and deal with the turmoil in the world outside. It is heartbreaking. James Wilby carries this movie from start to finish. As Maurice it is his story to tell and tell it he does. From adolescent bewilderment to revulsion with Clive's initial advances to falling in love with Clive then heartbreak and finally to his own sunset to walk into. He never has a foot out of place. It is an honest and compelling performance. But it is Hugh Grant's complex and multi layered Clive that you're left with ricocheting around in your soul. When Clive says to Maurice It's like the good blundering creature that you are to try and comfort me but there are limits Grant conveys a sense of defeat resignation and emptiness that is almost too difficult to watch. At times he stares very far away. Probably to the place where he wishes he could be but seems impossible to reach. I think because initially I was so personally disappointed in his characters evolution throughout the course of the movie that I missed what a brilliant performance this was. Forgive me Mr. Grant. You are a truly talented actor.This is a brilliant film. It's all there beautiful story beautiful landscape cinematography great scriptsmall problem though with the editing and nonsequitur dialog when Scudder meets Maurice in London great direction perfect score and above all two brilliant performances from James Wilby and Hugh Grant and many others in the supporting cast. This one is a must see.".

	schema:headline " A Major Milestone Movie";
	schema:reviewBody "I first saw Maurice when it was in theatrical release a long time ago and was absolutely captivated. I actually bought a VHS copy of it back when they cost something like 80 so I was really glad to be able to get the Special Edition DVD set which includes several deleted scenes.However back to the title of this review Maurice was a milestone or watershed movie because it has a happy ending. Before it was produced almost all movies with a gay theme ended either tragically or without a conclusion. Following that old formula it would have ended with Maurice standing on the dock as Alec's ship slowly moved away his farewell gift having been refused or Maurice would have found Alec hanging at the end of a rope in the boathouse. Instead it ends with Maurice and Alec in each other's arms. It's easy to forget just how significant this was at the time.I would also like to address the subject of Maurice and Alec's future. The opinion that their affair would not last long is widely held largely due to the huge difference in their social classes. I freely admit that they would face huge difficulties but I don't think their situation was hopeless.Alec was uneducated but he was not unintelligent. He was also ambitious and hard working. He had to have been very much in love with Maurice to change his plans at the last minute and stay in England. Maurice has already suffered the loss of someone he thought was his soul mate and was unlikely to let another great love get away easily.So what did they do and where did they go? My feeling is that their best chance at happiness would have been to emigrate to some location where nobody knew them most likely the United States. Class differences certainly also existed in America but they were not nearly as rigid as in Britain and with a little education and polish Alec could easy have found a way to fit in.Most likely they would have ended up in someplace like San Francisco which even then was famous for its Bohemians and people who lived unconventional lifestyles.".

	onyx:emotionText "I first saw Maurice when it was in theatrical release a long time ago and was absolutely captivated. I actually bought a VHS copy of it back when they cost something like 80 so I was really glad to be able to get the Special Edition DVD set which includes several deleted scenes.However back to the title of this review Maurice was a milestone or watershed movie because it has a happy ending. Before it was produced almost all movies with a gay theme ended either tragically or without a conclusion. Following that old formula it would have ended with Maurice standing on the dock as Alec's ship slowly moved away his farewell gift having been refused or Maurice would have found Alec hanging at the end of a rope in the boathouse. Instead it ends with Maurice and Alec in each other's arms. It's easy to forget just how significant this was at the time.I would also like to address the subject of Maurice and Alec's future. The opinion that their affair would not last long is widely held largely due to the huge difference in their social classes. I freely admit that they would face huge difficulties but I don't think their situation was hopeless.Alec was uneducated but he was not unintelligent. He was also ambitious and hard working. He had to have been very much in love with Maurice to change his plans at the last minute and stay in England.

But for those who had not they enjoyed as the rest of us did. The music score is excellent and the camera shoots of the English country side are exquisite. The story line is so romantic you really don't want it to end. It also deals with the class structure of its day in gentle way. All actors are brilliant in there roles.

This beautiful yet heartbreaking film actually made me cry the first time I saw it. I will not say exactly what I was thinking but it had to do with my father. Maurice is said to be from the writings of author E.M. Forster autobiographical it is thought in some aspects but requested only to be published after his death. It is uncommon in being an unconventional period love story where two men are the subject and later a third of some importance. It has text and subtext of what one must do cannot or tries to do to get hold maybe even destroy love. Frankly if one can suspend disgust for the protagonists of the subject and their love it may even be instructional where traditional love is concerned which often sometimes is not nearly valued enough and taken for granted. Please be aware the conservative may be horrified while the less conservative may be bored and feel a threat of their own. Wonderful film which I think of as a true achievement for the MerchantIvoryJhabavala triumvirate team. I also like as an accompaniment Room With A View. Separately wonderful.

	schema:reviewBody "When I first came across this movie last year I was hesitant to view it because I thought it would be fluff due to Hugh Grant yep i've yet to see a JamesIvory production but after seeing it I was enchanted by the serene treatment which is so unlike Hollywood. And for the better. It tells the story of a young snobbish gentleman Maurice James Wilby who falls in love with a fellow Cambridge undergrad Clive Hugh Grant who acknowledges Maurice's feelings but not truly returning the affection or love. Maurice realized he is fully capable of a passionate love affair with his own sex that he hangs on to the calcified Clive. Even after Clive married he accepts Clive's invitation to stay in Clive's estate in the desperate hope of a requited love. This predictably increased his sufferings when Clive showed up very little and even ignored Maurice's birthday. He tried to be like Clive by consulting a doctor and a hypnotist in order to 'cure' his homosexuality. As it turned out Clive's game keeper Scudder Rupert Graves has been observing and been trying to cozy up to him. Maurice of course never noticed this because Scudder is his social inferior. In a most memorable scene one reviewer here wrote it as a gay man's dream Scudder climbed up to Maurice's room and entered through the window to realize Maurice's pent up yearnings. Due to class difference Maurice tried to ignore Scudder subsequently but realized that Scudder's love is true when the latter intentionally missed his boat to Argentina where a job and a 'normal' life awaits him. And now its up to Maurice to accept a 'friend to last his life time' as he had long dreamed even if he is of a lower class. This movie reminds me of a beautiful stream that flows its course slowly. The performance is great and although Graves appeared only in the last half of the film his presence provides the sexual energy that was implied in the first half. The lovemaking scenes are unabashed but not self gratifying. The final scene of Maurice in his undergrad days at Cambridge beckoning to Clive is heart breaking. And the music feeds the mental image of the film after the credit ends. Definitely one of my favorite films that warrants repeated watching.".

It wasn't so long since Oscar Wilde was jailed for sodomy and Forster had his own homosexuality become public knowledge would certainly have found himself in a similar predicament and would never have enjoyed the literary eminence that he did. So consequently moved though he was to write the book gave instructions that it should not be published until after his death and Forster lived for a very long time. When Maurice eventually did see the light of day it seemed terribly dated. 'I'm an unspeakable of the Oscar Wilde sort' Maurice tells his doctor in a feeble attempt to be 'cured' of his 'affliction' and a line which the movie retains. Gay literature had come a long way in the interim and homosexuality was no longer seen as an illness nor a crime.But Forster's view of homosexuality was surprisingly not a tortured shamefilled one but touchingly if ridiculously romantic. When Maurice finally does find true love it cuts across all barriers including class and has the lovers retreating like some gay Adam and Eve to 'the greenwood'. It seems unrealistic but at the same time liberating long before the term 'gay liberation' was ever coined.James Ivory's screen version is remarkably faithful to the original and consequently risks ridicule in this socalled more enlightened age. But Ivory's intelligence as a filmmaker has long been overlooked in favour of an emphasis on his prettified recreations of the past. Yet he remains the preeminent chronicler in British cinema though American and consistently working with an Indian producer Ismail Merchant of a particular period in British history mostly through adaptations of novels by writers of the period or by contemporary authors writing about the period. But when Ivory did adapt 'classic' literature he concentrated on the best and working mostly with the great writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala brought to bear on these adaptations a deeply felt and genuine appreciation of their worth.Hence Maurice is as fastidiously good as we have come to expect the difference being that this time the script is not by Jhabvala but by Ivory himself and Kit HeskethHarvey. In every other respect it looks and feels typically 'MerchantIvory' a term some people believe stultified British cinema at a time when other directors were making edgy contemporary 'newwave' films. But that is like condemning wellacted wellcrafted Shakespeare just because it's old.Maurice is a superbly acted visually gorgeous film though at times its fidelity to its source means that sometimes certain scenes feel stilted you make want to give these people a good shaking. And did they need to cast actors as beautiful as James Wilby Maurice Hugh Grant his first great love Clive Durham and Rupert Graves the gamekeeper Scudder shades of a gay Lady Chatterly the boy he finally falls for? All three play wonderfully well and Ivory populates his film with a cast of wonderful character actors Simon Callow Denholm Elliot Billie Whitelaw Judy Parfitt all playing at the top of their form.Of course both book and film have now largely been set aside as dated and irrelevant in the annals of gay literature and cinema. Surely not. The film remains as much an integral part of the history and consequential progress of mainstream gay moviemaking as Brokeback Mountain though by no means as commercially successful as it is an integral part of the MerchantIvory stable. Anyone remotely interested in either should seek it out.".

This MerchantIvory production is without compare. I taped it when it was broadcast here in otherwise dull Iceland. Of course I had seen it a number of times in the theater but that did not stop me. I would watch this film every time I felt out of sorts and it always improved my mood. In fact I am hooked on it. If I understand correctly this film was a debut for Wilby Grant and Rupert Graves. These characters grow on you and they seem to become lifetime friends. I am especially partial to the all too seldom a truly happy ending. So friends out there lets rejoice.There is however a novel that has not caught the attention of the moviemakers. This is The Charioteer by the late Mary Renault. That book has given me even more comfort than Maurice has ever done. Why that is so can only be in the mind of the perspective reader. I fear that in our oh so sterile western societies where smoking and heavy drinking are frowned upon to say the least that this particular book would not appeal to the general public but from the kind words afforded by you on Maurice I wager that you would love to see The Charioteer in your favorite theater or in the privacy of your home. The Charioteer takes us back to World War II to a military hospital. To make a long story short the book portrays the love of a particular wounded soldier for two different young men and the soulwrestling that tortures him one of the beloved being a Quaker the other someone he used to know and admire from school. The Oliver Stone film Alexander was mainly based on Ms.Renault trilogy Fire From Heaven The Persian Boy and Funeral Games. So without boring you further I suggest that if any person of consequence in the film business reads these words and takes a close look at this particular book and think twice. The cast would of course have to be British but don't we all love the Brits anyway? Wouldn't Emma Thompson be the ideal producer? I'm all for it and Branagh the director?".

	schema:reviewBody "Similar to goldilocks78 I watched Maurice again  I saw it when I was in my 20s when it was first released. There is some very good acting and a very good sociological recreation of the Edwardian period. Maurice the novel might well not be considered as EM Forster's finest work. But similar to Lady Chatterley's Lover not considered among Lawrence's best the work raises issues of class gender and sexuality. The three leads are good  Hugh Grant gives a plausible portrayal of a more refined upperclass man who denies his homosexual urgings and marries. He clearly shows after this conversion of sorts his ambivalence and almost forced denial. Hugh Grant almost effortlessly shows the two sides to this character. James Wilbyas Maurice moves from selfdisgust despair and guilt to selfacceptance. Rupert Graves as Scudder similar to Mellors is really good. The scenes he shares with James Wilby are not forced. The supporting cast are good  the women Simon Callow who introduces us to the Edwardian conformist ideology are equally good. And Ben Kingsley as the hypnotherapist nicely shows the pushpull in the thenBritish psyche. My favourite MerchantIvory film is Room with a view. Maurice is darker but just as well filmed with enough humour to balance the seriousness of the film. The naive happilyeverafter ending EM Forster's doesn't quite work but leads to good discussion. Of all the DVDshown deleted scenes the final 'confrontation' between Maurice and Durham should be in my opinion restored. It's a fine film both engaging and unsettling. Sensitively adapted directed acted and shot. Kudos".

	schema:reviewBody " Quite simply one of the most exquisitely cinematic explorations of gay love that has ever created produced by Ismail Merchant directed by James Ivory and adapted from the classic E. M. Forster novel Maurice is a true masterpiece. A quintessentially English example of love between men in the early 20th century at a time when homosexuality was still illegal and persecution was everywhere. This delightfully considered and delicately fragrances tale starts with a windswept walk along the beach for an elevenyearold Maurice Hall and his bumbling although wellmeaning school master Mr Ducie played by a darling of the British theatre scene and all round nice guy Simon Callow. Mr Ducie tries to explain the rudimentary sacred mysteries of sexual intercourse with the aid of sand drawings to the fatherless young man on the very periphery of puberty. Years later in 1909 Maurice Hall is attending Cambridge striking up friendships with aristocratic Lord Risley and the jolly lip smacking lovely Clive Durham. Durham played by a devilishly handsome and not yet type cast Hugh Grant who seems to fall quite madly in love with the long tall blonde Maurice Hall and who could really blame him. He surprises Maurice by fessing up to his emotions which take young Maurice on the hop a bit. At first he is muddled and confused by the declaration yet soon comes to realise and accept he has similar feelings for his friend. Maurice is sent down leaves under a cloud from the academic hot seat of Cambridge and yet he maintains a strong friendship with Clive Durham. Maurice with a little help finds work embarking on an unrewarding career as a London stockbroker. A big fat spanner is thrown well and truly into the workings of a 'happy ever after' life when our two platonic lovers get frightened as university chum Lord Risley is not only arrested but also sentenced to six months hard labour. His crime was supposedly soliciting sex from dashing army soldier who may well have been up for it at the time!Maurice is heartbroken he cant have Clive who is now set to marry he seeks to rid himself of his gay feelings. Maurice and his aloof ways come to the attention of the supposedly uneducated under gamekeeper working on Durham's country estate. How Maurice fails to notice the adorable Alec Scudder played supremely by Rupert Graves is a mystery to all bar himself yet the young handsome manly servant is not put off. One rainy evening a few nights later Scudder risks everything and yet nothing by climbing a ladder and into Maurice's bedroom they kiss and spend most of the night 'getting to know' each other.Longterm joys are not on the horizon in just a couple of days Alec Scudder is booked on a passage to a new life in the new world. Somehow Scudder misses the boat confusion reigns supreme for a good long while. Maurice muddled by everything confesses all to Clive Durham who understands little and off Maurice trots to the boathouse. Oh the rapture and the wonder then he find dear young Scudder there waiting for him. It's bewilderingly romantic and powerfully affecting Scudder apparently sent a telegram to Maurice though it was never received informing him that he'd left his family and the chance of a new life overseas to stay with Maurice and telling him to come to the boathouse. They melt into each other's arms and the effervescent glow of love surrounds them in a bubble of happiness as Scudder whispers Now we shan't never be parted.Oh how I wanted my own Scudder or indeed to be someone else's Scudder when I first saw Maurice back in 1987 or 88 such was the magnificence and beauty of the story. The stunning production qualities wonderful photography and cinematography in plump richness exuberant colour with the finest of details all ensure this is one of the finest costume period drama ever made. Gay or otherwise! Forster wrote this mainly between 1913 and 1914 yet it was only published for the first time in 1971 a full year after his death. Forster himself was reticent about its publication mainly because of the legal and public attitudes towards homosexuality at the time. Indeed a handwritten note on the original manuscript allegedly said Publishable but worth it? He wanted it to have a happy ending not the one made up in the film version but perhaps one of the Scudder and Maurice years later as a pair of woodcutters having lived a long and happy life together although this epilogue of sorts was discarded by Forster himself. Many academic types including those at Kings College believe Maurice to be a substandard Forster novel compared with A Passage to India and Howards End. They very nearly did not give permission for the film to be made or indeed shot on location at Kings. Thankfully they relented and the world could enjoy a cinematic masterpiece filmed in part where Forster himself would have walked during his days at Cambridge. James Wilby and Hugh Grant excel as Maurice and Clive indeed many still believe this to be Grant's career best performance. Rupert Graves is magnificent as the beautiful Alec Scudder. In addition there is a potent supporting cast including Denholm Elliott Simon Callow Billie Whitelaw and Ben Kingsley.This movie had a profound impact on my early teenage years not only igniting a love of literature but also in my acceptance of sexuality profoundly moving entertaining and liberating.

This bittersweet but tender love story managed to get my attention all along I didn't even notice that it's longer than an average movie140 min. and marvelously get's it's message across without being too explicit. This highly emotional love story is built around three characters and explores the problem of homosexuality in 19th century England. The main character is Maurice Hallas the title suggests who comes to terms with his sexuality when love develops between him and his college best friend Clive Durham. After rejection deception and huge efforts to become what is considered normal he finally finds comfort in the arms of the Durham household's gamekeeper. Although all the performances were excellent it was Alec Scudder's character that I found the more interesting. Rupert Graves did an excellent job portraying this rough yet sensitive country boy who's sincere love for a high class gentleman seems impossible at first. A bit brash yet charming this low class lad falls desperately in love with Mr. Durham's almost permanent guest who initially despite Scudder's numerous signals doesn't seem to remark his more than obvious affection. His glances the clumsy conversations the overjoyed remark that Scudder makes after Mr. Hall's unexpectedly quick return to the estate as well as the passionate love letters addressed to Maurice after their first sharing show the honesty and depth of Scudder's affection excluding any chance of blackmailing and desire for profit  as both the viewer and Maurice might have suspected. Compared to Clive Durham who is unable to face his sexuality and hides behind a hollow marriage Scudder stands as a vivid character comfortable with who he isand who's faithfulness and unconditional love manages to win Maurice's heart.".

	schema:headline " Stones Hit Scorsese Misses";
	schema:reviewBody "I saw the Rolling Stones live last year for the first time and I was blown away. I've been a Stones fan for decades but have never had any interest in stadium rock concerts with their huge crowds and tiny stars on stage. The few stadium shows I've attended were always mediocre experiences. But the Stones' Bigger Bang tour changed my mind.For one the enormous video screens make every seat great. Beyond that it was the Rolling Stones that won me over. Rocking songs incredible performances unbelievable energy and every one in the crowd dancing and singing the whole show. And these guys are in their sixties! Watching 'Shine a Light' on IMAX at times made me feel like I was actually at a live Stones concert but then I kept feeling that something key was missing. And it was.Martin Scorsese covered the two explosive shows at the Beacon Theater in New York with 18 cameras but he somehow missed getting the band. As expected lead singer and ringmaster Mick Jagger gets the most screen time with guitarist Keith Richards coming in a not too distant second. And then there's Ron Wood the second guitarist and some might argue the better soloist He has juicy moments on screen but is shockingly absent time and again when soloing the camera instead lingering on a prancing Jagger or posing Richards.And where is drummer Charlie Watts? Watching 'Shine a Light' one might think the Stones had backing tracks instead of a live drummer. Watts is the quiet one who doesn't dye his hair but he's the backbone of their sound keeping time holding it down while the boys jump around. I kept wanting to see shots of Watts not only for the variety of imagery and the visual reinforcement that there really is a live drummer hitting the cowbell on 'Honky Tonk Women' but also because he's an original Rolling Stone. Sadly there are only a handful of very brief clips featuring Watts and just as few wide shots of the whole band on stage. And Watts is not the only one nearly absent from the movie.Although the original members are Jagger Richards Watts and Wood Wood joined in 1974 so he's not actually an original Stone they tour with a number of key support musicians including bass player Daryl Jones who's worked with them since 1994 a keyboardist a horn section and three backup singers. However except for some brief interplay between Jagger and the backup singers the other musicians are absent from the film. It's not so unusual to relegate nonmember support players to minor roles in concert movies but to avoid them altogether is baffling and frustrating.The support musicians may not be Rolling Stones but they are a part of the band. They are playing the music and adding to the sights and sounds on stage. But 'Shine a Light' mostly kept them in the dark. This isn't how a real concert is experienced. In concert the other players are seen and often featured in the spotlight as soloists. But time and again in 'Shine a Light' we hear a piano riff a sax solo a horn section blast a bass run but we never actually see who's playing. We neither get full nor medium shots nor even closeups of hands playing. We don't even get quick cuts of the support players as one might see interspersed regularly throughout most filmed live concerts today. Instead we see lingering shots of Jagger and Richards sometimes so close you can see the brown behind Jagger's teeth while a saxophone or some other player wails somewhere offcamera. The Stones sound is some much more than guitar bass drums and vocals. A concert is so much more than the starring players but you don't get that from this film. It's as if the film makers had tin ears.This is baffling because they had 18camera shooting the action. So the film makers either didn't get the coverage or they decided in the editing room not to include the other players. Bad decision. This gives the movie the Stones concert experience a frustrating myopic feel. I kept wanting to see what I was hearing but couldn't. I kept wanting to get a visual of the focal point in the song and on stage but it was not delivered. Even one of the few times Jaggar plays harmonica is offcamera. This left me feeling shortchanged.Ultimately 'Shine a Light' is slightly claustrophobic with all its medium and close shots. It rarely opens up to show the entire band on stage. The film suffers as a result as wide shots would have provided much needed breathing room offering a more open perspective and also providing the myriad tight shots with context. We do see the interplay between Jagger and Richards or between Richards and Wood but we don't see the whole band working together as a unit. And ultimately that's what a live Stones show or any live rock show is all abouta group of individuals performing together as a band. Even if Scorsese decided that the film was all about the four Stones he could have easily divided the enormous screen into quads now and again so we could see the four Stones working their magic simultaneously in a multiscreen format. This is common place today and highly effective.It's baffling that with all the resources at hand and experience behind him Scorsese didn't quite deliver the goods. It's as if his infatuation with the visages of Jagger and Richards blinded him from showing us the Rolling Stones. 'Shine a Light' is enjoyable for sure but suffers from a limited vision.".

Beyond that it was the Rolling Stones that won me over. Rocking songs incredible performances unbelievable energy and every one in the crowd dancing and singing the whole show. And these guys are in their sixties! Watching 'Shine a Light' on IMAX at times made me feel like I was actually at a live Stones concert but then I kept feeling that something key was missing. And it was.Martin Scorsese covered the two explosive shows at the Beacon Theater in New York with 18 cameras but he somehow missed getting the band. As expected lead singer and ringmaster Mick Jagger gets the most screen time with guitarist Keith Richards coming in a not too distant second. And then there's Ron Wood the second guitarist and some might argue the better soloist He has juicy moments on screen but is shockingly absent time and again when soloing the camera instead lingering on a prancing Jagger or posing Richards.And where is drummer Charlie Watts? Watching 'Shine a Light' one might think the Stones had backing tracks instead of a live drummer. Watts is the quiet one who doesn't dye his hair but he's the backbone of their sound keeping time holding it down while the boys jump around. I kept wanting to see shots of Watts not only for the variety of imagery and the visual reinforcement that there really is a live drummer hitting the cowbell on 'Honky Tonk Women' but also because he's an original Rolling Stone. Sadly there are only a handful of very brief clips featuring Watts and just as few wide shots of the whole band on stage. And Watts is not the only one nearly absent from the movie.Although the original members are Jagger Richards Watts and Wood Wood joined in 1974 so he's not actually an original Stone they tour with a number of key support musicians including bass player Daryl Jones who's worked with them since 1994 a keyboardist a horn section and three backup singers. However except for some brief interplay between Jagger and the backup singers the other musicians are absent from the film. It's not so unusual to relegate nonmember support players to minor roles in concert movies but to avoid them altogether is baffling and frustrating.The support musicians may not be Rolling Stones but they are a part of the band. They are playing the music and adding to the sights and sounds on stage. But 'Shine a Light' mostly kept them in the dark. This isn't how a real concert is experienced. In concert the other players are seen and often featured in the spotlight as soloists. But time and again in 'Shine a Light' we hear a piano riff a sax solo a horn section blast a bass run but we never actually see who's playing. We neither get full nor medium shots nor even closeups of hands playing. We don't even get quick cuts of the support players as one might see interspersed regularly throughout most filmed live concerts today. Instead we see lingering shots of Jagger and Richards sometimes so close you can see the brown behind Jagger's teeth while a saxophone or some other player wails somewhere offcamera. The Stones sound is some much more than guitar bass drums and vocals. A concert is so much more than the starring players but you don't get that from this film. It's as if the film makers had tin ears.This is baffling because they had 18camera shooting the action. So the film makers either didn't get the coverage or they decided in the editing room not to include the other players. Bad decision. This gives the movie the Stones concert experience a frustrating myopic feel. I kept wanting to see what I was hearing but couldn't. I kept wanting to get a visual of the focal point in the song and on stage but it was not delivered. Even one of the few times Jaggar plays harmonica is offcamera. This left me feeling shortchanged.Ultimately 'Shine a Light' is slightly claustrophobic with all its medium and close shots. It rarely opens up to show the entire band on stage. The film suffers as a result as wide shots would have provided much needed breathing room offering a more open perspective and also providing the myriad tight shots with context. We do see the interplay between Jagger and Richards or between Richards and Wood but we don't see the whole band working together as a unit. And ultimately that's what a live Stones show or any live rock show is all abouta group of individuals performing together as a band. Even if Scorsese decided that the film was all about the four Stones he could have easily divided the enormous screen into quads now and again so we could see the four Stones working their magic simultaneously in a multiscreen format. This is common place today and highly effective.It's baffling that with all the resources at hand and experience behind him Scorsese didn't quite deliver the goods. It's as if his infatuation with the visages of Jagger and Richards blinded him from showing us the Rolling Stones. 'Shine a Light' is enjoyable for sure but suffers from a limited vision.";

	schema:headline " The Rolling Stones are still rollin'";
	schema:reviewBody "The Rolling Stones are still rollin'.That is the primary message of Martin Scorsese's well crafted if conventional rock and roll movie 'Shine a Light' based on two concerts played at the Beacon Theater in New York City in late 2006. Mick Jagger was always considered a phenomenon the sexiest most hyperactive white soul dancer in the world. He's almost freakish now as exhilarating and kinetic at 62 as he was at 20. But 62!Mick has the same tiny butt and slim body and an astonishingly flat smooth stomach But he like Keith Richards and Ron Wood has the ravaged face of a Bowery bum. These Dorian Grays bear the marks of their dissipationor simply their intense livingin the visage. Only Charlie Watts the perennial Stones drummer just looks like an ordinary healthy old man. Four or five years ago Wood was downing a bottle and a half of vodka a day and smoking a pack and a half a day. Keith Richards' indulgences are legendary including his own claim later retracted that he once snorted up his father's ashes in a line of coke.Watts the drummer has always maintained a Buddhalike silence together with a Cheshire cat grin. Richards is notable for often kneeling on the stage and draping his wrist over a mike or one of his cohorts. Ron Wood is constantly mobile and smiling and has that standard aging rocker look big seventies mop of dyed or otherwise assisted hair ravaged face stickthin limbs. Mick of course is the front man of the band its voice its dynamo its flame. He has as many moves as Michael Jackson and you may wonder who influenced who of that pair.Ups and downs they have had and changes of personnel with Wood coming in after Mick Taylor who replaced the drowned Brian Jones left the band Daryl Jones replacing Bill Wyman as bassist and so on. But the Stones have an exceptionally solid history nonetheless with Keith Richards and Mick Jagger who met at the age of four or five in Kent still after 45 years together not only the creative center but the center of enthusiasm and joy of performance.The aggregation Scorsese records here is typically excellent. The Stones not only have an unrivaled set of songs but still deliver extremely classy musical backup as well as all the old style in their renditions. It's just hard to get on the stage as an equal with a band this tight and this strong. But since the newest song they do is from twentyfive years ago in the film the occasional fresh partner provides welcome variety. Success varies. The cute smiley Jack White is a charmer when he joins Mick with guitar and voice for Loving Cup but his performance is so good natured it's more a sweet singalong than the exciting duel it might have been. Christina Aguilera does a blistering rendition with Mick of Live with Me but she tries too hard and almost wails out of control. Best of these assistants not an assistant at all but a fully equal partner is the blues great Buddy Guy along for a song Mick says he first heard Muddy Waters perform Champagne  Reefer. That one is a true dueland it's astonishing to see the youth of Guy's face alongside the deep creases in Jagger's given that he's nine years older than Mick.As an album Shine a Light unquestionably works. It doesn't include all my faves but it does have exciting risktaking performances of Satisfaction and Sympathy for the Devil. not to mention All Down The Line Start Me Up Brown Sugar Shattered and Jumpin' Jack Flash Mick imparts all his old swagger to Some Girls and Tumbling Dice and makes As Tears Go By and Faraway Eyes touching and tongueincheek sincere. It's simply awesome that all these songs can still come across so intensely and musically but that's what being great performers and the greatest rock and roll band is about. Scorsese shows them up too close though and shows too many wrinkles.Scorsese used so many photographers and so much light it made the Stones nervous ahead of time. The result is technically impeccable but for a director who made the classic musical summing up 'The Last Waltz' and just recently the penetrating Dylan documentary 'No Direction Home' and for a band famously recorded in the shocking Maysle brothers 'Gimme Shelter' not to mention dozens of inventive song videos the tame technique used here is a bit disappointing. One thing that's missing is any long looks at members of the audience though glimpses show that they're of all ages. It doesn't add too much to have footage showing Marty's control freak nerves before the shoot he could never accept that he didn't know exactly what songs were coming and in what order nor is it hugely exciting to have Bill and Hillary present though they have to be because there they were and Bill said a few words to the crowd before the concert began. Not earthshaking either are a few clips of early Stones interviews though it's inevitable to show the one where Dick Cavett asks Mick at 24 if he can imagine doing concerts when he's sixty and he replies Yeah easily. Yeah. He was playing for laughs at the time but truer words were never spoken. There is a recording of the concert by itself including a few extra songs. I'd like to see the whole film again in IMAX. The sound system wasn't cranked up quite enough in the screening I saw. This is a remarkable experience. It confirms the excellence of the band. But to see them in their prime better the 1974 concert film Ladies and Gentlemen the Rolling Stones when Mick's face was smoother and his costumes more immodestthough that one is hard to come by.Are the Stones still getting their rocks off? Yeah easily. Yeah.".

	schema:reviewBody "Can you picture yourself doing this at the age of 60? Yeah sure. I thought that was the neatest line in this concertdocumentary when Mick Jagger gave an honest and prophetic answer to that question some 30 or more years ago maybe closer to 40!. We see that short interview here on this concert DVD.Not only Mick but Keith Richard Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood just keep going and going and going. None of that is any surprise to me as I own about a half dozen Stones concerts on DVD or VHS tape and this was entertaining as are all of their concerts. This film is 95 percent concert and five percent talk so those who think this is a documentary are going to be disappointed. The talk includes old interviews and an opening segment with the director trying to work with the group which as we see isn't easy. For those who want more documentary material check out the 16minute featurette which comes with the DVD. There is some great material on that reflections by a few of the guys some nice acoustic guitar work and a better chance to see what they guys are like in rehearsal.As far as this concert  held at the Beacon Theater in New York City  goes it's about average for the Stones. The 2003 concerts at NYC's Madison Square Garden and the earlier ones in London Berlin Turin and other places around the world seem more dynamic than this one because of the bigger stage and audience. At the smaller venue of the Beacon we couldn't enjoy the big props neon scoreboards the boys walking down the long aisle for a small set in the middle of the crowd Mick prancing down long sides of the stage etc. The prancing and all that is still here but it's in a confined area almost claustrophobic at times.It was fun here and there to see old clips of the band being interviewed when they were only in their second and third years of touring. You get an idea of the inane questions reporters have probably asked the rock group a thousand times over. The Stones especially drummer Charlie Watts don't exactly sound like Rhodes scholars either! Watts seems out of place too but  being the family man he is  that's always been the case. Everyone loves Charlie though and respects him  maybe because he is different from the rest.The beginning with film director Martin Scorcese was kind of strange. All it basically showed was his frustration in trying to get cooperation from the band regarding cameras and a set list and them basically doing what they want to do anyway. We also get a disgusting short scene with the band  I am not making this up  hugging and kissing the Mr. and Mrs. Clinton and the latter's mom. It just doesn't seem like part of the Stones' persona but I suppose they had little choice.I thought I would prefer to hear new material instead of the same oldsame old but as it turned out this twohour concert was best in the last 40 minutes when the band did the familiar upbeat songs. The concert seemed to come to life with Sympathy For The Devil and four or five other oldtime favorites. Earlier the electricity was missing on a bunch of the numbers that you don't usually hear. Maybe this would have had a much higher impact on me had I seen it in an IMAX theater instead of a TV on a small screen.There were sparks flying however when the three guests sang and played with the group. Jack White Buddy Guy and Christina Aguliera all brought life to the concert. Being a blues fan I liked Guy's number best. Buddy who really looked like he was having fun. Jagger and Guy traded lyrics about how much they enjoy smoking reefer and Guy put a plug in to get it legalized. Just out of curiosity I wonder how the Clintons reacted to that and some of the other lyrics in the song and the postsong introduction by Jagger of Buddy motherfking Guy! Odd that the fword was muted  in a Scorcese film!! Later on it wasn't. By the way on the featurette we get an explanation of why Jagger called him that.One of the strangest moments  and maybe the most real  was the closeup shot of drummer Charlie Watts yawning after one number and looking very tired and bored. Hey after all these years....he's entitled but it gave us a quick reminder just how old these guys are mid '60s. I don't think director Martin Scorcese whose slick cinematography in his films is fun to watch did these guys a favor in that regard. He makes them all look and sound as old as they really are and hey that's not the Stones. They jump around like 20yearolds. They'll go on forever right?".

	schema:reviewBody "Shine a Light displays thrillingly and with the bombastic POP of a revisited 'happy place' why many love the Rolling Stones and many love the style of Martin Scorsese. It's mostly a concert movie shot over a period of two mights at the Beacon theater as if doing a workhorse revival of thirty years ago while Scorsese was busy shooting New York New York in 76 and doing the Last Waltz concurrently this time he shot the concert while finishing up the Departed with some choice documentary footage interspersed in between some songs. On both fronts however minor the all archival interview footage is it's a big success visually and musically as good old rock and roll performance art well almost art but I like it and as visual virtuosity made incarnate.It might be easy to adulate the Stones as well as Scorsese. They've been around for so long doing what they do with each side rumored here and there to quit doing what they do for the Stones it's every tour much to their grinning bemusement and for Scorsese it was a point in the 80s when he thought he'd have to leave Hollywood and make documentaries on saints. They're always acclaimed usually big moneymakers and they've acquired a kind of netherregion between 'cult' audience and fullblown mainstream mayhem. It's this that is in a way the subtext for Shine a Light. While Scorsese stays mostly behind the scenes the Stones are up and front and in center of a marvelous performance and showcasing the energy and level of pizazz that quiets the naysayers. They sold out and it doesn't get to them a single bit.After some funny early footage of Scorsese shot usually in black and white DV by Albert Maysles who also appears here and there getting into a minor tizzy about what the setlist is going to be and getting some downtime with Bill Clinton the show starts up like any good Stones show should Jumpin' Jack Flash. Then onward come some given numbers Shattered Brown Sugar Tumbling Dice the masterpieces Sympathy for the Devil Loving Cup featuring an awesome Jack White and Champagne and Reefer with an equally awesome Buddy Guy and a lot of unexpected tracks too Live with Me with showy Aguilera As Tears go By some country song and a kickass She Was Hot. For fans it's an amazing mix and it allows for those who are just casual admirers to get their money's worth primarily in IMAX. This is not just because of the quality of the music and the performances which is at its best revelatory of what this band can do at any age but because of Scorsese's cameras moving around in epic and roving fashion edited with efficiency to not go all over the place or too slow and chiefly to make it intimate like how many remember the Last Waltz to be lots of neatly defined closeups lingering on to capture these hardened rockers.And at the end what is the point? Is it just another blahblah Stones concert movie? Not necessarily. It doesn't have the heavy sociological context of Gimme Shelter however it's not a little sloppy like Let's Spend the Night Together. Shine a Light celebrates its heroes but it doesn't go completely overboard. Scorsese knows as he did with Bob Dylan not to get too cocky with these fogies. It's important to throw in those bits with the Stones getting interviewed candid and without much overbearing ego present and by the end you know there's still a place for them firmly in the public consciousness.

	onyx:emotionText "Shine a Light displays thrillingly and with the bombastic POP of a revisited 'happy place' why many love the Rolling Stones and many love the style of Martin Scorsese. It's mostly a concert movie shot over a period of two mights at the Beacon theater as if doing a workhorse revival of thirty years ago while Scorsese was busy shooting New York New York in 76 and doing the Last Waltz concurrently this time he shot the concert while finishing up the Departed with some choice documentary footage interspersed in between some songs. On both fronts however minor the all archival interview footage is it's a big success visually and musically as good old rock and roll performance art well almost art but I like it and as visual virtuosity made incarnate.It might be easy to adulate the Stones as well as Scorsese. They've been around for so long doing what they do with each side rumored here and there to quit doing what they do for the Stones it's every tour much to their grinning bemusement and for Scorsese it was a point in the 80s when he thought he'd have to leave Hollywood and make documentaries on saints. They're always acclaimed usually big moneymakers and they've acquired a kind of netherregion between 'cult' audience and fullblown mainstream mayhem.

	schema:reviewBody "Scorsese has tried his best to recreate the glory of The Last Waltz but seems to have stumbled at the impossible how can you recreate or better what is arguably the best concert movie of all time? Quite simply you can't. The intro to this movie is as strange as its ending. There was obviously some sort of ruckus between Mick and Scorsese because the lack of backstage footage and constant arguments between the two regarding camera stage and setlists seemed to have set Scorsese on a I find it very hard to work with this diva twist on the movie.This seems to dissipate with the beginning of the actual concert. Maybe he's trying to tell us that Mick's divaesquire attitude and pointless demands fall apart and don't matter once they come onstage. It's all lost in the music.As far as camerawork is concerned this movie is well above most in terms of energy and fluidness regardless of the lack of rehearsals Martin seems to emphasise. The two cameras behind the front row of people give a great sense of being in the crowd looking up at Jagger and Richards.The gig itself is as good as any Bigger Bang tour I've seen. Anyone who has seen the Stones live in the past 5 years knows exactly what to expect and they don't disappoint in this show.Scorsese cuts to archive footage of the band being interviewed at certain times. As interesting as these are to see they seem to not fit as effectively as the cut scenes in The Last Waltz did. They almost seem separate to the rest of the film.The performances by Jack White and Buddy Guy are interesting. It seems like they appeared onstage unannounced and had no previous rehearsal with the band and just tried to play along. Especially for Buddy Guy. His usually inchperfect solos and licks seem rigid and refrained. Its as if he's waiting for cues from the Stones that never come. Christina Aguilaira's appearance proves she certainly has talent in her welltrained voice but seems like a strange cameo.All in all I'd say this is a pretty decent concert movie but nothing special in terms of movies in general. If you're a fan of the Stones you'll enjoy this but it won't shine any special light on the band themselves.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Rolling Stones was here for a concert not too long ago but since tickets were priced way out of my league there was no way I could have seen them in action live unless I opted for the cheapest of the lot and sat well away from the stage. So I got to thank Martin Scorsese for having design and capture some definitive moments from a Rolling Stones performance and share that stage magic the quartet provide when they're at their element on a celluloid screen captured for posterity.Make no mistake the entire movie is just like being there at a Rolling Stones concert only that you'll have to ensure the cinema hall has great sound system installed and you can't actually smell the sweat the rockers exude even though you get to go really up close and personal during their performance something which even the standingonly front row pit will not allow. You can even throw your hands up in the air only to irk those seated behind you unless they and everyone else are game enough to turn the sedate cinema atmosphere into a party one. So this review if I can call it one largely depends on whether you're a Stones fan to appreciate or for nonfans to want to give them a go to kick back relax if you can or just soak in the rollickingly wild atmosphere and immerse yourself into a Rolling Stones experience.More than 20 songs were performed if my mental counter serves me right and for a Rolling Stones fan you'll likely be satisfied them all for the price that you fork out. For a simple fleeting fan like me it's an eye ear? opener to a lot more of their music as well as an opportunity to watch them in action on the cheap. The first 10 minutes or so was the setup with Scorsese worrying and fussing over how to film the Stones in action and to want to have their set of songs as early as possible so that he could plan certain shots. But of course Mick Jagger and the gang got other ideas as they flit from performance to performance during their A Bigger Bang tour only to connect physically with Scorsese when they're at the designated performance stop at the Beacon theatre for the Clinton Foundation  where you'll get to see how big a fan Bill and Hillary are together with their 30 strong entourage.Interspersed throughout the concert performance are plenty of vignettes culled from past interviews spanning from the 60s which will bring on some laughter as you watch them with perfect hindsight. You will get to see how youthful all of them looked when they first started out and be amazed at their longevity in this business where bands come and go after making it to the top if at all. Despite being granddaddies Mick Jagger Keith Richards Ronnie Wood and Charlie Watts still look in great physical condition to be touring and strutting their stuff dishing out high energy high performance concerts with Watts even cheekily feinting tiredness at a point. In fact none of them thought earnestly thought back in their youths that they will sustain their popularity or would have reasons for it except perhaps Jagger himself who jested that he had dreamt about rocking the stage into his 60s.Shine a Light doesn't break any new cinematic ground even though it has cameras almost everywhere in a concert hall to capture every aspect and angle of the performing stage. In fact despite Scorsese making appearances in front of the camera his work behind it with all due respect could be replaced with any other director and the outcome would probably be more or less the same only because of the fact that it is a Rolling Stones concert with the band holding court from start to end. Would have been more of a blast to be able to see this in the IMAX version though.".

I thought this was one of the most embarrassing movies I have ever watched. Flat singing by Jagger in his usual exaggerated fake American accent was to be expected but the guy made no effort whatsoever to sing the melody of the songs or phrase the lyrics in any way that made the song recognizable. Ronnie Wood and Keith Richards sounded like they were playing in different bands and in a time of their own. Charlie Watts did a fair job of keeping time but after every song looked like he was going to pass out from the effort. I don't even know who is on bass these days but he seemed to be the only one in the front lineup displaying competence as a musician. The whole effect was like a very bad garage band backed by some excellent backing musicians. Without this large complement of additional helpers they would have sounded very very bad indeed. I was soon thinking that these guys had passed their sellby date by several decades and stank like a dead beached whale.One high point of the documentary was the historic footage that Scorcese cut in even if in retrospect it exposes them to be a group of vacuous wasters with nothing interesting to say. The very high point was a great performance by Buddy Guy showing the Stones up as a group of white boy wannabee pretenders. Jack White's duet with Jagger would have been better if Jagger had left him to sing alone.The Stones are like the Lou Gehrig of rock and roll. They go on playing long past when they should have retired making an embarrassing spectacle of themselves so they can set some kind of longevity record.".

The playlist is wonderful.Keith's dreamy smile as he plays exuding pure joy with his slow sexy gentleness is such a counterpoint to Mick's sharp clever edgy energy.I'd only seen the Stones on videos where Mick seemed to be a caricature of himself. Now I realize without the adoration and energy of an audience he is not inspired to receive and give that energy which is not unlike Janis Joplin's  totally out there and free  just diggin' in and groovin'. Yet you know he is in complete control.Shine A Light will probably be nominated for an academy award for film editing. It is genius. Hundreds of intimate shots that define a picture is worth a thousand words  Keith's caressing smile as he plays or tosses a cigarette  Mick's lips and nose in silhouette  Ron Woods looking like he's still in Faces the list is endless and meaningful to each individual fan. Scorceses' use of the cameras is inspired  absolutely the best.If you love the Stones you will writhe with energy and joy and want to jump up and shout  Start Me Up!".

	schema:reviewBody "Shine a Light 2008  out of 4 You could argue that Martin Scorsese is the greatest director in the history of cinema and you could also argue that The Rolling Stones are the greatest rock 'n roll band in history so the two giants teaming up for a movie is a tricky move. A lot of times when two giants team up the results are disappointing but that's certainly not the case here. This concert film is without a doubt the most beautiful one I've ever seen and certainly the best directed. There's no doubt in my mind that Scorsese has taken the concert film and created something so incredibly that I'd compare it to how Dylan changed music history with Highway 61 Revisited.As for the concert The Stones need no defending and they deliver a terrific performance here which was recorded over two shows at the Beacon Theatre in NYC. The guys get off to a feverish pace with a rocking 'Jumpin Jack Flash' followed with a neat version of 'Shattered'. The majority of the show has lesser known tunes and these here are certainly the highlight of the film. The cover of 'Just My Imagination' has the Stones making that song all their own. The legend Buddy Guy joins the band for an incredibly spirited version of the Muddy Waters' tune 'Champagne  Reefer'. 'Some Girls' features Jaggers really having fun on stage and the country based 'Faraway Eyes' really packs a punch. 'As Tears Go By' described by Jagger as a song they were originally embarrassed by turns into a magical moment. The second half of the show features the big hits like 'Start Me Up' 'Brown Sugar' 'Sympathy for the Devil' and 'Satisfaction'. The entire concert is full of terrific energy as Richards is constantly smiling and even does two songs himself including a sharp version of 'You Got the Silver'. The group is really rocking throughout the thing and Jagger doesn't slow down as he's constantly dancing spinning and working up the crowd. Not to mention feeling up on Christina Aguilera during 'Live With Me'.On the technical side of things this movie makes every other concert films look cheap and generic. Even without the music this thing is pure beauty as Scorsese really knows how to edit all the action together and his direction of the cameras is something really mind blowing. Just look at the 'Champagne  Reefer segment which is a rocking blues number and see how Scorsese captures the mood and spirit of the song. The heavier songs like 'Start Me up' are also perfectly captured. I'm really not sure I can put into words how incredible this whole thing looked on the IMAX screen. You get so up close and personal with the band that you can see spit flying from Jaggers mouth and notice every bit of perspiration pouring off the group. The stage settings add for some great visuals which really jump off the screen. At times I really forgot I was watching a movie as it felt like I was really there at the concert. After the songs would finish and the crowd would cheer I had to stop myself a couple times from cheering because that's how much I forgot I was watching a movie. The opening of the concert features a camera move that I won't spoil here but it ranks right up there among Scorsese's greatest and probably falls just behind that famous scene in Goodfellas.The first ten minutes of the movie shows all the preshow stuff including Scorsese trying to get the group to deliver a set list so that he can determine how he wants to film everything. The eventual set list doesn't show up until minutes before the show so you can imagine how Scorsese was pulling his hair out. We also get a great closing scene with the band leaving the stage which was great to see because I always wondered what they were doing as they left the stage. Vintage interview clips are also sprinkled throughout the film including one from when the band was just out for two years and Jaggers is asked how much longer they could keep doing this. He's reply is that they have at least one more year in them. Forty years later we get this film which shows why Scorsese and The Stones are legends and this film perfectly captures the greatness of both artist.".

You call yourself a patriot well I think you're full of sht.Both are recent songs by the Rolling Stones. A 1960s rock and roll group. Band members are now in their sixties.Verse 2 is from an antiBush song called Sweet Neo Con. An interesting point from which to start a movie perhaps. Veteran director Scorsese even chooses a concert at which democrat Bill Clinton is in attendance. But the song even though part of the tour is missing. This film has no hidden agenda or meaning. Sweetness and Light. Shine a Light.If you are a current fan of the Stones such details matter little. This is a concert film at the New York Beacon Theatre to die for. Production values are far better than any comparable TV live event. A concert to enjoy in surround sound in a comfortable theatre with every detail up close on a big screen or even IMAX. Not a film about lyrics. Not a documentary of these extraordinary long careers. Just a big brilliant concert.It rather feels as if the Stones hired the best filmmaker in the business. Who in turn hires the best cinematographers. Who in turn capture every dramatic gesture. Every Mick Jagger mince. Every crowdpleasing wave. Each impressive guitar riff. Each colourful stage contrast. Each theatrical burst of light. Everything. Except film fans may struggle and ask But isn't this supposed to be a Martin Scorsese film?When Scorsese did Bob Dylan No Direction Home his achievement was in the insights into a complex man. His film resolved the eternal conflict between Dylan's public personas. Shine a Light on the other hand offers no such insight into the stars concerned beyond the current state of their stage performance impressive though it is.There are some nice cinematic touches. It is fun watching Scorsese in front of the camera in the opening scenes. He worries about getting a specific playlist so he knows whether to be ready for a guitar solo or singer acrobatics. It helps us understand the complexity of filming a live event. The question of the band's age instead of being disguised is cleverly made a feature. Scorsese intersperses Beacon Theatre sets with vintage black and white footage of frequent interview questions relating to age. Can you imagine doing this when you're 60? and so on. I wince. I had qualms about watching these pensioners prance about on stage. A fan of their early music I instinctively feel rock stars should die or at least retire before they get old. But blues singers look cool old. Why not the Rolling Stones? Keith Richards looks positively cadaverous. A Munster with a mean guitar. And the Rolling Stones are considered chic both by baby boomers and trendy young welltodos. Long gone are the days when buying a Stones album was an act of defiance. But in spite of the unused Neo Con lyrics and Jagger's single use of the f word in the whole concert fans seem more concerned that Richards actually smokes a cigarette. A girl in the audience points disapprovingly. The Stones are mainstream. Bill Clinton hails their green credentials. Everyone is loveydovey. Much of the concert features impressive showmanship and a high level of professionalism. Jagger never misses a note. The guitarwork is beautiful. And as a role model for pensioners Jagger's routine is more energetic than any step class. But where was the angst? The blinding energy that seared itself into the brains of the 60s youth? This was a very a different band. I try to forget the old one. I enjoy the toothless new more than I like to admit.Shine a Light is a time capsule. The latter years of the most famous rock and roll band in the world. A great British institution preserved for posterity. It releases the day after Gordon Brown's jovial and equally polished teleappeal on American Idol. New Labour. New Stones.Wellchosen guest artists spring into sets. Jack White produces a perfect blend of young and old as he duets with Jagger. Christina Aguilera looks stunning in high heels and tights. How could she not fire up the old man? Jagger hugs her bum as they dance to Live With Me. He has new fire in him as he continues with Start Me Up. By the time he sings Brown Sugar there is a passion to it. The audience wave and cheer in time. When Satisfaction ricochets through the hall it is like watching the legend. The Mick Jagger of old. I'm almost a convert.Would it be cynical to say Sympathy for the Devil looked more like a BornAgain pageant? Unappreciative perhaps. The film lover in me would rather have JeanLuc Godard's film of that title for a sense of the 'real' Rolling Stones. But why should audiences dictate that pop stars  or film directors for that matter  conform to expectation? Accept Shine a Light for the awesome concert film that it is. Miserable old sentimentalists go back to your vinyl. Your 'creative' cinema. There's not much of it here.".

Keith Richards and Ron Wood spend the evening looking at their fingers and Keith forgets the words to multiple songs. Charlie Watts was awesome though. Mick just looks silly and old prancing around stage and you can see him CLEARLY reading a teleprompter watch as he looks down and to stage right. They definitely benefit from the stadiumarena experience where you can't notice these things. Buddy Guy shows up and blows them out of the water showing how growing old and still rocking SHOULD be. Vintage clips sprinkled between the performances remind you that at one time they were cheeky dynamic and relevant. Those days have passed.

As a concert it was mostly Mick Jagger prancing around the stage rather than a Rolling Stones concert. Just because it was made by an Oscar winner doesn't make this film a winner too! Keith Richard said in the movie that neither he nor Ron Wood are good guitarists on their own but together there are just like 10 good ones. This is exactly what Scorsese missed in this movie. The Rolling Stones are not just about Mick Jagger and reducing the rest to a supporting role. None of the Stones had a good solo career but as a group they are second to none. Yet Scorsese missed that point entirely!".

	schema:reviewBody "The Good the film is staged shot lit and visually edited extremely well Mick Jagger has emerged from his tunnel of selfparody and carries the film on his energetic old man shoulders his voice as strong and as accurate as ever his lithe little body defying all the rules that apply to most sixtyplus year old bodies they don't play any of the crap music they've written in the past few decades sticking to oldies and standards.The Bad the Rolling Stones suck as a rock and roll band now a guitar driven rock and roll band that is Keith Richards is mesmerizing in a What is that thing? kind of way but as a guitar player nope. The unfriendly way to put it would be to say he's lost his chops or has forgotten how to play all the riffs that made him one of the greatest rock songwriters of all time. The friendly way to put it would be to say he doesn't know the difference between what he feels and what he playsall the riffs and rhythms circulate through his bloodstream perfectly but the technology doesn't exist to send them through the sound reproduction system so all we get is what pulses to his finger tipsall we hear is his accompaniment to his inner self. His approximations to the riffs of Tumblin' Dice and Brown Sugar are almost forgivable but his butchering of Start Me Up is not.Ronnie Wood. He may be a fine guitar player but he doesn't play well with others. It's as if he doesn't listen to or hear what other members of the band are doing. A couple of the film's highlights are the two songs Keith sings featuring Ronnie as the sole guitarist. He plays great acoustic slide guitar on You Got the Silver and rocks well on Connection. Throw him into the mix and he plays junk. As soon as you want to excuse either Keith or Ronnie because they are old Buddy Guy seventyplus years old comes on stage and makes clear what it sounds like when the first thing a good guitar player does is listen to what other people in the band are doing.The Beautiful Mick singing As Tears Go By accompanied by Keith on 12string acoustic. Perfect.The Truly Bizarre with the caveat that I watched and listened to this film on a standard television set so I don't know what the Dolby 5.1 sounds like the audio mixing practice of boosting the sound level of the performer in the visual edit down to single notes sometimes sounds ridiculous. Luckily Mick was the visual focus of most of the film his vocals out front and clear.The Big Disappointment Lovin' Cup sans piano. Terrible.The best parts of the film and by that I mean the best songs in the film are the minimal simpler ones. It's too bad there aren't enough of them. Mick Jagger can channel himself channeling himself all night long he can be doubleplusgood but he doesn't have a band behind him any more. By showcasing the band's relationship to its music as product delivered to an audience an audience of handpicked paid extras that also includes Bill and Hilary Clinton Scorsese doesn't shine a light or bring any new insight to the Rolling Stones in this film.More reviews at sitenoiseatthemovies.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "Shine A Light emits a seemingly spontaneous spectrum of light on a band that never seems to tire and as well on a director who never rests on the laurels of his amazing directorial accomplishments.Some of the previous comments aggravate me as a musician a longtime fan of the Rolling Stones and as a lover of Scorsese documentaries and films.This film is a brilliant wellconceived though highly adaptive encapsulation of a wonderful twonight event at the historic Beacon Theater in NYC. The cinematography is quintessentially Scorsesedriven in it's brilliant camera angles and behindthestage banter that gives light to the reality behind the show. Some critics have said that there is not enough attention given to Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood. Ironically in the same criticism this reviewer makes a point of saying that Ronnie Wood is not even an original Rolling Stone. And I'm sorry if I am off base here but Ron Wood has been the rhythm guitarist for the Stones for almost 25 years. So if over a 14 of a century of performance and collaboration with one of the best rock and roll bands in history doesn't make you a bona fide Stone then what does? Without giving away any spoilers the movie is replete with amazing crowd favorites stellar guest performances songrarities that most people who have not seen a plethora of Stones shows will never witness. And ontopofitall there is the crisp brilliant portrayal of a brief twonight moment in rock history captured by Martin Scorsese. No other director can combine the 'intimacy' and the 'epic' quite like Scorsese. But of course this amazing directorial achievement could not have materialized without the charm and talent of the Rolling Stones. The Stones in the end is what we are all after. This is a musthave for any lover of the Rolling Stones andor brilliant musical documentaries.Enough said? Watch and Enjoy.Mike Oliveri moliveri80gmail.com".

	schema:headline " SHINE A LIGHT Martin Scorsese 2008 12";
	schema:reviewBody "This is actually the fifth Rolling Stones performance film Ive watched after SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL 1968 directed by JeanLuc Godard! THE STONES IN THE PARK 1969 GIMME SHELTER 1970 and AT THE MAX 1991 GIMME SHELTER is still tops since it captures The Stones and Rock Music at their pinnacle of achievement and controversy  so that Scorseses film emerges as a celebration of the groups unassailable musical heritage and undeniable live showmanship.Given the fact that the director had used their music on his films soundtracks as early as MEAN STREETS 1973 its curious to say the least that it took him 35 years to capture them for posterity. However in spite of the fact that both documentarist and subjects have aged considerably in the interim the end result shows that they clearly are still at the very top of their respective game as this is undoubtedly one of the most exhilarating concert films on record. Of course Scorsese already had two rockumentaries to his name Id watched his chronicle of The Bands legendary 1976 allstar farewell concert THE LAST WALTZ 1978  to which there is a subtle nod here when Ronnie Wood and Keith Richards are shown playing pool in the films opening sequence  but not his recent documentation of Bob Dylans early phase in NO DIRECTION HOME 2005 which alas wasnt released locally. Still on the strength of this Im even more eager now to catch it nowbut since as far as I can tell its not even available for rental on DVD that wont be happening any time soon! The Stones also demonstrate that their antiestablishment stance has not mellowed with age since in spite of his acknowledged reputation both as a filmmaker and chronicler of music they definitely do not make it easy for Scorsese and his troupe to capture their act much less let him run their show at his convenience! In fact the opening 10 minutes of the film sees the motormouth director driven to distraction by the Stones evasion in coming up with a complete set list for the upcoming concerts  part of their current A Bigger Bang tour although no songs from that latest studio album are to be found here  so that he can carefully line up his shots in time and eventually they only budge literally seconds before the start of the show which Scorsese feverishly scrutinizes! Once one gets past the hurdle of the improbable vision of a pensionable craggyfaced guy jumping up and down on a stage and acting horny Mick Jaggers enormously kinetic and charismatic performance is a real standout. Guest stars include Bill and Hilary Clinton Bruce Willis appearing for a couple of seconds in the audience bluesman Buddy Guy coperforming a Blues standard Champagne and Reefer in one of the films highlights rocker Jack White duetting with Mick and Keith on Loving Cup and popstar Christina Aguilera surprisingly effective on Live With Me. Although the concert includes a handful of their trademark tunes  As Tears Go By I Cant Get No Satisfcation Jumpin Jack Flash Sympathy for The Devil Brown Sugar and Start Me Up  they chose to mostly highlight two benchmark albums of the 1970s  3 songs from Exile On Main Street 1972 and 4 from Some Girls 1978 the title of the film incidentally also comes from a song off Exile but which is only partially heard in its album version over the end credits.Bafflingly enough Scorsese decided to augment his concert footage with archival material like TV interviews and news reports on their occasional drug busts which apart from two relevant snippets about their prospective durability I didnt think really belonged here particularly when spliced straight into the middle of one of Keith Richards two songs one splitscreen interview shows Mick and Keiths different responses to the same questions  the former is pragmatic and honest but the latter largely evades the issues but does so with impish humor! Incidentally witnessing the bulky cameras gliding over the audiences heads a few times towards the end it was appropriate that Scorsese would amusingly have Mick Jaggers objection of that fact be the very last thing we hear on the soundtrack after the end credits have rolled the latter are led into by the films single most staggering shot as Scorsese personally instructs the camera operator to take it up from the marquee of the event all the way to a panoramic view of New York City! The film was dedicated to Atlantic Record executive Ahmet Ertegun which stems from the fact that he died from a head injury sustained in a backstage fall on the opening night of the concerts recorded here! For the record Id watched exStones bassist Bill Wyman perform at the Jim Capaldi memorial concert in London in January 2007 furthermore I was practically all set to go see the Stones live at Londons Wembley Arena in 1997 when the concert was postponed due to Keith Richards accident at his home in which he fractured his ribs!".

	schema:reviewBody "Haw! Bill Clinton handshaking the Stones. Hillary is there too. Cut to Bill and Hillary holding hands as they walk across the stage. It's a back shot low beagle high angle. Scorsese doing the Stones! Wow. He did the blues. He did Dylan and now the Stones. The man knows his music I mean on top of being the best film director alive. And this time it's a concert at a relatively small venue of the Beacon Theatre as the boys play in New Yawk City for a Clinton charity.The band starts with Jumpin' Jack Flash' and baby it's a gas gas gas. Mick moves like he's half his age. Probably has something to do with running six miles a day. Keith is a bit slow and wiry cracking a sly smile. Old Charlie's good as usual and Ronnie slides on his guitar like a coke bottle down a ten mile incline. The band looks like it has weathered many a 'crossfire hurricane'you can see it in their now craggy faces especially when Scorsese directs a cut to clips of those smooth innocent devil may care faces of the past. Shattered is next. Mick sings to New York To live in this town you must be tough tough tough tough tough. Rats on the West Side bedbugs uptown.... And the crowd is loving it although with the exception of some of the band's back up one from Brooklyn a lusty lady the other a guy from from Queens and the third a fellow from South Africa they've probably never had an existential taste of Big Apple tough. It's all part of the Stones' conscious irony singing laughing smiling as the charity crowd rock 'n roars its approval.She was hot comes up next. And the swaying women in the front rows nearest the stage all hot look up.....mmmm delicious...and this is followed by a rip snorting All Down the Line. Then another from one that classic albumn Exile on Mainstreet. Hey this albumn was blaring over the loudspeakers last at the Fremantle Blues and Roots Festival. It's a duet this time with Jack White III. Sir Mick and Jack White III sing Loving Cup a veiled bluesy kind of reference to a certain part of the female anatomy. Well done Jack the Third.

As Tears Go By with a very pretty guitar played by Keith Mick on vocals.Okay so you get the picture. No you oughta go see the picture. One thing more though Champagne  Reefer. YES! Now here's a piece which Mick says he first heard Muddy Waters do. Geez oh peezo. What a great song! And who's on stage with the band this time? Buddy mofo Guy! Duets with Keith and Ronnie's guitar playing and Mick on the Mississippi saxophone. Sweet. And the lyrics will tear you up.".

	onyx:emotionText "Haw! Bill Clinton handshaking the Stones. Hillary is there too. Cut to Bill and Hillary holding hands as they walk across the stage. It's a back shot low beagle high angle. Scorsese doing the Stones! Wow. He did the blues. He did Dylan and now the Stones. The man knows his music I mean on top of being the best film director alive. And this time it's a concert at a relatively small venue of the Beacon Theatre as the boys play in New Yawk City for a Clinton charity.The band starts with Jumpin' Jack Flash' and baby it's a gas gas gas. Mick moves like he's half his age. Probably has something to do with running six miles a day. Keith is a bit slow and wiry cracking a sly smile. Old Charlie's good as usual and Ronnie slides on his guitar like a coke bottle down a ten mile incline. The band looks like it has weathered many a 'crossfire hurricane'you can see it in their now craggy faces especially when Scorsese directs a cut to clips of those smooth innocent devil may care faces of the past. Shattered is next. Mick sings to New York To live in this town you must be tough tough tough tough tough. Rats on the West Side bedbugs uptown.... And the crowd is loving it although with the exception of some of the band's back up one from Brooklyn a lusty lady the other a guy from from Queens and the third a fellow from South Africa they've probably never had an existential taste of Big Apple tough. It's all part of the Stones' conscious irony singing laughing smiling as the charity crowd rock 'n roars its approval.She was hot comes up next. And the swaying women in the front rows nearest the stage all hot look up.....mmmm delicious...and this is followed by a rip snorting All Down the Line. Then another from one that classic albumn Exile on Mainstreet. Hey this albumn was blaring over the loudspeakers last at the Fremantle Blues and Roots Festival. It's a duet this time with Jack White III. Sir Mick and Jack White III sing Loving Cup a veiled bluesy kind of reference to a certain part of the female anatomy. Well done Jack the Third. Ah then Marianne Faithful. Wish she'd been there. Mick makes a reference to how this was one of the first songs which the Stones wrote and then gave away to Ms. Faithful. As Tears Go By with a very pretty guitar played by Keith Mick on vocals.Okay so you get the picture. No you oughta go see the picture. One thing more though Champagne  Reefer. YES!

That's the end result in this fantastic concert film capturing the venerable rock statesmen and legendary bad boys The Rolling Stones performing for a 2nite benefit concert in 2006 for a charity event organized by President Bill Clinton which happens to fall on his 60th birthday too boot! at NYC's landmark venue The Beacon Theatre. And on hand to document the intimate rockin' event is noneotherthan Manhattan's own movie magician Martin Scorsese with all his trademark flair and care into every thing he commits to celluloid and it doesn't hurt that he's lensed at least one bonafide rockudrama The Band's swan song THE LAST WALTZ.What begins in a stark black and white opening with the band needling Marty about not letting him know the set list until the last second has the asthmatic auteur practically scrambling for his inhaler yet with all the hooha Scorsese and his troop of 18 premier cinematographers manage to get every possibly conceived angle with razorsharp snap and precision you'd never know he was on pinsandneedles at the 13th hour.The Stones may not be aging gracefully  witness their wizened leathery visage  but do not be fooled like a fine vintage they have ripened from the sweetest fruits of their labor and prove to be a force to be reckoned with. Led by the indefatigable front man and icon Mick Jagger impossibly strawthin and suggesting a hip Dorian Grey with his portrait somewhere in the attic laughing its head off  shimmies shakes and gets his snakehipped insouciance with energy to spare kicks the jams out with a nonstop Energizer Bunny kineticism that only sparks his onstage mates to full groove effect. Staid yet strong to a fault drummer Charlie Watts keeping the beat goodtimeCharlie Ronnie Wood on guitar having a laugh and a supporting line up of background singers horns men and bass. But it is legendary axeman Keith Richards looking like The Crypt Keeper with his madman's grimace and Pirates of the Caribbean lan that makes the whole affair a hoot and he knows he's the king bee as he addresses his buzzing hive. The hits are all covered from Jumpin' Jack Flash to Shattered to Sympathy for the Devil to natch Satisfaction and three musical guest appearances by Jack White on Loving Cup Christina Aguilera bumpingandgrinding with Mick to Live With Me and living legend Buddy Guy on Muddy Waters' Champagne and Reefer there's something for everyone that is if you're a dire hard Stones fan and who isn't?!Scorsese may seem to be doing a yeoman's job but he knows what to give his and their fans and delivers the goods and the band smartly choosing one of the more intimate premiere NYC stages makes for a shrewd tried and true night to remember. Filmed in IMAX I chose to see this  NYC's fabled last movie palace  The Ziegfeld  and it justifiably shows these giants larger than life as the aforementioned format would as well. It may be only rock and roll but I like it!!".

The film makers really should have gone for straight comedy.I needed a good laugh.  I've been getting a little burnedout at the job having some girl trouble and the whole week's just kinda sucked.  This puppy just sorta jumped in my hand at the video store so I bought the damn thing.  I paid a wopping 2 for it and now it's forever stuck in my library of bmovies.Here's the plot.  This guy I can't even remember his name has been having the sick disturbing dreams and he thinks that if he calls up a bunch of his idiot friends and drags them to his dead grandparents' former home then he will somehow find the meaning of life or some stupid thing like that.   It turns out that the place is like a gate to hell or something like that and a bunch of demons who sound like a broken toyshow up and start killing everybody.Yep it's that stupid but funny as hell to watch.  Talk about some funny scenes.  The two magician guys who look an awful lot like a poor man's Sigfread and Roy cracked me up.  I loved their mullets and there is something a little homoerotic about the way they interact with one another. am I the only one who noticed that? Of course one of them is a kungfu expert and he does kick a mean empty beercan.  I also liked the one overbearing boyfriend who kept saying that's why I keep her around. That was a howler.  I found the old man at the gas station quite hilarious. His warning  had me on the floor wallowing in laughter I'm sure if someone had walked in my room they would have thought I was having some sort of convulsions.  Just his there was BLOOD EVERYWHERE!!! makes me giggle when I think about it.The gore effects are pretty decent.  The zombies look like they just finished smearing a jar of vaseline on their faces and regurgitated that big bowl of oatmeal they had for breakfast.  Oh yeah  did I mention that their voices all sound like the lead singer of Cannibal Corpse with a slight electronic edge?Well  I hope at least one person out there enjoys this work of art as much as I did.  It takes raw talent and skill to make a film this funny.  I really hope to meet the director some day.  I'd also like to meet the guy who says that's why I keep her around.  That guy really cracked me up and I cracked open a beer simultaneously with his death scene.  It's a shame the magicalambiguous duo didn't stick around too long.  They were the coolest ones in the group.Well I'm done reviewing this beauty.  I'd just like to give a SPECIAL THANKS to the writers for coming up with that line that's why I keep her around the director for steering this whole thing in the right direction the guys with the mullets their hairstylists and the old man who gets to say there was BLOOD all over the floors all over the walls there was BLOOD EVERYWHERE.  I'd also like to thank that one girl who got killed in Slaughterhouse.  She's almost as talented as the old man and I'd like to see her in more stuff like this.  She can fake a scream and die with the best of 'em.One more thing  Lou Diamond Phillips is listed in the credits but If he was in it I must have missed him.  Hmmm maybe he was ducking behind a tree or hiding in the fake fog.".

Corey's father and several other members of his family met with horrible fates in an old farmhouse where they lived. Guided by visions and a burning curiosity Corey decides to go to the abandoned farm along with a pack of friends to investigate. Upon arrival an old man who says that he was a witness to very gruesome happenings at the old farmhouse tells them that the place is cursed and that the Devil himself is said to possess the land. The old man advises turning back and forgetting the whole thing but Corey insists that his fate lies within the old house.Of course things get bad from there onward. Without spoiling too much they encounter demon hordes magic spells phantom fog and a lot of them die very horrible deaths. The film's atmosphere is very dark and chilling especially the first half. The makeup and gore effects are really great and bring to mind movies like Night of the Demons and The Evil Dead. The film is not without its flaws though. The special camera effects are really cheap and schlocky. The script is pretty stupid at times more so in the second half. And there are plot holes aplenty.I had a great time with it though. Taken at face value this cheap flick is pretty entertaining. If you are a fan of stuff like the Evil Dead movies or Hellraiser I would recommend you check it out.".

Even though a local warns the kids not to travel there they do it anyways and sure enough they unlock the secrets which includes demons.Charles Philip Moore's DEMON WIND is a rather interesting horror movie that has a lot of good things about it but also some bad things that really keeps it from being better. Going back to the 1970s there have been countless movies about people going onto sacred ground and having to battle a variety of evils. The evils here are some demons with a connection to Satan and whenever the movie is focused on them it's quite entertaining.The biggest issue with this film is the fact that it runs way too long. At 97minutes the film really do seem to last at least fifteenminutes too long and it also didn't help that there were a lot of slow moments. The pacing is another issue as it just moves way too slow and this isn't helped by the extended running time. In all honesty this here was the biggest issue I had with the film and sadly it brings down the good moments.Where the film does succeed is with its makeup and costume design. I've seen a lot of low budget movies in my life but there really aren't too many out there that contain as good of costumes as this film does. I was really impressed with the look of the demons and we're also given some pretty good bits of blood and gore as the demons rip into people. The makeup team certainly deserves a lot of credit for their work here and it's what keeps the film entertaining.The performances are also decent for this type of production and best of all is that the cast at least make for some good characters to keep you interested in them. DEMON WIND isn't a complete success due to the issues I mentioned but if you're a fan of the genre then it's worth watching.".

Demon Wind has the formula for a goodbad horror movie  stupid characters  clunky dialogue  dreadful acting  and some of the most awful special effects that will have you laughing on the floor. But the problems with Demon Wind is it takes out some necessary goodies..like the occasional gratuitious nudity..only one nude scene that last about 10 seconds..we had 3 female characters..and none of them were shown nude..and also.NO GORE..sure there were some little small splurts here and there..but what makes the zombiedemon style horror movies work is the repulsive gore..the producers shouldn't have gone for an R rated feature..since this was obviously going to be direct to video when it was released in 1990..they should have gone for Unrated..because the R rated violence..is too tame for your average zombiedemon horror fan. Demon Wind also moves at a very slow pace...the action is restrained..and it's interrupted by clunky dialogue when there could be demon dismemberment. But I did like this film for it's efforts  and it does have some enjoyable moments..and the demon voices were especially neat..so check this out anyway if you can find it..but don't expect too much explicit scenes usually found in films of this genre6.510".

	schema:reviewBody "The best description I can find in my head for this film is a mix of Fulci and the Evil Dead but a movie that makes way less sense. Yes a film with less sense of plot than The Beyond and none of the aspiration toward art. And yet there's so much to like!In 1931 we see a body burned on a cross in the front yard. There's another in the hallway and plenty of paintings of Jesus as we hear singing about being washed in the blood of the lamp. We discover that a woman and her husband are trying to hide from demons. Instead the husband transforms into a demon and kills her.Fast forward to 1991 and Cory is dealing with the suicide of his father. He's the grandson of the people we saw in the opening and has decided to go back to the farmhouse where they died. Often in these posts I try and give advice. Here's a new piece if your family has a weird supernatural death or disappearance in its history just leave it alone. Don't go back to the cabin. Don't go into the woods. Don't go to the farmhouse. Just don't.He puts together a gang of his friends to hang out at the farmhouse but of course a fog rolls in. And some demons. And lots of death. The farmhouse has a shield that keeps the demons out but one by one the teens are turned into demons. Luckily they find some daggers that can kill the demons. Unluckily the demon's master arrives and they need to do much more to defeat him.That said where you'd expect things to make sense Demon Wind goes in a much stranger direction. Like when Cory mentions he has been in a gas station before in a dream we get to see that dream  in which he's holding a big book while talking to his grandmother. Naked. Buck ass naked.Also the kids in these films have weird interconnected relationships. Like Cory's girlfriend Elaine used to date his best friend Dell. He greets her by kissing her directly on the lips and then high fives Cory. As you do. Dell's new girlfriend Terry has an exboyfriend named Chuck who brings his girlfriend Stacy his magic tricks and an arsenal of roundhouse kicks. I can only imagine that if these kids all worked in a mall together they'd all have sex in the same room like Chopping Mall. Only Jack and Bonnie seem like they aren't Eskimo brothers or sisters with someone else.Despite warnings from old creepy men at gas stations  hello Friday the 13th  and dead bodies and evil statements in blood on the walls everyone acts like things are as normal as possible. It's not just wooden acting. It's literally like nothing phases these kids.Bonnie reads the words off the wall a Now Satan shall walk in Latin  and an explosive chicken shoots out of the oven and almost kills everyone. You read that one right. An explosive chicken. Somehow Bonnie instinctively knows how this all works and has one request when she dies please don't bury her here.Also  The Fog or the fog covers the town making sure that every escape attempt brings them right back to the farmhouse. And then three little girls take Bonnie who disappears leaving behind a burning baby doll.Everyone decides that they will stay in the farmhouse for protection. Whereas in a film like Night of the Living Dead you'd batten down the hatches and board up the windows these kids clean the house. Yes in the face of certain death the first thing they decide to do is some spring cleaning.Then another couple just randomly shows up! Demon Wind doesn't just go off the rails. It throws the rails off a cliff and follows them into the abyss.The final act of this film just gets more and more bizarre. There's gunplay. Demons feel up women and trying to get them off just by touching their breasts. Cow skulls eat faces. A female demon strips in the front yard begging for the guys to come out and have sex at which point they look at one another and say Demon like this is some demented Bud Lite commercial. And oh yeah  Cory transforms into a demon himself to battle the final boss.There's some decent gore. Some horrible acting. And no relation to the normal world in which you live and breathe. I often joke that there are some films that I just won't recommend to normal people. Demon Wind is one of those films. But to my friends that I trust to those that can effortlessly deal with trifling concerns like plot motivation or dealing with multiple dream sequences I'll give this a recommendation.".

The farmhouse has a shield that keeps the demons out but one by one the teens are turned into demons. Luckily they find some daggers that can kill the demons. Unluckily the demon's master arrives and they need to do much more to defeat him.That said where you'd expect things to make sense Demon Wind goes in a much stranger direction. Like when Cory mentions he has been in a gas station before in a dream we get to see that dream  in which he's holding a big book while talking to his grandmother. Naked. Buck ass naked.Also the kids in these films have weird interconnected relationships. Like Cory's girlfriend Elaine used to date his best friend Dell. He greets her by kissing her directly on the lips and then high fives Cory. As you do. Dell's new girlfriend Terry has an exboyfriend named Chuck who brings his girlfriend Stacy his magic tricks and an arsenal of roundhouse kicks. I can only imagine that if these kids all worked in a mall together they'd all have sex in the same room like Chopping Mall. Only Jack and Bonnie seem like they aren't Eskimo brothers or sisters with someone else.Despite warnings from old creepy men at gas stations  hello Friday the 13th  and dead bodies and evil statements in blood on the walls everyone acts like things are as normal as possible. It's not just wooden acting. It's literally like nothing phases these kids.Bonnie reads the words off the wall a Now Satan shall walk in Latin  and an explosive chicken shoots out of the oven and almost kills everyone. You read that one right. An explosive chicken. Somehow Bonnie instinctively knows how this all works and has one request when she dies please don't bury her here.Also  The Fog or the fog covers the town making sure that every escape attempt brings them right back to the farmhouse. And then three little girls take Bonnie who disappears leaving behind a burning baby doll.Everyone decides that they will stay in the farmhouse for protection. Whereas in a film like Night of the Living Dead you'd batten down the hatches and board up the windows these kids clean the house. Yes in the face of certain death the first thing they decide to do is some spring cleaning.Then another couple just randomly shows up! Demon Wind doesn't just go off the rails. It throws the rails off a cliff and follows them into the abyss.The final act of this film just gets more and more bizarre. There's gunplay. Demons feel up women and trying to get them off just by touching their breasts. Cow skulls eat faces. A female demon strips in the front yard begging for the guys to come out and have sex at which point they look at one another and say Demon like this is some demented Bud Lite commercial. And oh yeah  Cory transforms into a demon himself to battle the final boss.There's some decent gore. Some horrible acting. And no relation to the normal world in which you live and breathe. I often joke that there are some films that I just won't recommend to normal people. Demon Wind is one of those films. But to my friends that I trust to those that can effortlessly deal with trifling concerns like plot motivation or dealing with multiple dream sequences I'll give this a recommendation.";

The story is pretty much nonexistent and involves a group of young people revealing the horrible secrets of one of the groups' ancestors. Apparently his grandparents used to live in a devilworshiping neighborhood and evil in the form of demons and fog still dwells around there. But I got to hand it to this film.from start to finish it breathes morbidity! The diabolical undertones the playful gore and the relatively decent acting all together make this film raise high above the mainstream uninspired 80's slashers for sure. It shows some creativity and guts literally where other productions from this decade fall into routine and oblivion more easily. This creators clearly got inspired by the success of the Evil Dead' and perhaps even Lamberto Bava's Demons but what the heck! It's fun and made with lots of enthusiasm. Although.this film does have a pretty high what the f' standard at times. Especially near the end when flashbacks and laser shows are happily being mixed.

I enjoy this film it has everything one would love in a horror movie from this time frame practical special effects cheesy gore oozing slimy demons. The few problems I have with Demon Wind are that the scenes of violence and action are few and far between I find myself getting pretty bored waiting for the next instance of horror. The movie does have some pretty hilarious instances though that make me flash back to the horror comedy movies of the 80's and that helps this movie extremely that being said it is no where near as good as some of those 1980's greats.For it technically being a 90's horror movie which for me is an immediate turn off being that I think that particular decade was weak for the genre this is a fun Bmovie that almost any horror fan would love and the 90's would have been much better if other films would have followed in this movies footsteps.Demon Wind has an 80's vibe to it that is awesome and even with its Evil Dead rip offs it's a fun watch.

If you need some more characters to kill off just have them drive up and arrive midmovie with no explanation and the director also borrows heavily from The Evil Dead  The dialog and acting is wooden. The make up and special effects are actually really good though.. makes for a highly watchable  entertaining bad movie experienceWeaknesses I would have liked to have seen more gore and violence.. It is a little too tame for my tastes. Full Disclosure the movie is in color but I watched in Black and White and I loved it.. because that's the way i like it".

My friends and I first discovered this ... thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friend's house. It was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies we unfortunately picked this one. Well during the 90 minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up. The thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word. It's just a cheap poorly done ripoff of Evil Dead. The whole story seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting demons rip them to pieces. I have a bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed. I've seen bad horror movies before Manos Troll 2 HOBGOBLINS!!! shudder I would have to say that Demon Wind could definitely contend with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity. Watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid films.Fun fact This film is like a cockroach on steroids! Much like the ouija board every time we try to get rid of it it always seems to mysteriously reappear. Kind of scary huh?".

The story is so unintelligible that the viewer has no where to look for answers least of all the characters.  Lets talk about the characters....wow!  I never thought the parade of friends going to the small farmhouse out in the middle of nowhere would end.  First it starts out with eight...all fairly banal..then after a few die..low and behold two more friends join the proceedings.  None of them is anything more than onedimensional..and when characters die..the others just move on and act as nothing important has really happened.  The first girl to die is the funniest scene in the whole movie...unintentionally to be sure.  Demon Wind is not the worse horror film I have ever seen...but its a long way from being good.

It strives to be like the great High School comedies of the past like American Pie but in the end it falls flat on it's face without even starting. The jokes are far and few. And it seemed like the only people that would laugh at them are 12 year olds. But in a theater full of high school students not much comedy in the film is found amusing.First off the movie deals with stereotypes that most high school don't have anymore. there are the villainous jocks the wannabe gangstas the goths that seem to always be on school grounds after dark and there are the guys who want to prove to the jocks that they are not all that. The movie tries capture realistic high school but stereotypes stops that from ever happening. The first scene in the film made me lose all hope that this would be a somewhat good flick. A steroid infested jock drives on top of another person's car with his truck after having his parking stolen. Which is totally stupid and unbelievable.The actors either overacted or did not act at all. The lead characters looked like they were reading from cue cards the entire time. And the secondary characters acted like they were in a lead role because the timing of their face reactions and emotions were way off. for instance the guy who hosted the party had his eyebrows move in all directions anytime the camera was on him which again stole any realism from the film. Also there was the guy who was suppose to play a huge wrestling team captain but his end result was the Incredible Hulk on crack.To make matters worse the deeds themselves end up to be totally retarded. One of them is to steal a corpse from the morgue and put it in the middle of the field. Another was to steal an expensive car. What person in the right mind would do stupid things like this. Because in the end the cops are going to find out that he committed these crimes for the sheer fact that you name is going to be plastered everywhere around the school the next day. The movie leaves you with more questions than answers. and believe me there are NO answers for this movie. The end is completely stupid for the fact that the mob somehow gets involved and blows the entire movie out of proportion.One ad campaign for this film read that it was American Pie on Speed Ans it is true it is American Pie on speed crack and every other drug and the end result is one hangover of a film. The movie gets lost in it's own concept that I could find no one who enjoyed this movie.MY RATING F".

Dirty Deeds is called an American Pie like comedy but comes absolutely NOWHERE NEAR CLOSE to American Pie.A bunch of high school seniors come together as one brave senior attempts to complete every dirty deed as per tradition requests. Some of which include ejaculating into bread stealing a car OMG these kids are bad to the bone and finding the only other grad to complete the deeds. The film is revolved around this plot and many MANY unnecessary subplots which it could have easily gone without.First off the subplots are completely unnecessary and add absolutely nothing to the story. One of which involves a freshman wanting to get with an attractive senior girl but fails then go figure gets with her! Sweet lord I didn't think it would happen! No no no in Dirty Deeds ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE! EVEN STEALING A CAR WORTH MORE THAN 100000 AND HAVING THE GUY WHO ACTUALLY OWNS IT NOT CARE THAT THE KID STOLE IT! The acting was horrible. Through another subplot we watch Zach try to get with Meg and she keeps pushing him away because she wants to protect her brother who she thinks Zach is turning into a bad kid. Then at the end we see Meg actually has feelings for Zach WHAT A SURPRISE. Clich love subplot in a teen comedy? Oh you better believe it! What a joke. What a joke of a movie. I sat through this and couldn't wait for it to be over I'd rather watch paint dry or snow melt. Anything is more entertaining than this garbage.010. I wish IMDb had a lower rating system.".

No place is closed. except for the morgue. even the hotel bar is open and people are flooding through. now at 4am..

I usually only see that kind of garbage on download.com but I guess marketing hacks are everywhere...Watching this reminded me of rubbernecking at the seen of a car accident. Its sad and tragic to behold and you feel really bad for the people involved but its hard to look away.It's obvious this movie was sold and funded without anyone actually having read the script if it even exists at the time. Its porky's meets Amercian Pie meets Ferris Beuller...yeah that sounds sellable cut the check. The script is REALLY REALLY bad. It seems like the 'writers' weren't even trying. Giant plot holes characters with zero humanitydepth a complete lack humor nothing novelinteresting and perpetually cringe inducing dialog. They cant even get the clichd character archetypes right.Then there is the casting. I hate watching 30somethings pretending to be teens they don't 'act' like teens because these corpses cant act. Although watching the lead struggle with his Bell's palsy drooping mouth on one side of the face is interesting. And speaking of droopy there is 8 seconds of tittie shots in this movie. The photography is just nasty. Ugly locations psspoor lighting bad framing inconsistent color palette etc etc. The DoP should really hope no one notices his name or watches this on HD.There are a couple of highlights on the DVD though. In the bonus features you get to see the actors lying through their teeth about how much they loved this project and you get to see Charles Durning explain why he took the role. Why did I choose this role? Well when I was younger I remember asking Henry Fonda how he chose his roles. He said 'I take whatever is offered and I don't ask questions'. Thats what I do. Hey at least he is honest.Anyway the people who made this film should be unemployed. There are so many talented people and great projects desperately searching for funding its a travesty that this thing was give millions and found shelf space at my DVD shop.".

My favorite part of the movie is when an explosion happens if you watch carefully you can see a fire start then get completely put out by unknown forces and explode into flames one more time. The most brilliant and deeply developed character in this film is the Biff like character who has lines like mmm blood i cant wait to taste his blood.  and ...please don't yell at me mommy.

She had been quite respectable in Butterflies Are Free in 1972 but she turned in a beautifully nuanced performance in this one.I would certainly argue with any notion that this film is underrated. It's always been well regarded even back in the days when Spielberg was known as the clever kid who made Jaws. That doesn't mean it has ever been easy to see.Now with the passage of time Sugarland Express looks even better than it did in the 1970's.

	schema:reviewBody "Before Jaws propelled Steven Spielberg to the moon he was a television director often on episodes of Columbo and Night Gallery. Then came Duel his taut experimental feat of man vs. man in machines thriller that made him notable if not bankable in the Hollywood eye. His first theatrical release The Sugarland Express is to me still one of his ten best maybe not top five but up there. Along with his screenwriters whom would all go to win at Cannes Spielberg brings a true story with a sense of the tragic realism but also the sense of adventure and fun that goes into Spielberg's most entertaining films. There's usually a sense of excitement but one can sense this is not the kind of story that will end up as the main characters think.Goldie Hawn as pretty as she is dramatic and chippy and William Atheron later impressionable in Ghostbusters very much so here are a husband and wife the husband is in jail at the start of the film and Hawn breaks him out with little trouble. They have a custody battle literally going on with their son who is away at a home. They have to go through Texas aka the 'Sugarland Express' but it won't be easy. Soon there's a pursuit across the state as the couple becomes rather famous in their simple pursuit of getting the one they love. Hawn and Atherton play off each other well and Spielberg even at his young age as a director here gets very good performances out of them especially out of Atherton who has a kind of urgent tense but focused way about him throughout. Hawn here isn't totally in the kind of mode like in her vehicle comedies she's playing the worried mother as determined as her husband but her performance still contains a kind of naivet that's crucial to the character.And in full widescreen glory Spielberg flexes his technical chops to a full capacity. He doesn't make the film as a thriller like with Duel but it still drives suspense on in its road movie way. There are a couple of shots that are done for the first time see trivia to great effect and there is a scene in a small town I still remember very well due to the amount of people that are in it and how Spielberg directs this wonderfully. In some ways this is like one of those Lifetime movies crossed with Smokey and the Bandit only played more for realism there's something very interesting that we don't get to see much with the son he's always in a world of his own inside the house as the situation builds on the outside.This all builds up to an ending that some have said doesn't work or like with some of Spielberg's other films War of the Worlds for example is too abrupt. I found that it worked just as well as with the opening scenes. It's realistic at least for the period and its important to remember this is based on a true story and in these establishing and closing scenes the audience gets the real meat of the story Catch Me if You Can did this too though in a different way and then in the middle some of the more dramatized parts come in. It wasn't a smash success on its first release but it made enough of an impression with its win at Cannes and its writers guild nomination ironically it was nominated for Best Comedy to get Spielberg his next gig which ended up being the real test of his career. As a nifty tale of overly concerned parents ontherun its really very impressive.".

	schema:reviewBody "Haven't heard about Sugarland Express till recently and I had to see it because it was vintage Spielberg and I'm a fan.  And I wanted to see the young Goldie Hawn.  I was not disappointed.  It was one of these roadchase movies bigger than life but it was unique especially because it was based on a true story.  That fact made me incredulous throughout the film but everything in Texas is supposed to be bigger than life.Goldie desperately wants to get her baby back.  She was in jail for some minor crimes and was found to be an unfit mother and her baby was put in a foster home and the foster parents were going to adopt him.  Despite being a young girl or maybe because of it she was desperate to have her baby back. It was a lovechild and the motherlove was passionate and obsessive.  Hawn played the part to the hilt and used her sexuality and femininity to overcome the objections of her husband who was in a prerelease facility with low security.She had a plan to help him escape but he didn't want to risk it take a chance of being caught and being incarcerated again.  He only had four more months to serve.  The other inmates were incredulous as they disguised themselves and got an old couple to give them a ride.From this quiet beginning the film proceeded to repeated crescendos of drama and excitement.  Try to imagine the young couple young officer in tow leading a chase of police cars first a few then a few dozen then many dozen and ultimately hundreds lawenforcement officers from all over the state and then snipers and a helicopter.Lucky for the young couple an oldhand cop realized they were just a couple of kids and he staved off snipers with telescopic longrange rifles and a couple of vigilante gunnuts.You know something bad is going to happen at the end because these kids didn't know what they were doing they were madly in love and in a fantasyland of getting their little boy back and living happily ever after in Mexico.  Something bad happened but something good happened.  It will be worth your while to see this little classic from one of the greatest directors of the 20th century.".

	schema:headline " Early Spielberg is just as fun as any Spielberg";
	schema:reviewBody "There's something so incredibly fascinating about watching the humble beginnings of a director as renowned as Stephen Spielberg. The Sugarland Express is one of his earliest films and it is not of the calibre of films like Jaws Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the Indiana Jones franchise but it still remarkably entertaining. It tells the story of two lovers who go on a mad run from the law in order to kidnap their son from his foster parents. LouJean played by Goldie Hawn breaks her husband Clovis out of jail in order to do so and this sparks mad paranoia in the two. The run from the law doesn't occur until the two kidnap a policeman and his vehicle forcing him to drive them to Sugarland Texas in order to find their baby boy. This is a wild exciting often hilarious film and to top it all off it's based on a true story.I think what defines this film more than anything is the distinct new Spielberg smell. It has all of the things we recognize from the bigger Spielberg films just on a much smaller scale. The dialogue flows so naturally and fits right in with the action and camera work of the film. There are lots of familiar camera techniques in the film especially the fluid camera movement that goes on within the confines of the police vehicle where a lot of the film takes place. Nothing is as grand and widespread as Spielberg's classics but anyone who respects the genius can respect this film for what it is because like it or not this is where it all began.But not only is The Sugarland Express a fascinating look into how Spielberg got his start it is also just an incredibly fun film. Goldie Hawn plays the border line psychopath mother perfectly. She wants nothing more than to see her baby boy again and she won't let anything stop her. The film hits both ends of the spectrum very nicely. A lot of it is very comedic ranging from cleverly hilarious to downright goofy at times. Yet there are also moments of sincere dramatic tension. Through all of the offbeat wackiness the film never forgets the situation it is dealing with. Despite everything it is still two convicts running from the law a subject that the characters must handle with care. And the film brings this to light very well as it is very gripping at moments and almost touching at others.The Sugarland Express isn't much more than a very exciting adventure story with some enticing moments of drama thrown in but you have to love it for that. It doesn't try to be much more and it pulls off everything it wants to deliver with a lot of talented finesse and grace. This is not a film to miss. It's only mistake was coming right before Jaws a masterpiece that overshadowed it greatly hence why we know that name but few of us have heard of the pleasant little gem that is The Sugarland Express.".

I'm surprised most Spielberg fans turn their noses up at this movie it's one of his best. The finale doesn't really work the picture switches gears too many times and eventually leaves us eating dust but Goldie Hawn's performance is brave and funny and wonderful. In fact all the acting is excellent right down to the last twoline player.  from ";

The small budget does not stop Spielberg of making a good movie. This movie was also the first Vilmos ZsigmondSteven Spielberg collaboration. They later worked together on Close Encounters of the Third Kind. But more importantly it also was the first collaboration of John Williams and Steven Spielberg one of the most successful collaborations in movie history as later turned out.the movie features a young Goldie Hawn and William Atherton who I really like as an actor. Atherton is probably best known for his role in Die Hard 1  2 Ghostbusters and the more recent movie The Last Samurai in which he has a small part early in the movie.It might be a bit too slow and probably boring for some people but I still recommend this movie. It has both action and substance. In a way also a must see because it was Spielberg his first real big hit and can be regarded as his breakthrough.810httpbobafett1138.blogspot.com".

	schema:reviewBody "I wasn't sure what to expect from this film. Fellow fans of Steven Spielberg advised me to see Sugarland Express so I bought the DVD. I'm glad I did it as it is one of Spielberg's best. He should have made films more along the lines of Duel Jaws and the above film. Being based upon a true story is a Feather in the films cap. The two main characters  played by Goldie Hawn and William Atherton  are very sympathetic in spite of their circumstances. She is planning to find their baby boy so they can be reunited. He is a convict serving a light sentence. They both help his breaking out of jail and after taking a police officer hostage they lead the police of Texas on a state wide chase. The wife and her convict husband race against time so they can find their son. This has thoughtful moments and it isn't a hard hitting film. There is some violence but it's fairly mild and minimal. The pace is good and the tension is sustained throughout. Ben Johnson does well as one of the senior police officers who leads the Dragnet. He is a tough man but he isn't totally lacking in compassion. The direction is some of the best from Steven Spielberg.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first theatrical feature by Spielberg his last as just another director before Jaws this story is saddled by what I call an 'idiot's resolve' plot. This means the main characters behave like complete idiots and in real life wouldn't get two steps in the direction they're going much less the miles of roadway managed in this pic. But  and this is an important point  the story is supposedly based on a real life incident which means such theorizing may not apply here. It all depends on how much Spielberg and the writers exaggerated events which I tend to think was quite a bit. The story is jumpstarted in that a 2year old baby is placed in foster care the real parents Hawn  Atherton smalltime criminals won't have it and break the father's incarceration to set out for the foster home. But from the outset these two are presented as such obvious losers I was hoping they'd never reach the kid. The father for example has only 4 months remaining of postprison time to do in short order the idiot couple's transgressions escalate from auto theft to kidnapping of a cop Sacks. In essence they quickly sabotaged any chance for themselves of getting the kid back in a happy fashion.I also got the impression Spielberg was poking a lot of fun at Texas and Texacans in general where this takes place. Besides the two idiotic socalled parents most everyone else is also presented as a buffoon a country hick with no clue. The more sinister examples are those who live for the opportunity to shoot someone  this is gun country after all. The only one who escapes with his dignity intact is the police captain well played by Ben Johnson. There are traces of the imagery and poignancy which many of Spielberg's later pictures would be laced with. There's the absurdity of that long very long line of police vehicles lights flashing following that one car with the fugitives I guess no other crimes needed attention in the county that day?. And the sudden look on Atherton's face when he watches a Road Runner cartoon is amazing. But these are a few instances far and between in an ambling picture. Hawn is immensely likable of course but in the end she comes off as an idiotic screaming shrew who directly causes bad stuff to happen. Maybe it's just me but I don't really like women such as this. But then if this is truetolife Spielberg captured some sense of an unpleasant reality we have no control over. It just didn't retain such a consistency through the entire movie.".

The one thing that I almost made was White Lightning the Burt Reynolds picture Spielberg said I spent twoandahalf months on the film met Burt once found most of the locations and began to cast the movie until I realized it wasn't something that I wanted to do for a first film. I didn't want to start my career as a hardhat journeyman director. I wanted to do something that was a little more personal. Reynolds was hurt by him quitting saying  He wanted out and it really hurt me I felt like he just didn't want to work with me and that was the reason. And he didn't.Shot in perfect continuity for financial reasons The majority of this movie is filmed in a car. But there was no rear view projection or shoot it and then have the actors lipsync later. Spielberg's timing was just right Panavision inc had recently developed and the Paraflex the first totally noiseless camera compact enough to be handheld or shoulder rested. Virtually the entire movie was shot in sync dialogue with only 10 lines a looped later. The Sugerland Expressis one of the first fiims to be shot in this then revolutionary style though shortly all filmmaking would follow suit.This movie shows that Goldie Hawn could have been a fine dramatic actress had her career gone in that direction. Hawn's plan slightly mad as it is in fact does have an inner logic. I expected her infedelity She prostitutes herself to a male neighbour for 65 to become a bigger issue. But it's surprisingly dropped pretty quickly. There is no villain in this movie. Captain Tanner certainly isn't one. I also like a tender scene involving a Wile E. Coyote cartoon which was probably my favourite scene in the movie. This film marked the beginning of Spielberg's friendship with John Williams and we get a Spielberg trademark images seen in a side mirror This is one of the few Steven Spielberg films that ends on a downbeat note. And boy what a downbeat note it is!! Sugerland Express grossed 7.5 million against a 3 million dollar budget at the domestic box office.".

	schema:headline " New Hollywood style Steven Spielberg";
	schema:reviewBody "The Sugarland Express is most famous these days for being the first theatrical feature film from the soontobemassive directorial wonder kid Steven Spielberg. It's by no means his first significant film as he had already directed another earlier road movie namely the seminal TV movie Duel 1971. But this was the first time that he had went beyond working for the TV studios and made a feature directly for cinema release. Despite receiving good notices it flopped on release though. And because it fell in between the critical and commercial hits Duel and of course Jaws 1975 it seems to have been kind of forgotten to a certain extent. Given this director's subsequent fame I find it quite surprising how relatively obscure The Sugarland Express actually is especially considering that it's actually a very good film.Seemingly based on real events it focuses on a young outlaw couple who organise a jailbreak and then kidnap a police officer who attempts to apprehend them. They then drive over to Sugarland Texas to try and take back their child who has been given to foster parents on account of the authorities regarding these natural parents as being unsurprisingly unfit.What makes this one stand out quite a bit is that it is clearly a product of the New Hollywood. These American movies were directorled challenging works that were released predominantly in the 70's. This one's downbeat plot elements and lack of moral certainties marks it out as a clear example of this kind of thing. It also falls into a subcategory of New Hollywood movie namely a loversontherun film. Films such as Bonnie and Clyde 1967 and Badlands 1973 were of this ilk and this one is another clear example. Maybe the public had begun to grow tired of this type of road movie by 1974 and this meant the film didn't do such good business at the box office. It's difficult to say but whatever the case this is a fine example of this kind of thing. Goldie Hawn and William Atherton play the young criminals and do so very well with Michael Sacks also impressive as the police officer they capture. Interestingly the film goes a little against type by portraying the police captain who chases them in a very sympathetic manner. Usually these types of movies are very antiauthoritarian and antipolice but not so in this case which adds a bit of extra depth in some ways because it's not spelt out to the audience who they should root for. Spielberg himself has went on the record to say that he believes the police to be the heroes in this film with the main bad guys actually being the citizens who cheer the criminals on as part of the media circus generated by the televised nature of the case.This is a very fine film from Spielberg and in my view one of his actual best. It shows that in the days before he was so powerful that he could pick and choose his projects he had to interpret material that wasn't necessarily 100 aligned to his sensibilities and also had to do so on a lower budget. I think the effect of this was that he was forced to utilise his obvious talent in a more lean and economical fashion while in directing material further removed from his naturally more syrupy and sentimental disposition resulted in tougher and less morally certain films. With The Sugarland Express we get the best of both worlds.".

Maybe the public had begun to grow tired of this type of road movie by 1974 and this meant the film didn't do such good business at the box office. It's difficult to say but whatever the case this is a fine example of this kind of thing. Goldie Hawn and William Atherton play the young criminals and do so very well with Michael Sacks also impressive as the police officer they capture. Interestingly the film goes a little against type by portraying the police captain who chases them in a very sympathetic manner. Usually these types of movies are very antiauthoritarian and antipolice but not so in this case which adds a bit of extra depth in some ways because it's not spelt out to the audience who they should root for. Spielberg himself has went on the record to say that he believes the police to be the heroes in this film with the main bad guys actually being the citizens who cheer the criminals on as part of the media circus generated by the televised nature of the case.This is a very fine film from Spielberg and in my view one of his actual best. It shows that in the days before he was so powerful that he could pick and choose his projects he had to interpret material that wasn't necessarily 100 aligned to his sensibilities and also had to do so on a lower budget. I think the effect of this was that he was forced to utilise his obvious talent in a more lean and economical fashion while in directing material further removed from his naturally more syrupy and sentimental disposition resulted in tougher and less morally certain films. With The Sugarland Express we get the best of both worlds.";

There might not be as much of Goldies skin in this one compared to some films but there are several sequences which do use her figure to great advantage. The 2nd major asset is Ben Johnson.

Spielberg knew he had a winner in this film and he worked hard in getting a star like  Goldie Hawn to agree to be in the movie and thus convincing the executives to let him go ahead.At heart this is a story about a mother's love for her son and to what extent she is willing to go to get him back from the same system that saw her unfit to raise him. Lou Ann might have done things in her past to land her in jail but her heart is in the right place and if she has to fight in order to get the toddler back she will do whatever is in her power.The prison escape is hysterical. Clovis can't believe what Lou Ann makes him do. The film become a road picture when the old couple agrees to give them a ride. When they're stopped for going so slow in the highway Lou Ann decides to take matters into her own hands. Later on she overpowers the patrolman Slide and they embark in an adventure of great proportions.The carnival that follows them is created by the media that follows the trio on the road. It's incredible to think of the caravan of police cars that followed them and were unable to do anything to arrest them. Captain Tanner knows his fight against the fugitives will come to nothing because the press has made the couple into popular figures on a quest for justice.Goldie Hawn is the best asset on the film. She doesn't have her usual mannerisms as she plays a straight Lou Ann. William Atherton is equally excellent as Clovis. Michael Sacks and Ben Johnson contribute to the film tremendously.This is a classic Spielberg.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw The Sugarland Express for the first time about six months ago. I can't believe I've never heard of this movie before then. It had everything you could hope for in a movie. Excellent story good acting and great directing by Steven Spielberg. The story is about a young woman named Lou Jean Goldie Hawn who has lost custody or her baby son because of her criminal record. She decides the only way she can get him back is to get her husband and take her baby son away from his foster parents. Unfortunately her husband Clovis William Atherton still has four months of his own prison sentence left to serve. Lou Jean visits him at the Prerelease Center he is serving his time in and threatens him with divorce if he doesn't leave with her. He reluctantly agrees and escapes. Actually he just walks out  the place has the worst security. From then on the two only have bad luck. The older couple they hitch a ride with get stopped by Highway Patrol Officer Slide Michael Sacks. Lou Jean and Clovis then steal the older couple's car wreck the car and kidnap Officer Slide and force him to drive them to Sugarland where their son is living. The remainder of the film chronicles what happens to them on their trip. How the media transforms them into a cause clbre and how the police have to not only deal with the fugitives but with the media and the public which has rallied behind the couple. The movie also deals with the changing relationship between Clovis Lou Jean and Office Slide. As Lou Jean Goldie Hawn brings a heartfelt and sympathetic performance to the role of a women who refuses to see the futility of her actions and is blinded by her desire to get her son back at any cost. This is definitely one of her best performances and shows what she can do with a part that demands a range of emotions. It was a real surprise to see William Atherton as a good guy and not as a pompous jerk or villain. I will always remember him as the idiot inspector in Ghostbusters. Atherton did a good job of letting you see that Clovis did whatever Lou Jean said not because he was weakwilled but because he really loved Lou Jean and didn't want to lose her. Michael Sacks gave dimension to a character which in lesser hands might have come across as your basic bythebook cop. Over the course of the movie you see the gradual change in Officer Slide as he is torn between his duty as an officer and his desire to help the couple get their son. It's a mystery to me why I've never seen Michael Sacks in anything I can remember  he was very impressive in this.Spielberg's direction gives you a real feel for the expansive Texas countryside which contrasts with the fact that for most of the movie these characters are confined in cars. Spielberg uses everything at his disposal to highlight and backdrop his story  the sunsets the open Texas highway and local color are all used to optimum effect. Not a surprise he went on to become as successful as he did.Overall  A must see.".

	schema:headline " Maybe not the very best film Spielberg has ever made but it's not too far below his best";
	schema:reviewBody "Steven Spielberg's debut theatrical feature probably his least well known 4000 IMDb votes compared to say 20000 for his madeforTV Duel and easily his most undervalued picture. Goldie Hawn stars as an excon just recently released from jail. She visits her husband William Atherton perhaps best known as the EPA official from Ghostbusters in a minimum security prison. He has four months to go but Hawn wants to bust him out so he can help her retrieve their baby who has been taken by child protective services. The actual escape is easy but it only takes a short while for the cops to find them. Eventually they capture one as a hostage Michael Sacks who played Billy Pilgrim in George Roy Hill's adaptation of Slaughterhouse Five and end up driving down the highway with a couple hundred police cars following them. Their poorly conceived plan is to keep a gun on Sacks while they go through it all hoping that they can nab their son and take him down to Mexico. Thankfully the guy leading the chase John Ford regular Ben Johnson knows they aren't bad people just misguided. I'm glad Spielberg didn't go after the more clich route of the redneck sheriff the story takes place in Texas and Johnson is particularly fantastic in the film in fact all four of the main actors are excellent. This being Spielberg I was sure the two antiheroes would get out of it somehow. I didn't see much hope in this situation but I thought he might cleverly find a way out of it. Well he doesn't. It's very much a '70s flick with its downbeat ending. That in particular makes it fairly unique among Spielberg's films. It's perfectly directed. Much like with his work in Duel Spielberg already shows that he's a naturalborn director. The cinematography is among the best in his filmography. It was shot by Vilmos Zsigmond. This was also the first Spielberg film scored by John Williams.".

Ruthless and daring he was  and  though his soul was black with foul deeds  he feared no creature  living or dead . Because he had an iron claw for a right hand  this terror of the Ocean lanes was known as The Hook . Bob Hope is Sylvester the Great  a conceited actor  the man of seven faces . He is a vaudvillian who falls for a gorgeous princess Virginia Mayo  both of whom being pursued by a nasty hooked pirate Victor McLagen and a governor Victor Slezak . Hope posing as a woman in order to escape  being saved by an old pirate Walter Brennan. The Hook and his hoodlums Mike Mazurki  Hugo Haas  Marc Lawrence set out in pursuit Sylvester . They look for a valuable treasure and on the run Hope disguises as a gypsy . Meanwhile  Hope attempting to save the princess from being abducted . Hope and Mayo flee and find themselves surrounded by pirates . Later on  they go to the inn called Bucket of Blood. Deciding to head back to treasure island . This is an original and entertaining swashbuckler comedy  spoofing numerous pirate situations and including a wonderful song titled Kiss me in the moonlight. The film is a Bob Hope recital  he stooges  makes acrobatics  tongue twister and puts faces and grimaces . It's a pretty amusing farce with the master comic and he displays splendidly his portentous skills . Bob Hope show with his particular talent as a great comic about an issue of mistaken identities  maps  hidden treasures and many other things . This is one of Bob's early Technicolor entries  being spectacularly photographed by Victor Milner and William Snyder . Available digitally remastered stereo with original film trailer . This one Hope played on loan from Paramount to the great producer Samuel Goldwyn . Samuel Goldwyn paid Paramount 133500 to borrow Bob Hope for twelve weeks. During that time Hope made this film and They got me covered. The Screen Guild Theater broadcast a 30 minute radio adaptation of the movie on March 26 1945 with Bob Hope and Virginia Mayo reprising their film roles . Of course  at the end of the movie appears a famous guest star  Big Crosby  in a closing cameo performed . Bob Hope  Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour on their crazies starred the known series about The Road To.. these are the following  The road to Singapur this one started it all  Road to Hong Kong The Road to Lebanon The Road to Morocco  The Road to Rio The road to Zanzibar The road to Utopia . The princess and the pirate results to be as funny as some the other Road movies  it's a great entertainment and fun . The motion picture was well directed by David Butler . Picture is a vehicle Bob Hope  he's an authentic comic and real Farceur . If you like Hope's crazy interpretation  in which he manages charm and humor  you will most definitely enjoy this one  it's really a great amusement .".

Walter Brennan plays an addled old pirate who's not quite as dumb as he lets everyone think he is and he and McLaglen compete with Hope for laughs.The only one who looks like he's enjoying himself but playing it very straight is crooked island governor Walter Slezak. He's got a working arrangement with McLaglen but the two of them aren't above a little double cross.Of course this is a Bob Hope movie and Hope manages to blunder his way through to survival. But as we learn he loses Mayo right at the end to a visiting bit player from Paramount. Hope did make good on his word he never did do another film for Goldwyn again. I guess he wanted to go out on a high note and The Princess and the Pirate is as high a comic note as Bob Hope ever struck in any of his films. Not to be missed by his legion of fans.".

The Technicolor was smashing the lovely ladies i.e. The Goldwyn Girls were delightful the script sparkled with wonderful humor and the plot not only made some sense but was wonderful escapist entertainment since we were then in the throes of World War II. I can't but agree with the previous comments about the great comedic humor we had then. Today's brand of humor is not only tasteless but also vulgar and senseless. Bob Hope was a master and remained such through much of his active career. Sam Goldwyn's production standards were impeccable and the movie was a thorough joy. My summation is that people could laugh back then and had the natural intelligence to get sophisticated intelligent comedy.".

It's certainly fast enough. Everyone seems to be running around bellowing and there are explosions and multiple sword fights and a few minutes of romance. But it's not funny for the same reason that Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd isn't funny anymore. It's a child's idea of comedy in that it lacks any sophistication. I don't mean to be supercilious but kids laugh at things that don't demand much of them. Somebody takes a pratfall and a fifthgrader laughs. Kids don't need to know anything other than what they see happening on the screen.What made the Road movies so funny was that there were pauses so that the audience could take a breath while Bing Crosby crooned a silly tune to Dorothy Lamour. And Hope and Crosby were constantly trying to outwit each other in ways both shameless and sly. When they had a friendly embrace and picked each other's pockets at the same time we could identify with them or at least with their desires. There was somebody for a grown up to ROOT for on the screen.The Road team had a different set of writers  Panama and Frank  and they were better at giving Hope gags than the writers of The Princess and the Pirate. Hope is given a couple of anachronistic wisecracks  made in Japan eh?  but they don't save the day because the rest of the movie propels us at warp speed through the ludicrous plot. One of the more amusing scenes is a minor ripoff from the Marx Brothers' Duck Soup. What's missing is the easy banter between Hope and Crosby the more delicate touches provided for them. Delicate here being a relative term. Hope on his own could be hilarious as he was in They Got Me Covered. Danny Kaye was making movies in this period that were just as funny and like Hope he always played the same character but it was a different character the shy neurotic schlub. Hope always played the same part in the 1940s too  the sniveling greedy libidinous coward  but nobody was better at it. Woody Allen borrowed some of Hope's mannerisms for his own performances.If you give Hope the right settings and the right gags he runs with the ball like nobody's business. But this part could have been done by almost any comic actor maybe Red Skelton. The Princess and the Pirate was released in 1944. Hope had some splendid movies ahead of him. In the 1960s he was churning out one turkey after another. I suppose he must have enjoyed working. He surely didn't need the money by then. When he finally quit he played golf continued to make his wellknown USO tours to troops overseas and lived to a respectably old age. Not at all a bad career.".

Even facial ticks playing to the camera and the audience  this is great as it breaks that fourth wall and brings the audience into the film and story more. Bob Hope is a master at making people feel comfortable happy and like one of his friends. Most people relate to him if not to the character he's playing.This is the story of Sylvester The Great Hope. An actor who is about to pursue his greatest role to date... that of a hero... though an unwilling  and sometimes cowardly  one at that. Princess Margaret Mayo is eloping to marry her one true love and not the arranged one her father has in mind. Though her father doesn't know of her plans Captain Barrett The Hook McLaglen does. Along with his band of pirates he plans to kidnap the Princess for a King's ransom... except he's not planned for Sylvester...Bob Hope is brilliant as usual in the role of Sylvester and gives his customary topnotch performance. Though quite a few may say that his characters vary very little in his career I would have to agree with them. However he also gives a hundred percent in those roles. If you look at some comedians today they do the same but because their repertoire doesn't have as much scope they can become boring and tired pretty quickly. Whereas Hope's joyful exuberance appears fresh with every film.It also helps that the rest of the cast is also topnotch. Virginia Mayo is as sprite and bubbly as Hope in her role and helps to make them into a lovable duo. Though it's both McLaglen and Walter Slezak who plays La Roche that add the Straight roles for Hope and Mayo to play off of. Both of these actors are brilliant as the bad guy's. McLaglen has both the physique and the face to pull off the fearful Pirate he's also not too bad at humour the fake mirror sequence is brilliantly pulled off. Slezack as usual has the air of a cunning fox about him a man you just wouldn't trust. These two characters add the depth to the story and make the shade to the light of Hope and Mayo.Another great thing is the direction. Though there's nothing too original in differing camera shots there are a couple of interesting angles. It's the pace of the movie which helps to keep the viewer's attention and build on their interest. The pace is as fast as the gags in the script. There was only one hiccup and that was in the Bucket of Blood Inn. The scene where Sylvester and the Princess do their routine is a little ineffective. I can understand why it's in the story though in the context of the film this is the slowest section and feels awkward. Though I can forgive this because of the excellent beer swilling scene who says we have a drinking problem today.... And even though the end punchline of a sight gag is telegraphed right at the start of the movie it's still funny... the secret of great comedy is...I would recommend this film to everybody who wants a good laugh and is sick and tired of the puerile and immature comedy around today. This should brighten your day quite well....Timing!!!".

	schema:headline " I'm getting this treasure map off my chest";
	schema:reviewBody "A rare for the times Technicolor slapstick farce. Obviously Goldwyn put a lot of resources into this film hoping that a combination of verbal and physical comedy along with the beautiful Virginia Mayo as the princess and often colorful costumes and backdrops would prove irresistible to audiences. It was a box office success. We have 2 chief villains the blustery pirate captain Hook well played by Victor McLaglen and the oily corrupt governor of the fictional pirate island of Casarouge. played by the generally understating Walter Slezac. These 2 appear to be working together at times while double crossing each other at other times. Hook has learnedhow??that the princess Margaret is on the ship Mary Anne. Governor La Roche also has learned thishow??. First Hook captures her along with Bob Hope after burning and sinking the Mary Anne. After she and Hope escape in a lifeboat to Casarouge La Rouge eventually kidnaps them for random. Later they escape and Hook recaptures them on shore and takes them on a voyage. But he is spotted and defeated by a royal warship. The princess and Hope are rescued. The princesses father is on this ship and tells her she can marry her commoner boyfriend rather than a man of royal blood which he previously insisted upon. Her boyfriend is a sailor on this ship she discovers.Meanwhile Hope eventually discovers that the letter he brought to Casarouge to give to Featherhead's cousin actually contains Hook's map of his treasure. But Hope doesn't discover this until Hook's bunch show up including Featherhead who hides under Hope's bed. When Hope arrives Featherhead knocks him out then takes the map from him and tattoos it on his chest. When Hope awakens Featherhead tells him about the map but he doesn't yet see the tattoo job under his shirt. Hook wants to kill whoever stole the map thus Hope says I'm getting this treasure map off my chest. They end up eating bits of the map to dispose of it!Eventually Hook and La Roche discover the map on Hopes chest when he s taking a bath. Hope runs to his room with Hook close behind. Featherhead shoots Hook in the back and he falls apparently dead. Hope puts on his clothes and acts like him in ordering his crew around. But Hook is far from dead. He recovers and gives orders contradictory to those of Hope. Eventually Hope's masquerade is confirmed and he and the princess are captured again. They are taken to his ship for a voyage and rescued as described before.Many important details of this story don't make any sense. In this regard it is most suitable for children who are generally less bothered by gross absurdities. I've already alluded to one. Another example Why did the princess board the Mary Anne without her boyfriend if she wanted to elope with him?? Perhaps the idea was that they would eventually meet in some port in the Americas? Another example Why did the supposed pirate island of Casarouge have a royal governor?Hope and McLaglen are both great in their demanding roles. The screenplay has just enough complexity to hold our interest without being overwhelming. Allen Boretz adapted the screen play from a story written by Sy Bartlett. Virginia was winsome and gutsy in her first Hollywood starring role. Hope had been borrowed from Paramount for a hefty some thus wouldn't do any more pictures with Virginia. Danny Kaye would be Hope's replacement in several films with Virginia.Presumably the name Hook was derived from the pirate of the same name in the children's story of Peter Pan. Presumably the idea of having Hook bury a chest of gold on a desert island is derived from R.L. Stevenson's Treasure Island. The title presumably is an appropriate derivation from Twain's The Prince and the Pauper.Other examples of pirate spoofing films of this era include Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd and Double Crossbones starring Don O'Connor. Then there's the recent animation spoof  The Pirates Band of Misfits.".

We have 2 chief villains the blustery pirate captain Hook well played by Victor McLaglen and the oily corrupt governor of the fictional pirate island of Casarouge. played by the generally understating Walter Slezac. These 2 appear to be working together at times while double crossing each other at other times. Hook has learnedhow??that the princess Margaret is on the ship Mary Anne. Governor La Roche also has learned thishow??. First Hook captures her along with Bob Hope after burning and sinking the Mary Anne. After she and Hope escape in a lifeboat to Casarouge La Rouge eventually kidnaps them for random. Later they escape and Hook recaptures them on shore and takes them on a voyage. But he is spotted and defeated by a royal warship. The princess and Hope are rescued. The princesses father is on this ship and tells her she can marry her commoner boyfriend rather than a man of royal blood which he previously insisted upon. Her boyfriend is a sailor on this ship she discovers.Meanwhile Hope eventually discovers that the letter he brought to Casarouge to give to Featherhead's cousin actually contains Hook's map of his treasure. But Hope doesn't discover this until Hook's bunch show up including Featherhead who hides under Hope's bed. When Hope arrives Featherhead knocks him out then takes the map from him and tattoos it on his chest. When Hope awakens Featherhead tells him about the map but he doesn't yet see the tattoo job under his shirt. Hook wants to kill whoever stole the map thus Hope says I'm getting this treasure map off my chest. They end up eating bits of the map to dispose of it!Eventually Hook and La Roche discover the map on Hopes chest when he s taking a bath. Hope runs to his room with Hook close behind. Featherhead shoots Hook in the back and he falls apparently dead. Hope puts on his clothes and acts like him in ordering his crew around. But Hook is far from dead. He recovers and gives orders contradictory to those of Hope. Eventually Hope's masquerade is confirmed and he and the princess are captured again. They are taken to his ship for a voyage and rescued as described before.Many important details of this story don't make any sense. In this regard it is most suitable for children who are generally less bothered by gross absurdities. I've already alluded to one. Another example Why did the princess board the Mary Anne without her boyfriend if she wanted to elope with him?? Perhaps the idea was that they would eventually meet in some port in the Americas? Another example Why did the supposed pirate island of Casarouge have a royal governor?Hope and McLaglen are both great in their demanding roles. The screenplay has just enough complexity to hold our interest without being overwhelming. Allen Boretz adapted the screen play from a story written by Sy Bartlett. Virginia was winsome and gutsy in her first Hollywood starring role. Hope had been borrowed from Paramount for a hefty some thus wouldn't do any more pictures with Virginia. Danny Kaye would be Hope's replacement in several films with Virginia.Presumably the name Hook was derived from the pirate of the same name in the children's story of Peter Pan. Presumably the idea of having Hook bury a chest of gold on a desert island is derived from R.L. Stevenson's Treasure Island. The title presumably is an appropriate derivation from Twain's The Prince and the Pauper.Other examples of pirate spoofing films of this era include Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd and Double Crossbones starring Don O'Connor. Then there's the recent animation spoof  The Pirates Band of Misfits.";

It is a well scripted meticulously shot and finely acted period drama the likes of which are increasingly less to come by at the movies these days. A big congratulations to all those involved with the production for having the confidence to delve into this venture. Actually I am very curious about its boxoffice. Last year was a surprisingly profitable year for adult dramas and if that is any indication this fine film should continue the same trend.Water For Elephants really impresses with the production design atmosphere costumes and stunts. Most of the time I felt like I was watching a classic film made during the studio era it looked that authentic and faultless. The three main actors all seem satisfied for having such meaty parts and deliver more than satisfactory performances. Robert Pattinson shines and proves that he is capable as a serious actor. Reese Witherspoon has always been a true professional and here with her stunts demonstrates that again. She also fits surprisingly well to the 1930s platinum blonde beauty type. Christopher Waltz is a wonderful actor and here it becomes very clear that his success in Inglorious Basterds was not a oneoff. The story is very emotional and while it touches the heart romantically it also manages to lay down a heretofore unseen dark aspect of old era circus entertainment in particular and also crowd entertainment as a whole. I almost wished for a three hour epic after it ended it left me wanting more. The whole thing was really interesting.All in all a wonderful and deeply satisfying experience at the movies well worth every dime. Go see it so that adult dramas of this caliber in terms of star power production budget and subsequent attention to detail could continue to be made.".

I have not read the novel even though I plan to do it now so I'm only offering my views on the movie.First of all It's amazingly beautiful. The costumes and sets are gorgeous the cinematography is exquisite the animals are cute especially Rosie the elephant and the three leads are very easy on the eyes as well. Robert Pattinson was actually quite good. This was a surprise to me since I didn't really think he was anything special in any of the Twilight movies or Remember Me. He looked very appropriate for the time the movie was set in and even though I love Emile Hirsch who auditioned for Jacob too I'm confident that Robert was the best choice there was for this role it was perfect for him. Hal Holbrook was also very fitting for the role of older Jacob. The two actors really made me believe that they were the same person in different stages of his life.Reese Witherspoon was okay. She looked beautiful was charming and cute but it felt like something was missing  however I can't think of any other actress I would have liked better in the role so I came to the conclusion that it was probably the character Marlena that was a little bland not Reese. But the true star of this movie was Christoph Waltz. I may be a bit biased since I loved him in Inglorious Basterds but he was even more perfect in this movie. His portrayal of August was amazing he made him likable and interesting and I was always compelled by his scenes. The character reminded me a lot of Miles in King Kong played by Jack Black a character that also wanted fame and success more than anything and used questionable and even cruel methods to get it. He was terrifying in some scenes too but always believable. Also in the beginning of the movie i really felt the chemistry between August and Marlena which made the character even more interesting however I did feel like Jacob and Marlena had chemistry too and in my opinion this way it was more realistic both men loved her and she also cared about both of them. I loved the movie and I really recommend it to everyone. I would sincerely give it 1010 stars. Of course there was some parts of the movie I didn't like particularly towards the end of it but overall it was a magical spectacular and epic period movie and I can't wait to see it again!".

	schema:headline " Very pleasantly surprised by Pattinson!";
	schema:reviewBody "Okay firstly as I guy I did not think this movie was going to be all that great and interesting for me. I was wrong. The cinematography costumes score and acting all added up to an interesting and quite lovely spectacle. I suggest everyone should give it a go. You might be as surprised as I was. I'm going to try to avoid any major spoilers so I'll keep it very vague on the story. The movie kind of keeps you guessing which was its going to go for the characters. Be it happy ever after or big disaster. I could genuinely feel the admiration and respect between Jacob Pattinson and Tai the elephant which is essential and central to the story. Which brings me to Pattinson. He was absolutely very good in this movie. He was different to previous characters he has played. He was warm and caring yet a strong character which is a difficult balance. I mentioned the connection with Tai was believable and the same is true with Marlena Witherspoon. She also did a fine job. Her circus tricks should be commended at the very least. Waltz was very good as the bad guy. He just delivers that kind of role brilliantly. When Pattinson and Waltz are on screen together you do not feel that one is less impressive than the other. That is why I was pleasantly surprised by Pattinson. He has shown in this movie that he is a fine actor with a lot more potential and I question anyone who says differently's motivations. Yes he is Edward Cullen..but its time to let that go people and give the guy some major credit for his acting All in all. I thought it was a charming movie.".

	onyx:emotionText "Okay firstly as I guy I did not think this movie was going to be all that great and interesting for me. I was wrong. The cinematography costumes score and acting all added up to an interesting and quite lovely spectacle. I suggest everyone should give it a go. You might be as surprised as I was. I'm going to try to avoid any major spoilers so I'll keep it very vague on the story. The movie kind of keeps you guessing which was its going to go for the characters. Be it happy ever after or big disaster. I could genuinely feel the admiration and respect between Jacob Pattinson and Tai the elephant which is essential and central to the story. Which brings me to Pattinson. He was absolutely very good in this movie. He was different to previous characters he has played. He was warm and caring yet a strong character which is a difficult balance. I mentioned the connection with Tai was believable and the same is true with Marlena Witherspoon. She also did a fine job. Her circus tricks should be commended at the very least. Waltz was very good as the bad guy. He just delivers that kind of role brilliantly.

	schema:reviewBody "Critically acclaimed novel Water for Elephants written by Sara Gruen was a New York Times 1 Best Seller in 2007 and now has taken a turn towards cinema with the help of Director Francis Lawrence I Am Legend. The film's biggest draw comes from Robert Pattinson Twilight after his tween vampire film following success however the real star of the show is Academy Award Winner Christoph Waltz Inglourious Bastards. Reese Witherspoon Walk the Line stars as the film's leading lady hitting her stride late in the film. Hal Holbrook All The President's Men opens up the film with the portrayal of present day Jacob Janowski found in a parking lot outside of the circus who begins telling the story of his early years connecting to one of the biggest circus disasters in history. Pattinson plays the younger Jacob a veterinary student at Cornell whose his life is turned upside down. He drops out of school deciding to go jump a train. He realizes that he has joined the ranks of the Benzini Brothers Circus changing his life forever. He is thrown into the harsh reality of the Big Top meeting a man named August Waltz who reluctantly gives him a job working with the animals. Jacob becomes infatuated with August's wife Marlena Witherspoon who is a part of the lead act in the show that develops into a friendship between man woman and a majestic elephant. However life is a battle and the story is extremely dramatic leaving everyone's life at risk with August's alcoholic greedy rage on their doorstep.Cristoph Waltz does what he does best with his most recent interpretation of a complicated illwilled bad guy that audiences grow to hate however the depth of his performances make him memorable. He is able to give life to the cold soul of August making the viewer root for his demise along with his change of heart. Pattinson shows that he is more than just a tween king vampire however his full potential is not unleashed. The real star of the show is the majestic elephant herself Rosie and the character's journey to protect her hitting the right notes in the second half.The magic and magnificence of the film is lost within the overly dramatic lengthy exposition. The melodramatic backdrop of the film is omnipresent leaving little room for comic relief and the growth of the beautiful creatures to coexist. The most disappointing part of the film is Witherspoon's odd character development making her very plain until halfway through the film. At the same time it seems like an eternity once the elephant finally enters the film showing an inkling of hope while the love triangle becomes childish clich and eventually annoying.Overall the film has an average script that is aided by the performances of its actors. It is hard to overlook the melodrama as Waltz controls the show which is actually more about life and relationships than the circus.".

	schema:reviewBody "Having read a few reviews of this depression era set novel by Sara Gruen I was apprehensive to see the film. The readers and critics had said it was too depressing and didn't end well. I'm happy to say the film is not bad at all. It captures the mood of the 1930s and we the audience really get a sense of what it must have been like to live in that time in history. Yes we went through our own depression but it was quite different and much more difficult back then. The film centers around Jacob Robert Pattinson a student of veterinary science at Cornell who gives up his education and runs away after his parents die in a car accident. He stumbles upon a traveling circus where he is taken in by riff raffs and other stowaways. They have all become a part of the circus ensemble in order to make ends meet. Jacob eventually meets their ringleader August played by Christolph Waltz Inglorious Basterds and his beautiful wife Marlena Reese Witherspoon. August takes Jacob under his wing initially but later Jacob learns his true colors. I do not wish to give away too much of the storyline but something tells me people will like this movie as much as the book if not more. I think the film makers have managed to make a film about the depression era without it being depressing. The film has an epic feel to it. It's emotional inspiring romantic and overall it makes for a very good drama. Even the ending is uplifting. The cast is wonderful as well. Robert Pattinson holds his own against two Oscar winners. It's great to see Reese Witherspoon back in action and in top form. There aren't enough great things I can say about Christoph Waltz. He balances the line between being dangerous and comedic with razor sharp precision and is very intimidatinghis performance is brilliant. It's great to see a film with real sets and gritty and flawed characters rather than imaginative CG rendered places and creatures. Even the train where a large part of the film takes place feels alive with all its moving partsit has a personality of its own. It's a surprising film from director Francis Lawrence whose previous films include Constantine and I am Legend. It's clear that the team he works with has a great sense of capturing a story's mood time and place. Water for Elephants is a beautiful moving and entertaining film. Go see it! httptickingticket.blogspot.com".

Film dragged on for too long. How i hope the animals at the end would just kill them all. And like some others said the elephant was or still is definitely tortured to perform tricks like that. Shame on the stars who performed in this film. If you enjoy being tortured by a slow and pointless story then this is the film for you. Otherwise there are better films out there. I wish i could take back that 2 hours of my life or at the very least not trusting the high rating from reviewers here. Oh another thing what cinematography were people talking about?

	schema:reviewBody "Jacob Jankowski Robert Pattinson has a bright future ahead of him with the Great Depression ravaging through America he has the chance at a good job as a veterinarian and a stable life. This all changes when he discovers that his parents have been in a car accident and that he is illegible to own their house. He tries to renew his life's purpose and by chance comes across the circus troupe of the Bezeni Brothers where he meets the cruel owner August Christoph Waltz and dazzling Marlene Reese Witherspoon.Titanic on a train you would be forgiven if this was your estimation of the film based on previews and for the most part you would be right. Based on the awardwinning novel of the same name Water for Elephants tells the story of a man who has to redirect his life after it is derailed from some unfortunate events. The story is told in a linear fashion and it is a pity that not more is made of the idea of reality vs. illusion which is a noticeable subject in the odd dialogue interchange. While this concept has more in liking with who a character really is and what information they know but do not let on the concept is nevertheless never fully developed and ultimately explained by the characters themselves. Nevertheless other themes present themselves in more subtle and interesting ways such as the images of railroads and water allowing the experience to not be all dictated. In the end the film feels like a reworking of James Cameron's Titanic with a new setting and a new cast but it most likely will not have the same cultural impact.Romance becomes pivotal to the development of characters and the respective actors prove capable. Robert Pattinson will obviously be the centre of talk for the film and he does well for himself here. If you did not feel that Remember Me was a step in the right direction from a Twilightesque future then this film will surely give you the impression that Pattinson at least has the potential to mature his acting in a commendable manner. Witherspoon does an adequate job in her portrayal of Marlene and wriggles in workable chemistry between herself and Pattinson but ultimately she does little to truly shine beyond her male counterparts. But experience is what steals the show with Waltz exemplifying a character who can pull you in with his charisma and idealistic hopes but who can also repulse you with his cruelty. Waltz is indeed the strongest link in the acting department but do not let his performance undermine the rest of the cast especially the supporting roles who help create a holistically believable set of characters.All of this is strengthened by some decent costume design and film direction which brings every scene to life gracefully. There is some questionable CGI use for animals towards the end and the environment does not get quite the showing it could but the film feels balanced and admirable in portrayal of one man's journey of selfdiscovery.Sex and nudity are at most hinted at and language is mild at best. There is some violence mostly in the regard of fist fighting but also the rare offscreen violence towards an animal.As mentioned earlier Titanic on a train could very well be an apt explanation of the film. There is thankfully enough substance to allow the story to craft its own image but only just. This coupled with some slight CGI mishap and a narrative that does not always allow one to ponder on certain ideas are not enough to truly hurt the overall quality. The story is lovely the acting is strong and the filming is delicate in what it offers. It may not be the Titanic of the time but it is hardly a bumpy ride either.".

	schema:reviewBody "This was one of the oldest stories in the book  a new man gets in between the relationship of a husband and a wife. But for Water for Elephants this story was transported to the era of the Great Depression in the US where a young vet student joins a traditional big top circus led by its perfectionist ringleader and his star performer wife.I guess period set pieces like this would only appeal to certain people. I did not find the time or the setting particularly interesting. The presence of the the titular elephant Rosie was engaging though as the beast actually seemed to emote. Christoph Waltz does another one of his charming sadist roles as August the ringleader. Reese Witherspoon impressed me with some of her gymnastic skills as Marlena but overall her performance was rather bland. Most of the audience attention was on Robert Pattinson to see if he can step out of Edward's shadow in the Twilight movies. Interestingly he plays a character named Jacob in this film. He has very distinct facial features which makes it hard for him to disappear into a role. He was able to show more variety here and he looked right for the time period. It is still very much in the love story genre though so his acting style is generally the same. So the final verdict is If you like love stories you might like this movie. If you like the circus you might like this movie. Despite all the rave reviews I have been reading about it I found this film rather average because of the very familiar and therefore predictable storyline.".

	schema:reviewBody "First of all WowSecond WowI saw the movie today at a pre screening and let me just say this movie simply just took my breathe away. I was already in tears by the first scene! This is an emotional warm movie and I loved every second of it of course there are some really funny scenes in it too but since I don't wanna post spoilers I will add a few under the cut but one of the best scenes has to do with cats . It is so beautiful they have really captured the era and the feeling of a circus.This movie seem to be all Robert Pattinson Jacob I mean come on!! The footage of Rob is to die for. If i could picture frame every scene he is in i would. He is simply amazingly beautiful in this movie like we didn't already know that?!How about Robs acting then. The big question  I could see so much change in his acting and so much progress. It made me sort of proud in a weird way. I hope this movie will finally be the one that makes the movie business see him as something more than Edward Cullen. In the beginning of the movie i could see some Edward acting in certain face expressions and further in I could draw parallels with Tyler in Remember Me and sometimes I couldn't tell if he was acting or if he was simply being Rob. In some scenes I could see him charming fans at official events or just being laid back as he always is. Like if he shined through..you know what I mean? I think all of you will see his amazing change he have learned so much on the way.He has developed so much!To make this a fair review I think I would have to mention the rest of the cast.Hal Holbrook Old Jacob is the sweetest little man ever. Totally awesome for the short time we see him on screen. I had a really hard time not crying when he was on. The opening scene is so emotional.Reese Witherspoon Marlena I didn't expect anything besides good acting. She is so very sweet and on film she and Rob has an awesome connection and chemistry. Almost felt as if I could see the playfulness in the movie that they shared during their WFE press junket interviews.Christoph Waltz August have to admit i haven't seen any movie from him before but he plays his part gracefully. Scary man with great ambitions for his circus.Tai Rose the elephant. I LOVED HER!! I loved how adorable the scenes between her and Rob are. You can see the love Rob has for that elephant. Their scenes are the best!!As for the other cast...they have made a great casting for this movie. Everyone plays their part so good.Found a lack of depth in the movie like the book has but i guess it is impossible to add all features from the book in to 2 hours of film. Overall nothing that really is bothering.About the music.. I must admit that i didn't notice the score at all so i suppose it really worked in the movie. A lot of time typical music in many scenes. Many have asked me on twitter if i think this movie is Oscars material. To be honest I would love it to get an Oscar nod cause the scenography and costumes are so beautiful !! but my answer will be no at least in the bigger categories. It's not that i don't think the movie is extremely good but because i don't think the movie has the depth or the complexity that the Oscar winning movies normally have. But if i am wrong i will be so happy of course.I wish all would see this movie. I don't think it will disappoint many.SPOILERSThe sex scene is something i have been asked about. Well it's short and pretty much non existent. As far as anything naked in this movie you will not find it.Funniest scenes When August tells Jacob to feed the cats. I laughed so much when Rob gets scared and falls. Also the scene after Robs party with Barbra and the crew and he wakes up in full clown gear. I am telling you nippelgate Rob all the way hahhahaha!!!When Rob gets tears in his eyes when Rose is being hit my heart broke. tearsWe also get to hear Rob speak polish in the movie which is really cool. And for me as a non polish person i think it sounds genuine DI will not write the ending even if this is spoilers cause I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't read the book.The ONLY thing in the movie that didn't have the high quality as the rest of the movie was the scene when the animals are let loose among the circus audience. Looked to much as computer work than the real thing".

It is also apparent that the more popular a book is the quicker its screen adaptation gets produced. All we as viewers and fans can hope for is a script production and acting body that gives the book the attention it deserves. Now I haven't read the book but for what it's worth I think Francis Lawrence and company gave it their best shot.Since I didn't read the book I can't attest to its congruency with the film. However the screenplay seemed wellwritten though quite straightforward. If the book was nuanced with symbolism such nuances were lost on me during the film. The love triangle mixed with animal rightshumanitarianism makes for a fine story but it is one with a vast and welltrodden history and wears thin on a cinemaphile such as myself.The good news is for fans of the book there was definitely adequate attention paid to the production value and acting. The cinematography was deliciously crisp and the lighting fantastic. Overall this allowed me to forget the few scenes that seemed oddly cut. As for the acting I came into the theater expecting to have fuel added to my hatefire for that pale glistening vampire from Twilight. To my glorious surprise Robert Pattinson shows that he has skills when not covered in white powder. I look forward to seeing what he can do in the future. Reese Witherspoon is maturing into a beautiful seasoned actress and her experience shows. Unfortunately I haven't enjoyed Christoph Waltz since Inglorious Basterds and this movie is no exception. I don't know whether he fit the physical profile of August to a tee or not but I think I could have introduced a circus better than his bearded self.All in all whether you are a fan of the book or want an interesting perspective on a certain lifestyle of the depression era Water for Elephants is worth seeing once.

	schema:reviewBody "When an old man is found wandering in the parking area of the Circus Vargas his owner invites him to come to his office to call the Green Haven nursing home to take him back home. The old man tells his name Jacob Jankowski and explains that he worked in the Benzini Bros. Circus in 1931. The owner is curious about it since in 1931 there was the most famous disaster in history of circuses in the Benzini Circus and asks Jacob to tell what happened.In 1931 during the Great Depression the Polish American Jacob Robert Pattinson lives with his beloved parents in a small ranch and studies veterinary in the Cornell University. During his final exams his parents die in a car accident. Jacob learns that he is homeless and without any money since his parents used their house to get a loan for his studies. Jacob leaves his town and jumps in a train in movement without destination to seek a job. Soon he finds that this is the Benzini Brothers Circus train and he finds a job cleaning the animals' excrement from the wagons. When the unstable and violent owner of the traveling circus August Christoph Waltz learns that Jacob is a veterinary he hires him to train his attraction the elephant Rosie. August and his bodyguard Blackie Scott MacDonald throw workers that complain off the train in movement to get rid of them. Meanwhile Jacob meets August's wife and lead attraction Marlena Reese Witherspoon he immediately falls in love with her. Jacob gets closer to Marlena and soon he discovers that she is also in love with him but she fears August. Water for Elephants is a beautiful romance developed in the Great Depression with the story of a youngster that loses his beloved parents and joins a circus by chance. He finds love but also the illusion of the circus and the violence of an unstable man.

	onyx:emotionText "When an old man is found wandering in the parking area of the Circus Vargas his owner invites him to come to his office to call the Green Haven nursing home to take him back home. The old man tells his name Jacob Jankowski and explains that he worked in the Benzini Bros. Circus in 1931. The owner is curious about it since in 1931 there was the most famous disaster in history of circuses in the Benzini Circus and asks Jacob to tell what happened.In 1931 during the Great Depression the Polish American Jacob Robert Pattinson lives with his beloved parents in a small ranch and studies veterinary in the Cornell University. During his final exams his parents die in a car accident. Jacob learns that he is homeless and without any money since his parents used their house to get a loan for his studies. Jacob leaves his town and jumps in a train in movement without destination to seek a job. Soon he finds that this is the Benzini Brothers Circus train and he finds a job cleaning the animals' excrement from the wagons. When the unstable and violent owner of the traveling circus August Christoph Waltz learns that Jacob is a veterinary he hires him to train his attraction the elephant Rosie. August and his bodyguard Blackie Scott MacDonald throw workers that complain off the train in movement to get rid of them. Meanwhile Jacob meets August's wife and lead attraction Marlena Reese Witherspoon he immediately falls in love with her. Jacob gets closer to Marlena and soon he discovers that she is also in love with him but she fears August. Water for Elephants is a beautiful romance developed in the Great Depression with the story of a youngster that loses his beloved parents and joins a circus by chance. He finds love but also the illusion of the circus and the violence of an unstable man. The lead cast is composed by the excellent Christoph Waltz Reese Witherspoon and a surprisingly good Robert Pattinson besides the lovely elephant Rosie. The art direction is also very beautiful in the recreation of 1931 costumes and sets. My vote is eight.Title Brazil gua Para Elefantes Water for Elephants";

This is oldstyle adventure and romance Hollywood filmmaking at its finest!I didn't read the novel but I am an avid fan of classic films and an animal lover and I highly recommend Water for Elephants for most anyone who is at least in their teens. The only critique I have of this movie is that it was too short! It was so beautiful and it carried me away so completely I think I could have enjoyed it for another hour.Water for Elephants sweeps you into circus life of the 1930's during the hungry and desperate times of the Great Depression. It's a nomadic hardworking and very sparse life. This 2nd class circus is a defined family though and they live isolated on the sullied fringes of regular society.All three leads were truly luminous. Jacob and Marlena were both lovely and believable in their restrained refined roles.Christoph Waltz as August proved again he can be an enigma absolute. He is charismatic and likable his enthusiasm and joy is literally tangible but somewhere beneath there seems to lurk something so horrific there simply aren't words to name it.I have so much admiration for the magic of this Christoph Waltz after Inglourious Basterds and now this new film. It is my great hope that he will choose his roles wisely and with delicacy so that we can continue to relish in his talents for many years to come.My virtual hat is off!

	schema:reviewBody "Although his last Twilight movie hasn't even been released yet Robert Pattinson is already struggling to forge a new screen persona for himself. Last year's Remember Me emerged as an abysmal failure for Pattinson not to mention a shamelessly exploitative account of the 911 tragedy. Now Pattinson is pairing up with Reese Witherspoon in I Am Legend director Francis Lawrence's Water for Elephants and it fares no better than Remember Me. This glum gritty 1930s' melodrama unfolds within the confines of a threadbare Depressionera traveling circus during Prohibition. The unsavory plot concerns animal cruelty marital infidelity and coldblooded murder. The soiled romance between Pattinson and Witherspoon as illicit lovers generates minimal sizzle. Despite its evocative production values and historicallyladen atmosphere Water for Elephants qualifies as a creative misfire and this sour saga will leave a bad taste in your mouth.Disaster couldn't occur at a worse time for a Cornell University veterinary student Jacob Jankowski Robert Pattinson of Vanity Fair as he is poised to take his final exam graduate and embark on a new life. Jacob has enjoyed a carefree povertyfree life and his parents love him dearly. Without warning the authorities inform our hero that his folks have died in an automobile accident. Worse Jacob's parents were up to their eyeballs in debt. Actually Jacob's father had taken out a loan to put him through college. Further he had been a compassionate veterinarian who accepted food in lieu of cash as payment for bills from his clients. An incredulous Jacob emerges badly shaken by these revelations with little more than a suitcase that he disposes of almost immediately when he launches himself on his travels. He climbs aboard a train one evening and finds himself stowing away with a circus. Jacob winds up sweating and shoveling manure for his keep.Later he meets Marlena Oscarwinning actress Reese Witherspoon of Vanity Fair who is the resident platinumblond equestrian beauty with her celebrated white stallion. Not only is she the star attraction under the big top but she is also married to the man who runs the circus. August Rosenbluth Christoph Waltz of The Green Hornet is the ringmaster and middleaged owner of the Benzini Brothers Circus. He has spent his entire life in sawdust and knows all the tricks of the trade. When Marlena's horse goes lame August shows an interest in Jacob for his obviously useful background in veterinary medicine. He invites Jacob to inspect Marlena's injured horse. She believes that her horse will recover and August quietly convinces Jacob to agree with her. Reluctantly behind Marlena's back Jacob confides in August that the horse should be euthanized.The economically minded August doesn't want to shoot the horse that has made him a fortune. Instead he wants to string the poor animal along until it can do nothing else than die. Later Jacob intercedes on behalf of the steed and puts it out of its misery with a bullet to the head. Naturally August is not happy. August's musclebound thugs tackle Jacob in a moving railroad boxcar and threaten to hurl him off the speeding train. August explains that this practice is known as 'red lighting' and the victim usually dies a horrible death. Later a couple of sympathetic characters meet their illfated fortune this way. August has second thoughts about Jacob and grants our protagonist clemency. Befriending Jacob August takes him into his close circle of friends eventually narrowing it down to his wife and himself.Meanwhile August has bought an elephant named Rosie from a rival outfit. He gives Jacob custody of the beast. Now rather than straddle a horse Marlena will ride atop a 9000pound pachyderm. Of course nothing goes well from the beginning. Rosie becomes hysterical and nearly stomps on the spectators before she rampages out of the tent. Jacob and his roustabout friend Camel Jim Norton of Straw Dogs find the elephant in town feeding at a outdoor market. August goes berserk and beats the animal with an iron prod. Miraculously the beast recovers and becomes a profitable part of the circus attracting crowds. Inevitably through no design of their own Marlena and Jacob are drawn together and they fall in love. Mind you Camel has warned Jacob to keep his eyes off the boss' wife. The incident occurs at a nightclub that the police raid for selling contraband alcohol when August steps out. Marlena and Jacob elude the authorities but arouse August's suspicions. Later they run away from the circus but August tracks them down. His thugs beat Jacob within an inch of his life. Jacob sneaks back to the circus with revenge on his mind. He slips into August's tent and poises a knife against the nape of an unconscious ringmaster's neck but he cannot summon the courage to kill him.You know a movie is in trouble when the most interesting character is a thoroughly loathsome villain who is justified in some of his actions. Oscarwinning actor Christoph Waltz marvelously portrays August Rosenbluth as a such sadistic dastard that you will cheer when he receives his comeuppance. Meanwhile Pattinson and Witherspoon try to enliven characters who are not only wimps but also lack charisma. It is difficult to root for both the hero and heroine when they are such losers from the start. Adding to the woes of this terrible movie is the fact that it is wrapped around a tedious flashback so you know that nothing disastrous can occur to the protagonist since he has survived all the perils. Mercifully Bridges of Madison County scribe Richard LaGravenese has synthesized various characters and incidents from Sara Gruen's New York Times best seller. Nevertheless humorously lumbering along like a elephant for two hours Water for Elephants wears out its welcome quickly. This is truly a 3ring snore.".

	schema:reviewBody "I saw the film in South Africa on Friday afternoon  The trailer was an attractive appealing one which made the film look intriguing promising a sweeping period story and an epic romance. Water for Elephants certainly isn't unwatchable. However it lacks any serious emotional power Robert Pattinson so effectively cast in the Twilight movies is a good looking and interesting looking guy but he definitely isn't a great actor. Pattinson fails to create a three dimensional character. One never sees what is going on in Jacob's head because Pattinson isn't capable of projecting internal emotions. Reese Witherspoon  who can act  is miscast. Christopher Waltz  who was really well cast in Inglourous Basterds is certainly entertaining to watch and I would attribute some of the failings of his colorful character to the script rather than his acting ability.The chocolate box cinematography is pleasant colorful and sometimes atmospheric rather than brilliant and the film never really gets into top gear. Like its leading man it's nice looking but lacking in real substance. The narrative structure is also lumpy and the story doesn't flow naturally. The best acting in the picture is done by Hal Holbrook and Paul Schneider in relatively small roles. But to be honest Rosie the elephant is easily the most endearing character in the film. While the film was disappointing and is certainly not an out and out flop the story has been dumbeddown to appeal to a teenage demographic. It's got no real sexual or romantic heat. But funny enough I think youngsters will enjoy it. Especially teenage girls. I just hoped for so much more. No wonder 20th Century Fox are keeping it away from the critics for as long as possible and opening it in a few smaller territories before the States. It ain't going to pick up sparkling reviews.Don't think I hated it though I just expected and hoped for so much more. The film's ending is a wee bit anticlimactic but then the romantic part of the storyline is so predictable that it could hardly have ended any other way. I was however touched  little tears even welled up in my eyes  by the scene involving the horse's tragic demise and a scene involving Rosie being hurt by Waltz's August. The costumes and period details are good although things sometimes look a wee bit too glamorous considering the milieu it plays out in but the dialog and body language of the actors feels too contemporary. I imagine given the film's target demographic and the marketing campaign  which is centered around Pattinson that this was intentional.The story while interesting enough not surprising since it is based on a popular novel never really gathers an epic sweep not is it ever intimate enough to compensate for this. Mostly it just lacks the genuine romantic heat to succeed fully. There is virtually no erotic chemistry or tension between Pattinson and Witherspoon. So serious passionate adult cinemagoers looking for intelligent emotionally resonant fare will be disappointed but maybe it will work for Twilight fans if you know what I mean. The teenage girls will like it and their boyfriends won't mind it. I must say though as a 51yearold adult male who works in the DVD industry writes film reviews for local publications and watches over a 100 films a year on the big screen plus another 400 or so on DVD I am hardly the target demographic so depending on age tastes and how seriously they take cinemagoing others might well enjoy it more than me. Those young viewers who are looking for lightweight escapism with a pretty contemporary star in the male lead will probably forgive the film its lack of genuine dramatic tension and a compelling narrative structure.Like I say I really expected more from this film but I guess so many of today's films are tailored to a teen aged democratic who lack the ability to concentrate for long periods of time want fast editing and are not interested in seeing characters breathe or develop in interesting realistic ways.".

	onyx:emotionText "I saw the film in South Africa on Friday afternoon  The trailer was an attractive appealing one which made the film look intriguing promising a sweeping period story and an epic romance. Water for Elephants certainly isn't unwatchable. However it lacks any serious emotional power Robert Pattinson so effectively cast in the Twilight movies is a good looking and interesting looking guy but he definitely isn't a great actor. Pattinson fails to create a three dimensional character. One never sees what is going on in Jacob's head because Pattinson isn't capable of projecting internal emotions. Reese Witherspoon  who can act  is miscast. Christopher Waltz  who was really well cast in Inglourous Basterds is certainly entertaining to watch and I would attribute some of the failings of his colorful character to the script rather than his acting ability.The chocolate box cinematography is pleasant colorful and sometimes atmospheric rather than brilliant and the film never really gets into top gear. Like its leading man it's nice looking but lacking in real substance. The narrative structure is also lumpy and the story doesn't flow naturally. The best acting in the picture is done by Hal Holbrook and Paul Schneider in relatively small roles. But to be honest Rosie the elephant is easily the most endearing character in the film. While the film was disappointing and is certainly not an out and out flop the story has been dumbeddown to appeal to a teenage demographic. It's got no real sexual or romantic heat. But funny enough I think youngsters will enjoy it. Especially teenage girls. I just hoped for so much more. No wonder 20th Century Fox are keeping it away from the critics for as long as possible and opening it in a few smaller territories before the States. It ain't going to pick up sparkling reviews.Don't think I hated it though I just expected and hoped for so much more. The film's ending is a wee bit anticlimactic but then the romantic part of the storyline is so predictable that it could hardly have ended any other way. I was however touched  little tears even welled up in my eyes  by the scene involving the horse's tragic demise and a scene involving Rosie being hurt by Waltz's August. The costumes and period details are good although things sometimes look a wee bit too glamorous considering the milieu it plays out in but the dialog and body language of the actors feels too contemporary. I imagine given the film's target demographic and the marketing campaign  which is centered around Pattinson that this was intentional.The story while interesting enough not surprising since it is based on a popular novel never really gathers an epic sweep not is it ever intimate enough to compensate for this. Mostly it just lacks the genuine romantic heat to succeed fully. There is virtually no erotic chemistry or tension between Pattinson and Witherspoon. So serious passionate adult cinemagoers looking for intelligent emotionally resonant fare will be disappointed but maybe it will work for Twilight fans if you know what I mean. The teenage girls will like it and their boyfriends won't mind it. I must say though as a 51yearold adult male who works in the DVD industry writes film reviews for local publications and watches over a 100 films a year on the big screen plus another 400 or so on DVD I am hardly the target demographic so depending on age tastes and how seriously they take cinemagoing others might well enjoy it more than me. Those young viewers who are looking for lightweight escapism with a pretty contemporary star in the male lead will probably forgive the film its lack of genuine dramatic tension and a compelling narrative structure.Like I say I really expected more from this film but I guess so many of today's films are tailored to a teen aged democratic who lack the ability to concentrate for long periods of time want fast editing and are not interested in seeing characters breathe or develop in interesting realistic ways.";

There are several reasons for such an opinion.It's a comedy and satire shaped movie with a serious background story concerning the values in the post WW2 Yugoslavian society. Obsession with Marshall Tito the undisputed ruler and the political system which follows his character is the main theme seen through a child's perspective. The main character a 10 year old boy Zoran from Belgrade tries to find himself between his divers family friends girls who he starts to notice and a communist regime which infiltrates all the life's pores. Love can be confusing and Zoran will discover that during the boy scout expedition to the Tito's native village Kumrovec. A convincing performance was also given by Lazar Ristovski Comrade Raja a party instructed delegate whose task was to plan and execute the expedition. The cynicism and narrow minded appearance of his character does represent the true state of the communist regime and it's impact on daily life.Tito i ja is also the best and probably the last good work of Goran Markovic who for reasons unknown utterly lost his common sense and creativity after this movie and started making rubbish.".

	onyx:emotionText "Tito i ja or Tito and me is beyond any doubt one of the best Serbian movies of all times. There are several reasons for such an opinion.It's a comedy and satire shaped movie with a serious background story concerning the values in the post WW2 Yugoslavian society. Obsession with Marshall Tito the undisputed ruler and the political system which follows his character is the main theme seen through a child's perspective. The main character a 10 year old boy Zoran from Belgrade tries to find himself between his divers family friends girls who he starts to notice and a communist regime which infiltrates all the life's pores. Love can be confusing and Zoran will discover that during the boy scout expedition to the Tito's native village Kumrovec.

Indeed the movie gives the viewer plenty of reasons to be amused.

	schema:reviewBody "Yugoslavia is one country I know only a little history about. However this movie was done in 1992 probably the best time to do a film on this subject. Tito was the Croatianborn leader who led Yugoslavia for about four decades after World War Two. Yugoslavia was MarxistCommunist but not having as strong ties to Moscow as other Communist countries in eastern and southern Europe. The beginning of the movie is very light hearted and funny. Zoran's parents are dancers who live in very close proximity to another family in Belgrade the largest city and capital of Yugoslavia. His parents are in love but argue. His grandparents live in separate houses but still come over for the family meal. There is no privacy and the two mothers argue incessantly with one another because of having to be living in such cramped quarters. There are very funny comments such as when his father loses his job at the ballet and finds a job at a jazz nightclub. This leads his Mom to be jealous that he is having affairs with lots of women and they have a big argument. Although not dirt poor like in many Communist countries most people are always at the edge of poverty. The son named Zoran even eats the wall literally to get nutrients. Zoran is a ten year old boy but despite not getting all his nutrients is a bit overweight. This gets him labeled and called all kinds of names. His big passion is a crush on an older girl who grew up in an orphanage. This leads to the second and main part of the film the adulation of Tito totally dominates the society. His teacher in his classroom even goes so far to teach her kids the name of Tito's cows in the village he came from. When Tito finds out the girl he has a crush on is leaving for two weeks to participate in the Young Pioneer's camping trip to the birthplace of Tito he is devastated. But sort of like the Red Rider BB Gun essay in Christmas Story Tito finds his ticket when the winner of the best essay praising Tito in his class will be able to go on this camping trip. Zoran makes sure he writes so good an essay that he not only gets to go but has written the best essay in all of Belgrade. He goes so far as to say that he loves Tito more than his parents. His parents are very offended when they hear he prefers Tito to his parents. For the first time it intrudes that maybe not everyone is totally happy with the political regime in Yugoslavia. But still Zoran is merrily sent off on the train to camp where he finds the girl he loves. He is so in love with the girl that he had secretly given his grandmother's valuable ring to her.The leader of the pioneers is named Raja. He is a very cowardly and obedient servant of the state. He is very charming but the movie soon turns tragic because Zoran is overweight and cannot keep up with the group. He soon becomes seen as a nonconformist and threat to the group and the Yugoslavian state. Staying in the palace of a disgraced aristocrat Raja dresses up as a ghost to scare the kids and the kids knock over all kinds of priceless statues when they flee around the house in terror. The aristocratic owner stupidly informs the police. The police tell the aristocrat to buzz off or they will drag him in and beat him up but the incident embarrasses Raja who sees this as both a slight to his authority and makes him look too close to a disgraced aristocratic in the state. In authoritarian states it is extremely important to save face and look in control. Minor disputes with someone especially someone seen as right wing to the state can lead to arrest and humiliation. Sadly Raja scapegoats ten year old Zoran and uses his romance with the girl his slowness in keeping up with the group and even his going to a church to pray over the fact that he is being now labeled as a troublemaker in the group as all part of his devious plot to fool people into thinking that he is devoted to Tito. This part is most sad and it is very hard not to feel a great deal of sorrow of a poor ten year old who through his innocence becomes a scapegoat for his inability to completely conform. The ending is very significant. Raja is arrested because he is seen as incompetent in his control of the group and commits suicide. Zoran gets to meet Tito at the palace but when all the kids run to Tito Zoran realizes for the first time that the political regime is using these kids to prop up the state through their worship and devotion to Tito. Zoran realizes that the state is not about innocence youth and about promoting the image of a great leader who all should totally admire and be devoted to but beneath that brutality and pain to those who cannot conform and go along with it all. So in defiance Zoran goes off to another room filled with food to eat. The movie is interesting because although Yugloslavia is not as undemocratic as most of the other Communist states of the time it is still a place where there is a thin line between getting along with regime and being seen as an obstacle.".

Sent on a trip with his classmates to recite the poem to Tito Zoran develops feelings for a girl in the group while repeatedly angering the chaperone.I wasn't familiar with Markovi or his work before watching this movie. A previous reviewer said that Markovi's work after Tito and Me sucked. I can neither confirm nor refute that but having seen this movie I'd like to see at least one more of his movies. As for Yugoslavia in the 1950s I also recommend Emir Kusturica's When Father Was Away on Business. I'd also like to see a movie or two about Yugoslavia's foreign relations especially how Tito's defiance of the Soviet Union resulted in Yugoslavia's expulsion from the Eastern Bloc as Howard Zinn put it the Soviet Union  like the US  didn't want to support any revolution that it couldn't control.".

	schema:reviewBody "The Serbs say this is the best Serbian film ever made which I think underestimates it  it may be the best film anyone made in the 1980s. Released in 1982 when Yugoslavia was a functioning state rather than international shorthand for murder and genocide it casts a baleful look backward that becomes in the light of all the subsequent blood almost unbearably poignant and prophetic. It would be too much if it weren't constantly brutally laughoutloud funny  funny even in subtitles funny as slapstick and deeply classically comic at the same time.It is set in the 1930s in a backwater small town in Serbia where the Topalovic family has its funeral home.. Topalovic women fade away like flowers immediately after bearing a boy while the men live on and on  creating the Marathon reference in the title. In an effervescent scene we meet six generations of Topalovic men each one of whom mercilessly beats and bullies the younger ones. The film centers on the youngest the tall and nonetoobright Mirko lover of movies and Cristina piano player at the town's movie house and daughter of the local gangster Billy Python who supplies the Topalovic home with used coffins dug up and emptied of their previous occupants.The action revolves around three events the death of the very oldest Topalovic the desire of Mirko's imbecilic cowardly and conniving father Lucky to break up the MirkoCristina affair and  and this is resoundingly delicious  the arrival of sound film in the town putting Cristina out of a job.The writer Dusan Kovacevic adapted the script  from his own play and director Slobodan Sijan gets an amazingly good ensemble cast of actors to run the machinery in high gear flat out. It starts dark and gets darker with crematorium jokes the wave of the future vintage silent Yugoslav film commercials and clips and slides laughing more and more wildly into violence that flies out of control  The tie to what happened to Serbia only a few years later spins the movie up another level. That the tie is not accidental  is underlined by the opening sequence  newsreel footage of the assassination in France of the King of Serbia in the early 20s. The wonderful musical theme raucous and melancholy at the same time is by Zoran Simjanovic. You don't know me but do yourself a favor and see this one.".

The plot is based on the story about the youngest member of the Topalovic family which is in the coffinmaking business for more than a century. But the youngest member doesn't want to live this kind of lifehe wants to marry the mafia boss' daughter and to live the life of an artist since he is impressed with the movies this all happens back in the year 1935. But the mafia boss tries to use him to destroy the opponents  the Topalovic's themselves. This is the shortest possible plot of the best movie ever made. I have seen this movie for over 20 yes twenty!!! times and I think there is not a single person in Serbia that didn't see it. This is the best and the hardest one to make kind of movie  it's a comedy without a single moment of triviality. If you were not a habitant of the former Yugoslavia the names of the actors probably mean nothing to you. But these actors are incredible! They are absolutely hilarious and are the reason for outstanding popularity of the movie. Almost every phrase used in the movie became a part of the usual conversation of the people here in Serbia. I know you probably aren't convinced and still think that The Godfather or Gone With The Wind are the best movies you will see in your lifetime. And I would probably have to agree if there wasn't for that one little movie made 20 years ago in Serbia.".

	schema:headline " Not the very best of Serbian cinema but entertaining";
	schema:reviewBody "Coming from Croatia I am very much familiar with Serbian cinema. Serbian humor is very much appreciated throughout the former Yugoslavian republics and this movie is one of the prime examples of it. For those of you not familiar with it well you're missing on a lot. Unfortunately a lot of it depends on language so if you're not acquainted with Serbian language and culture a lot of the jokes will not seem so funny. What is even more disappointing for an average European or American viewer not being properly introduced to a specific laid  back Balkan mentality can also constitute a huge obstacle in understanding many nuances and sides of this and many more movies filmed throughout the Balkan peninsula. Well what can you do? I guess that's life. Somebody gets to live in a secure and prosperous geographical region while somebody else gets to live in a war zone for hundreds of years. Hey at least you get to have a specific sense of humor. That sure makes it right doesn't it? Its like with the African Americans. They have been slaves for 300 years but they have completely taken over the NBA in the last couple of years. See how God takes care of everyone? Lets get back to the movie  another example of Balkan mentality is inability to focus on what you are doing . It tells the story of an interesting all  male family of morticians  the oldest member of the family is 150 years old . The youngest family member is somewhat on a crossroad since he feels neglected and wants to take his part of the company and marry a local mobsters daughter. This mobster is actually a sick bastard who provides the family with coffins. You see all they do is dig out the old used coffins and sell them as new ones. It is the way their company operates but recently they invested in a brand new cremation unit they are dying to test... What bothered me with this movie is that many scenes felt a bit too obvious something which many people seem to neglect. Sometimes I had the impression that the writer forced some situations because he needed room for one or two jokes he came up with and wanted to use them no matter what. One of those situations is at the very beginning of the movie when the youngest mortician measures a dead man and mentions that the man now has an extra measure. He wants to see how long the man is  instead of how tall  in order to produce a fitting coffin. Bogdan Diklic is a great actor but somehow i felt that this scene was so obviously set up like this just because the writer wanted to say that we shouldn't talk of dead people as being tall but as being long. The ending is also a bit predictable. Diklic's rage piles up to that point and early on in the movie it becomes obvious that the only possible way for this movie to end is a carnage. Nevertheless you should still be able to enjoy it since it is abundant in amazing jokes and interesting comedic situations. As far as I know the script is based on a theater script written by the same author and this is in fact pretty much evident during the movie which is also a downside if you ask me. Still it is an entertaining movie but if you are really interested in Serbian or Balkan cinema at it's best you should check out some of Emir Kusturica's work.".

Serbian humor is very much appreciated throughout the former Yugoslavian republics and this movie is one of the prime examples of it. For those of you not familiar with it well you're missing on a lot.

	schema:reviewBody "Emir Kusturica's first film Do You Remember Dolly Bell? is a bittersweet comedy set in the former Yugoslavia during the 1960s. The film which won the Golden Lion Prize at the 1981 Venice Film Festival is both a coming of age story and a tribute to the city of Sarajevo long before it was devastated by civil war. To the chagrin of his strict Communist father Slobodan Aligrudic sixteenyear old Dino Slavo Stimac is more into hypnosis and selfhelp mantras than Marxist ideology. He recites the phrase Every day in every way I'm getting better and better and sings in a new band mandated by the local Eastern European bureaucracy as they relax the Communist grip and allow some influence of Western culture.Dino's family of six live in a cramped oneroom house while they wait for state housing. The father drinks excessively and the family is poor. This is underscored when during a visit to relatives the youngest boy makes a point of saying how much he wishes he had a bicycle like the one he sees in the relative's home. Through Dino's relationship with Sonny an unsavory pimp he meets a cabaret singer and prostitute Dolly Bell Ljiljana Blagojevic named after a stripper in an Italian film they had seen recently at the Culture Club. Dolly is forced by Sonny to wait in the attic of Dino's home until he returns and Dino is a passive onlooker as a band of delinquent boys take their turn with her.Dino's sweet innocence captivates the young girl however and the two form a bond that results in Dino's sexual initiation and first love affair. Dino has to cope with his father's illness a lung cancer that has become lifethreatening and their days together reveal a much mellower man who tells Dino he knew about the girl in the loft and no longer disapproves his using hypnosis and autosuggestion. While Dolly Bell lacks the polish and cinematic flair of Kusturica's later work it is an honest and intelligent film one that avoids sentimentality and provides compelling insight into what it meant to grow up in Eastern Europe during the sixties.".

	schema:reviewBody "Kusturica is something of a challenge for me to parse. The experience is a bit troubling because it seems so genuine that we should be ashamed for intruding. He does not seem to accomplish this by ordinary means. Yes the acting is good but what works here is something quite a bit deeper than usual.Instead of the world of the film coming to us as is usually the case he inserts the camera in such a way that we  or rather our intent to see  brings it into being. This is an early film and already he seems to have mastered the art of composition. This has a couple of his trademarked panning sequences that are the most elaborately choreographed I know. But more than that each scene progresses through what seems to be an ordered diorama of gypsy projection. It is intensely human. I can imagine the filmmaker crying as he blocks the shot and places the actors lights camera.I can imagine him obsessing over how objects and shadows form families that work the way the central family does here. I can see his passion in how he guides the camera in arcs that are unnatural. It is a wonder he continued to make films such is the obvious cost.A lost nation. A lost larger family. A lost love. Do we remember? Can you?Because I encounter young filmmakers and see their first works I know it is possible to spring whole into the art allowing open completion of soul to make up for insufficient craft. As time went on Emir learned to layer humor and circumstance to tell a story. But nothing he will do can match this his first love.Ted's Evaluation  3 of 3 Worth watching.".

	schema:reviewBody "Post written by a person nicknamed No Gods perhaps just proves that this movie may not be for consumption by audiences outside of the Balkans. Heshe completely missed the point. There's so much more to this movie watching it was of great joy and delight for me.It gives an honest simple and raw account of Sarajevo realities back in the 1960s when it was an expanding city in Tito's Yugoslavia. 'Dolly Bell' offers many memorable snapshots that it uses as setting teenagers mimicking Adriano Celentano audiences watching 'Rome by night' couples with children dreaming of moving into new housing complexes built by the communist government lunches with extended family members community center struggling to buy instruments for their band.....etc etc. And all this while the main character Dino played by Kusturica's favourite Slavko Stimac is finding his way through adolescence.Basically the movie is Kusturica's and Sidran's love letter to their respective childhoods which happened to take place during an interesting time in Yugoslav history not too long after World War II when the country was being rebuilt under new social order and a tangible sense of excitement of participating in something good and worthy was felt amongst certain sections of its population.Kusturica would of course go on to make much more serious and challenging films later in his career but this one shows his ability to successfully deal with simple stories that are not driven by big complex ideas and don't have an instantly dramatic setting.".

	schema:reviewBody "In a style that reminds us of Italian neorealism of last century forties and fifties Kusturica gives us in syncopated sequences the story of a not so wealthy family whose head is a diehard Marxist who still believes that communism will come in 2000 this movie dates back to 1981. The youngsters of the family however and like youngsters all over the world are more inclined to rock music than to communism. The story develops itself in episodes of great realism in terms of images against the background of socialist Yugoslavia which appears here and there in the speeches of a local official who thinks that juvenile delinquency can be fought by creating a juvenile rock ensemble in a club in the Marxist talk of the old father and in the efforts he makes to get a house provided by the State to replace the squalid dwelling where the family lives. Ironically this will come only after his death. Behind the apparent simplicity of the story we feel that its characters have deepness of feelings and reactions being very human. Love is present in its various forms though shown almost bashfully. The love between father and son and the love between the son and the young prostitute for instance. The action takes place in Bosnia but nothing in the movie makes us to surmise the bloodbath that occurred there 20 years after. In conclusion we can say this is a good and well made movie.".

	schema:headline " Somewhat frustratingly remembering Dolly Bell and wanting to revisit Dolly Bell any time in the near future are two different things.";
	schema:reviewBody "Do You Remember Dolly Bell? is a sweet and good natured coming of age tale which lands around about half way between attempting to get across a really well intended and light hearted story of early adulthood with an atmosphere of a 'universal' kind with a downtrodden gangster infused lessthanwelloff and quite scary feel about things. Thenfirst time Yugoslavian director Emir Kusturica spends the best part of the piece looking at the thematic ideas of growing up and first interactions with the opposite sex twinned with what it is to assert yourself grow a sense of individualism as well as find one's interests and general form. These ideas are bitten off with the intent to chew them all up real good but everything sort of falls half way between this lighthearted study of adolescence and heavy study of harsh realities of living in the time and place it's set.Kusturica is setting out to tell a tale of coming of age his lead is a young boy of whom it is established is observant of the world around him and I think this observant nature is a recent characteristic of his persona. He watches films within this film the piece constructing his gaze at the images on the screen in the local viewing theatre accordingly his interest in items of a political nature are got across when he talks with his father about Communist merits and there is certainly that general sense he's forming his own identity as skills and interests in playing a musical instrument and learning a mite of a foreign language Italian in this case is put across in a few scenes that advance the character as an individual moreso the film overall. Indeed the recurring line the lead merrily sings namely Everyday I'm getting better in every way enforces the transition.The lead is a certain Dino timac a young man whom hangs out with his friends as they smoke and drink while suffering through one another's tired false stories of how they've interacted in certain ways with girls in recent days. Of the friends he has the most prominent is a taller boy named Marbles. Things get complicated when some shady local individuals want Dino to hide a call girl for them something Dino accepts and goes on to stow her away in a barncomebird hutch of some description located within his house's grounds to the rest of his families unbeknownst. The girl is the one of the title a certain Dolly Bell Blagojevic. Of his family it's established that a pretty ordinary evening with them consists of sitting around a table as talk of exactly what it was they did during their day is instigated by the father. To the side of them as they all sit around opposite one another is a leak in the roof as the rain pours down a metaphorical seeping through the blockade as Dino his sister and the rest of them admit to feelings and desires which are seeping through their minds and coming out as an expression of intent.In Do You Remember Dolly Bell? you have an idea or a premise  the notion that specific content I find quite interesting is playing out. So why is it the film felt as underwhelming as it was? It feels inconsistent too often opting for unnecessary and somewhat kooky content which frustrates more than it does either add to the character study unfolding in front of us or make us laugh if we've seen the band play that somewhat annoying song once or twice we don't need it an extended third time. This and a rather bizarre trip to some relatives as an entire subplot revolving around some local council bigwigs and their want want to hire Dino the boys and their band to play for other local youngsters quite frankly could have been entirely scrapped. The film additionally carries an upbeat tone something that doesn't entirely sit  there's a real lack of threat which is especially odd given what's at stake with his family the hidden girl and the local criminals. Certain revelations do unravel but they carry very little dramatic weight and fizzle out as they play out.Compared to another film of this ilk from around the time namely Bill Forsyth's Gregory's Girl Do You Remember Dolly Bell? plods along and feels unconcentrated as the USP around which the coming of age study is played out gets shoved towards the back and forgotten about. I also think Kusturica wants to raise awareness of times gone by indeed life at a time when living in Yugoslavia may well have been less glamorous than it might have been in the then modern day when the film was produced. Is there a specific reason the film is set in the early 1960s  a whole two decades prior to the film's production? This comes across as somewhat needless as if the director is attempting to get across the idea that comingofage and growing up in all walks of life regardless of nation nationality conditions or time is the same. The basing of this tale so far back in the thentwenty years ago past acts as a trigger designed to evoke a faux sense of nostalgia a sense that it unfolds in the past and the subject matter playing out most certainly happened to the designated audience in the past. While I haven't seen any of the director's other films I'm informed that he's gone on to have quite a career cracking the American scene and making some rather acclaimed films. Do You Remember Dolly Bell? is a calling card a clear and relatively well executed demonstration that he can handle the subject matter which he only really renders everso slightly interesting.".

	schema:reviewBody "The first scene of 'Sjecas li se Dolly Bell' 'Do You Remember Dolly Bell' happens in a tern meeting room where old people debate the dire state of the morals of the youth and decide that what they need to make a change in their lives is a musical band. The people debating are badly dressed they use a wooden language they do not believe what they say but playing the game of political meetings is part of their lives. The second scene happens someplace in the hills. Music is loud and trash people are unhappy but funny in their way there is force and life beyond the poverty of the landscape around. I think that even if I did not know that this is the first full time feature film of Emir Kusturica I would have made the association and recognized that we are in Kusturica's universe. The main lines and the personality unique to the work of one of the greatest directors of our time are already present.The moment in time when this film was made was 1981. This is significant from many points of view. At the end of the decade Communism will be brought down in Europe and in retrospective we can say that the signs were there and this film can be seen as an example but nobody would have believed it certainly not the people living with no apparent hope and future behind the Iron Curtain. The film is made in Sarajevo the city of birth of Kusturica and the action happens a little more than a decade before at the start of a period of relative relaxation in the politics of the Communist Yugoslavia. The same number of years after the making of the film the name of the city will become a symbol of the interethnic and religious conflict of the Balkans the place where neighbors killed each other blindly and relentlessly in the aftermath of the Yugoslav union. The seeds of the conflict are visible in this film as well in a scene towards the end where dispute arises between the traditional way of mourning of the Sarajevo Muslims and the Communist ways. The conflict seems to emerge from nothing and be about nothing it cannot be understood by an outsider but are not so all conflicts where people fight each other for symbols letting humanity slide away from their minds? The film can be read as a political film and it took certainly a lot of courage for Kusturica to make it this way. Describing the lack of perspective and hope of a full generation or even bringing to screen a coming to age obsessed by sex and pain may be universal themes when the film is made in freedom but was no easy thing to bring to screen in Yugoslavia in 1981. It is also a very human film which gives birth to a plethora of characters like the ones that will continue to populate 'the land of Balkans according to Kusturica' in his next few great movies. It's not a perfect film it takes off a little bit slowly and heavily but when we get into the action and the feelings of the characters we start to deeply care for them. The father acted by Slobodan Aligrudic is an unforgettable figure with his mix of irony and ideological stiffness of rudeness and hidden tenderness. Welcome to the world of Emir Kusturica!".

	schema:reviewBody "I simply can't believe there are so few viewer comments for this movie that won the PALME D'OR in Cannes in 1985!  By the way it represented Yugoslavia a country wich no longer exists...It was much of a surprise back then as Kusturica was totally unknown and the movie was entirely produced at home with no financial contribution from abroad. No doubt this is in the top 3 of best Yugoslavian films if not he best one ever.This film is a historical not only because it deals with a specific historical context but most of all because it was all done in SARAJEVO a mere six years before the outbreak of war at a time when nobody suspected how things would eventually turn out. Note that the movie shows a place where Muslims Christians and Jews coexist in peace and this is quite a symbol today when you watch it knowing what came next. It is highly probable that some of the crew died during the Yugoslav conflict which took place around that same city and cost 300000 lives.The lead role by little Moreno de Bartolli is certainly one of the most amazing child performances on screen ever. Otherwise two of the actors appeared in famous films after that. Miki Manojlovic who plays the father is a Kusturica regular and has become famous internationally the late Davor Dujmovic who plays the elder brother plays also the lead role as Perhan in Time of the Gypsies. Generally speaking all the acting here is first class.Also it isn't so often that  the world of adults is shown through the eyes of a child and when it's done it is often in a twee or awkward manner. Not at all here. Besides Kusturica's first work has a very honest and sensitive approach of themes like fatherhood adultery and betrayal. It 's all lightyears away from the frenzy found in the artist's later work.Warning  this movie is highly emotional. When I saw it again recently after a long time I'm not ashamed to say I wept twice and I'm not a single case. Yet it is often very funny as well. Note that unlike many European movies it ends rather well and on a hopeful note. If you like tragicomical movies like the Bicycle Thief no doubt you will love this too.The very light sexual allusions and nudity caused an R rating in America. Quite a pity as this work is far more decent than most releases and would be a lot more interesting and appealing for young audiences than the idiotic stuff they are used to watch. I would even consider showing this in schools.Definitely a 10 out of 10 as far as I'm concerned.".

	schema:reviewBody "Winner of the award for Best Film at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival and Academy Award nominee for Best Foreign Film Emir Kusturica's When Father Was Away on Business is a blend of comedy family drama and political realism that is courageous funny and deeply moving. The title of the film refers to the lie told to a sixyearold to cover up the fact that his father was serving time in a labor camp for making a thoughtless remark that offended the Communist apparatchiks. Set in Yugoslavia in 1950 after the break between Stalin and Tito it was a time of confusion when people worshiped Stalin one week and despised him the next. The story is told from the perspective of sixyearold Malik Moreno D'E Bartolli and his performance is natural and convincing.His father Mesa Miki Manojlovic is a lowlevel bureaucrat who spends more time womanizing and drinking than attending to his job. A casual remark filled with sarcasm about a political cartoon made to his wife Sena's Mirjana Karanovic sisterinlaw Ankica Mira Furlan leads to his arrest and detention by Zijo Mustafa Nadarevic a Communist Party official who also happens to be his wife's brother. Mesa is sent to work in the mines while Sena becomes a seamstress to make ends meet and his sensitive son starts sleepwalking perhaps a wry metaphor for the status of the people under Marshal Tito.The family does reunite when Mesa is sent to a remote settlement for further resocialization but he does not change his ways and visits prostitutes with the party official in charge of his rehabilitation using Malik as his escort. In a subplot Malik who looks and acts more like ten or eleven than six falls in love with a girl about his age who is suffering from a serious blood disorder and their inevitable separation is quite touching. Though family relations are strained especially between Sena Zijo and Ankica the family is very strong and we know that somehow they will endure. When Father Was Away on Business is perhaps the least daring cinematic ally of all of Kusturica's works but it is one of the most heartfelt and gained the director his first international success paving the way for the full maturation of his vision in the brilliant and disturbing Underground.".

	schema:reviewBody "There have been several movies about the adult world as seen by children. Daniel and Matinee are good examples from the United States. A good one from the former Yugoslavia is Emir Kusturica's Otac na sluzbenom putu When Father Was Away on Business in English.When Sarajevo man Mesa is arrested in 1950 for criticizing a cartoon his wife Sena has to tell son Malik that the dad is on a business trip. As the movie progresses Malik comes to understand the political status quo in this country straddling east and west. Moreover it becomes clear that Mesa is not the world's most responsible person preferring to go screw attractive women to raising his son.One thing is that I like seeing films about cultures that we rarely see. Beyond that this look at political tensions  and how the boy has to learn about sex on his own  fascinates me. I definitely recommend the movie.PS Emir Kusturica also directed Arizona Dream starring Johnny Depp Jerry Lewis and Faye Dunaway in the United States and Black Cat White Cat back in his native country.Tito's disagreements with Stalin led to Yugoslavia's expulsion from the Eastern Bloc so it aligned itself with the west but maintained an Eastern Blocstyle government.".

There is one thing that I have to mention  the subtitles are pretty bad and do not do the justice to the movie  they can be expressed much much better!

The film itself is very good but it would certainly help your perception if you were familiar with historical aspect of it all. Some similarities can be drawn to Tito i ja because Otac.. is seen through a child's point of view but then it was made something like ten years prior to Tito i ja so I guess you should disregard that statement altogether. The film is a drama from start to finish and like other Kusturica's films it requires much of emotional involvement as well as some patience. But I definitely like it although it's not for everyone.

Maybe it can be a bit confusing if you do not know enough about time and place of the plot.I also liked that the movie does not depend too much on dialogues there is no trashtalking at all. And although I like trashtalking very much it would have spoiled this movie. The way the story is told is rather picturesque. Almost fairytalelike! Having said that it is not that easy to understand the idea of the movie. But maybe that's because of me  Each time I watch the movie I discover something new that draws my attention. And I still have not reached the stage where I can say OK now I have seen enough. As it is I am looking forward to watching this movie again and hopefully again. There's not much more to say really.

	schema:reviewBody "Kusturica can really move me he's one of very few filmmakers I trust and allow into my life to do that. It is in a very delicate way he can affect a way that I also know and appreciate deeply from some of the great Zen and Sufi poets. He has that quality let's call it a duende of having lived with enough ardor and zest of soul to be able to speak about a sadness that is joy. About pain without ego. Struggle as release.And on top of that he's so adept with images it hurts. He knows how to frame a small puddle of water so that it reflects entire skies above with many moons and make the moon seem wet and the waters earthy. So even though this is a more than fine film and better than most filmmakers accomplished on their second turn behind a camera I am saddened that it doesn't move me more. This is a rare complaint from me. And this is because I know this man has felt harder than he shows here and has sung what it means to feel with images that cut deeper. This also cuts but cuts solemnly in ordinary way with mostly serious restraint with a historic thrust for a respectable account of Yugoslav suffering as the suffering between brothers in law.It's just not a very enviable or interesting position to want to be the historic chronicler like he's doing here it just means you have to organize a lot of pedantic detail. Now I am from around here and can trace roots from every corner of the Balkans to be able to tell that what Kusturica usually writes about is a romance and not an account. This is a frequent complaint of course acknowledged moreso from around here where pundits feel somehow threatened or otherwise insulted by this wistful clowny image broadcast abroad for tourist consumption. So yes a romance that is about a love and life that is a little more dangerous than from the safe distance of reason a little more sublime and noble than was today or yesterday but that is nevertheless imbued with the same reckless spirit that gave rise to the chronicle that Kusturica is only a very recent chapter to.Meaning this spirit that he has used to make films preexisted him and carries its own truths from long ago. The family gatherings around food the common rituals the stories about honorable scoundrels that may be someone's father or uncle. These songs above all our main tradition being musical and fiddled continuously on the stage for a few hundred years.So when he puts it all together it is not a question of ability that makes a difference and stirs the soul  he was always able and here just as well  but one of spontaneous creation. There is only a little of that here for my taste more history. It is touching drama but lacks some of the reflections I prize so much.".

So yes a romance that is about a love and life that is a little more dangerous than from the safe distance of reason a little more sublime and noble than was today or yesterday but that is nevertheless imbued with the same reckless spirit that gave rise to the chronicle that Kusturica is only a very recent chapter to.Meaning this spirit that he has used to make films preexisted him and carries its own truths from long ago. The family gatherings around food the common rituals the stories about honorable scoundrels that may be someone's father or uncle. These songs above all our main tradition being musical and fiddled continuously on the stage for a few hundred years.So when he puts it all together it is not a question of ability that makes a difference and stirs the soul  he was always able and here just as well  but one of spontaneous creation. There is only a little of that here for my taste more history. It is touching drama but lacks some of the reflections I prize so much.";

I believed the family was Jewish only to learn from other reviews that they were actually Muslim. Also awareness of Yugoslavia's strained relationship with the USSR is helpful. While I found the film interesting the father's continued philandering made him a rather despicable figure. The young boy's retreat into sleep walking is probably a comment on what it took to survive in that society. The FatherinLaw's desire to act as if nothing had actually happened to his soninlaw is a hint here.

	schema:reviewBody "This is yet another film where I had some problem figuring out many plot elements and character relationships where some of the blame might rest on having to rely on subtitles. I also do not know much of the complicated history of Bosnia so that didn't help me to understand the context either.It took me at least half the film to figure out all of the character relationships and this is really a slice of life storyalbeit set in the 1950s in what's apparently a confusing changing communist political landscape. But it's important to know each character's relation to other characters as well as a bit of their personal backgrounds and histories with each othercharacter development is of primary importance but I'm not sure it was always fleshedout as it needed to be.It also didn't help as it never does in any film that a few characters looked very similar and at least one has a major change of appearance and a major change back. For example I never was completely clear on whether the woman on the train with the father at the beginning with whom he was having an affair he was quite the philanderer was also the female pilot in the airshow and also the gym teacher who was also his brotherinlaw's wife. And the reason that the father went away to some kind of prison work camp was never very clear to me either. Ostensibly it was because he made a remark about a cartoon in a newspaper but that seems ridiculous although maybe that's more realistic than I can imagine and is part of the point and I kept thinking that the real reason was for the brotherinlaw to get back at him for the affair with the brotherinlaw's wife.In any event despite my confusion this is a fairly good film with great performances. The family's youngest son is at times a narrator and is featured in a poignant subplot but Otac na sluzbenom putu would have benefited by making him even more of the focus and point of view.".

The story is told from the perspective of Malik his young son who believes the mother's story about father being away on business.Now the director whose name I won't write because I fear I'll butcher it is a great artist and quite possibly the greatest storyteller out of Yugoslavia. Indeed we do not think of them having a film industry and yet he has made many great works.But this is not my favorite. I love when he digs his toes into the surreal and this film fails on that count. There is still a dash of humor here and there but the film still runs a little too long and is too serious.

	schema:headline " More relevant than ever...";
	schema:reviewBody "Reading some of his interviews I'm not surprised that Emir Kusturica one of the greatest European directors despised political movies. Some directors use their movies to make a commentary which is fine as long as the story allows the viewers to extract the 'political' substance by themselves. Have you noticed that everything is political today? From the movies to their awards campaign everything revolves around issues such as race gender or resulting discrimination and that trend might inspire some filmmakers to try to have a shot by making something 'relevant' instead of something that speak to them. Today no one should ever be allowed to be personal about himself unless it's for some political statement likely to inspire claps cheers and nods. There's nothing wrong with being unpopular but with all the media outrage frenzy of our twitterdriven era you're only unpopular when you're ostracized and your detractors can cut off your capacity to reach people.That's why Kusturica could have never made movies for Hollywood or under the studio system. That's why out of all the directors who tell political stories Kusturica can make the most politically rich movies without being prisoner of one ideological perception. His Golden Palm winning Underground could be regarded as a magnificent and epic retrospective of the history of exYugoslavia but the film is also a vibrant exuberant and musically driven orgy of booze sex and passion that says more about the soul of the Balkans than any other thing. Kusturica speaks from the heart and portray characters who generally care about regimes and ideologies in the realm of their personal greed or lust they're strong but weak big guys acting like children. So much for political engagement.And it also seems that Kustrucia more than any other else knows one thing or two about human hubris. One of my regrets was to have discovered Undeground before Fellini's movies and couldn't spot the connection when I finally discovered the Maestro. Now I can fix it and say that maybe Kusturica is the most Fellinian director but he's like Fellini with a social commentary maybe the neorealisitic Fellini and it shows even more in his first Golden Palm winner When Father Was Away on Business Kusturica is one of the few directors to have won the Palm twice the story whose euphemistic title doesn't prepare for how sad it is how dramatic and yet comedic and catching at others. Forgive for the clich but like life I guess.The film takes place in Sarajevo in 1950 at the midst of the Stalin Tito Split the DVD bonus features provide many information they are so helpful I'd recommend to check them first. In fact there's an irony in the history of Yugoslavia the people were proud to fight the Nazis they didn't totally surrender to Stalin's hegemony wanting to be treated as an equal much to the Soviet Master's anger. The film contains many football games between the two countries and you can tell that Yugoslavians are taking their victories damn seriously. The film was made the same year than the Heysel tragedy just to remind that the setting of the film never deprives from its timeless and universal value. Still what a tragic irony that this pride was a doubleedged sword leading Yugoslavian multiculturalism to cause its downfall.The Split lead to the formation of a bureau named Informibrio and whose mission was to spot any potential agent of the Soviet or someone malcontent enough to become a troublemaker. It's a sort of Yugoslavian HUAC with the same paranoid implications. But Kusturica doesn't shout it clear and loud he only starts his film with a man singing Chiquita that he picked a Mexican song instead of an American or Russian one implicitly tells you the kind of attitudes that can get you in trouble. But sometimes it can be worse than singing. The pivotal moment occurs when Mesa a communist functionary played by Miki Manojlovic he was the unforgettable Marco in Underground criticizes a cartoon in newspaper Politika. Mesa just state something like they're really going too far and the comment wouldn't have taken him too far if it wasn't for his mistress to hear him. Hurt after because he can' divorce from his wife lshe denounces him to his brotherinlaw and it's a matter of a few days to get him arrested and go far away on business. Then starts a series of life episode involving his patient and enduring wife Mirjana Karanovic also starring in Underground and the two boys a geeky photography buff played by the late Davor Dujmovic and a chubby kid Mario De Bartolli he's the narrator and the film is punctuated with many episodes involving his sleepwalking.When Father Was Away on Business is both a family drama and a touching comingofage story that never overplays the pathos or the lyricism. Sarajevo is a town where four religions meet Kusturica makes the same point by showing a Muslim family practicing circumcision rituals an orthodox funeral and people of different backgrounds drinking and dancing together. As if he was sleepwalking during his own journey Kusturica says the most without saying much knowing that you're never as touched by a politican story when you can't touch its political content. The film could have been set anywhere anytime it doesn't say much about the regime only the ongoing paranoia when every word can cause your downfall.And before you consider yourself luck not to have to endure this remember that at the midst of the metoo movement an actor like Damon suffered severe backlash for a comment he made. And how many actors now are away on business because of an accusation or a suspicion. Sorry to make these interfere with the movie but while I expected a 1980's drama that would have aged a little I didn't expect a film to be so relevant.".

The poor sap it seems made a very innocent and harmless comment and because of this he was sent away from his loving family for a couple years for reeducation and forced labor. All of this was very interesting. The problem for me was that although you felt for his family you had a hard time caring for the man because beneath it all he was a major jerk who spent much of the movie being repeatedly unfaithful to his very loving wife. This unfortunately served to really blunt the impact of the film. While it COULD be said this humanized the story and made it more complex I really felt disappointed by this plot choice.".

	schema:reviewBody "Set in gangriddled Los Angeles in the 1970s director John Carpenter was inspired to make a film that was basically a combination of Rio Bravo 1959 and Night of the Living Dead 1968 with rookie cop Ethan Bishop in John Wayne's Rio Bravo roleDuane Jones' Ben a recently vacated police precinct as the small town jailfarmhouse and with gang members in place of Night of the Living Dead's zombiesNathan Burdette's men.For some viewers that premise alone may be enough for them to not be able to grant this film a 10 but Assault on Precinct 13 is yet another example of why quality isn't correlated to having unprecedented ideas.One of the first striking things about Assault on Precinct 13 is that it looks beautiful. It was made on a relatively low budget and it looks like a large percentage of the money must have gone into camera rental film stock and film processing. Douglas Knapp's color cinematography is crisp innovative I just love the shot with the camera mounted in front of the car headlight with the sunset in the background and marvelously portrays Los Angeles as a gritty suburban wasteland as well if not better than any other film I can think of. What makes it effective isn't overthetop run down buildings and heavily populated streets but vast wideopen spaces with squat nondescript houses and buildings all fading into nothingness. Knapp even manages to make the streets look like this and a couple scenes are set in what is effectively a sandlogged desert with a lonely dangerous phone booth sitting in isolation. The police station also reflects the suburban wasteland look in terms of its spaces and their relationship to each other its sparseness and its colors.The low budget nature of the film forced a very successful straightforward brutal and realistic approach to the action especially the violence. Carpenter on his commentary track on the DVD notes that some scenes weren't as he would have liked because they didn't have the coverage they needed and had to let them play out longer than normal from a single angle. Thank the heavens for a lack of time and funding! Despite the overthetop mayhem in subsequent action films by other directors the impact of many of the scenes in this film cannot be topped and it's often because of the unusual almost documentarylike feel of the film.Also adding to the effect is Carpenter's score. Although it's technically primitive it's just as good as any of his other music and Carpenter is as talented as a film composer as he is as a director. His use of motifs often in an almost trancelike repetition is similar too and just as effective as both Bernard Herrmann and Ennio Morricone.The performances are all excellent and the staging is even better. If you know anything about the premise of the film before you begin watching it for the first time you may have difficulty figuring out how they're going to pull off the central situation of the film. The logistics seem to be against creating a prolonged tense situation. Carpenter and company create the perfect scenario with just a couple ingenious moves and the unending threat combined with the unusual pacing of the zombielike menace make Assault on Precinct 13 as frightening as any horror film could be.".

	schema:headline " Violent and witty";
	schema:reviewBody "This is rightly considered a classic cult movie from the 1970's by the once reliable John Carpenter who also composed the edgy early synth score. Basically it's a faint mishmash of other movies the dialogue is reminiscent of great westerns as a black policeman and a white convict battle against gang members in a Night of The Living Dead reworking. It's also tempting to draw Vietnam allegories as with many American movies of the mid 1970's and after the faceless nameless gang members die in the droves but keep attacking the besieged police station and the lawmen and the lawbreakers black and white must unite to defeat them and escape with their lives.The real joy of this movie however is the playing of the two virtually unknown leads Austin Stoker and the late Darwin Joston. They have a great almost wry chemistry and use Carpenter's strippeddown witty dialogue to great effect. Because there are no 'stars' there are no real expectations and the shocks when they come including the famous ice cream sequence are more shocking for it.The representation of women leaves a little to be desired the two female characters obviously shop at the same sweater store! but the character Lee shows some inner strength and resolve and even has time for some kind of upper hand in terms of sexual tension between herself and Joston's Napoleon Wilson.If you haven't seen this movie I urge you to watch it in terms of B movies and cult thrillers it's the yardstick in my opinion simple stylish violent witty and not remotely sentimental.".

Basically it's a faint mishmash of other movies the dialogue is reminiscent of great westerns as a black policeman and a white convict battle against gang members in a Night of The Living Dead reworking.

	schema:reviewBody "John Carpenter is one of few directors who can successfully transform their movies into giant roller coaster rides without insulting the audience. James Cameron does this sometimes but usually adds more plot to his stories. Carpenter just takes simple premises throws some characters together and lets everything evolve and unwind on their own. Assault on Precinct 13 deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Dawn of the Dead or perhaps the overrated Texas Chainsaw Massacre as a very lowbudget horrorthriller that takes a cast of unknowns places them together doesn't really delve into their backgrounds but lets everything just work itself out like clockwork. There's an eager new cop an infamous death row murderer and a relocating precinct all stuffed together into a movie about a vicious gang assault. It's brilliant in a very subtle way a sign of things to come for a director who has implemented some of the most oftused camera tricks in the horror world.He pioneered the firstperson killer perspective in Halloween  an effect sorely missed on full screen TV and VHS versions to once again be savored on the wide screen DVD presentation. Carpenter received quite a number of critical jabs in 1978 for his use of the POV technique explained to be too voyeuristic and potentially dangerous to be shown in a mainstream motion picture. Hitchcock used the POV technique very subtly in Psycho's famous shower sequence but in Halloween it was far blunter resulting in an uproar of moral complaints.No matter. Halloween became movie horror legend casting a spell over its viewers inspiring major knockoffs such as the Friday the 13th series which has overall made more money than the Halloween franchise due to more sequels than Police Academy. Assault on Precinct 13 was one of Carpenter's very first efforts at directing. It shows. The movie is flawed imperfect both technically and otherwise some of the dialogue in particular could have used fixing and the acting is nothing incredible by any means. But it still has an addictive sense of urgency and frantic pacing that makes the movie feel like one long nonstop brutal assault  even though the setup for the film takes over forty minutes. It may not be a flawless film but it is one of my favorites.It's about a new cop named Bishop Austin Stoker who is put in charge of a transferring L.A. police precinct  number thirteen. As equipment is carried out of the building and lastminute closings are made far away a bus load of convicts including notorious murderer Wilson Darwin Joston decide to stop at precinct 13 due to the fact that one of the criminals seems to be coming down with a harsh cough. And downtown a young girl is shot by a ruthless gang member. Her father shoots the killer and then flees to precinct thirteen hunted by the gang members who eventually begin to siege the precinct in a suicide raid. Trapped with two killers a few cops and a jail warden Bishop and company try to think of a way out of the place without getting shot by the vicious gang outside.That's basically it  people stuck inside a police station trying to get out without dying in the process. The movie is only ninety minutes long give or take which is a good thing because if it had been any longer it might have lost some of its pacing and become tiring. Instead there isn't a single scene in Assault on Precinct 13 that I think should have been cut. I'm sure there are some that could have been tossed onto the editing room floor but I'm glad that the movie is the way it is  it flows smoothly and we don't ever feel like a scene has gone on too long or too short. In that sense it's just about perfect.Carpenter has had one of the most successful careers of all time followed by a legion of cult fans. His Halloween is one of the greatest horror films of all time and one of the most influential. He occasionally makes his duds like any director but in this case the good far outweighs the bad. Assault on Precinct 13 is an utterly refreshing film experience that manages to maintain a fast speed but never appears to be cheating its target audience or treating them stupid. The movie is being remade in 2005 with a considerably higher budget bigger names and probably worse directing. I don't really look forward to this remake because I can almost guarantee that given the age it is being made in there will be many pointless plot explanations worse dialogue and bad direction. Assault on Precinct 13 does not really need to be made again because the first one works so well. History has taught us that most remakes are not at all on the same level as their influences  just look at Hitchcock's Psycho then Van Sant's. If it isn't broken don't fix it. Assault on Precinct 13 is not broken and it does not need to be fixed.".

	schema:reviewBody "I long for the days when John Carpenter was ingenious enough to make such excellent films as his classics like Halloween Escape From New York and of course The Thing. He's gone way downhill since those glory days but thankfully he built himself enough of a legacy that the aforementioned films will be the one's he is known for along with a little film called Assault of Precinct 13. This is one of Carpenter's very first films made back in 1976. It tells the story of a group of people holed up in a police station that is under siege by a ruthless South Los Angeles gang. It is a wicked film full of intense action riveting suspense and an incredible score written by Carpenter himself. It is a brief 90 minute flick that has a very low budget indie feel to it but this only adds to the experience which makes this film into something truly remarkable.It's hard to place exactly why I love this film. It is one of those that seems like it shouldn't be nearly as enjoyable and excellent as it is. There's plenty of cheese and its a very small scale low budget flick that doesn't possess any kind of pizazz no remarkable production value and no big name stars to carry the film. But it might just be all of these things that combine to make this film so much fun and so incredibly compelling. Carpenter makes the most out of what little he has and makes a uniquely awesome film. Herein lies a style that you either love or hate. If you can stand low budget action then you should love this film as I do. If you long for something bigger then chances are you won't get much out of this. It's a matter of personal preference but my preferences make me enjoy this film almost too much.Something else that makes this film work is its overall tone. It's a very serious and hard hitting film. It is brutal and unapologetic when it comes to the level of violence and it doesn't hold back. The immense darkness of the film makes us believe in what we are seeing and draws us deep into the film's driving emotion and sincerely intense action. This film is not satire it's not a farce it's not a parody. It is it's own type of film managing to be utterly serious and absolutely wicked. This is a must see whether you are a John Carpenter fan or not.".

	schema:reviewBody "When a man and his daughter drive down the wrong street they get into the middle of a gang shooting. The little girl is killed and the father left distraught but armed with another victim's gun. He catches up with the gang and kills the leader before seeking refuge in a local police station. However the station is only manned by a few staff as it is in the process of being shut down. A prison wagon also arrives at the station with sick prisoners for temporary holding  however it is then that the street gang launch their attack with stolen and silenced automatic weapons.I had half watched this film several years ago and didn't review it then because I knew I had been distracted and not able to give it enough attention to be able to form a fair opinion of it  however I didn't really enjoy it then. Giving it another chance produced a much more enjoyable film even if it seems very basic on the face of it. The plot seems very simple and in fairness it is  gang outside people inside people try to keep gang out and stay alive. This is doing it a disservice of course because it creates an enjoyable tension from this simple setup and delivers some enjoyable if basic action and thrills. The direction is good my personal favourite shot being the shot near the end where the smoke clears! This effective delivery is also aided by Carpenter's own score that is nicely pulsating and still sounds great even if it is dated  the important thing is that it still fits the film and therefore works.The dialogue is trashy but this fits the slight bmovie feel the film has. The characters are also quite simple very basic backgrounds and personalities for each but again this seems to work really well. The strength of having a mostly unknown cast is that you can't be sure who will live or die by the end of the film. Despite being mostly unknowns to me anyway the performances are generally very enjoyable even if no Oscars are being given out. Stoker and Joston lead the film really well and give good natural performances with an overflow of charisma. I don't know the other's outside of these two but the rest were good as well even if the film belongs to Bishop and Wilson. I was a bit let down by the lack of a central bad guy but in one regard the film also uses this well by making the gang an unseen threat that could be an isolated group or an army.Overall this is a very basic film in several regards but it is also a very effective and enjoyable one. If you are looking for film references then there are some to be had but for most of us the film's charismatic leads action and effective tension will be what we stay for  and luckily it has all those with some to spare.".

	schema:headline " on par with its inspirations a must see Carpenter classic";
	schema:reviewBody "Ackowledged by it's own creator on the DVD Assault on Precinct 13 is a bit more of a hybrid than just a sheer homage to Howard Hawks's Rio Bravo. It has traces of that editing name hoho and of the Western specifics in bits of the storytelling devices and stereotypes. But it also has traces of the horror film of the basic theme of demise by outside forces that not only rests in the best of zombie films but also in a lot of Carpenter's later work. What makes the film seem fresh today even if it takes its time to get started in the first half hour is how focused the action is around the story. Even with these basic characters those with speaking parts closer to archetypes than not it all works. It's a practicallyperfect midnight movie.You've got your good guys a mix of cops and criminals one of them Darwin Joston's Napoleon Wilson has enough style as an actor without even flinching at times. And you've got the ravenous gang achem zombies out for blood after a gun down by a vengeful father. What surprising about how this very simple premise is set up of a showdown in the worst pit of Los Angeles is how it's all close to being just a pure exploitation film. But there's some thought or maybe just music to the film not the actual music though that's cool in its way just as relentless as in Carpenter's other work maybe even more in its rough way. It is a violent film but the violence comes and goes leaving more room for talk than one might expect given it's byathread rating. It's quite clear where the visual style would end up lending itself to in later years too i.e. Reservoir Dogs.When taking aside the occasional misstep like an unneeded suggested subplot not that Joston or Laurie Zimmer are bad actors but they lack chemistry Assault on Precinct 13 comes out without many scratches at all. It's a lean film at 90 minutes with enough tension for two more. When it is shocking it shocks when it wants a cheap solid laugh or more often grin it comes through and it doesn't pull any punches in letting you know here and there this is nothing more than a genre exercise. That Carpenter is able to pull it off so unpretentiously is a credit to his first inspiration as well as to the spirit of the long boiled ingredients of older films. In short the most cult you can find by the filmmaker without going to his previous effort Dark Star. Grade A".

	onyx:emotionText "Ackowledged by it's own creator on the DVD Assault on Precinct 13 is a bit more of a hybrid than just a sheer homage to Howard Hawks's Rio Bravo. It has traces of that editing name hoho and of the Western specifics in bits of the storytelling devices and stereotypes. But it also has traces of the horror film of the basic theme of demise by outside forces that not only rests in the best of zombie films but also in a lot of Carpenter's later work. What makes the film seem fresh today even if it takes its time to get started in the first half hour is how focused the action is around the story. Even with these basic characters those with speaking parts closer to archetypes than not it all works. It's a practicallyperfect midnight movie.You've got your good guys a mix of cops and criminals one of them Darwin Joston's Napoleon Wilson has enough style as an actor without even flinching at times. And you've got the ravenous gang achem zombies out for blood after a gun down by a vengeful father. What surprising about how this very simple premise is set up of a showdown in the worst pit of Los Angeles is how it's all close to being just a pure exploitation film. But there's some thought or maybe just music to the film not the actual music though that's cool in its way just as relentless as in Carpenter's other work maybe even more in its rough way.

	schema:reviewBody "With the release of the 2005 remake of John Carpenter's classic action film Assault on Precinct 13 rapidly approaching I took a chance and managed to purchase the last DVD copy of the special edition at my local video store and I must say that Carpenter's second directorial feature ranks amongst some of the director's finest work.The first film by Carpenter that I really liked was The Thing 1982 because it utilized its claustrophobic setting and escalating tension by focusing on the paranoia of the characters rather than splattering the screen with pointless action.Assault on Precinct 13 has much in common with The Thing in this sense the mounting tension and fears between the characters which of course help to further the plot and heighten a slight emotional attachment to the leads.I'll say that Carpenter's film is a perfect example of what's wrong with a lot of movies today and how Hollywood has grown less skillful and daring over the years. For those that don't know what I mean just watch the scene in Precinct with the wrongflavored ice cream to get an idea of just HOW far Carpenter was willing to go with this picture.Though the primary setting for the action in this movie takes place at the abandoned police station in Precinct 9 Division 13 it opens with the shooting deaths of six Los Angeles gang members by the police. News breaks on random radio stations inform the audience that a large cache of weapons was stolen from a facility and the police are overworked with the rapid rise in crime over the last 24 hours.The camera then centers on four sinisterlooking individuals in their living room weapons and ammo boxes strewn about they each sit like warlords at a tribal counsel plotting what evil deeds they're about to unleash. They then enter into a blood oath to the death but for what is largely unknown.Across town Bishop Austin Stoker the newly promoted lieutenant is on his way to work for his first assignment and is ordered to head over to Precinct 9 where there are only a few people working. Already many of the supplies and ammunition have been moved across town to the new police station which is located far away.At a local jail across town Nathaniel Wilson Darwin Joston is on his way to prison to face the death penalty for several murders of which the nature is presumably extreme since he's being put to death. We know it had to be something horrific since he informs one of the officers supervising him that a preacher once told him that he had seen death in his eyes.It would seem that fate or the Street Thunder the largest most powerful and deadliest gang in Los Angeles brings them all together at Precinct 9 where the few police officers on duty and a few convicts are forced to make a stand as the murderous gang members lay siege to the police station with heavyweapons fire.Carpenter's second feature is heavy on walltowall action and vicious violence but surprisingly there's a strong center about the characters and the dire situation they're trapped in. Only a handful of people remain in the police station to ward off the seemingly hundreds of faceless murderous gang members that want into the place and aren't afraid to die in the process.Carpenter owed a lot to the apparent source material Rio Bravo which had a similar plot about everyday people who are forced to make notsoeveryday decisions when they become trapped in a nightmarish situation with some very upset people looking for their blood.I can only hope that the remake of this 1976 action classic is as bold and daring as its predecessor or we'll have one hell of a flop on our hands.1010".

	schema:headline " Neat thriller from John Claustrophobia' Carpenter";
	schema:reviewBody "Assault on Precinct 13' shows Carpenter in the fine creative form of his earlier days when he produced such thriller and horror gems like Halloween' The Thing' and this little movie. As usual he eschews a complex plot in favour of a great little central concept  in this case a group of civilians prisoners and police trapped in a deserted police station under siege from a mysterious gang who want to get at one man inside.The acting in these movies is generally bland but Carpenter at least breathes some dimension into his characters. The lead role goes to Lt. Ethan Bishop Austin Stoker the cop in charge of minding the building for the night. Naturally he's honourable but there's also a good sense of pragmatism to his character. Similarly the prisoner Napoleon Darwin Joston isn't just a criminal  there's something quite human to him. The same goes for the civilians caught up  despite their disparities the characters become a relatively cohesive unit that's quite believable enjoyable without veering into grating sentimentality ever. Naturally a lot of them are cannon fodder but the loss of individuals in such movies is one of the anticipations you expect in the genre.Carpenter did a great service by making the protagonists of the piece silent. They never utter a word. They have nothing in common hailing from all races. We have no motivation for their actions and thankfully we're spared weak and frankly pointless excuses. Instead their blank faced determinism and the manner in which they mete out death lends them a horrific cold bloodedness that is far more memorable than typical thriller character building. There's not so much a sense of palpable evil but a much more terrifying sense of complete inhumanity. Carpenter also uses his great skills with claustrophobia  even the outdoor scenes are deserted lonely isolated. The actual station under siege is well designed  we're made aware of the layout quickly before the action starts so that the action sequences make sense without confusing us on issues of location. The darkness of the proceedings  pale lighting and so forth  add to the edgy mood of the characters. And Carpenter once again has a nice musical score accompanying his movie  it may sound dated but it suits the ambience and atmosphere to a tee. Assault on Precinct 13' is hardly clever. It's not claiming to be. It's a low budget work with a central siege' idea. It works because of the claustrophobic element the feeling of desperation in the characters some neat villains and fairly well fleshed characters. It may not be the pinnacle of its type but it sure is enjoyable while it lasts. 6.810.".

A rookie officer is left in charge of a few stray employees and an assortment of prisoners who must band together to battle the intruders lest they be mowed down in the path of their endless destruction.Directing As Carpenter's second directorial effort Assault stands as a prime example of the director's skill at turning something into nothing. Crafting such an intense movie with very little resources was a skill that would pay off big time a few years down the line with the release of his seminal slasher flick Halloween. There are other hints at future Carpenterisms such as his bleak world view which would be further exploited in Escape From New York and They Live. In typical Carpenter fashion very little time is wasted and when one of cinema's biggest taboos in trampled underfoot within the first 30 minutes you know you're in for a oneofakind experience. But rather than resorting to pure shock value Carpenter cuts through the ultraviolence with a dose of good humor and overthetop action. The last block of film itself plays like George Romero's Night Of The Living Dead only with thugs rather than zombies cornering our beloved characters.Cast Austin Stoker plays the wholesome hero officer in sharp contrast to the selfassured and coolasacucumber alphacriminal as played by Darwin Joston. While Stoker oozes the necessary likability Joston hams it up a bit making his character sound better on paper. No matter though as the two play off of each other beautifully and you find yourself rooting for each individual equally. Future Carpenter regulars Nancy Loomis and Charlie Cyphers have bit parts but are inconsequential to the plot. As far as the villains of the piece go they are a dimeadozen and by the end of the film there are literally dozens of them coming from out of nowhere. There isn't really a single villain you could pick out of the crowd as they are mostly faceless.Music A classic Carpenter scores pulses through the film at key moments but is never overbearing in the slightest. Within one viewing you'll find yourself tapping and humming along a surefire clue that you are watching a prime Carpenter film.The Bottom Lines Assault On Precinct 13 is a rather underappreciated classic though a minor one at that. It features a streak of ultraviolence and cynicism that could only have been produced in a postVietnam culture. Any fan of Carpenter or thrillers in general should see this groundbreaking little film at least once.Lessons Learned 1. Never ask a black man if he likes his coffee black unless you are prepared for a witty comeback.2. If an icecream man gets your order wrong it's probably best to cut your losses and not go back.".

	schema:reviewBody "You can say a lot about John Carpenter ....but not that his visions as a director are limited. He's responsible for milestones in two of my favorite genres of cinema. Horror  Halloween the Thing  and Action  Assault and Escape from New York . Carpenter was a multitalented director around the time this movie was shot. He was a master in creating unique suspense and atmosphere and he was way ahead of his time. The futuristic image his portrays here is exceptional depressive and disturbing. Therefore Assault on Precinct 13 is an absolute MUST for actionfans and cult freaks.Small SPOILERS coming up !!!!!!! The plot of Assault is surprisingly simple. Several characters are introduced briefly and after a certain incident they get united in an abandoned police station. From that moment on these different types of personalities have to fight for their lives and stick together. They're kept under siege by violent gangmembers who set their mind to slaughtering everybody inside the station. How simple this may sound it's a lot more effective than most other farfetched movies. Carpenter manages to create a claustrophobic atmosphere in his movie that lasts for almost the entire movie  also thanks to his intense and creepy musical score . The bad acting is a bit disappointing you have to keep in mind that Carpenter worked with a limited budget and rather inexperienced actors. The little weaknesses in Assault are widely compensated by the explicit violence shown on screen. For several sequences in this movie you need to have a pretty strong stomachEspecially when watching his most recent films  like Ghost of Mars and Vampires  you can't help wondering what the hell happened to John Carpenter !! He seemed to have lost every bit of his ancient talent. His modern movies are uninspired pointless and not at all memorable. You can't go wrong if you stick to his classicslike this one. Highly recommended Oh one more thing.Assault on Precinct 13 contains the most brutal and shocking slaughtering sequence I ever saw !! You'll know which one I'm talking about when you see it. Enjoy !!!".

	onyx:emotionText "You can say a lot about John Carpenter ....but not that his visions as a director are limited. He's responsible for milestones in two of my favorite genres of cinema. Horror  Halloween the Thing  and Action  Assault and Escape from New York . Carpenter was a multitalented director around the time this movie was shot. He was a master in creating unique suspense and atmosphere and he was way ahead of his time. The futuristic image his portrays here is exceptional depressive and disturbing. Therefore Assault on Precinct 13 is an absolute MUST for actionfans and cult freaks.Small SPOILERS coming up !!!!!!! The plot of Assault is surprisingly simple. Several characters are introduced briefly and after a certain incident they get united in an abandoned police station.

	schema:reviewBody "As the director behind such horror masterpieces as HALLOWEEN and THE THING John Carpenter's first shot at the action film is nothing short of amazing. Based on Howard Hawks' classic Western RIO BRAVO the original ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 is sort of an urban take on the genre but it succeeds quite well as a survivalist story.Police Officer Ethan Bishop Austin Stoker is about to have a notso memorable night as he along with fellow cops and convicts must team up in order to fight for their lives. Hiding out in an abandoned police station they are unexpectedly surrounded by a vicious multiracial gang led by the sadistically homicidal Frank Doubleday.The lack of dialog and motivation certainly makes his character more menacing despite having a short amount of screen time. Of course Doubleday's head warlord involves himself in the most controversial scene in all of cinema. The actions will raise a lot of questions like Why is he doing these murderous acts? Why is his gang brutally attacking innocent people? We may never know and frankly we don't want to know.Darwin Joston has been given one of the coolest names in movie history as slick jailbird Napoleon Wilson. The running gag involving Joston asking people for a cigarette may be considered an obsolete character trait today but it stands as an example of clever screen writing on Carpenter's behalf.Armed with a higher budget than DARK STAR the film achieves its realistic edge with unrehearsed choreography resourceful editing strategies and the always remarkable Panavision cinematography. However the slow pacing may turn off novice viewers who are more used to fastrhythm action. But I think it helps build the suspense within the economical storyline.ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 is a near perfect example of lowbudget filmmaking and a template of what is to come from John Carpenter.".

It's a bit rough around the edges as would be expected from a first time director working with a budget estimated at 150000. However if your into B movies and enjoy yourself some grindhouse theater you may want to keep on reading and check out this film when you're done.Police in LA set a trap for some gang members and gun them all down with shotguns. The gangs in the city take a blood oath to seek revenge for the killings. We then hear a radio description about some missing weapons to help set the sceneThe gangs start terrorizing some run down parts of the city. They even gun down the poor ice cream man. After a man's daughter is killed he gets revenge by shooting one of the gang leaders and then half out of his mind seeks refuge in a police station Unfortunately for him that police station is being decommissioned and is pretty much mothballed at this point. A few secretaries and a couple of officers are all that remain at the station. Soon a police van on the way to a prison stops due to a sick inmate on board. While they are attempting to enter the police station the horde of well armed gang members attackThere was some serious tension up to this point in the film. The initial set up of the plot takes about thirty minutes then the real fun starts. Due to being vastly outnumbered and outgunned Officer Bishop Stoker releases the two remaining prisoners Wilson Joston and Wells Burton to help defend the police stationWave after wave of gang members attack the station house and get blasted by witty shotgun wielding Napoleon Wilson Officer Bishop and Hard as nails secretary Leigh Zimmer. There are some great action scenes during the combat in this sequence. The witty dialogue burning sexual tension between Wilson and Leigh and balls to the wall violence will impress fans of the genreWhile Stoker and Joston managed to land some minor roles in the future this film sports a fairly unknown cast. Joston supposedly landed the role due to the fact that he was John Carpenters neighbor when Carpenter wrote the script. Carpenter also wrote the score for the film as well as directing and writing the screenplay. While it sounds a bit like it was done on a Casio keyboard in someone's bathroom it fits in well with the filmThis film is a solid 1970's B movie and as such has attracted a bit of a cult following. Fans of John Carpenter might also want to view the film as a means of gauging his progression as a director. Assault on precinct 13 is currently available on Netflix for streaming and is available on Amazon in DVD format for under 10.".

	schema:headline " A fun Carpenter classic";
	schema:reviewBody "Assault on Precinct 13 is a siege thriller set in an L.A. police station. The movie chronicles a few tense hours as a closing precinct is attacked by a large group of gang members. Typical of Carpenter the film has a lonely and oppressive low budget feel. The evoked mood is one of the movies greatest strengths. In a way the film comes off as unnervingly real. That the attackers are relatively unorganized is to be expected. What makes this story chilling is the sense that this is animal against animal. The humanity of the gang members is left blank so as to emphasize the brutal nature of the attack. This is not akin to Bataan in which the enemy was defaced for propaganda. Rather Carpenter hits on the feeling of simple ferocious and violent confrontation.While the film does elicit wonderful fears about life or death struggle Carpenter did cut some corners. A somewhat distracting refrain comes from the protagonists repeatedly saying that back up is soon to arrive. Even though Carpenter has armed the gang with silenced weapons the staggering degree of isolation is hard to swallow especially when regularly reminded. A second issue is the way in which the assault is finally discovered. Deus ex machina is a functioning formula but when employed it leaves much to be desired. In AoP13 the arrival of the cavalry feels almost as if Carpenter had run out of ideas or had written himself into an unwanted tragedy and needed a way out. The above and a few other issues aside the film is a well paced thriller. In addition the four protagonist characters stand out as near perfect use of stock characterization. The straight as an arrow cop the dark yet honorable criminal the world weary female lead and the overly boastful yet kind convict are all well portrayed and convincing enough. In fact Carpenter has added enough touches to these people so that the audience really can empathize with them.As with most low budget films the over all technical display is modest. The cinematography is confined to set pieces and urban waste. The editing and pacing typical of Carpenter begin slowly and build to an exciting and fast climax. The score another Carpenter addition is fitting and accents the stark mood well. The highlights of the film really are the eerie feeling of brute competition and the easy to identify with characters. Overall this is a fun film that achieves more than most low budget offerings.On a personal note I will recommend this film for future movie nights. While AoP13 is not a film to be watched once a month it is a tense pot boiler that has a wide appeal. 7.3 of 10 stars.".

	schema:reviewBody "Siege battles have always been my favorite type of battle there is just always something gratifying and exhilarating seeing few overcome or at least try to overcome against innumerable odds which seems almost hopeless. And just the sheer intensity of being alone against the world and whatever means you use to stay alive and win. This is my second favorite film from my favorite movie director John Carpenter it's also one of my favorite action movies and films in general.This was his first silver screen film I'd say it was one helluva start and has aged well over the decades yeah there has been many movies and TV shows that have utilized this formula but this film does it with perfection and I still feel is the best.I love the fact that it's done on a low budget which is fine by me because that helped give the film the right look and feel it also feels like the filmmakers really put effort to their work. From the locale down to the enviorment it takes place it feels like any place else that I've passed by. And as usual with Carpenter this film has one of the best damn scores I've ever heard and is memorable. From the music that goes on in the film down to the theme song.I like the plot it really does feel plausible makes me wonder if any gangs or crime organization might of thought of doing something like this in the back of their mind. The action is great looks and feels realistic doesn't look as though it was perfectly choreographed as any Jackie Chan film would which gives the action a slight sense of unpredictability.The two protagonists Biship and Napolion played by Austin Stolker and Dawrin Joston shame both didn't have more are great like the chemistry between them which makes this film also kinda a buddy cop movie so in a way this film helped pave the way for future buddy cop films like Lethal Weapon and the underrated Drive. Like in most those movies both characters are dynamic opposites and yet they have and form a bond. It's true that both characters don't have much depth but you get little hints of depth which make them all the more interesting sometimes what you don't say says a lot about a person and sometimes I find when you know a character so well they tend to be less interesting.Biship is the figure of authority but I think is pretty cool just has sort of that easygoing attitude where you can easily be friends with the guy I like his leadership quality the way he conducts things in the situation I can't help but feel he's can make Captain I'd follow him. We also in one scene see Biship use to be a rebel and even lived on the wrong side of the tracks just seeing him as a police lieutenant now just shows that not everyone that lives on those tracks turns out bad.Napolion is a figure of anti authority. He's rebellious doesn't take crap from people that give him crap a real butt kicker but also kinda a passive aggressive type. But what I like is just the sense of mystic of his character he is a death row inmate that has killed people but how he talks and the way he composes himself were not sure if those people he killed were really innocent. I also can't help but feel he could be an ex army or marine just from the way he handles that shotgun I don't know your theories are as good as mine but still you have to wonder.The Street Thunder are great opponents for the two I really like how this gang is handled their scary because they feel like they could exist. It's true they never say anything in the film but it's really in their actions and behavior that make them all the more menacing they have no movie for their killing it's like these guys are just doing it just to have fun or mere boredom. I also like how their sort of like game hunters in some parts of the film they don't do anything at first but when their moment comes you know they will. One scene which really disturbed me was when one member took out a sniper rifle and as they were driving by this guy was either practicing or thinking of killing whoever walked on the sidewalk I'll admit that was scary because it made me wonder it made me wonder if someone ever put cross hairs on me whenever I walk on the streets.What I like the most is the sense of suspense which is does great. I like the use of darkness in the film it really creates a sense of unseen danger that someone could just come out of the shadows or hit you and you wouldn't know where. The sounds of the silencers and where the gangs are positioned but worst of all just the mere quiet really gave that sense of isolation dread and sometimes impending doom. Assault on Precent 13 has plenty of ammo and firepower.Rating 4 stars".

The little girl's father is in a telephone booth and when he discovers his girl dead he chases after the gang members and actually kills one of them. The gang then chase the father into an abandoned police station with only a few police officers and three prisoners. The gang cuts all the power in the area and begin an assault on the building. This is one of John Carpenter's best films right up there up The Thing.".

There's little plot or character depthi just didn't feel sorry or care about any of the characters and if they were to have their brains blasted out i would not have been that shocked.I also thought that the acting was wooden as none of the characters seem very scared at what was happening to them. There are some plus points in the film such as there's one killing scene which i thought was brutal and darwin joston gave the film some black humor with his 'got a smoke?' catchphrase but the rest of the castespecially lauren zimmercould and should have done better. Overall there are gome good points and it is a low budget thriller so i didn't expect amazing action scenes but ultimately this just seemed run of the mill fare.Verdict 510".

Newly promoted Lieutenant Ethan Bishop is put in charge of precinct 9 division 13 during the last few hours before it is permanently closed down. The station is shortstaffed with Captain Chaney and the station's two secretaries Leigh and Julie. Starker is in command of a prison bus transporting Napoleon Wilson and Death Row inmate Wells. They stop at the precinct to get help for sick prisoner Caudell. The gangs go on a rampage chasing Lawson to the precinct where they lay siege.It takes too long for the movie to get going. There are way too many separate stories that have to gather into the precinct. It's usual to see a little girl with an ice cream cone get shot in the chest but that could have been done without doing a long story with the father. The point is to get these people into the precinct like a fort in the old west. John Carpenter wrote and directed this strip down action thriller. The gun fights aren't that exciting. All the gangsters use silencers which makes for less exciting sound effects. Also the slow moving cars is not that effective in driving the excitement. The acting is pretty stiff. I don't really understand why the characters just stand around. They could at least barricade the station. Plenty of bad guys get killed but nobody thinks to strip them of their weapons. In general this movie would make more sense if this is some small town police station. It would be a much better fit for the wild west fort. Nevertheless it's still a relatively good low budget Bmovie action after a slow start.".

Story is good at least a part of it  but why  oh why would someone try to put prisoners in abandoned precinct when 3 blocks ahead is a new one? why would gang members without any cause shoot young girl and ice cream man? Why would hundreds of gang members run to attack precinct like some kind of animals and get killed and why no one had gun when in the beginning of the movie it is said they stole lots of guns. Why would a serial killer sentenced to murder help defend precinct... Movie is full of flaws ... but in a way it's entertaining. Atmosphere is very good. Claustrophobic like there is no way out and precinct is placed in the middle of city...so good work for that. Soundtrack! I loved it. That theme so spooky it definitely fits good in movie.

And then boredom set in for some reason Carpenter decided to take his sweet time with getting to the point  namely the assault on Precinct 13  and this takes about halfanhour. But before the assault takes place Carpenter gives us a major taste of the absurdity to come the scene with the little girl going back for a different icecream but of course... and then getting shot  just like that  by the gang they shoot her for no reason and jeopardize their revenge mission that way. Dumb. The father of the girl then chases after the killers only to reach and kill  of all of the numerous gang members  the one gang member who killed his girl after getting shot our vicious yet illogical gang member then falls sideways like a tree. The father of the girl then gets chased by some other gang members and reaches Precinct 13 where he suddenly loses his ability to speak at the moment when he is trying to inform the Precinct's occupants of the danger they are in! Is this a dumb plot device or what. Shortly afterwards the Precinct gets shot at from all sides the bullets shattering windows and thus making noise yet Carpenter would have us believe that noone could hear all that and come to the rescue because the gang was using noiseless guns. Dumb. The guns may have been noiseless but I don't think there are any bullets in this world that will quietly shatter windows. From then on it's strictly zombie material. Carpenterobviously saw The Night of the Living Dead one too many times and decided to do something similar. Except for one problem gang members  and may they be as fanatical as teenieboppers  do not act attack behave and brake through windows like zombies. They don't. And I don't care if they're high on heroine or belong to a cultlike organization they can't behave like this. I mean this gang is supposed to be totally kamikazelike and irrational on one hand but clever and organized in its planning of the attack on the other hand. Carpenter wants to have his cake and eat it too. The dialog as mentioned is mediocre and gets even worse when the key characters start philosophizing in moments when no sane or insane person would even talk. The actors don't have it easy with this kind of dumb script  but the female lead acts so badly that she appears at times more zombielike than the numerous invaders.

I was not directly involved with the mission but had a front row seat and the officers I worked under kept me apprised of the progress. These facts might be of interest1. Our Top Secret operation had two elephants called Bonnie and Clyde.2. The elephants were not dropped in slings or standing up as depicted in the movie. They had to be tied down to airdrop cargo pallets. If they were hung in slings their own weight would have suffocated them. If they had been dropped standing up their weight would have caused fatal physical harm upon landing. 3. Two veterinarians were flown from England to sedate and revive the animals. 4. The purpose was not for a ceremony but for a much more practical reason. A sawmill had been built in the village to help its economy. The mountain trails were much too narrow to use bulldozers to drag the trees to the mill and someone came up with this idea. 5. The mission ultimately was a failure. The elephants were juveniles weight!!! and were much too small to drag the large logs. Growing elephants eat a lot. The village chief complained that the villagers were being forced to travel deeper and deeper into VC controlled territory to collect banana trees for their fodder. I don't know how this problem was resolved.The movie was much more interesting and fun as the actual mission was pulled off without a hitch and had little entertainment value. My credibility could be verified on my website which I am required not to include but I'll be glad to provide it to anyone who is interested. There is a direct contact link available.For those reviewers who chose this forum to again knock a war over 36 years gone SHAME ON YOU! You have only exposed your own ignorance. As all soldiers in every war  some Americans conducted themselves better than others. As this mission actually went and as depicted in this DRAMATIZATION many of us worked tirelessly to improve the lives of the Vietnamese. I am most proud of my days in Vietnam when I was privileged to provide food cooking utensils clothing and other necessities to peoples displaced by the war. Many good American lives were lost directly attempting to prevent harm to Vietnamese people. I risked my life more than once not in combat but in aiding common villagers in tasks they could not accomplice themselves. My OIC Officer in Charge was shot down and killed while attempting to evacuate refugees from a besieged ACamp. HE DID NOT HAVE TO BE ON THAT AIRCRAFT. You are welcome to your opinion and can state it per the First Amendment but ethically you should study and actually know a little bit about the topic before you share an opinion. And for Heaven's sake keep political opinions on political forums. Dumbo Drop hardly glorified warfare. It just exposed the truth that a little bit of good can be found in most things even things as tragic as warfare.And to the reviewer who doubted that anything funny ever happens in warfare You too speak out of ignorance. I spent two years in country and had many genuine good times often with the fine Vietnamese soldiers with whom I worked.".

It is a great film for a family movie night or even when you're alone and simply bored. Children and Adults alike can appreciate the exciting action accompanied with only occasional mild violence cute humor and expressed morals and the importance of human kindness. History bluffs would also enjoy this since it takes place during the Vietnam War and shows some interesting details.

Dinh Thien Le appears as the boy Linh companion of the elephant Bo Tat.An NCO indirectly linked to the real operation said the movie was much more interesting and fun than the actual event as the mission was pulled off without a hitch with little entertainment value. Being a Disney flick the combat situations are Yeah right and no one gets hurt but that's to be expected. Other than this it's a straight forward dramedyadventure.While I'm generally not into Disney flicks it's nice to see a more positive side of the war after watching movies like We Were Soldiers Platoon and A Rumor of War. Believe it or not there WERE fun comedic and altruistic occasions over there every day. Many good Americans perished directly attempting to prevent harm to Vietnamese people. Many risked their lives not in combat but in aiding civilian villagers in tasks they could not accomplish themselves. Many worked tirelessly to improve the lives of the Vietnamese providing food cooking utensils clothing and other necessities to those displaced by the conflict. Yes I realize you could argue that they wouldn't be in such a predicament if there was no war but don't forget that generally speaking the South Vietnamese didn't want communistic rule and the conquestminded NVA were no angels. Look no further than the incredible killing fields of Cambodia.I love elephants so I also appreciate this element. What's most enjoyable besides the great cast are the exceptional Thailand locations. Although there are a few eyerolling parts like all Disney movies a lot was put into making this film. It's a fun adventure reminiscent of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Unfortunately there are no key female parts and the Yeah right moments are too painful to give a higher rating.The movie runs 107 minutes.GRADE C or B 5.510".

I'm a huge lifelong fan of Danny Glover Predator 2 anyone?! and my wife absolutely loves Ray Liotta a little too much I might add  hence the need to spice up our marriage  wocka wocka!.So we walked into the theatre with high expectations and they were exceeded. This film takes place during the Vietnam War and is by far the most accurate depiction of wartime I've seen since MASH but if you're not a warfilm buff don't let that hold you back. The characters played by Liotta Glover and Denis Leary Who's the Man? Demolition Man are on a mission to  get this!  deliver a live elephant across South Vietnam. Hilarity ensues.I won't give the rest of the film away but let me leave you with this Liotta Glover and Leary deliver the finest acting of their respective careers. My wife and I absolutely adored this film. We laughed we cried we held hands the entire time. Had it not been for this breathtaking film my wife and I might have gone our separate ways by now and who knows who she'd be with today maybe Ray Liotta!.So what are you waiting for? Add this to your Netflix queue or take a trip to your local video rental center because this movie is Operation MUSTSEE!".

So you may argue that it's still impossible to catch up with the elephant. Yah it probably is but if he went into a dive motion a la James Bond in the beginning of Goldeneye it's possible to decrease air resistance and increase aerodynamics in such a way to fall faster. Stunt skydivers do it all the time. So that's the second reason why you're wrong.

What's even harder to grasp is how they actually got the elephant and the boy back to the same village. The lengths they went to just to keep a promise speaks volumes about keeping your word.

First it positively reflects the actions of the US military in Vietnam whereas most movies on the subject don't portray our forces in the most positive manner. Secondly it more accurately shows the mission of the Special Forces in working with indigenous peoples to counter an adversary not the snakeeating killeverythinginsight stereotype compounded by the Rambo series. Thirdly I find the acting dialogue and interactivity between the characters to be well done. This movie wasn't dumbed down to be familyfriendly it maintained a standard that showed Disney was serious about making a quality film.So it may not be historically perfect and it may not fit into many's preconceptions as to what a Vietnam war film should address but accepting it for what it was intended to bea Disney film addressing positive subject matterand criticizing it under those objectives makes the outcome a success in my book. If you want to see soldiers killing natives and burning villages there are plenty of other films that depict such acts but if you want to watch a movie based on an actual operation by USSF to positively impact a Vietnamese village during the war that Operation Dumbo Drop is the best choice. It may not compare to Apocalypse Now or Full Metal Jacket but it is not intended to be like those film but judged on its own it succeeds in meeting its objectives!".

	schema:reviewBody "There is an unfair urban legend about the late 40th President of the United States that all his films were awful except for Knute Rockne All American and King's Row. Actually Ronald Reagan did more good films than most people realize  he was in supporting roles in Boy Meets Girl and Dark Victory he did nicely in Brother Rat The Voice Of The Turtle and surprise! Bedtime For Bonzo and he again gave good support to the trio of old troopers who star in this film.Louisa is that rarity  a romantic comedy about the loves of elderly people. Spring Byington is the mother of Ronald Reagan and she meets his new employer Charles Coburn. Byington is perky and intelligent and graceful and she captivates Coburn. So far so good. Unfortunately she already has met Edmund Gwenn a poorer man than Coburn but just as smitten. Both men proceed to pursue her and to try to derail each other's campaign for her.

	onyx:emotionText "There is an unfair urban legend about the late 40th President of the United States that all his films were awful except for Knute Rockne All American and King's Row. Actually Ronald Reagan did more good films than most people realize  he was in supporting roles in Boy Meets Girl and Dark Victory he did nicely in Brother Rat The Voice Of The Turtle and surprise! Bedtime For Bonzo and he again gave good support to the trio of old troopers who star in this film.Louisa is that rarity  a romantic comedy about the loves of elderly people. Spring Byington is the mother of Ronald Reagan and she meets his new employer Charles Coburn. Byington is perky and intelligent and graceful and she captivates Coburn. So far so good. Unfortunately she already has met Edmund Gwenn a poorer man than Coburn but just as smitten. Both men proceed to pursue her and to try to derail each other's campaign for her. Coburn being richer and Reagan's employer is in a better position  especially after he finds a secret regarding Gwenn's past that can blast his chances. Or will it boomerang and make Gwenn more sympathetic?The three old pros carry this film  one of the two best films for elderly performers with Monty Wooley's As Young As You Feel made in the 1950s.

After Reagan basically tells mom to lighten up she does just that and ends up with the affections of two men a widowed grocer Edmund Gwenn and Reagan's funloving boss Charles Coburn.

Gwenn and Coburn may not be dashing matine idols but they are determined in their efforts to outwit the other and win the lovely lady for themself.Both men are amusing in their comical efforts to play Don Juan and when Coburn outwits Gwenn by taking Byington on a picnic near a flowercovered pond you almost think he's got it made. But Gwenn has a few tricks up his sleeve and even if Coburn and Byington can win a limbo contest outdoing even the teenaged lovers entered in this country club competition Gwenn can always use sympathy as a way of winning his lady fair back. It is difficult to choose who Byington will end up with but it is safe to say that the conclusion is believable and most satisfactory. Some witty lines are provided by that veteran maid character actress Connie Gilchrist and handsome Scotty Beckett is funny as Laurie's boyfriend who sincerely believes that he is smarter than all of the adults in his girlfriend's family. Future Emergency! star Martin Milner is instantly recognizable as Beckett's competition for Laurie's affections.A step above the usual situation comedy style film this is a perfect companion picture for the same year's Father of the Bride and Reagan while no match for Spencer Tracy in the acting department is appropriately confused and bewildered as he deals with the fact that his mother has a few surprises up her sleeve that he hadn't anticipated when bringing her into his home. Byington goes from nagging widow to lovestarved romantic with easy grace and gives a performance that will make you look at your own widowed parents with wonder that they might still have more life than their children believed them to possess.".

Reagan and the other players try to make their now feeble lines stronger by shouting all their dialogue at the top of their voices. It doesn't work. When the film is quieter and lines are funnier the players are better too. Coburn is the only one who manages well from go to finish. Even Ed Gwenn is defeated by the script's weak material in the latter stages though he has some splendid material earlier on including an hilarious dinner table proposal which degenerates on Coburn's arrival to a plaintive altercation. All audience sympathy is plainly with Coburn rather than the wimpish Gwenn which makes the conclusion all the more unsatisfactory. Reagan does well in the first half but is one of the worst shouters later on. It even looks as if he were resynching his lines to shout them even higher. An uncomfortable and strained performance.A pity another writer wasn't brought in to doctor the script's last half. Still there are enough funny memorable moments in the first to justify giving Louisa a look. Photography is attractive but Hall's direction is undistinguished I thought it was Fred de Cordova it's so bland in the first half so mistimed in the second. Production values are extremely moderate. Unusual theme too. It's hard to credit that this sloppily recorded film with its clumsy postsynching and toostrident dialogue was actually nominated for an Oscar for sound recording.

Everyone around him seems to agree that retirement shouldn't be forced upon you if you are still able and willing to work but no one in this large company where he works seems to be able to anything about this ruleespecially since the company is actually controlled by a huge corporation. They just keep saying it's company policy and they would change it if they couldmaybe he should talk the the guy in charge to get the rule changed someone suggests. Unfortunately no one seems to know exactly who that is or how to find him. Out of sheer frustration he hatches a plot to impersonate the company's CEO and make the changes himself! Unfortunately this relatively simple plan snowballs and lots of unforeseen problems arise.This is a brisk cute movie that it sure to please. The acting is superb I just love Woolley in films the story well written and the film leaves you smiling.PSGet Marilyn Monroe OFF the Video Cover!!!

	schema:reviewBody "As Young As You Feel is a modest budget early 50's BW comedy. While the creative people were experimenting with 'film noir' and 'neorealism' the studios were cranking out stuff like this for a traditional audience. This adaptation of a story by Paddy Chayefsky was made during the McCarthy years so the social satire aspect could only be subtly subversive. The themes balancing work and play doing work that gives you personal satisfaction and maintaining your integrity give the film a worthwhile message and are not delivered in an overbearing manner.Monty Woolley as John Hodges carries the film as a printer who is pushed into retirement at age 65 and decides to impersonate the president of the holding company that owns the printing plant where he worked. This sets up a sort of 'Being There' effect where his views on national affairs become an inspiration to the whole country. David Wayne who would eventually play the Mad Hatter on Batman plays his prospective soninlaw and their scenes are all gems partly because they have a real chemistry and partly because they got the best dialogue. The best scene is the opening a very well staged scene of the company orchestra playing the Nutcracker the camera opens on a promotional poster pans left and takes us into the concert hall as a little girl scurries to her seat. The camera moves around in the crowd where we meet most of the main characters. Hodges is playing one of the piccolos and he soon launches into an impromptu solo much to the annoyance of the guest conductor and an accurate preview of what his role will be throughout the film.This film is fairly entertaining but is most valuable as a cultural artifact. Because it was not a high budget production the cast is almost entirely older stars at the very end of their careers like Wooley and Constance Bennett and young actors at the beginning Wayne Jean Peters and Marilyn Monroe. So there is a kind of torch passing at work. It is also hints at Monroe's special screen presence which somehow allowed her to beat the Hollywood starlet system. She and Peters were the same age both were born in 1926 and had both started too late in the movie business. By this film they had already lost all the youthful luster of their early 20's check out how much better Peters looked two years earlier in 'It Happens Every Spring' and Monroe before she became a blonde yet Monroe was somehow able to transcend this and become a big star.Arthur Miller said of Monroe She was rarely taken seriously as anything but a sex symbol. To have survived she would have had to be either more cynical or even further from reality than she was. Instead she was a poet on a street corner trying to recite to a crowd pulling at her clothes.".

It's part of the feelgood type of movies of the early 1950s. The story is by a young Paddy Chakevsky who would later write Marty A Catered Affair The Goddess The Americanization of Emily Hospital Network and Altered States and the screenplay is by Lamar Trotti who wrote the screenplays for John Ford's Young Mr. Lincoln and Drums Along the Mohawk for Ox Bow Incident and won the screenplay Oscar for Wilson in 1944. A lot of talent in a thimble. It might be interesting to compare this screenplay to their other works for similarities. Chakevsky's work later became sharp and hard and even bitter. But his Marty Catered Affair and maybe even this show a gentle humorous side. Trotti would die the next year so this is one of his last screenplays".

	schema:headline " A Woolley...repeat...Woolley movie not a Monroe flick";
	schema:reviewBody "Monty Woolley's film career has not had as much discussion as it deserves. The one time head of Yale University's Drama Department and close personal friend possibly lover of Cole Porter had been involved in Broadway for many years. He was for example in the original cast of the Rodgers and Hart Musical ON YOUR TOES as the Russian Ballet impresario who sings TOO GOOD FOR THE AVERAGE MAN. He also made many film appearances in the 1930s including the irascible but eventually dumbfounded French judge in Mitchell Leisin's MIDNIGHT. But his fame would come when he was starred in the original production of THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER and subsequently was lucky enough to repeat his performance in the film version. Other film starring parts were his as well such as THE PIED PIPER and his pair of films costarring Gracie Fields HOLY MATRIMONY and MOLLY AND ME. But more frequently he ended up in supporting parts even in THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER it was Bette Davis who was given the starring position in the credits!. More typical of his later films was MISS TATLOCK'S MILLIONS where he and Dan Tobin were two greedy uncles of Schuyler Tatlock John Lund. A better deeper part was the Latin Scholar in THE BISHOP'S WIFE who is going to write the greatest history of Rome since Edward Gibbon. The problem for Woolley was age. To an extent in the early 1940s he was able to still play grouchy sorts who were not too old say about 50. But as the 1940s went forward Woolley's age became a handicap. It was harder and harder to find material for him where he was the star.Without a doubt his last starring role was as John Hodges the 65 year old printer who is forced by a company policy to retire while he is still mentally and physically vigorous. Few films from Hollywood had tackled the issue of aging. The best known one was Leo McCarey's MAKE WAY FOR TOMORROW with Victor Moore and Beulah Bondi which remains a heartbreakingly sad film. But that was made in 1935. Except for an occasional comment about aging in a film like Berton Churchill's comment to John Carridine not to heed his white hairs if he is hesitant to challenge Churchill to a fight in STAGECOACH most of the movies ignored aging. Even before the 1960s and President Kennedy's pushing a cult of youth and vigor Hollywood was pretty much doing the same thing.So this is why AS YOUNG AS YOU FEEL is such an unusual film. Besides Woolley getting one of the best parts of his career it tackled a relatively taboo subject. Why talk about the inevitable that nobody likes to think about  aging and weakening...and eventually death. It's a downer in terms of a theme for a film as McCarey's movie had brilliantly shown. But in point of fact AS YOUNG AS YOU FEEL is the reverse side of the coin. Woolley is forced to retire from his firm and is angry about it. Then by chance he is able to temporarily take over the media and town's attention when he is mistaken for the multimillionaire Minor Watson who has taken over the factory that retired Wooley. Being an intelligent man his opinions get huge publicity and sweep the nation. Woolley stresses that the chronicle age of the individual does not mean that he or she is to be put out to pasture if he or she is capable of functioning and contributing to society. Soon Woolley finds he is in demand everywhere due to his spunky philosophy. Watson of course is amazed at the error but does not stop it  he finds that it is enhancing his own public image after all the media and the public think Woolley is Watson. At the same time Woolley finds the masquerade is getting out of hand in many ways. It is playing havoc with his grandson David Wayne's career. It is also playing havoc with the family life of the manager of the factory Albert Dekker and his wife Constance Bennett. So caught up in the American dream of making a success of himself for his family Dekker has distanced himself from his wife and son. Then Woolley shows up and Bennett decides she wants to divorce her stodgy husband Decker for that lively old wire Woolley!It was a nicely written role by Paddy Chayefskyand Woolley did very well in it. Ironically despite the philosophical point of view in the film the studio system ignored the message. Woolley never had another great lead part after this film. His last memorable part was as an elderly adviser to the young Persian Monarch in the musical KISMET  not a really big part that.Ironically too the film was one of a long string of early films that Marilyn Monroe appeared in from 1949 from LOVE HAPPY to 1952 the Cary Grant  Ginger Rogers MONKEY BUSINESS. Monroe did well in most of these roles and they gave her exposure but even in the meatiest ones CLASH BY NIGHT she did not star in them. Yet Marilyn's name means so much to this day in film lore to the public these early films are usually sold in Marilyn Monroe collections. The ever youthful ever too fragile Marilyn remains a Hollywood icon forty  four years after her death in 1962. Monty Wooley died in 1963 but I doubt that a hundredth of the people who adore the memory of Marilyn ever think seriously about Monty and his best performances.".

Many baby boomers wish that were the case today because in fact they'll be working way past 65. He finds out that the company he works for is a subsidiary of a huge company that is owned by a huge corporation. Finding out the name of the President of that huge corporation he dies his hair and whiskers and poses as the man comes to town tours the plant and makes a speech in which he declares that the knowledge of our elders is critical in printing and changes the policy.And there the fun begins. The boss' wife Constance Bennett feeling unloved by her husband Dekker falls for Hodges his granddaughter's boyfriend Wayne recognizes him and tells someone else at the plant and the corporation doesn't know what to do. This fake president has raised their stock and given them a fabulous profile so much so that the labor union has settled their grievances with them. How can they call his bluff? I seem to have enjoyed this film more than some of the other posters. Thelma Ritter as John's daughterinlaw is a scream. An exsinger who gave up her career to marry George Joslyn John's son sings Temptation while in the kitchen  she's hilarious. Woolley is great as an older man not ready to be put out to pasture and it's wonderful to see one of the great stars of the '30s Constance Bennett in a later role.This film is remembered today as early Marilyn Monroe. She plays the boss' sexy secretary and she does a wonderful job. It's a small role but you can definitely see that she Peters who plays the granddaughter and David Wayne are all getting the star buildup and are each at different stages of it. Monroe was just about to break through and she and Wayne would appear together in How to Marry a Millionaire where he says I already think you're quite a strudel. Entertaining and definitely worth seeing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Though released on DVD as part of Fox's Marilyn Monroe Collection her role  playing the spirited though obviously dumb secretary at a printing factory headed by Albert Dekker  is actually very brief. The film is an amusing Capraesque comedy about 65 yearold printer Monty Woolley who refuses to accept the age imposition which sends him into retirement. The plot involves him impersonating the President of the corporation which owns the factory paying them an unexpected visit and making a speech in which he retracts the current policy  thus enabling Woolley the printer to get back his job! Complications arise when David Wayne fianc of Woolley's niece Jean Peters who also works at the factory recognizes him  but also with the attentions given Woolley by Dekker's neglected wife Constance Bennett. The film features a solid supporting cast which includes Allyn Joslyn as Woolley's son Thelma Ritter as his wife who's proud of her Brooklyn origins Clinton Sundberg as Wayne's ambitious colleague at the plant who could blow Woolley's cover at any moment Minor Watson as the real President of the conglomerate and a young Russ Tamblyn playing Dekker and Bennett's confused son. It's a pleasant enough diversion  adapted by Lamar Trotti from a Paddy Chayefsky! story  given Fox's typically polished if fluffy treatment.".

It focuses on a 65yearold man who's been laid off due to company policy in a bookbinding company that prevents employees from working once they turn 65. Naturally Monty Woolley doesn't take kindly to being put out to pasture. He's still young and fit as a fiddle. He promptly comes up with an idea to change company policy just how I'm not telling and in so doing shaking things up. As Young As You Feel boasts a great cast with David Wayne Jean Peters Thelma Ritter Allyn Joslyn Albert Dekker Russ Tamblyn and Constance Bennett who exceptionally plays Dekker's wife who needs to feel loved and appreciated. A great movie vehicle for Monty Woolley this film is fun innovative charming and leaves you feeling younger than when you started it.".

	schema:headline " Mandatory retirement at 65 or not? Woolley stars";
	schema:reviewBody "The theme of this unusual comedic drama is that the policy by many companies of the time of mandatory retirement at a certain agecommonly 65 or 70 is of questionable advisability for the company and robs many still quite capable seniors of some of their potentially most productive years as well as an opportunity to help support themselves and perhaps others. There are of course various reasons why a company might feel it benefits from a mandatory age cut off.. Older workers typically cost more in salary and health insurance. They generally have much more health issues. Many will have lost their youthful zip or feel burned out. So which policy is likely to be best for the company? Monty Woolsey as John Hodges argues that it's best to have some capable elderly workers around with more work and life experiences than younger ones. Should a company's managers decide who is capable and who is not rather than one shoe fits all?There are basically 3 personal happy endings dramatized that result from Woolley's masquerading of the CEO of the parent company of this very complex multicompany conglomerateConsolidated Motors.Firstly Woolley does manage to convince the presidentMcKinley of his own company Acme Printing to rescind the policy of mandatory agebased retirement which means that he as a recent retiree is allowed to return to his job if he wishes. Also 2 couples are indirect beneficiaries. His granddaughter's fianceElliott gets a promotion because his rival claimed to McKinley that Cleveland the CEO of the parent company was the victim of an imposter causing McKinley to conclude that he must be crazy. Also McKinley was 'forced' into a reconciliation with his wife of 20 years after she announced she would file a divorce so that she could marry the more charming and flattering WoolleyCleveland who was a widower. Seems McKinley had been neglecting her in recent times in favor of his young curvaceous secretaryMarilyn Monroe. But Woolley convinced her that in the long run she would be better off with her sameaged husband if he reformed.So where is the comedy as some reviewers have asked? True it's not a belly laugher. Partly it's the idea that Woolley succeeded beyond his wildest dreams in not only lobbying to do away with the age cut off but in becoming an overnight celebrity within his company and even the newspapers because of his superficial pronouncements on how to keep the country out of depressions and inflationary spirals. The lack of recognition of either Woolley or Cleveland by McKinley serves as a sarcastic take on the growing anonymity of workers and even bosses in huge plants and in huge conglomerates. Then there's the blast of condemnation by both McKinley and other manager when EricksonElliott's rival for a promotion claims that the man they were convinced was Cleveland was an imposter. Also when McKinley arrived at the Hodges home looking for his wife when the real Cleveland there claimed he was such McKinley flew into a rage calling him another imposter.Of course in reality it's implausible that a man with such a distinctive look and style of talking would be missed by his president. This is a significant but necessary weakness of the script.Besides Woolley middleaged Constance Bennett was nearing the end of her Hollywood days. Both would find some work in TV dramas. Woolley had most often been cast as a character actor although he had a few other leading man roles. For a man brought up in the high society of Manhattan a graduate of Yale and Harvard his erudite aristocratic persona came naturally. Thelma Ritter although first billed among the women didn't have much of an impact on the proceedings. Easily recognized by her Brooklyn accent. ...Jean Peters as Woolley's mature granddaughter would again be cocast with Marilyn Monroe in the popular Niagara. Marilyn appears several times in the present film as McKinley's secretary and apparent lover.Did you notice that the president of Acme Printing Company and the CEO of the parent company both have the name of a US president of the late 19th century.Available as part of the Marilyn Premier DVD Collection".

His granddaughter's fianceElliott gets a promotion because his rival claimed to McKinley that Cleveland the CEO of the parent company was the victim of an imposter causing McKinley to conclude that he must be crazy. Also McKinley was 'forced' into a reconciliation with his wife of 20 years after she announced she would file a divorce so that she could marry the more charming and flattering WoolleyCleveland who was a widower. Seems McKinley had been neglecting her in recent times in favor of his young curvaceous secretaryMarilyn Monroe. But Woolley convinced her that in the long run she would be better off with her sameaged husband if he reformed.So where is the comedy as some reviewers have asked? True it's not a belly laugher. Partly it's the idea that Woolley succeeded beyond his wildest dreams in not only lobbying to do away with the age cut off but in becoming an overnight celebrity within his company and even the newspapers because of his superficial pronouncements on how to keep the country out of depressions and inflationary spirals. The lack of recognition of either Woolley or Cleveland by McKinley serves as a sarcastic take on the growing anonymity of workers and even bosses in huge plants and in huge conglomerates. Then there's the blast of condemnation by both McKinley and other manager when EricksonElliott's rival for a promotion claims that the man they were convinced was Cleveland was an imposter. Also when McKinley arrived at the Hodges home looking for his wife when the real Cleveland there claimed he was such McKinley flew into a rage calling him another imposter.Of course in reality it's implausible that a man with such a distinctive look and style of talking would be missed by his president. This is a significant but necessary weakness of the script.Besides Woolley middleaged Constance Bennett was nearing the end of her Hollywood days. Both would find some work in TV dramas. Woolley had most often been cast as a character actor although he had a few other leading man roles. For a man brought up in the high society of Manhattan a graduate of Yale and Harvard his erudite aristocratic persona came naturally. Thelma Ritter although first billed among the women didn't have much of an impact on the proceedings. Easily recognized by her Brooklyn accent. ...Jean Peters as Woolley's mature granddaughter would again be cocast with Marilyn Monroe in the popular Niagara. Marilyn appears several times in the present film as McKinley's secretary and apparent lover.Did you notice that the president of Acme Printing Company and the CEO of the parent company both have the name of a US president of the late 19th century.Available as part of the Marilyn Premier DVD Collection";

Directed without much inspiration or cleverness by Harmon Jones. It's a somewhat interesting dud. The ideas intrigue but the tone is extraordinarily flat.Wooley is outrageously miscast as a laborer ! who disguises himself barely as the head of his own firm to agitate in the favor of older employees because he was let go. Despite multiple family members working alongside him it takes half an hour of film time for them to figure out that no firm has two effete erudite wordy opinionated figures like Wooley associated with it. Going even further the movie promotes other unlikely ideas A 43 year old woman abandons her family for a 65 year old. Writer Paddy Chaevsky thinks he's saved some time and effort by having three of the workplace characters also be relations of Monty Wooley but it just clutters up the movie and cheats it of a smarter structure. The script feels like it never got a 2nd revision and though ripe with comic potential there isn't a single laugh in it perhaps due to Wooley's overbearing presence. It operates at a weird domestic scale many of the scenes occur in a living room filled with people or in a second household as if it had been a play once. The most interesting idea is a throwaway corporations in 1951 have grown to an anonymous scale at which no one knows what the boss looks like anymore.Making all these convolutions more confusing is that two different actors who look way too similar play boorish heads of households Allyn Joslyn  Clinton Sundberg. Wooley and his fauxcontinental accent are simply over the top. Thelma Ritter is completely extraneous to the plot. Russ Tamblyn in an early role reads his lines without any energy facing away from characters as if he's reading cuecards. Don't watch it for Monroe. She has twenty lines as a putupon secretary and is not a key figure in the piece. This is strictly a Wooley vehicle. It reminded me of George Bernard Shaw's labormorality tale 'Major Barbara.'".

I'm surprised that director Harmon Jones made no attempts whatever to hose Woolley down a bit but allowed him to run roughshod over all the other players. The lovely Jean Peters has a particularly thankless role. Not only is she pushed into a corner by Monty Woolley but director Harmon Jones then allowed David Wayne to step all over her!

There are several specific examples. In the first a visit is made to the Iraq Museum in Baghdad where a set of curved tubes is said to be the exhaust port on the bottom of the rocket and the base of a Saturn one is shown for comparison. However no details are given of where the artifact was found how old it was or what mainstream archaeologists thought it was.In the second there were statues in Mexico who were claimed to be wearing odd hats communication or utility devices on their chests and perhaps weapons or communicators on their belts. No alternative opinion was presented such as the communicators might just be ordinary breastplates and the hats some kind of ornamental warrior headgear. Additionally in Pelenque Mexico a sarcophagus lid for the Mayan leader Pacal is supposed to be a rocket ship with no additional explanation given that his rocket might actually be a collection of Mayan symbols representing the king's passage to the underworld and the meaning of these symbols unknown to few modern people except archaeologists specializing in preColumbian history.I liked the crazy spacey soundtrack which ranged from early '70s electronica to New Ageish acoustic and the cinematography much shot from the skies  the way these alleged ancient astronauts might have seen the earth! There just wasn't enough evidence presented that aliens created all these mysteries which certainly are unexplainable.Spacemen? I don't know. The theory that humans not aliens reached a high level of civilization thousands of years ago  say more like late 21st century  only to have it destroyed by a natural disaster such as an ice age seems like a more probable explanation for the supposedly advanced technologies in ancient artifacts and even the strange costumes. People knocked back to the stone age by a disaster over generations could have forgotten their heritage old costuming and technology and have only traces which to them might become religious legends. They might record them on cave or cliff walls in images that look more familiar to us because we are advanced just like their distant ancestors.

The cinematography is good.Entertaining for those interested in far away places as well as for scientists.";

	schema:reviewBody "This is an important documentary because it criticizes all the established theories. When I first saw it i really first believed in it. Now I don't do it 100 . But it made me think. It is a very bias documentary but some of the point are good. Why where there maps that depicted the south pole under the ice in th 16th century?? That is a good question which the established science have ignored. The south pole was first discovered and mapped in the 18th or 19th century. This documentary suggests that Aliens came down to earth and taught us many things. That is not my theory. My theory is that the human race was much more advanced once before the last ice age. We know that the poles can shift and that it has happened. Plus before the last ice age 20.000  25.ooo years ago there were a lot warmer plus they have found millions of years old bones of dinosaurs there. I think that an advanced human civilization once lived on the south pole. That explained a lot we have a 16th century map of the pole under the ice because the map from the ancient civilization was copied and copied again from generation of learned people to the next. There a pyramids in Egypt South America and somewhere in south east Asia. This explained that the once advanced human population of the south pole fled to the whole world after the ice age ruined their homelands and they took their culture with them. All the depictions of gods which are wearing helmets and breathing apparatus are all because the advanced human race visited the primitive ones long ago. The advanced culture of humans explained the pyramids all ancient cities The sphinx which has marks of irrigation on its back which hints that it is as old as the recent wetperiod in Egypt which lies 25.000  35.000 years in the past which is much older than it is acknowledged how the pyramids were build Balbeck in Lebanon easter island and many other big ruins around the world. There is generally a feeling that people in the past were dumb  they were not. Just because they were not born in Europa or USA does not make people inferior. It is arrogantly of us in the west to assume the we invented everything first and that advanced civilization started in the west.This documentaries makes people think  and that is good.".

Like I said the movie focuses on these conundrums more than anything else and it's just really damn fascinating. But and there's a big butt the movie is also slightly boring. With a pretty boring narrator and long drawn out shots that just go on for too long. This is not always the case obviously and the shots are also pretty amazing when they show how gigantic these manmade marvels actually are. Chariots of the Gods is without a doubt worthy documentary to check out. It's undeniably interesting and important. Just a tad boring once in a while.".

	schema:reviewBody "I would imagine anyone who gone though the trouble of obtaining this film already knows about premise of Chariots of the Gods so I will save you the trouble. I am a fan of Leonard Nimoy's In Search of TV series and its pilot shows. In the shows the name Von Daniken and the book Chariots of the Gods were mentioned and I remembered there is a documentary film from the book. So I looked it up and watched it. While Chariots of the Gods is not as dramatic as the In search of Ancient Astronauts narrated by the great Rod Serling but it has that snazzy 70's Euro pop jazz going for it. The kind of music that reminds you that you are watching a low budget 1970 film from West Germany. Also if you had watched Rod Serling's Ancient Astronauts or Outerspace Connection you will noticed most of the footages from those films are from the Chariots of the Gods. The images of the film is quite good on the VCI Entertainment release DVD. Like other reviewers have said if you turn the volume down this movie could make a good travelogue.Also like so many other reviewer have wrote the narrator is no Rod Serling. As a matter of fact I think he is about as dry as a glass of martini with no olive. This film consists of him reading from the book with no sound bites of people who were interviewed. If you want answers of strange going on with those little green aliens then this film is not for you because this movie offers questions a lot of questions but no answers. With rhetorical questions like Could the ancient Egyptian mummifies body to copy alien's hypersleep during space travel? or Could the stone drawing in the middle of Sahara desert thousand of years ago be that of UFOs? or Could that 5000 years old Japanese figurine be that of an alien in a space suit? make me want to put my finger to my cheek and go Hmmmmmm....Is that so? Even though most of the questions posed doesn't pass go on my mumbo jumbo filter it is still good a fun watch on a boring summer afternoon. What can I say I'm a sucker for this kind of stuff.".

What is so remarkable is that the book  film literally changed and influenced our popular culture in a manner that continues to this day Battlestar Galactica Stargate Jack Kirby's The Eternals several post60s installments of Star Trek the list of pop culture forms that harvested Erich Von Daniken's fanciful ramblings goes on  on and some are quite good.See the problem with this film is that it tries to teach its viewers to be lazy observers  simpleSimon thinkers. For example You see lines scratched on a desert highland which resembles the patterns of an airport viewed from above. To conclude therefore that the lines must be the remnants of an ancient airport to the exclusion of all other possible conclusions just because that's what it looks like suggests a grave limitation in comparative reasoning.It also presumes that ancient alien astronauts would need an airport to land their space ships with extended diagonal runways stretching across the desert soil as far as the eyes can see. That means you are limiting the technology available to the aliens to that which would require an airport  You are creating a foregone conclusion with only one possible explanation fitting the lazily observed data. Von Daniken even says in his book that it cannot possibly be anything else. Oh really?Which is the basis of all conspiratorial reasoning. You conclude beforehand that the building was blown up by a controlled demolition and then you cherry pick only those clues which support that conclusion  jettison those which suggest anything else. Need spaceships? Look for depictions of angels in flight. Need space suited aliens? Any cave drawing with a stylized human figure will do the more sloppily executed the better. Just make sure it's enigmatic enough to defy a literal interpretation and you're home free. Anything can be the result of contact with ancient alien astronauts once you let your mind wander far enough afield. Then you start churning through the funny looking cultural artifacts the bizarre statuettes and other cultural forms which do not resemble classically executed images of representation we are accustomed to. Bulbous head? Space alien. Stringy looking arms? Space alien. Seated or crouched position? Space alien. Nonhuman head attached to stylized form? Space alien. Imprecise written account from historical documents? Space alien. One would think we were passive observers in our own prehistory. I am sure the Mayans would have been amused to learn that their gods required oxygen helmets.Then you muddle it all down with doublethink employing terms that sound scientific  reasonable peppered with a tad of ridicule to put anyone who won't go along with your conclusion on the outside. Now it's you  a select few against the world with your secret insights and private knowledge. Everybody else becomes a bumpkin for following the mainstream thinking which is usually remarkably boring in comparison to the idea of space aliens sweeping down from the heavens to teach our ancestors how to levitate railroad car sized blocks of stone. And then you pose these conclusions in the form of questions so that you can deny being dumb enough to have said so. You were just asking questions ... sound familiar?But it's a fascinating movie with superb music made by German film craftsman Harald Reinl with a visual power that is difficult to deny. One aspect of which is capturing the ancient monuments on film as they appeared in the late 1960s before most of them were restored to their present day touristfriendly look complete with snack stands  souvenir shops. You can really get a feel for how those Mayan cities were swallowed by the jungle and what a jumbled mess Easter Island was before we figured out what the deal was with the statues how they were supposed to be lined up who made them and why they probably did it. If the film served a useful purpose it may have been to inspire a generation or three of young scientists to figure out some of the riddles being posed.For that matter the film represents a more innocent era for modern man when we could gaze at mysteries like the Easter Island statues and just marvel at them in awe. Nowadays Easter Island speaks for a tragedy where a whole people were wiped out by outside invasion famine and eventually disease spread by contact with the Western world. Kind of a bummer compared to heroic alien cosmonauts descending in their rocket ships to immortalize themselves in stone for us to ponder over so many eons later.If only it were. Also were I to criticize the film stylistically it is for being too onesided. There's no voice of the other suggesting any contrary conclusions just like all good conspiracy theory entertainments. After all that would distract from the stunning conclusions that all of our prehistory was shaped by contact with space aliens since those blocks of stone are too big for even a modern day crane to move etc etc etc. It's a marvelously stacked deck though just as long as you are aware of that going in it can be fun to follow along at home. Just don't take any of it too seriously the photography is great enjoy the music and pass the munchies dude.410".

	schema:reviewBody "I watched Chariots of the Gods as it was known as in the United States when it was originally released and was rather bored by it if it were not for the great footage of sites from all over the world I would have probably fallen asleep. The narration is bland uninspiringand uninformative. There are a few cases where the narration is unintentionally funny. When discussing a 40000 year old bison skull the movie states the bison was killed by a high speed bullet and The beast was alive when killed. I didn't mean to say it out loud but I said Most animals ARE alive when they are killed. How else could they be killed? and got a good laugh from the audience near me. As is typical in this sort of film things are taken out of context questions are asked but not answered and simpler explanations are ignored. I bought my copy as part of a double feature DVD issued by EastWestDVD.com. The second feature on the disk is a turkey entitled Astral Factor and also known as Invisible Strangler. I think the most telling thing about this movie is that the credits say it is Based upon the novels by Erich von Dniken which indicates that the producers felt the premise of the film was fictional. I have never understood how the movie was ever nominated for an Oscar in the best documentary category because as I was leaving the theater everyone I heard talking about the film felt they had wasted their money. At 1.00 or 50 if you divide it over the two films the movie is worth watching for the location shots.".

	onyx:emotionText "I watched Chariots of the Gods as it was known as in the United States when it was originally released and was rather bored by it if it were not for the great footage of sites from all over the world I would have probably fallen asleep. The narration is bland uninspiringand uninformative. There are a few cases where the narration is unintentionally funny. When discussing a 40000 year old bison skull the movie states the bison was killed by a high speed bullet and The beast was alive when killed. I didn't mean to say it out loud but I said Most animals ARE alive when they are killed. How else could they be killed? and got a good laugh from the audience near me. As is typical in this sort of film things are taken out of context questions are asked but not answered and simpler explanations are ignored. I bought my copy as part of a double feature DVD issued by EastWestDVD.com. The second feature on the disk is a turkey entitled Astral Factor and also known as Invisible Strangler. I think the most telling thing about this movie is that the credits say it is Based upon the novels by Erich von Dniken which indicates that the producers felt the premise of the film was fictional. I have never understood how the movie was ever nominated for an Oscar in the best documentary category because as I was leaving the theater everyone I heard talking about the film felt they had wasted their money. At 1.00 or 50 if you divide it over the two films the movie is worth watching for the location shots.";

Based on the controversial and bestselling book by Swedish writer Erich Von Daniken the film was shot in various world locations Italy Egypt Africa South America Mexico Easter Island exploring telltale signs that aliens from outer space visited the earth in ancient times. The inyourface theory is considered flawed oldfashioned and has even been proved wrong. The documentary is more than 30 years old now and the book was released in 1968. At the time it was typical sensational theory material and the subsequent documentary was made according to the standards and formula of documentaries at the time. The narration style the slow pacing and constant change of locations is similar to the Endless Summer documentaries. The music by Peter Thomas and his Orchestra is gorgeous full of exotic and beautifully wistful melodies. These components together with the stunning cinematography by Ernst Wild make for a very enjoyable experience as if we are watching a documentary that can never fall into the realm of the bland and the boring. It is as artistically made as the primitive art depicted in the film. Curiously Erich Von Daniken himself did not take any part in the making of this documentary but it is a faithful adaptation of his book into documentary form. A generation of science fiction movies like Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters and E.T. Ron Howard's Cacoon and TV series like Stargate are clearly influenced by Chariots of the Gods. The ancient astronaut theory claims that beings from other planets visited the earth when it was in early stages of civilization. This is shown in the film as exemplified by the curious Martians depicted on the high walls of the canyons in Tassili in the Sahara desert the alienlike beings in the cave paintings in Australia the mysterious Easter Island statues and the pyramids of both Aztec Mexico and ancient Egypt at the time of the Pharaohs. History's mysteries seem to be the theme but Daniken is fully convinced that aliens had been around since ancient times. The most striking visuals for me are the faded chalklike drawings in Italy depicting two astronauts the flying rockets piloted by men just above the sight of the Crucifixion of Jesus in a church in Da Sani Yugoslavia and of course the most fascinating of them all  the Nazca lines in Peru. For the film maker and for Daniken this is the trump card as he believes the Nazca lines are an abandoned airport made for flying saucers. Those enigmatic lines the forms of birds monkey insects a human pointing downward and looking at the heavens and the little martianlike entities all seen from the air and yet being made on the ground in mysterious precision. Time and again this documentary has fascinated many scientists theologians and the general public. It may be a bunch of B.S. hoax or just possibly the grandest and most flamboyant evidence of extraterrestrial life and its communion with humans over centuries' time. Enjoy this fascinating film keep an open mind and come to your own conclusions but we can all be sure of one thing this one is a classic.".

	schema:reviewBody "Film version of the book by Erick Von Daniken that postulates that perhaps the weird creatures in painting legends and tales were not gods or monsters but instead visitors from outer space. The film is essentially a travelogue of sights that march us from one location to another showing us intriguing painting buildings and other sights. Dull when compared to the stuff that we see on the History and Discovery Channels on cable this film has no recreations just has a catalog of weird anomalies that may or may not point to something other that a man made influence. The film doesn't speculate as to the origin of the ancient astronauts it simply shows the strange stuff and lets the viewer decide. The film is more or less a highlight reel of early Von Daniken and his theories which many scientists and scholars have dismissed but at the same time I find that many who dismiss the premise do so either without having read any of his books or with out being as well read on the number of cultures as the author himself This is an okay film that has been kind of hurt by the passage of time remeber this was released in 1970. The film feel kind of static and while it hints very strongly that we could have been visited it doesn't spoon feed you that conclusion. The film can be a tough one to get through but at the same time its less strident stance is better than many others on the subject which seem to trap you in a carnival come on. Will the film change your mind as to the possibility of visitation? I have no idea. The material in the film is ultimately too lacking in detail to put up a fully persuasive argument but it is the sort of thing that might nudge you in one direction. Von Daniken doesn't say one thing is the key to his belief rather the sheer number of odd things.Worth a look if the subject interests you.".

	schema:reviewBody "Let me start off by saying that I love movies and documentaries about the paranormal strange phenomena and unexplained mysteries. I particular enjoyed the old Rod Serling specials produced by Alan and Sally Landsburg but I always regretted not having seen Chariots of the Gods.I didn't miss anything.On the face of it this film would make a lovely travelogue of Mexico and South America because despite the premise of exploring andor revealing ancient mysteries it actually does very little of either. True all the old familiar sites are visited but the bland narration does little more than tell you that these places are associated with mysterious doings. It would be like a documentary on ghosts and hauntings showing only the exterior of the Amityville house and saying vaguely ...and the Lutz family claimed to have experienced something here in this house.The photography is very nice the camera angles fresh and dramatic but as I mentioned earlier the narration both the text itself and the narrators is monotonously bland and surprisingly UNinformative which negates any instructional value the film might have had as a documentary. Again just change the narration and this could be a fine travelogue.I suspect that the high ratings people give this title are based merely on that the title and its association with the excellent and influential book and less on the film itself. I also suspect that people are remembering the soundtrack LP and later CDs of the excellent Peter Thomas score which ironically is almost unrecognizable in the garbled monaural sound mix of the film itself.My opinion is that you should ignore this film and look instead at the much more dramatic and informative In Search of Ancient Astronauts which is itself a far superior reedit of this film narrated by Rod Serling or any of the other Landsburg productions like In Search of Ancient Mysteries The Outer Space Connection or Encounter With The Unknown.For that matter track down the old In Search Of... TV programs or Robert Stack ferreting out those Unsolved Mysteries.".

A mystery and suspense thriller ensue with government agents shadowy figures the protagonist cannot be sure he can trust relationship problems work stress possible mental illness and one of the worst endings imaginable. The film had to end some way and this one lands with a loud thud. Everything will be Fine was at last year's Cannes Film Festival and currently has no U.S. release date good it would not make very much money here. If crowds want to spend their money on crap they go see the latest action or animated film. Lackluster mysteries usually fall through the cracks.".

Inside are photos of Danish soldiers torturing what I assume are Iraqis. A mystery and suspense thriller ensue with government agents shadowy figures the protagonist cannot be sure he can trust relationship problems work stress possible mental illness and one of the worst endings imaginable. The film had to end some way and this one lands with a loud thud. Everything will be Fine was at last year's Cannes Film Festival and currently has no U.S. release date good it would not make very much money here. If crowds want to spend their money on crap they go see the latest action or animated film. Lackluster mysteries usually fall through the cracks.";

But unlike Khadak Altiplano has a very strong and story oriented narrative which is extremely good since the constant allegorical images that the movie possesses are much more well timed and effective than in Khadak. Apart from the style issues the movie is a intense journey in the fight between modernism and tradition nature and city. I don't want to give away anything because seeing this filme without any kind of expectations storywise that is is the best way to enjoy it. Visually stunning with a exceptional soundtrack Altiplano is despite his flaws a movie that should be watched for anyone that likes cinema or at least original cinema. If you belong to that group go see it. Don't expect action packed sequences or determined heroes overcoming evil. Altiplano is about life. Slow real and unforgiving.A really good film with some brilliant moments. If you like cinema take a chance on this one. It's worth it.".

Some visual moments reminded me of a more comprehensible version of Tarkovsky. Same with the previous film Khadak directors here don't aim the entertainmentseeking audience but the one with higher standards. Visually it is completely different from Khadak but the same cinematic language of the directing duo can be felt in both. The leading star Magaly Solier gives a remarkable performance which is a carrier of the whole film. Music is a very big part of this film. It blends with every image perfectly and gives extra power to every scene. Bottom line I would warmly recommend this film to anyone that has the chance to see it.".

The town has massive health issues and birth defects etc but has received little compensation from the arrogant mine owners in the US. I gather that the Peruvian government should take much of the blame as well for turning a blind eye to such devastating operations.It's not just humans at risk from the effects of industrial waste and pollution. Consider the minerals in many mobile phones and laptops currently being mined in parts of Africa where land clearing is killing off the gorilla population at a frightening rate.Anyways back to the film.

Altiplano tells the story about a former war photographer and her physician husband who are caught up in a riot when locals in an Andean village vent their unhappiness with contamination from a nearby mine.There are some pretty serious themes in this movie such as murder pollution and suicide but none affected me in any way because the central characters in Altiplano didn't come to life at all. That's probably because there is almost no dialogue in Altiplano. There are just beautiful shots with some very heavy music some dramatic events and that's it.In advance of the screening the director tried to explain to the audience what kind of experience Altiplano would be. Some people walked out of the audience during the film. After the movie though i was left with some people nobody seemed to have understood anything of this poorly directed film.The director tried to explain to us what he wanted this movie to be A movie that has a different meaning to anyone. A movie that is special for every person in his own way.In stead nobody understood. Nobody cared. Why? There is no life in this film just some beautiful shots of Peru.

	schema:reviewBody "It has been noticed that films which deal with multiple themes often fail to strike a chord in viewers' minds. It is due to the fact that while watching filmsmost viewers have a limited attention span which gets impaired when an endless array of plots and subplots is revealed.Belgian film Altiplano suffers enormously from this fate as the richness of its themes cause active viewers to question whether there is something which will tie these loose themes or they have just been included in order to get an opportunity to speak about world's problems.The main reason to watch this film is Olivier Gourmeta famous Belgian actor who has acted in various well madeoffbeat as well as excellent commercial films.Apart from Olivier Gourmet's presence viewers might develop a liking for the film's South American setting where visually rich religious imagery characterizes the behavioral patterns of its inhabitants.Finallyhow human beings reach out to each other in times of grief is one of this film's recurring leitmotif.Film critic Mr.Lalit Rao saw this film during 18th European Film Festival 2013 which was held at Alliance Franaise De Bangalore.".

It is due to the fact that while watching filmsmost viewers have a limited attention span which gets impaired when an endless array of plots and subplots is revealed.Belgian film Altiplano suffers enormously from this fate as the richness of its themes cause active viewers to question whether there is something which will tie these loose themes or they have just been included in order to get an opportunity to speak about world's problems.The main reason to watch this film is Olivier Gourmeta famous Belgian actor who has acted in various well madeoffbeat as well as excellent commercial films.Apart from Olivier Gourmet's presence viewers might develop a liking for the film's South American setting where visually rich religious imagery characterizes the behavioral patterns of its inhabitants.Finallyhow human beings reach out to each other in times of grief is one of this film's recurring leitmotif.Film critic Mr.Lalit Rao saw this film during 18th European Film Festival 2013 which was held at Alliance Franaise De Bangalore.";

They end up in a mysterious cloud things happen that really don't make sense and the ending you see coming a mile away. The main girl is a raging cword to her pointless boyfriend apparently this is a important plot point?. These kids sans the boyfriend remind you of the popular kids you hated in high school. The positives reviews Have to be plants from the industry. Avoid this film the premise is awful and you end up wanting whatever it is in the cloud to eat them faster.

A dash of Outer limits maybe. . .THEN I actually WATCHED the movie.What ruined it principally was the casting No I don't blame the Actors themselves but the CharacterPlot premise that presupposes that any story stocked with goodlooking young adults posing as Teenagers acting out the normal angst trivia and emotional immaturity of Teenagers is somehow MustWatch MovieMaking.

Like how a young pilot like that doesn't just rent a 6seat twin engine plane like it's a Hyundai Sonata while she doesn't even have her Instrument Rating typically a must for planes of that size. Then there are stupid script misses like the fact that our Pilot Heroine blames the plane's malfunctioning altimeter on magnetic disturbances. Altimeters are affected by air pressure. Not magnetism. Script bloopers like that abound in this one.Come on writers. It was like shooting a story set in New York City then showing the characters walk up to a hot dog stand...and order sushi. Bad research.Technicalities aside prepare for a lame flick that basically consists only of a bunch of teens yelling at each other that they're going to die. For an hour.Some here say the film had an awesome Twilight Zone ending. Really? Where was it? There was an attempt at a twist but when the credits rolled I still didn't even know what that supposed twist was supposed to be. WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILER! Was there time travel involved? Ghosts?

My hitrate for finding good movies this way is about 5050. But I sometimes get as much pleasure from watching a bad movie as a good one. And so to Altitude which lands firmly in this former category. But pleasure was something sadly lacking in taking this flight.The description on the back of the DVD case hinted at a malevolent force picking off teens as teens usually are in these films but in the unique setting of a light plane a nice twist on the usual claustrophobic settings. A supernatural killer on the loose at 10000 feet... cool I thought. But from this intriguing takeoff position the film crashes and burns in its most important areas a coherent plot and interesting characters. Five friends fly a twinprop to a concert 'because the drive is bad' or some other rubbish reason  so we have our setup. The five tick all the clich boxes for the teen victim demographic the jock the nerd the sensitive artist the prom queen and the bookworm. And despite these stereotypes bucking the usual trends slightly the arrogant jock turns out to be a coward and a drunk the artist brave and resourceful the characters are so weakly sketched out that we do not care for anyone as things start to go wrong even our spunky heroine pilot Sara who has achieved somewhere in the region of 100 hours worth of flying time whilst keeping this a secret from her dad and also learnt to fly because her mum was killed in an air crash. As you do.So after establishing such hateful and idiotic people are our main protagonists it's left to the plot get us off the ground. Initially it's a bit like Twilight Zone The Movie where a nervous John Lithgow sees an evil imp trashing the wing of his passenger jet but can get noone to believe him. But a closer look at that 1983 movie reveals an even more blatant lift. The Joe Dantedirected third segment where an evil child who can create his own reality around him trapping his family in a murderous world where he has to be kept happy and entertained for fear of violent and bloody retribution. So no external entity of malevolence just an insecure manchild with a violent id Forbidden Planet? subconsciously brought to the fore by the heroine's plan to leave to go to university and his repressed anger at the death of his parents yes in the same air crash that killed Sara's mother. Throw in a prescient comic book Heroes anyone a giant flying squid and a climactic face off between good and 'evil' is he? I still don't know who we were supposed to be rooting for that is resolved by the biggest clich of them all and all that backsleeve potential finally runs out of fuel. It's such a shame because I thought the direction from Kaare Andrews was solid and some clever scenes with the lightning flashes making the screaming faces look like skulls even had me considering the possibility everyone was already dead.

I remembered it as being 'memorable' without really remembering too much about the characters or the plot.Watching it again now I have to say I really enjoyed it.OK you have to suspend some disbelief on the planeflying front  there have obviously been quite a few reviews by critics with pilot's licenses no doubt attracted by the title and certainly there are a lot of highly unlikely flying technicalities to be overlooked. However  this film is really a sort of Lovecraftian scifi chiller and let's face it  how many such films would work if they had to be technically accurate? In reality in this case the girl would never even have got to hire the plane let alone get into trouble in it.The cast are a uniformly pretty unpleasant and dim bunch and it's nice to see them getting knocked off one by one but I wouldn't say they were bad actors. I could well imagine that if you took a group of college kids and put them in a 'stress' situation like this for real you would see exactly the sort of mental and social breakdown portrayed here. For the most part the script actually treads a wellchosen line between teenage banality and the needs of the plot.There are a few corny bits in the dialogue between the 'teenagers' and there is a strong temptation to keep saying to the screen 'so maybe you should fly the plane now?' but this is really the practical result of filming a minimal number of actors in the confines of a 6seater cabin  if the pilot had to sit in front of the controls facing forward the whole time she would only have a bit part in the movie! The plot has enough twists and turns to keep you guessing and the sky monster is neatly explained. I cannot imagine why some reviewers have slated its 'realism' when as explained by the plot it isn't quite 'real' anyway and so doesn't have to conform to a scientificallyviable form. OK the CGI isn't brilliant but at DVD quality you can't see too much detail and it's really all about the 'lost in the dark' atmosphere rather than the monster effects.The filming is  within the limits of the budget and the CGI  good and imaginative. No it isn't Avatar but the director does a good job with what he's got. I don't understand reviewers who continually criticise the filming standards of lowbudget monster movies. You have to show the monster eventually and no money  rubber monster. If they can't understand that they shouldn't bother watching and reviewing such films.The ending has a nice twist which neatly ties everything together but I think the immensity of the concept behind the ending  and the great suspension of incredulity necessary to appreciate it  left a lot of reviewers with a bad taste in their mouths. I think most reviewers just wanted the entire cast to die horribly and gave the movie a low score when it finally appeared they might not have....If you enjoy Lovecraftian films and can suspend some disbelief for 90 minutes 'Altutude' is an enjoyable Friday night's viewing.".

	schema:reviewBody "Altitude is a ThrillerHorror movie that never really lives up to anything. Even if you cling to a hope that something large or satisfying will happen you will be disappointed. This is only made worse by the fact that the acting dialogue and plot developments do little more than to waste away an hour of the movie before the real events unfold. There is no one major flaw in this movie however no tweaking would have made this viewable. This movie is fundamentally built around a thin plot which leads to a 20 minute series of events and it makes the whole movie seem disjointed.The plot of the movie is that a group of friends are flying to a concert and the main character in the group of 5 Lowndes is the amateur pilot. She offers the best moments in the movie but even those are scarce. Errors during flight causes the plane to climb higher than intended without the ability to descend. The main cling of fear appeared to be fear of flying and the claustrophobia associated with the small cabin and uncontrollable circumstances surrounding them. However as evidenced by the movie case this is a monster movie though you could barely tell because it has so little face time.I am notorious for being able to sit through garbage horror movies just to see the twist or developments at the end. That being said I waited patiently through the poor dialogue and acting. At first it seems that everything could happen to you and there is no need to suspend your disbelief as with many supernatural horrors. However the ending and subsequently revealed underlying plot of the movie are very supernatural and unfortunately are flat and unbelievable. It really made me regret sitting through the early goings to get a stupid ending.I would not recommend this movie to anyone as it really has no redeeming qualities. The only people who might find it interesting are pilots but for every plane focused moment there are 3 where the physics and mechanics are awful.".

This is only made worse by the fact that the acting dialogue and plot developments do little more than to waste away an hour of the movie before the real events unfold. There is no one major flaw in this movie however no tweaking would have made this viewable.

If you like Twilight Zone or if you like watching scary movies best if you don't like flying then this movie is for you.Acting was and the special effects were OK.

Though its not because its fantastic it was because it was good.What you have here is a minimalist film that doesn't really play off as a big budget film but does very well with what it has.First off the issues you'll notice are theseThe acting is a little off and on what you get is decent actors that work really well with one emotion but fall flat with something like crying especially the lead female. The biggest example of this is the character that at first plays off as a frat boy when he's in this mode he is just plain terrible. When he starts cracking a little throughout the movie from all the events that are occurring he switches to a decent level of acting that really isn't that bad.Onto our next issue The CGI though by no means terrible is a bit middle ground. You see a plane most of the time in CGI and while it does look bad it doesn't move nor seem to function fluently. Most of the time they show it to see how out of control the situation is and it mostly doesn't invoke any feeling of impending doom but more like they are just sort of floating.The last issue is the story its not bad but its not great. It plays off more as something you'd see in a Outer Limits or Twilight Zone episode. So don't go in expecting the best of the best.Okay and as for the good? Well all I can say is that this movie is watchable and entertaining to enough of a level that I'd recommend it for maybe a afternoon watch on a Sunday afternoon. It doesn't have the gore you'd expect either it actually focus's on the characters and actually trying to make them more fleshed out and their actions make sense.So all in all I'd suggest it for a watch. Its mild entertaining and not at all terrible.".

	schema:reviewBody "Franz Wenzler's Hans Westmar 1933 is based on the activities and death of Horst Wessel leader of Berlin's S.A. Sturm 5. In actual fact the film was originally intended to be Wessel's actual political life story but Goebbels intervened and the main character had a slight name change hence we have Westmar instead of Wessel.Emil Lohkamp plays the title character with freneticism probably an accurate portrayal as Wessel virtually wore himself out leading his Sturm. Wessel's story is sanitised here the rumours of Wessel living off immoral earnings are unfounded propaganda formulated by the far left to discredit him but he was certainly a violent young man. In Hans Westmar he's depicted as saintly virtuous and almost virginal illustrated by his reluctance to become fully emotionally involved with his platonic girlfriend Maude at the expense of his activism.The legendary Paul Wegner former silent screen actor plays a Lenin look alike Communist which is probably truer to type than we would like to think because Wegner had leftist leanings. The street scenes of riot and disorder are excellently filmed and are so convincing that they've often been mistaken for actual footage of Weimar era political violence.The print that's currently available on DVD is a censored version of the original film the deleted scenes having been removed by a Nazi censor not a post war Allied one in any case the film was banned by the Allied Control Council in 1945. Interestingly the Italian dubbed version of this film has some of the original censored scenes intact including the scene where Westmar is lying on the floor in his own blood after being shot. Ironically the Nazi censors must have considered this scene too graphic for German audiences!".

	schema:reviewBody "Warning this film is Nazi propaganda. 'Hans Westmar' is a near contemporary account of the street battles Strassenkmpfe between Nazi and Communist militias in Berlin in the late 1920s. As history told by the victors it recounts mostly real events altered to fit the 'official truth'. As a result you need some backstory to understand the film.In the mid 1920s Berlin was the epicenter of Communism in Germany and the Nazi presence in the city was negligible. Then Josef Goebbels heretofore editor of a regional party newspaper accepted the position of party leader in Berlin. He organized Brownshirt units die Sturmabteilung or SA instigated Strassenkmpfe and struggled to take over the city.'History is made in the streets' the clubfooted dwarf ranted to his followers. In this case he was right. The Nazis came to control Berlin's streets if not its ballot boxes a success critical to the victory in the national elections of 1933.'Hans Westmar' began as a biopic of Horst Wessel. At age 21 Wessel led the SA unit in Friedrichshain Berlin's toughest slum and the reddest district in the 'Red City'. He recruited from the Communists with considerable success. The real Wessel was like Sid Vicious both were musicians of sorts. Both shacked up with exprostitutes. Both were charismatic reckless obnoxious and both became unwitting martyrs Wessel was assassinated by communists in January 1930.This film was made a few months after the takeover when the victorious SA had served its purpose. Its hard drinking hard partying henchmen were unruly undisciplined and uncontrollable.At the same time the recently elected Nazis wanted to appear 'responsible'. The cinematic result is an uncomfortable compromise Horst Wessel didn't lend himself to a makeover. 'Hans Westmar' recasts Wessel as a model of virtue but the 1920s the Nazi appeal lay in its ruthlessness not its virtue. Imagine the punk rockers of the 1970s but organized and with a political agenda.At the same time the film shows Brownshirts picking fights which didn't fit the image the party wanted to project once in power. Retitled 'Hans Westmar one of many a German destiny from the year 1929' the film saw limited release. Any interest lies in how the Nazis recast history and in a few unique scenes.'Hans Westmar' takes pains to show that the SA cooperated with police and did not use weapons. Training included 'sport exercises' not martial arts. The SA men in the audience must have been laughing up their sleeves.Theater audiences thought the funeral scene was newsreel footage. Police limited the funeral train to a few horse drawn wagons and the swastika was forbidden. Communists attacked stealing the wreaths from the coffin. Additionally scenes of SA rallies and Strassenkmpfe give a chilling sense of the Zeitgeist.The nightclub scene gives you some idea of what a 20s Berlin nightclub might have been like. In the nightclubs ladies appeared naked on stage you could get any kind of sex for money and cocaine was the drug of choice. But the film condemns the nightclubs only for ethnic mixing. Given the openly homosexual SA leadership and the party's amoral tactics audiences would have seen through any moral condemnation.A more accurate film might depict civilians caught between two evil movements. Only atrocity would be the victor.'Hans Westmar' would not have been shown at all after June 1934 when the SA leaders were eliminated and the SA was disbanded. What happened to the stormtroopers? Because of their street fighting experience many wound up in the battle of Stalingrad. They died miserably.".

	schema:reviewBody "This is an early Nazi propaganda film and quite a heavy one. It is set in 1932 mostly in Berlin where communists social democrats SPD and Nazis were battling in the streets. The hero Hans Westmar original working title was Horst Wessel the infamous SA martyr but the title had to be changed is a student who later gives up his study to work as a taxi driver to be nearer to the working class people though I suppose they wouldn't ride in a taxi too often.The bad guys are the communists depicted gleefully as ugly speaking with bad accent and having a feminist woman in their round. They try to organize the workers into resistance against the Nazis with their apartment buildings decorated with red flags and banners.In what is supposedly an election campaign the Nazi SA dares to march through the workers' quarters. Brutal streetfighting ensues and in the end Hans Westmar is dead and ceremonially buried.That's basically all there is to the story with a lot of more details of course showing foreign influences in Berlin's night club scene for instance.But more interesting is the reception history I think Goebbels himself banned the film some years later as it was just too bad unconvincing propaganda. In 1945 the film was banned again by the victorious allies  and to this day 65 years later in Germany it is still blacklisted by the Murnau Foundation as Vorbehaltsfilm only allowed public showing in controlled environment with a speaker to explain it all.Then again there's the internet archive.org in particular which offers this film for free download. Low resolution image bad and spotty sound  but still one can watch it unsupervised by Murnau and form one's own opinion. It sure is a bad movie but still interesting to get a better understanding of the Nazi times.".
